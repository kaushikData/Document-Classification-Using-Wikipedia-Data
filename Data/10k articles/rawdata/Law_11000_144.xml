The New Zealand '''[[constitutional crisis]] of 1984''' was an important constitutional and political event in the [[history of New Zealand]]. The crisis arose following the [[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 general election]], and was caused by a major [[currency crisis]]. The crisis led the incoming government to review New Zealand's constitutional structures, which resulted in the [[Constitution Act 1986]].&lt;ref name="mclay"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10830093|title=McLay: My plan to replace Muldoon|author=Audrey Young|date=28 August 2012|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prior to 1985 the [[New Zealand dollar]] was controlled centrally by the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]] at an [[exchange rate]] fixed to the [[United States dollar]]. In early 1984 the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, [[Roderick Deane]], became concerned that the New Zealand dollar had become significantly overvalued and was vulnerable to currency speculation on the financial markets in the event of a "significant political event".{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=63}}

==Currency crisis==
Media speculation followed a leak that an incoming Labour government would be likely to significantly devalue the dollar upon election. The Reserve Bank advised the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], Sir [[Robert Muldoon]], that the dollar should be devalued. Muldoon ignored the advice, owing to his belief that it would hurt poorer New Zealanders in the medium term. In June 1984 Muldoon announced a [[snap election]] to be held in July. This caused an immediate run on the dollar, as currency speculators believed a Labour win would mean devaluation. Despite a deepening foreign exchange crisis, Muldoon continued to refuse to devalue, forcing the Reserve Bank to take some extraordinary steps, such as closing the [[Foreign exchange market|Forex]] markets for a short period of time to slow down devaluation.

On 14 July, Muldoon and National lost the general election, and the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour government]] led by [[David Lange]] was sworn in on 26 July.

== Constitutional crisis develops ==
By constitutional convention, between election day and the return of the writs for the election, an outgoing [[caretaker government]] implements the directions of an incoming government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bJEjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kqUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=807,2787893&amp;hl=en|publisher=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|date=18 July 1984|page=A-13|accessdate=26 February 2015|title=Muldoon backs down, won't block Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/node/32#6.11|title=Cabinet Manual 2008|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of Sunday 15 July, Reserve Bank officials (Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell, deputy [[Roderick Deane]], and Treasury Secretary [[Bernie Galvin]]) met with the head of the Prime Minister's Department [[Gerald Hensley]], and agreed that the currency market could not open on Monday unless there was a devaluation. Contacted by Hensley, Muldoon refused to meet that afternoon but told him that they could close the market on Monday if they liked, and agreed to meet them at 8:30 am on Monday 16 July. Russell closed the market on Sunday evening. The Reserve Bank officials also wrote a letter to Lange, and a senior Treasury officer unofficially briefed the incoming Finance Minister [[Roger Douglas]] on the situation.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=388–389}}

After their meeting on Monday morning, Russell and Galvin flew to Auckland to advise Lange, and Deane reluctantly briefed Labour's Deputy Leader [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]], before escaping from waiting journalists out a back door. Muldoon called Lange at 10:30 am and suggested they make a joint statement that the currency would not be devalued. Lange said he would give Muldoon an answer after meeting with Russell and Galvin. The meeting, which also included Douglas and his incoming associate finance minister [[David Caygill]], took place at [[Auckland International Airport]]. On being advised that a joint statement would not solve the currency problem, Lange told Russell and Galvin to inform Muldoon there would be no joint statement. Lange then travelled to unrelated meetings with the U.S. Secretary of State in Ohakea and the Australian Foreign Minister in Wellington, before returning to Auckland. Meanwhile, Russell and Galvin decided while travelling back to Wellington that they should not tell Muldoon, but that Lange should do so himself. Muldoon was left waiting for a response and despite Hensley's appeals to Galvin, received none before going home around 5 pm. His wife told him to have a rest and took the phone off the hook without telling him. By now, Deane had decided Muldoon had to be told what had happened, but could not reach Muldoon by phone.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=390–392}}

Lange had meanwhile imposed a 24-hour news blackout on the currency problem, and was reported in the 6:30 pm television news as saying that Muldoon was "refusing his advice on the matter". Muldoon had his press secretary issue a statement that this was untrue, and agreed to a television interview with [[Richard Harman (journalist)|Richard Harman]] that evening. Shortly afterward he received a handwritten note from Deane explaining the situation, followed by a letter from Lange. In the interview, Muldoon went over the events of the day from his perspective. He said Lange had not yet responded to him, that "I am not going to devalue, as long as I am Minister of Finance", and that he hoped Lange would agree tomorrow not to devalue.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=392}} Prime Minister elect David Lange responded with an interview of his own. He stated: "This nation is at risk. That is how basic it is. This Prime Minister outgoing, beaten, has, in the course of one television interview tried to do more damage to the New Zealand economy than any statement ever made. He has actually alerted the world to a crisis. And like [[King Canute]] he stands there and says everyone is wrong but me".{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=67}}

This provoked a further crisis in the foreign exchange markets - when the exchange opened on 17 July, millions of foreign exchange dollars left the country as currency speculators expected a devaluation of the New Zealand dollar. Lange later remarked "We actually were reduced to asking our diplomatic posts abroad how much money they could draw down on their credit cards! That is the extent of the calamity that had been ground into us by the briefings that we'd got".{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=64}}

===Resolution===
Roderick Deane and Spencer Russell then spoke to several senior ministers within the National Party caucus.{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=65}} On the morning on Wednesday 18 July,&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Dollar devaluation is announced|publisher=The Daily Reporter|date=18 July 1984|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r18rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9dgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5909,1337552&amp;dq=zealand+dollar+devalued+20&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; after an emergency caucus meeting, Muldoon relented and agreed to devalue the currency upon Lange's wishes. Muldoon's most senior Cabinet members, led by the soon to be Leader [[Jim McLay]], had threatened to remove Muldoon from his leadership of the National Party and therefore strip him of his post as Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.&lt;ref name="mclay" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mclay2"&gt;Interview with Jim McLay from a [[TVNZ]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] on David Lange - ''Reluctant Revolutionary'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Cabinet members [[Jim McLay]] and [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]] had key roles in persuading Muldoon to step down. They advocated a ‘caretaker convention’ despite it not existing formally. Jim McLay drafted the convention and presented it in a press statement on June 17, where it became recognised as the '[https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/our-business-units/cabinet-office/supporting-work-cabinet/cabinet-manual/6-elections-transitions-3 caretaker convention]'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLay|first=Jim|date=2012|title=1984 and all that|url=https://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/centres/nzcpl/publications/nz-journal-of-public-and-international-law/pdfs/volume-10,-issue-2/McLay.pdf|journal=New Zealand Journal Of Public And International Law|volume=10|pages=267-287|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The New Zealand dollar was devalued by 20%.&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt; In a 1994 documentary on the crisis, former [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet minister]] [[Hugh Templeton]] confirmed that McLay, working with [[Bill Birch]] and [[Jim Bolger]], was ready to approach the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], [[David Beattie|Sir David Beattie]] to have Muldoon removed as Prime Minister (Beattie had suggested he could remove Muldoon prior to the Cabinet meeting on 19 July).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Days in July|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/frontline-five-days-in-july|series=Frontline|serieslink =|date =10 July 1994|season =[[NZ on Screen]]| number = |accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Result==
As a result of the constitutional crisis, the incoming Labour Government convened the Officials Committee on Constitutional Reform to review New Zealand's constitutional law, and the [[Constitution Act 1986]] resulted from the two reports by this Committee. The issue of the transfer of power from incumbent to elect governments (and hence Prime Ministers) was not resolved by this Act however, and the transfer of executive powers remains an unwritten constitutional convention, known as the 'caretaker convention' which was developed by [[Jim McLay]].&lt;ref name="mclay" /&gt;

==Dramatisation==
A television mini-series, ''[[Fallout (New Zealand drama)|Fallout]]'', dramatising both the events surrounding the crisis and the initiation of [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|New Zealand's nuclear-free policy]] (a major plank of Labour's 1984 election campaign) was produced in New Zealand in 1995. This mini-series, written by [[Greg McGee]] and [[Tom Scott (cartoonist)|Tom Scott]], starred [[Mark Mitchell (actor)|Mark Mitchell]] as Lange and [[Ian Mune]] as Muldoon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390703/ IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Family Association v. City and County of San Francisco''''' is a case in which the [[American Family Association]] (AFA) challenged the [[San Francisco, California|City and County of San Francisco]]'s actions opposing an AFA sponsored advertisement campaign as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

In 1998, a full-page advertisement regarding homosexuality and Christianity was placed in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' as part of the nationwide "Truth in Love" campaign by several [[Christian right]] organizations. The advertisement stated, "God abhors any form of sexual sin," including homosexuality, and further stated that many people have walked out of homosexuality into [[Sexual abstinence|sexual celibacy]] and marriage through the help of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. The advertisement was labeled by the  City and County of San Francisco as "hateful rhetoric," which incites [[hate crime]]s. San Francisco officials discouraged local TV and radio stations from running Truth in Love advertisements.

In October 1999, the AFA filed the suit against the City and County of San Francisco with support from [[Family Research Council]] and [[Virginia]] based Kerusso Ministries. The suit claims the City and County of San Francisco violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] by expressing hostility towards a religion and violated the First Amendment's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Freedom of speech|Free Speech]] and [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise]] clauses by the City's attempt to prevent "Truth in Love" advertisements.

In June 2000, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] District court ruled the Defendant's actions did not violate the First Amendment and stated the City and County of San Francisco was only doing its duty to address public safety by encouraging local media not to run the advertisements. The AFA appealed the decision and the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] affirmed the District court ruling.

The majority opinion was written by [[Michael Daly Hawkins]] and the dissenting/concurring opinion was written by [[John T. Noonan, Jr.]]

== Background ==

On October 19, 1998, the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] Board of Supervisors, led by Leslie Katz, wrote a letter to the AFA in response to an ad placed in the newspaper. The letter stated:

{{quote|Supervisor Leslie Katz denounces your rhetoric against [[gay]]s, [[lesbian]]s and [[transgender]]ed people. What happened to [[Matthew Shepard]] is in part due to the message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy of the most basic equal rights and treatment. It is not an exaggeration to say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination, such as when [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s are called [[sin]]ful and when major religious organizations say they can change if they tried, and the horrible crimes committed against gays and lesbians.}}

During the same time, the [[San Francisco, California|City]] and [[San Francisco County, California|County of San Francisco]] passed two resolutions. The first resolution was summarized by [[Michael Daly Hawkins|Judge Hawkins]] as:

{{quote|The first, Resolution No. 234-99, condemned the murder of Billy Jack Gaither&lt;ref&gt;On February 19, 1999, in [[Coosa County, Alabama]], Billy Jack Gaither was beaten to death with an axe handle and his body was burned because he was homosexual.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Alabama]] following a reported unwanted gay sexual advance, and urged Alabama lawmakers to extend their [[hate crime]]s legislation to include offenses related to [[sexual orientation]]. The final paragraph of the Resolution "calls for the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] to take accountability for the impact of their long-standing rhetoric denouncing gays and lesbians, which leads to a climate of mistrust and discrimination that can open the door to horrible crimes such as those committed against Mr. Gaither."}}

The second resolution was summarized by Judge Hawkins as:

{{quote|The second resolution, No. 873-98, was specifically directed at "anti-gay" television advertisements. It recited that a coalition had introduced a nationwide television advertisement campaign to encourage gays and lesbians to change their sexual orientation, and listed one of the Plaintiffs by name. The resolution asserted that the organizations "promote an agenda which denies basic equal rights for gays and lesbians and routinely state their opposition to toleration of gay and lesbian citizens" and stated that a "prominent San Francisco newspaper" chose to accept and publish a printed advertisement campaign. The resolution contended that "the vast majority of medical, psychological and sociological evidence supports the conclusion that sexual orientation can not be changed" and that ads insinuating as much are "erroneous and full of lies." The resolution also stated that ads suggesting gays or lesbians are "immoral and undesirable create an atmosphere which validates oppression of gays and lesbians" and encourages maltreatment of them. The Resolution claimed a "marked increase in anti-gay violence" that coincided with "defamatory and erroneous campaigns" against gays and lesbians. It then urged "local television stations not to broadcast advertising campaigns aimed at `converting' homosexuals."}}

The '''Armistice of Saint Jean d'Acre''' (also known as the '''Convention of Acre''') concluded the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. The [[Armistice]], signed on 14 July 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Windrow|1999|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was between [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces in the [[Middle East]] under the command of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[General]] [[Henry Maitland Wilson]], and [[Vichy France]] forces in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], under the command of General [[Henri Dentz]], [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Army of the Levant]] (''Armée du Levant'') and as [[High Commissioners of French-mandated Syria and Lebanon|High Commissioner of the Levant]].

==Description==
Having lost control of the Northern Desert and the Euphrates Province and being threatened with the imminent loss of [[Beirut]], General Dentz decided to ask for an armistice.  On the evening of  11 July, British [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]], [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Middle East Command]], received a wireless message from Dentz proposing the suspension of hostilities six hours later, at midnight.  General Dentz declared himself ready to engage in talks on the basis of a memorandum presented to him that morning by the United States Consul at Beirut on behalf of the British Government.  But Dentz made the reservation that he was empowered by the French Government to treat only with the British representatives to the exclusion of those of the [[Free French Forces|Free French]].&lt;ref name="Auchinleck1946"&gt;{{harvnb|Auchinleck|1946|p=4216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposals presented by General Dentz were considered at once by the Middle East War Council.  The council took into account the opinion of the American Consul at Beirut that Dentz was entirely insincere and might be playing for time in the hope of a last minute rescue by the Germans. Accordingly, his conditions were rejected by the British and he was called on to send his [[plenipotentiaries]] to the British outpost on the Beirut—[[Haifa]] Road at or before 0900 hours on 12 July.  Failure to do this would lead to the resumption of hostilities at that hour.&lt;ref name="Auchinleck1946" /&gt;

On 12 July, the Vichy second in command, [[Lieutenant-General]] Joseph-Antoine-Sylvain-Raoul de Verdillac attended the talks.  He went all the way from Syria to [[Akko|Acre]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and was escorted by a convoy of Australian high commanding officers.  General de Verdillac represented the [[Army of the Levant]] for the Armistice talks instead of his superior commander, General Dentz. The 21 July 1941 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine indicates that Dentz sent de Verdillac to the talks because de Verdillac was more pro-British and less anti-[[Charles De Gaulle|De Gaulle]] than Dentz.

At 2200 hours on 12 July, the Armistice of Saint Jean d'Acre was initialled.  The Allied forces were represented by General Wilson, by Air Commodore [[Leslie Brown (RAF officer)|L. O. Brown]], [[Royal Air Force]], by Captain J. A. V. Morse, [[Royal Navy]], and by Free French General [[Georges Catroux]].  The Vichy French were represented by de Verdillac.&lt;ref name="Auchinleck1946" /&gt;

The Armistice talks, the first between Great Britain and France since [[Napoleon]]'s time, were held in the officers mess of "[[William Sidney Smith|Sidney Smith]] Barracks", on the outskirts of the city of Acre. On this site was later founded [[Bustan HaGalil]], an Israeli agricultural settlement.  Despite the generosity of the British terms, representatives of Vichy made a brief show of refusing them, then dumped the whole mess into General Dentz's lap. On [[Bastille Day]] 14 July General Dentz, Vichy's High Commissioner to the Levant States, signed [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] away to the conquering British and to the Free French Forces.  When General De Verdillac uncapped his pen to add his signature, all the lights in the room fused out, and so a dispatch rider's motorcycle was brought into the room to light the place with its [[head lamp]].

'''Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec''' ('''BAnQ''', unofficially translated as National Library and Archives of Quebec) is a [[Quebec]] governmental organization who manages the [[legal deposit]] and [[national archives]] systems of the province as well as its [[national library]], which is located in the [[Grande Bibliothèque]] in Montreal. It is born out of a merger between the ''Bibliothèque nationale du Québec'' (BNQ) and the ''Archives nationales du Québec'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=//B_1_2/B1_2_A.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006. The ''Bibliothèque nationale du Québec'' had previously merged with the [[Grande bibliothèque du Québec]] in 2002. 

BAnQ's mandate is to offer democratic access to culture and knowledge. To this end, it brings together, preserves and promotes Quebec's and Quebec-related heritage materials, and also provides the services of a major public library. BAnQ carries out its mandate in 12 facilities which are open to the public: the [[Grande Bibliothèque]], BAnQ Vieux-Montréal and BAnQ Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie in Montreal; BAnQ Gaspé, BAnQ Gatineau, BAnQ Québec, BAnQ Rimouski, BAnQ Rouyn-Noranda, BAnQ Saguenay, BAnQ Sept-Îles, BAnQ Sherbrooke and BAnQ Trois-Rivières.

== Collection ==
The library's collection includes [[National library#Legal deposit and copyright|legal deposit]] copies of all works printed in Quebec, concerning Quebec, or written or contributed to by an author from Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.banq.qc.ca/portal/dt/collections/dons_acquisitions/dons_acquisitions.jsp?bnq_langue=en Donating and Acquisition]", BAnQ Web site, retrieved December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''Archives nationales du Québec'' (ANQ), or National Archives of Quebec, were founded September 2, 1920, and [[Pierre-Georges Roy]] became Quebec's first Head Archivist in the process.

The purpose of the institution was to process historical materials, more specifically public archives and the Quebec government's archives, and to collect documents pertaining to the [[history of Quebec]].

The ''Archives nationales du Québec'' (as they were called in 1970) were brought under the jurisdiction of the Department of Cultural Affairs in 1961. Until 1963, the institution was called ''Archives de la province de Québec''.

On August 12, 1967, the Quebec National Assembly legislated to establish the ''Bibliothèque nationale du Québec'' (BNQ), an institution that would also come under the Department of Cultural Affairs. Originally, the BNQ held the collections and furniture of the [[Bibliothèque Saint-Sulpice]], located in [[Montreal]]. Its creation by the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|Sulpician Order]] dated back to 1915. The library belonged to the [[Government of Quebec]] since 1941.

In 1968, the provincial regulation on legal deposit came into effect requiring that Quebec publishers deposit with the BNQ two copies of their printed works, i.e. [[books]], [[brochures]], [[newspapers]], [[magazines]] and journals, artists' books and [[sheet music|musical scores]].

As of 1971, the Quebec government regionalized the ''Archives nationales du Québec'', opening archives centres in several regions.

In 1992, a regulation of the National Assembly expanded legal deposit to [[printmaking|original prints]], [[posters]], art work reproductions, [[postcards]], sound recordings ([[Gramophone record|microgroove vinyl records]], [[compact discs]], and more), [[software]], electronic documents ([[Internet]] files for instance) and [[desktop publishing]].

Iris, an online catalogue, was made available to the public in 1994. It provides free access to a description of every item held in the library.

In 1997, the idea of creating a [[Grande Bibliothèque]] was born out of the desire to provide widespread availability to the materials of the BNQ and of the [[Montreal Public Libraries Network]]. The institution founded to create a major public library, called ''Grande bibliothèque du Québec'' (GBQ), was merged with the BNQ in 2002: the new entity kept the name ''Bibliothèque nationale du Québec'' and pursued two separate mandates: the acquisition, preservation and promotion of the National collection, and the acquisition and promotion of the circulating collection for the general public.

The construction work of the [[Grande Bibliothèque]] took place from 2001 to 2004 in downtown Montreal.

In the fall 2004, the collections of the Montreal Library, the circulating collections of the BNQ and the new acquisitions were placed on the shelves of the Grande Bibliothèque.

On {{date|April 29, |2005}}, the [[Grande Bibliothèque]] was formally inaugurated. The next two days were dedicated to public tours. On Tuesday, {{date|May 3, |2005}}, it began its operations.

On {{date|January 31, |2006}}, the ''Bibliothèque nationale du Québec'' and the ''Archives nationales du Québec'' merged to become '''Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec''' (BAnQ).

==Mission==

The mission of ''Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec'' (BAnQ) is to gather, permanently preserve and promote Quebec's published heritage materials, any Quebec-related material of cultural interest, and any Quebec-related material published outside Quebec.

Another of BAnQ's mission is to provide democratic access to the heritage material constituted by its collections, to culture and universal knowledge, and to act, in this respect, as a catalyst for the library and information institutions of Quebec, thus contributing to the fulfillment of its citizens.

More specifically, BAnQ pursues the following objectives: attach great value to reading, research and the advancement of knowledge, promote Quebec publishing, foster continuing self-training, be instrumental in the integration of newcomers to Quebec, strengthen cooperation and exchanges between libraries and encourage Quebec's participation in the development of the virtual library.

BAnQ also aims to provide structure, support and advise public bodies regarding the management of their materials, ensure the preservation of public archives, make them more accessible and boost their visibility. The institution is also responsible for promoting the preservation and accessibility of private archives.

To this end, BAnQ carries out the responsibilities provided under the Archives Act. In the archival field, the institution can also provide research support services and contribute to the development and international outreach of Quebec heritage materials and expertise.

BAnQ serves as the official representative of the [[Agence francophone pour la numérotation internationale du livre]] ([[AFNIL]]) regarding the assignment of [[ISBN]] prefixes in Quebec and Canada.

==National Library==
BAnQ is responsible for acquiring, processing, preserving and highlighting the heritage collections. These collections bring together the entire production of printed materials in Quebec, mostly through [[legal deposit]], and of Quebec-related materials. The Preservation Branch (Direction générale de la conservation) which handles this aspect of the institution's mission, operates out of BAnQ Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie, in Montreal. Designed to ensure the long-term preservation of the materials stored there, the facility also houses BAnQ's head office. Patrons can access the heritage collections' materials in the reading room of the Collection nationale, located in the [[Grande Bibliothèque]]. The special collections, however, can be viewed on site at BAnQ Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie.

==National archives==
''Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec'' carries out its activities in the archival field through 10 regional facilities: BAnQ Vieux-Montréal, BAnQ Québec, BAnQ Gaspé, BAnQ Gatineau, BAnQ Rimouski, BAnQ Saguenay, BAnQ Sherbrooke, BAnQ Trois-Rivières, BAnQ Rouyn-Noranda and BAnQ Sept-Îles.

The Montreal facility is housed in the [[Gilles Hocquart Building]], formerly the [[HEC Montréal]] building, on Avenue Viger. The Quebec City facility is located in the Louis-Jacques-Casault pavilion on the [[Laval University|Université Laval]] campus.

==Grande Bibliothèque==
Located in the ''Quartier Latin'', in the heart of Montreal, the [[Grande Bibliothèque]] is the flagship library facility of the ''Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec''. This major public library was specifically designed to encourage the discovery and exploration of BAnQ's collections with free and open access. Materials from the universal collection are available for circulation while rarer documents such as most of the legal deposit collection can be consulted on site. The building, each of its six levels fostering a different atmosphere, opened to the public in 2005. Its patrons include scholars and the general public alike. It welcomes close to 50,000 visitors each week.

[[File:Bolek and Lolek monument 8.jpg|thumb|Bolek and Lolek monument in [[Bielsko-Biała]], where the show was produced]]
'''''Bolek and Lolek''''' are two [[Polish language|Polish]] cartoon characters from the children's TV animated comedy series by the same title (''Bolek i Lolek'' in Polish). They  were partially created by [[Alfred Ledwig]] before being developed by [[Władysław Nehrebecki]] and [[Leszek Lorek]]. The series is about two young brothers and their fun (and sometimes silly) adventures which often involve spending a lot of time outdoors.

==History and background==
The characters first appeared in an animated film in 1962. Their names are [[diminutive]]s of [[Boleslaw (given name)|Bolesław]] and [[Karol (disambiguation)|Karol]]. In English, the cartoon was distributed as '''Bennie &amp; Lennie''' and '''Jym and Jam'''.  Some episodes were seen as part of [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]''. In 1973 the creators of the film placed on the request from the female viewing audience a girl character by the name of Tola, a little girl who lives in the forest, and meets Bolek and Lolek there. The first time she appeared in occurred in the episode entitled "Tola". In total, Tola appeared in 30 episodes.

In a similar vein to [[Pink Panther cartoons|The Pink Panther]] theatrical cartoons, most episodes do not have dialogues. Exceptions are feature-length films and the series from the 1980s, where the main characters' voices were done by: Bolek – Ewa Złotowska, Ilona Kuśmierska; Lolek – Danuta Mancewicz, Danuta Przesmycka.

During the period of the [[Polish People's Republic]], Bolek and Lolek were reproduced in a large quantity of toys: action figures, movies, postcards, online arcades, puzzles, etc., which can be seen in the Museum of Dobranocki (bed-time stories) of the PRL. They are also currently made in computer programs, coloring books, general picture books and games.

Of all the Polish animated cartoons Bolek and Lolek ranks as the number one all-time favorite. The series was popular in many countries, and was one of the few animated films allowed to be broadcast by [[Iran]]ian television, along with other popular Polish animated cartoon [[Reksio]], just after the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979.

In 2011 a monument of Bolek and Lolek was erected in Bielsko-Biała.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zetnews.pl/Poland-in-English/News/Famous-cartoon-characters-commemorated-by-a-monument{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judicial proceedings against Siegessäule ==
The copyright holders of Polish cartoon Bolek and Lolek filed a lawsuit in 2006 to examine a case of the illegal use of the images of Bolek and Lolek by German [[homosexual]]s who wanted to encourage German homosexual minorities to participate in the [[Warsaw]] [[Pride Parade]].

The copyright holders, [[Alfred Ledwig]], [[Władysław Nehrebecki]], and [[Leszek Lorek]], felt indignant with what they alleged to be an illegal use of the images of Bolek and Lolek on the cover of German magazine ''[[Siegessäule (magazine)|Siegessäule]]'' without their permission. The characters had been changed, and Bolek was transformed into a woman. The owners took particular offense to the suggestion of Bolek and Lolek's apparent homosexuality in the image. During one of the interviews, Roman Nehrebecki commented, "The most important thing for me is that children were used for the purposes they should not be used for, for promoting ideas and organizations."{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The residents of [[Bielsko-Biała]], the city where Bolek and Lolek were created, also signed petitions against the improper use of the image of the characters.

The lawsuit lasted two years and took place in Berlin. The main line of defense of the magazine's owners was the fact that in 2005 the president of Warsaw, [[Lech Kaczyński]], forbade the organization the Pride Parade, manifesting inclination toward uneven treatment of minorities. However, this argument was deemed insignificant by the court, since the subject of the dispute was violation of copyright on the image of Bolek and Lolek and not on the alleged unfair treatment of homosexual minorities. Despite the fact that the lawsuit was prolonged due to the complex German judicial proceedings, it was closed with an agreement. German magazine ''Siegessäule'' was obliged to pay the copyright owners 4,000 [[euro]] in compensation, as well as to publish an official apology in their pages.

==Characters==
* '''Bolek''' (voiced by [[Ewa Złotowska]] and [[Ilona Kuśmierska]]) - Lolek's older brother.
* '''Lolek''' (voiced by [[Danuta Mancewicz]] and [[Danuta Przesmycka]]) - Bolek's younger brother.
* '''Tola''' - A cute and lovely little girl who lived deep in the forest. Tola is very girly when she looks like a magical fairytale princess, but she is really an ordinary tomboy, and she had her boyish looking rather than a magic princess. Tola has orange hair with pigtails. She wears a white shirt, a sleeveless blue dress, white socks and black shoes. In her first appearance in the episode "''Tola''", Tola is leaving the forest and moved to Bolek and Lolek's house and met them for the first time. According to the episode "''Zgubiony Ślad''", Tola lives in the wooden cottage in the forest. She is Bolek and Lolek's love interest and the supporting character in the series.

[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|The [[Union Flag]] is one of the most potent symbols of Britishness.{{sfn|Commission for Racial Equality|2005|p=21}}]]

'''Britishness''' is the state or quality of being British,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/orionbritainireland/british#obi00438b|publisher=credoreference.com|work=Brewer's Britain and Ireland|accessdate=11 April 2010|year=2005|title=British – Britishness}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; or of embodying British characteristics.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It comprises the claimed qualities that bind and distinguish the [[British people]] and form the basis of their unity and identity,{{sfn|Wright|Gamble|2009|p=32}} and the expressions of [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]]—such as habits, behaviours, or symbols—that have a common, familiar or iconic quality readily identifiable with the [[United Kingdom]]. Dialogue about the legitimacy and authenticity of Britishness is intrinsically tied with power relations and politics;{{sfn|Commission for Racial Equality|2005|pp=11–12}} in terms of [[nationhood]] and belonging, expressing or recognising one's Britishness provokes a range of responses and attitudes, such as advocacy, indifference, or rejection.{{sfn|Commission for Racial Equality|2005|pp=11–12}}

Although the term 'Britishness' "[sprang] into political and academic prominence" only in the late 20th century,{{sfn|Wright|Gamble|2009|p=149}} its origins lie with the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707. It was used with reference to Britons collectively as early as 1682,&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Britishness|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50027736?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Britishness&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2008|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the historian [[Linda Colley]] asserts that it was after the [[Acts of Union 1707]] that the ethnic groups of Great Britain began to assume a "layered" identity—to think of themselves as simultaneously British but also [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[English people|English]], and/or [[Welsh people|Welsh]].{{sfn|Colley|1992|pp=12–13}} In this formative period, Britishness was "closely bound up with [[Protestantism]]".{{sfn|Colley|1992|pp=8}} The ''Oxford English Dictionary Online'' dates the first known use of the term Britishness to refer to the state of being British to a June 1857 issue of ''[[Putnam's Monthly Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

Since the late 20th century, the exploration and proliferation of Britishness became directly associated with a desire to define, sustain or restore a homogeneous British identity or allegiance to Britain, prompting debate. For instance, the [[Life in the United Kingdom test]]—reported as a test of one's Britishness—has been described as controversial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1701843.stm What is Britishness anyway?] BBC News, 10 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UK Independence Party]] have asserted that Britishness is tied with inclusive [[civic nationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukip.org/media/pdf/Britishness.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414152704/http://www.ukip.org/media/pdf/Britishness.pdf |date=14 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] reported that Scots, Welsh, Irish and [[ethnic minorities]] may feel quite divorced from Britishness because of ethnic English dominance; [[Gwynfor Evans]], a [[Welsh nationalism|Welsh nationalist]] politician, said that "Britishness is a political synonym for Englishness which extends English culture over the Scots, Welsh, and the Irish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/halloffame/public_life/gwynfor_evans.shtml |title=South East Wales Public Life – Dr Gwynfor Evans |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians Graham Macphee and Prem Poddar state that Britishness and Englishness are invariably conflated as they are both tied to the identity of the [[British Empire]] and UK; slippage between the two words is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macphee &amp; Poddar|title=Empire and After: Englishness in Postcolonial Perspective|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York and Oxford|isbn= 978-1-84545-320-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StFvN6zt9icC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=empire+and+after&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=z_eZTam2JJXU4wb8jdTUAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With regards to a proposed oath of allegiance for school leavers, historian [[David Starkey]] argued that it is impossible to teach Britishness because "a British nation doesn't exist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7040137.stm Can pupils learn 'Britishness'?] BBC News, 12 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7287984.stm |title=Pupils 'to take allegiance oath' |publisher=BBC News |date=11 March 2008 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government perspective==
[[Gordon Brown]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], made a speech in 2006 to promote the idea of Britishness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4611682.stm Brown speech promotes Britishness] BBC News, 14 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's speech to the [[Fabian Society]]'s Britishness Conference proposed that '''British values''' demand a new constitutional settlement and symbols to represent a modern patriotism, including a new youth community service scheme and a '[[British Day]]' to celebrate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fabian-society.org.uk/press_office/display.asp?id=520&amp;type=news&amp;cat=43 The future of Britishness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806025348/http://www.fabian-society.org.uk/press_office/display.asp?id=520&amp;type=news&amp;cat=43 |date=6 August 2006 }} Fabian Society, 14 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the central issues identified at the Fabian Society conference was how the English identity fits within the framework of a devolved UK. Does England require a new constitutional settlement for instance?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fabian-society.org.uk/press_office/display.asp?id=525&amp;type=news&amp;cat=43 New Britishness must resolve the English question] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925211657/http://www.fabian-society.org.uk/press_office/display.asp?id=525&amp;type=news&amp;cat=43 |date=25 September 2006 }} Fabian Society, 14 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British government]] has sought to promote Britishness with the inaugural [[Armed Forces Day (United Kingdom)|Veterans' Day]] (now called [[Armed Forces Day (United Kingdom)|Armed Forces Day]]), first held on 27 June 2006. As well as celebrating the achievements of members of the armed forces, at the first event for the celebration Brown said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Scots and people from the rest of the UK share the purpose—that Britain has something to say to the rest of the world about the values of freedom, democracy, and the dignity of the people that you stand up for. So at a time when people can talk about football and devolution and money, it is important that we also remember the values that we share in common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Critics have argued that Brown's sudden interest in the subject had more to do with countering English opposition to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] Member of Parliament becoming Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate = 15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper's ''Comment Central'' asked readers to define Britishness in five little words. The winning suggestion was "No motto please, we're British".&lt;ref name="Hurst"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article2917745.ece|title=Maverick streak makes mockery of hunt for a British motto|last=Hurst|first=Greg|date=22 November 2007|work=The Times|accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A duty to promote [[democracy]] forms a key part of the "duty to actively promote fundamental British values in schools" in the United Kingdom in accordance with section 78 of the [[Education Act 2002]]. According to the [[Department for Education]]’s advice for maintained schools in 2014, “Schools should promote the fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs”.&lt;ref name="DfE2014" /&gt; The Government's [[CONTEST|''Prevent'' strategy]] of 2011 was cited as the source of this list of values, but that strategy also contained a slightly different list: “democracy, rule of law, equality of opportunity, freedom of speech and the rights of all men and 
women to live free from persecution of any kind.”&lt;ref&gt;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent-strategy-review.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 version of the [[CONTEST]] strategy codified the list as:
* the rule of law
* individual liberty
* democracy
* mutual respect, tolerance and understanding of different faiths and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counter-terrorism-strategy-contest-2018|title=Counter-terrorism strategy (CONTEST) 2018|website=GOV.UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same advice stated that UK schools must:
*encourage respect for democracy and support for participation in the democratic processes
*[ensure pupils acquire] an understanding of how citizens can influence decision-making through the democratic process
for example by
*[including] in suitable parts of the curriculum, as appropriate for the age of pupils, material on the strengths, advantages and disadvantages of democracy, and how democracy and the law works in Britain, in contrast to other forms of government in other countries;
*[ensuring] that all pupils within the school have a voice that is listened to, and demonstrate how democracy works by actively promoting democratic processes, such as a school council whose members are voted for by the pupils.&lt;ref name="DfE2014"&gt;Department for Education, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/380595/SMSC_Guidance_Maintained_Schools.pdf Promoting fundamental British values as part of SMSC in schools], November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnicity and social trends==
Not all people residing in England and the United Kingdom are [[white people|White]] due to immigration from other countries. According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] in England, around 85.4% of residents are White (British, Irish, other European), 7.8% Asian (mainly [[South Asia]]n), 3.5% Black, 2.3% are of [[Mixed-race]] heritage, 0.4% Arab, and 0.6% identified as Other ethnicity, with a significantly higher ethnic minority population in large cities such as [[London#Ethnic groups|London]].

A survey conducted in 2007 found that the majority of people in many non-white ethnic minority groups living in Great Britain described their national identity as British, English, Scottish or Welsh. This included almost nine in ten (87%) of people with [[British Mixed-Race|mixed heritage]], 85% of [[British African-Caribbean community|Black Caribbean people]], 80% of [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]]s and 78% of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]]s. Non-whites were more likely to describe themselves as British than whites. One-third of people from the [[White British]] group described themselves as British; the remaining two third of respondents identified themselves as [[English people|English]], Welsh, or Scottish ethnic groups. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/social-trends-rd/social-trends/social-trends-39/social-trends-full-report.pdf Office for National Statistics, ''Social Trends'' No.39, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted for the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] (CRE) in 2005 found that, in England, the majority of ethnic minority participants identified primarily as British, whereas ethnic English participants identified as English first and British second. In [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]], the majority of both white and ethnic minority participants identified as Welsh or Scottish first and British second, although they saw no incompatibility between the two identities.{{sfn|Commission for Racial Equality|2005|p=37}} Other research conducted for the CRE found that white participants felt that there was a threat to Britishness from large-scale immigration, the "unfair" claims that they perceived ethnic minorities made on the [[welfare state]], a rise in [[Value pluralism|moral pluralism]], and [[political correctness]]. Much of this frustration was found to be targeted at [[Muslims]] rather than minorities in general. Muslim participants in the study reported feeling victimised and stated that they felt that they were being asked to choose between Muslim and British identities, whereas they saw it possible to be both at the same time.{{sfn|Commission for Racial Equality|2005|p=4}}

There is evidence that [[Scottish people|people in Scotland]] are increasingly likely to describe themselves as Scottish, and less likely to say they are British. A 2006 study by social scientists at the Universities of Edinburgh, Dundee, St Andrews and Lancaster shows that more than eight out of ten people in Scotland saw themselves as Scottish. At the same time, there has been a long-term decline in Scots defining themselves as British, although more than half of the people in the survey saw themselves as British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/060602britishness.html|title=Study Shows Scottish sense of 'Britishness' in decline|publisher=University of Edinburgh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615063724/http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/060602britishness.html|date=2 June 2006|archivedate=15 June 2006|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institute-of-governance.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/47354/IoG_Briefing_03.pdf|title=Feeling Scottish: its personal and political significance|publisher=Institute of Governance, University of Edinburgh|first1=Ross|last1=Bond|first2=Michael|last2=Rosie|date=January 2006|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] in Scotland:&lt;ref name=nationalidentity&gt;{{cite web|title=Scotland's Census 2011 - Analysis: National Identity |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2014/03/7340/16|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*62% identified themselves as '''Scottish only'''
*18% identified themselves as '''Scottish and British'''
*8% identified themselves as '''British only'''

The [[Scottish National Party]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] and [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]], [[Kenny MacAskill]] gave the following submission to the [[UK Parliament]]'s Joint Committee on Human Rights in March 2008 discussing a British Bill of Rights:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is meant by Britishness? Is there a concept of Britishness? Yes, just as there is a concept of being Scandinavian. We eat fish and chips, we eat chicken masala, we watch EastEnders. Are [the SNP] British? No, we are not. We consider ourselves Scottish.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Human Rights, ''A Bill of Rights for the UK?'', Twenty – ninth Report of Session 2007–08, Ev. 61, Q290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Wales===
{{See also|Welsh national identity}}

Similar to Scotland, results from the Annual Population Survey (APS) conducted by the [[Office for National Statistics]], show that the majority of people residing in Wales describe themselves as [[Welsh people|Welsh]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Equality-and-Diversity/National-Identity/nationalidentity-by-year-identity|title=National identity by year and identity|publisher=Office for National Statistics|first1=|last1=|first2=|last2=|date=June 2017|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Respondents were asked whether they considered their national identity to be 'Welsh', or 'Non-Welsh' (defined as: 'English', 'Scottish', 'Irish', 'British' or 'Other').  In June 2017, 63.2% of respondents in Wales defined their national identity as 'Welsh'.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In a 1998 poll, 37% of [[Scottish National Party]] voters stated themselves to be "Scottish, not British", the rest demonstrating some form of British identity, with the most popular choice being "More Scottish than British" (41%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishaffairs.org/onlinepub/sa/mccrone_1997-98polls.html |title=Scottish Affairs, D.McCrone, Polls 1997–98 (online article) |publisher=Scottishaffairs.org |date= |accessdate=26 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221102601/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/onlinepub/sa/mccrone_1997-98polls.html |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion was again put forward in 2002, with similar figures cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishaffairs.org/onlinepub/sa/mccrone_paterson_sa40.html |title=Scottish Affairs, D.McCrone+L.Paterson, No.40, Summer 2002 (online article) |publisher=Scottishaffairs.org |date= |accessdate=26 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220002710/http://www.scottishaffairs.org/onlinepub/sa/mccrone_paterson_sa40.html |archivedate=20 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British Social Attitudes Survey of 2007 found that only 21% of Scots saw themselves as 'Equally Scottish and British', with less than half choosing British as a secondary identity.&lt;ref name="BSA2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natcen.ac.uk/natcen/pages/news_and_media_docs/BSA_24_report.pdf |title=Home |publisher=NatCen |date= |accessdate=13 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015728/http://www.natcen.ac.uk/natcen/pages/news_and_media_docs/BSA_24_report.pdf |archivedate=29 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that 73% of respondents saw themselves as 'only' or 'mainly' Scottish.&lt;ref name="BSA2007"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Chōsen-seki'''|朝鮮籍||"Korean domicile"}} is an alternative nationality assigned to ethnic [[Koreans in Japan]] who have neither Japanese nor [[South Korea]]n citizenship. This nationality is imputed to [[North Korea]]n residents in Japan, as the Japanese government does not recognize North Korea as a country.

This non-conventional category does not have effective representation in the government.

==Background==
Chōsen-seki is a convention made by the [[Japanese government]] to register Korean residents in Japan shortly after the [[Surrender of Japan]] as if they had been [[statelessness|stateless]]. The Korean people originally had Japanese citizenship during the Japanese [[Japanese Occupation of Korea|occupation]] of the [[Korean Peninsula]], but their Japanese citizenship was later revoked by Japanese government, after Japan surrendered and gave up sovereignty over Korea, first practically in 1947 under Edict of Foreigner Registration in 1947 ([[:ja:s:外國人登錄令|ja]]) of [[Allied Occupied Japan]], then finally and formally in 1952 in consequence of [[San Francisco Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Komai|first=Hiroshi|title=Migrant Workers In Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wDcsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-16206-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 Koreans were still technically of Japanese citizenship although, Edict of Foreigner Registration Article 11 told to consider them as foreigners. Hence the Koreans who then resided in Japan were registered as "of Chōsen" according to their geographical origin as substitution of nationality. Since 1950s, after the foundation of [[South Korea]] in 1948 and its diplomatic actions to the Allied and later Japan, those Koreans have been able to reprocess their foreinger registration in Japan as South Korean nationals willingly. On the other hand, Koreans either who have been affiliated to North Korea or who have not renewed their registration data, they have remained in Chōsen-seki, in Japan practically as stateless.

==Legal issues==
On September 30, 2010, the Seoul High Court declared that an ethnic Korean from Japan with Chōsen-seki status is not a South Korean citizen and can be refused an entrance visa to South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Tae-u (태우) | last = Kim (김) | script-title=ko:조선적 재일동포 여행증명서 발급거부는 정당 | date = 2010-09-30 | url = http://www.asiatoday.co.kr/news/view.asp?seq=401304 | work = Asia Today | accessdate = 2011-08-23 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Eun-gyo (은교) | last = Jang (장) | script-title=ko:‘조선 국적’ 재일동포 입국 막는 ‘꽉 막힌’ 나라 | date = 2010-09-30 | url = http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201009300016565&amp;code=940100 | work = Kyunghyang Sinmun | accessdate = 2011-08-23 | language = Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan delegates [[family law]] issues involving foreigners to the foreigners' home country. For example, [[Koreans in Japan|Zainichi]] registered as South Korean have their wills determined by South Korean law. Chōsen-seki holders are arbitrarily assigned the family law of North or South Korea depending on whether they used the word "Chōsen" or "Kankoku" in official registration documents, as well as other considerations. Recently it has become more common to refer to South Korean law because it is easier to use. When North Korean law is employed, the court is often forced to fall back on Japanese law due to [[renvoi]].

'''Cobblestone''' is a natural building material based on [[Cobble (geology)|cobble]]-sized stones, and is used for [[Road surface|pavement roads]], streets, and buildings.

In England, it was commonplace since ancient times for flat stones with a flat narrow edge to be set on edge to provide an even paved surface. This was known as a 'pitched' surface and was common all over Britain, as it did not require rounded pebbles. Pitched surfaces predate the use of regularly-sized granite setts by more than a thousand years. Such pitched paving is quite distinct from that formed from rounded stones, although both forms are commonly referred to as 'cobbled' surfaces. Most surviving genuinely old 'cobbled' areas are in reality pitched surfaces. A cobbled area is known as a "causey", "cassay" or "cassie" in [[Scots language|Scots]] (probably from ''causeway'').&lt;ref&gt;Scottish National Dictionary Association (1999) ''Concise Scots Dictionary ''. Edinburgh, Polygon. {{ISBN|1-902930-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sett (paving)|Setts]] are often idiomatically&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cobble?region=uk|work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|title=Cobble |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as "cobbles", although a sett is distinct from a cobblestone by being quarried or shaped to a regular form, whereas cobblestone is generally of a naturally occurring form.

==Use in roading==
Cobblestones are typically either set in sand or similar material, or are bound together with [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Paving with cobblestones allows a road to be heavily used all year long. It prevents the build-up of [[Rut (roads)|ruts]] often found in [[dirt road]]s. It has the additional advantage of not getting muddy in wet weather or dusty in dry weather. Shod horses are also able to get better traction on stone cobbles, pitches or setts than tarmac/asphalt. The fact that [[carriage]] [[wheel]]s, [[horse]] [[hooves]] and even modern automobiles make a lot of noise when rolling over cobblestone paving might be thought a disadvantage, but it has the advantage of warning pedestrians of their approach. In England, the custom was to strew the cobbles outside the house of a sick or dying person with straw to dampen the sound.

Cobblestones set in sand have the environmental advantage of being [[permeable paving]], and of moving rather than cracking with movements in the ground.

===Use today===
Cobblestones were largely replaced by quarried granite [[Sett (paving)|setts]] (also known as Belgian block&lt;ref name="belgianblock"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A27568|title=Were Pittsburgh's original finished roads and streets paved with cobblestone, Belgian block or some other type of brick?|last=Potter|first=Chris|date=14 October 2004|work=[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]|accessdate=23 September 2009|quote=In fact, Belgian block refers not to the type of stone but the way it is cut: in rectangles. People often refer to roads paved this way as "cobblestone streets," but that isn't strictly correct. Cobblestones are rounded, typically because they've been worn smooth by rivers. They might be hell to drive on, but they were cheap: you could just dredge them up from the river, the same way the Pirates put together the roster for their farm teams.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the nineteenth century. The word cobblestone is often wrongly used to describe such treatment. Setts were relatively even and roughly rectangular stones that were laid in regular patterns. They gave a smoother ride for carts than cobbles, although in heavily used sections, such as in yards and the like, the usual practice was to replace the setts by parallel granite slabs set apart by the standard axle length of the time.

Cobblestoned and "setted" streets gradually gave way to [[macadam]] roads, and later to [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]], and finally to [[asphalt concrete]] at the beginning of the 20th century. However, cobble&amp;shy;stones are often retained in historic areas, even for streets with modern vehicular traffic. Many older villages and cities in [[Europe]] are still paved with cobblestones or pitched.

Popular television soap opera [[Coronation Street sets|Coronation Street]] has cobblestones and they are often referenced in relation to reports on the show.

In recent decades, cobblestones have become a popular material for paving newly [[pedestrian]]ised streets in Europe. In this case, the noisy nature of the surface is an advantage as pedestrians can hear approaching vehicles. The visual cues of the cobblestones also clarify that the area is more than just a normal street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Architect: Open Salem pedestrian mall to cars, parking |url=http://www.salemnews.com/local/x2036003030/Architect-Open-Salem-pedestrian-mall-to-cars-parking |accessdate=23 April 2011|newspaper=The Salem News|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cobblestones/setts is also considered to be a more "upmarket" roadway solution, having been described as "unique and artistic" compared to the normal asphalt road environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frances Page|first=Cecilia|title=Authentic Insights|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Setts cobblestones.JPG|thumb|right|Setts visible beneath cracked asphalt in New Bedford, MA.]]
In older U.S. cities such as [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Pittsburgh]],&lt;ref name="belgianblock" /&gt; [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], [[Portland, Maine|Portland (Maine)]], [[Baltimore]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[New Orleans]], many of the older streets are paved in cobblestones and setts (mostly setts); however, many such streets have been paved over with asphalt, which can crack and erode away due to heavy traffic, thus revealing the original stone pavement.

In some places such as [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], as late as the 1990s some busy intersections still showed cobblestones through worn down sections of pavement. In Toronto streets using setts were used by streetcar routes and disappeared by the 1980s, but are still found in the [[Distillery District]].

Many cities in Latin America, such as [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]; [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] and [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], in [[Mexico]]; [[Old San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]; [[Philippines]], [[Vigan]]; and [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], are well known for their many cobblestone streets, which are still operational and in good condition. They are still maintained and repaired the traditional manner, by placing and arranging granite stones by hand.

In the [[Czech Republic]], there are old cobblestone paths with colored [[marble]]s and [[limestone]]s. The design with three colors (red/limestone, black/limestone, white/marble) has a long tradition in [[Bohemia]]. The cubes of the old ways are handmade.

==Use in architecture==
{{main|Cobblestone architecture}}

In the [[Finger Lakes]] Region of New York State, the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age left numerous small, rounded cobblestones available for building.  Pre-Civil War architecture in the region made heavy use of cobblestones for walls.  Today, the fewer than 600 remaining cobblestone buildings are prized as historic locations, most of them private homes. They are clustered south of Lake Ontario, between Buffalo and Syracuse. There is also a cluster of cobblestone buildings in the Town of [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]], [[Ontario]]. In addition to homes, cobblestones were used to build barns, stagecoach taverns, smokehouses, stores, churches, schools, factories, and cemetery markers. The history of building with cobblestones and 17 driving tours to see the remaining structures are found in "''Cobblestone Quest - Road Tours of New York's Historic Buildings''".

The only public cobblestone building is the [[Alexander Classical School]], located in [[Alexander (village), New York|Alexander, New York]].

==Use in cycling==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
In cycling road races, cobblestones are used as an additional difficulty for the riders. It requires a certain skill to ride cobblestones efficiently, without falling or getting a flat tire. [[Tour of Flanders]] and [[Paris–Roubaix]] are notable [[cobbled classics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21520">In the [[United States]], a '''conservation easement''' (also called '''conservation covenant''', '''conservation restriction''' or '''conservation servitude''') is a power invested in a qualified [[private land]] conservation organization (often called a "[[land trust]]") or government (municipal, county, state or federal) to constrain, as to a specified land area, the exercise of rights otherwise held by a [[landowner]] so as to achieve certain conservation purposes. It is an interest in [[real property]] established by agreement between a landowner and land trust or unit of government. The conservation easement "runs with the land", meaning it is applicable to both present and future owners of the land. As with other real property interests, the grant of conservation easement is recorded in the local land records; the grant becomes a part of the [[chain of title]] for the property.

The conservation easement's purposes will vary depending on the character of the particular property, the goals of the land trust or government unit, and the needs of the landowners. For example, an easement’s purposes (often called "conservation objectives") might include any one or more of the following:
* Maintain and improve [[water quality]];
* Perpetuate and foster the growth of healthy [[forest]];
* Maintain and improve [[wildlife]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and migration corridors;
* Protect scenic vistas visible from roads and other public areas; or
* Ensure that lands are managed so that they are always available for [[sustainable agriculture]] and forestry.

The conservation easement's administrative terms for advancing the conservation objectives also vary but typically forbid or substantially constrain subdivision and other [[real estate development]].

The most distinguishing feature of the conservation easement as a conservation tool is that it enables users to achieve specific conservation objectives on the land while keeping the land in the ownership and control of landowners for uses consistent with the conservation objectives.

The decision to place a conservation easement on a property is strictly a voluntary one whether the easement is sold or donated. The restrictions of the easement, once set in place, are perpetual (and potentially reduce the resale value of the associated property). Appraisals of the value of the easement, and financial arrangements between the parties (land owner and land trust), generally are kept private.

The landowner who grants a conservation easement continues to privately own and manage the land and may receive significant state and federal [[tax]] advantages for having donated and/or sold the conservation easement. In accepting the conservation easement, the easement holder has a responsibility to monitor future uses of the land to ensure compliance with the terms of the easement and to enforce the terms if a violation occurs.

Although a conservation easement prohibits certain uses by the landowner, such an easement does not make the land public. On the contrary, many conservation easements confer no use of the land either to the easement holder or to the public. Furthermore, many conservation easements reserve to the landowner specific uses which if not reserved would be prohibited. Some conservation easements confer specific uses to the easement holder or to the public. These details are spelled out in the legal document that creates the conservation easement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcr.org/index.php Equestrian Land Conservation Resource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615132220/http://www.elcr.org/index.php |date=2008-06-15 }} ''Guide to equestrian-friendly conservation easements'', revised edition, 175 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref is complete;  no date etc. in the original --&gt;

==Income tax deductions==
Landowners in the United States who donate a "qualifying" conservation easement to a "qualified" land protection organization under the regulations set forth in 170(h) of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] may be eligible for a federal income [[tax deduction]] equal to the value of their donation. The value of the easement donation, as determined by a qualified [[appraiser]], equals the difference between the [[fair market value]] of the property before and after the easement takes effect.

To qualify for this income tax deduction, the easement must be: a) perpetual; b) held by a qualified governmental or non-profit organization; and, c) serve a valid "conservation purpose", meaning the property must have an appreciable natural, scenic, historic, scientific, recreational, or open space value. As a result of legislation signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on August 17, 2006 (H.R. 4 The Pensions Protection Act of 2006), in 2006 and 2007, conservation easement donors were able to deduct the value of their gift at the rate of 50% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) per year. Further, landowners with 50% or more of their income from agriculture were able to deduct the donation at a rate of 100% of their AGI. Any amount of the donation remaining after the first year could be carried forward for fifteen additional years (allowing a maximum of sixteen years within which the deduction may be utilized), or until the amount of the deduction has been used up, whichever comes first. With the passage of the Farm Bill in the summer of 2008 these expanded federal income tax incentives were extended such that they also apply to all conservation easements donated in 2008 and 2009 and then this provision was extended again to apply to donations in 2010 and 2011. The provision has since expired and currently for 2012, conservation easement donations may only be deducted at the rate of 30% of the donor's AGI and after the first year the donor has a five-year carryforward.

==Income tax credits (states)==
Land conservation advocates have long tried to enact additional tax incentives for landowners to donate easements, above the federal charitable deduction (and state tax deduction in states that conform to federal tax process). There has been discussion of creating a federal income tax credit for easement donors since around 1980. However, no federal tax credit has been enacted. States, however, have moved ahead to grant credits that can be used to pay state income tax to donors of qualified conservation easements. In 1983, North Carolina became the first state to establish such a program.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina G.S.§105-151.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Philip Tabas of [[The Nature Conservancy]] promoted the state tax credit idea widely in the 1990s. In 1999, four state legislatures enacted state tax credit programs (Virginia, Delaware, Colorado, and Connecticut, in that order). South Carolina and California followed in 2000. Several other states have followed since.

For landowners with little income subject to state taxation, a tax credit is a hollow reward for reducing the value of real property by donating a conservation easement. To respond to this, Colorado conservationists made their state tax credit transferable in 2000—that is, the donor/landowner can sell her/his credit to other parties; the buyers then use the purchased tax credit to pay their Colorado income tax. This is appealing to buyers because the credit is sold at a discount from face value. Virginia followed by enacting transferability in 2002. Delegate Bill Howell (now Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates) introduced HB1322, which had been suggested to him by conservationists Charles Davenport and Phil Hocker. HB1322 was enacted, effective retroactively to January 1, 2002. Other states have followed since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Walden to Wall Street, Chapter 8|year=2005|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC, USA|isbn=1-59726-029-0|pages=124–137|authorlink=Transferable State Tax Credits as a Conservation Incentive|editor=James N. Levitt|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "caps" on the amount of credit an easement can generate, and other restrictions, limit the scope of the different state tax credit programs in varying manners.

In the states where credit for conservation land donations is transferable, free markets have arisen. Brokers assist landowners with excess credit to contact buyers, and the brokers often handle payments and paperwork to protect the principals, and to ensure that transfers are fully reported to the state tax authorities. The federal and state tax treatment of profits from sale and use of transferable tax credit have been the subject of extensive discussion and the issuance of several guidance documents by the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref&gt;[A comprehensive treatment of IRS views on state income tax credit transfers is contained within IRS AM 2007-002, issued 26Jan2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Mexico state income tax credit was originated in 2003.[SB 581] New transferability legislation, effective January 1, 2008, applies retroactively to conservation easements effected from January 1, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/NMAC/parts/title03/03.013.0020.htm 3.13.20 NMAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia transferable credit program is the largest among the States in dollar value of property conserved. By the end of 2010, $2,512,000,000 of property value had been donated as easements in Virginia for which tax credit was claimed.&lt;ref&gt;[For a comprehensive online treatment of the Virginia credit program, see: {{cite web |url=http://www.conservationfund.org/sites/default/files/The_Conservation_Fund_Chesapeake_Bay_Better_Models_for_Conservation_Chapt4_VA_State_Tax_Credit.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724194232/http://www.conservationfund.org/sites/default/files/The_Conservation_Fund_Chesapeake_Bay_Better_Models_for_Conservation_Chapt4_VA_State_Tax_Credit.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}]&lt;/ref&gt; The qualifying easements cover over {{convert|516,000|acre|km2}} of Virginia landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[Virginia Department of Taxation, public presentations, Jan2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Virginia program now (2011) grants about $110 million of new tax credit each year. The credit allowance is 40% of the appraised value of the easement donation, so this equates to $275 million of property value donated per year for protection of wildlife habitat, farmland and woodland, and scenic open space—in perpetuity. The other state tax credit programs are smaller in dollar measurement, but are very significant in the area and the conservation values that they cause to be protected. The concept of state tax credit action (in the absence of a federal tax credit) that Philip Tabas and The Nature Conservancy promoted in the 1990s has borne remarkable fruit, and continues to expand today.

==Estate tax reductions and exclusions==
For landowners who will leave sizable estates upon their death, the most important financial impact of a conservation easement may be a significant reduction in [[estate tax]]es. Estate taxes often make it difficult for heirs to keep land intact and in the family because of high estate tax rates and high development value of land. It may be necessary to subdivide or sell land for development in order to pay these taxes which may not be the desire of the landowner or their heirs. A conservation easement can often provide significant help with this problem in three important ways:

# ''Reduction in value of the estate.'' The deceased's estate will be reduced by the value of the donated conservation easement. As a result, taxes will be lower because heirs will not be required to pay taxes on the extinguished development rights. In other words, heirs will only have to pay estate taxes on preserved farmland values, and not full development values.
#''Estate exclusion.'' Section 2031(c) of the tax code provides further estate tax incentives for properties subject to a donated conservation easement. When property has a qualified conservation easement placed upon it, up to an additional 40% of the value of land (subject to a $500,000 cap) may be excluded from the estate when the landowner dies. This exclusion is in addition to the reduction in land value attributable to the easement itself as described above.
#''After death easement.'' Heirs may also receive these benefits (but not the income tax deduction) by electing to donate a conservation easement after the landowner's death and prior to filing the estate return (called a "post mortem" election).

In Pennsylvania, conservation restrictions on land included in the estate can reduce the inheritance tax owed.&lt;ref&gt;Pregmon, Esq., Patricia. "Reducing Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax", ConservationTools.org. Online. http://conservationtools.org/guides/show/52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and property tax incentives==
Some states ([[Colorado]], [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[North Carolina]]) offer a state income tax incentive and many states offer [[property tax]] incentives to conservation easement donors. In Pennsylvania, conservation restrictions on land included in the estate can reduce the inheritance tax owed.&lt;ref&gt;Pregmon, Patricia, Esq. "Reducing Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax", ConservationTools.org. Online. http://conservationtools.org/guides/show/52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues to consider==
* As is the case with any property interest, a conservation easement may be taken by eminent domain (and thereby extinguished) when the public value of the proposed project exceeds that of the conservation interest being protected by the easement.
* Conservation easements may result in a significant reduction in the sale price of the land because a builder can no longer develop it. In fact, this difference in value is the basis for the granting of the original tax incentives. An estimate of 35%–65% value reduction has been made on conservation easement land to the land owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olmsted|first1=James|title=Conservation Easements: New Perspectives in an Evolving World|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Fall 2011|volume=74|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clear boundaries of adjacent properties are not always consistent with each other. Currently, the NCED manages this issue by snapping boundary polygons to a standard parcel layer which may differ from the original data provided by a landowner.

==Purchase of conservation easements==
Many conservation easements are purchased with funds from federal, state, and local governments, nonprofit organizations, or private donors. In these cases, landowners are paid directly for the purchase of the conservation easement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olmsted|first1=James|title=Conservation Easements: New Perspectives in an Evolving World|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Fall 2011|volume=74|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Farm Bill]], updated every 5 or more years, provides an important source of funds for conservation easement purchase. The 2014 Farm Bill created the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) by consolidating the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program, the Grassland Reserve Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program. Under ACEP, the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] helps tribes, state and local governments, and land trusts protect agriculture from development and other non-agricultural uses. ACEP includes Agricultural Land Easements and Wetland Reserve Easements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farm Bill|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/farmbill/|website=United Stated Department of Agriculture|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural land easements preserve land for food production and aids in soil and water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agricultural Conservation Easement Purchase Program|url=https://conservationtools.org/guides/47-agricultural-conservation-easement-purchase-program|website=Conservation Tools|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetland reserve easements aim to restore wetland areas that have been converted into agricultural land. To maximize the benefits, the program targets land that has both a high chance of restoration success and a history of low crop yields or crop failure. The Farm Bill also funds the purchase of conservation easements for forestland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farm Bill|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/farmbill/|website=United Stated Department of Agriculture|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Forest Legacy Program]] is a voluntary Federal program in partnership with States which protects privately owned forest lands. Landowners are required to prepare a multiple resource management plan as part of the conservation easement acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing the Land|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/managing-land|website=US Forest Service|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of states have direct funding sources for conservation. Commonly used funding sources include real estate transfer tax, legislative bonds, and lottery proceeds. For instance, in 2014, New Jersey added conservation funding from corporate business taxes through constitutional amendment, approved by 65% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking Investments in Protected Lands|url=http://www.conservationalmanac.org/secure/|website=Conservation Almanac|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states and counties have programs for the purchase of agricultural conservation easements (PACE) to protect productive farmland from non-agricultural development. In 1974, [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] in New York enacted the first PACE (also known as purchase of development rights or PDR) program. King County in Washington and the states of Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut quickly followed suit. As of 2003, the PACE program operates in 23 states, including 19 statewide and more than 45 local programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/nre/in_focus/ere_if_preserve_programs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308205032/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/nre/in_focus/ere_if_preserve_programs.html |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; King County in Washington and the states of Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut quickly followed suit. As of 2016, the PACE program operates in 32 states through both state and local programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking Investments in Protected Lands|url=http://www.conservationalmanac.org/secure/|website=Conservation Almanac|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Conservation Easement Database==
The National Conservation Easement Database maps conservation easements and provides a resource for understanding what resources conservation easements protect in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olmsted|first1=James|title=Conservation Easements: New Perspectives in an Evolving World|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Fall 2011|volume=74|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the National Conservation Easement Database included over 130,000 conservation easements on 24.7 million acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completeness|url=https://www.conservationeasement.us/|website=National Conservation Easement Database|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copy protection''', also known as '''content protection''', '''copy prevention''' and '''copy restriction''', is any effort designed to prevent the reproduction of software, films, music, and other media, usually for [[copyright]] [[reasons]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Obnigene, [http://www.filmfodder.com/movies/dvd/glossary/glossary.htm DVD Glossary], filmfodder.com 2007. Retrieved July 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Various methods have been devised to prevent reproduction so that companies will gain benefit from each person who obtains an authorized copy of their product. Unauthorized copying and distribution accounted for $2.4 billion in lost revenue in the United States alone in the 1990s,&lt;ref name="Short"&gt;Greg Short, Comment, Combatting Software Piracy: Can Felony Penalties for Copyright Infringement Curtail the Copying of Computer
Software?, 10 Santa Clara Computer &amp; High Tech. L.J. 221 (1994).
Available at: http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/chtlj/vol10/iss1/7&lt;/ref&gt; and is assumed to be causing impact on revenues in the [[Music industry|music]] and the [[Video game industry|game industry]], leading to proposal of stricter copyright laws such as [[PROTECT IP Act|PIPA]]. Some methods of copy protection have also led to criticisms because it caused inconvenience for honest consumers, or it secretly installed additional or unwanted software to detect copying activities on the consumer's computer. Making copy protection effective while protecting consumer rights is still an ongoing problem with media publication.

== Terminology ==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}
Media corporations have always used the term '''copy protection''', but critics argue that the term tends to sway the public into identifying with the publishers, who favor restriction technologies, rather than with the users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Protection Confusing Words and Phrases that are Worth Avoiding], GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF).&lt;/ref&gt; '''Copy prevention''' and '''copy control''' may be more neutral terms. "Copy protection" is a misnomer for some systems, because any number of copies can be made from an original and all of these copies will work, but only in one computer, or only with one [[dongle]], or only with another device that cannot be easily copied.

The term is also often related to, and confused with, the concept of [[digital rights management]]. Digital rights management is a more general term because it includes all sorts of management of works, including copy restrictions. Copy protection may include measures that are not digital. A more appropriate term may be "technological protection measures" (TPMs),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/enforcement/en/faq/technological/faq03.html How do technological protection measures work?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614024159/http://www.wipo.int/enforcement/en/faq/technological/faq03.html |date=2013-06-14 }}, World Intellectual Property Organization&lt;/ref&gt; which is often defined as the use of technological tools in order to restrict the use or access to a work.

== Business rationale ==
Copy protection is most commonly found on [[videotape]]s, DVDs, computer software discs, video game discs and cartridges, audio CDs and some [[Video CD|VCDs]].

Many media formats are easy to copy using a machine, allowing consumers to distribute copies to their friends, a practice known as "casual copying".

Companies publish works under copyright protection because they believe that the cost of implementing the copy protection will be less than the revenue produced by consumers who buy the product instead of acquiring it through casually copied media.

Opponents of copy protection argue that people who obtain free copies only use what they can get for free, and would not purchase their own copy if they were unable to obtain a free copy.  Some even argue that free copies increase profit; people who receive a free copy of a music CD may then go and buy more of that band's music, which they would not have done otherwise.

Some publishers have avoided copy-protecting their products, on the theory that the resulting inconvenience to their users outweighs any benefit of frustrating "casual copying".

From the perspective of the end user, copy protection is always a cost. [[Digital rights management|DRM]] and license managers sometimes fail, are inconvenient to use, and may not afford the user all of the [[fair use|legal use]] of the product he has purchased.

The term ''copy protection'' refers to the technology used to attempt to frustrate copying, and not to the legal remedies available to publishers or authors whose copyrights are violated. Software usage models range from node locking to floating licenses (where a fixed number licenses can be concurrently used across an enterprise), grid computing (where multiple computers function as one unit and so use a common license) and electronic licensing (where features can be purchased and activated online). The term ''license management'' refers to broad platforms which enable the specification, enforcement and tracking of [[software license]]s. To safeguard copy protection and license management technologies themselves against tampering and hacking, software anti-tamper methods are used.

Floating licenses are also being referred to as ''Indirect Licenses'', and are licenses that at the time they are issued, there is no actually user who will use them. That has some technical influence over some of their characteristics. ''Direct Licenses'' are issued after a certain user requires it. As an example, an activated [[Microsoft]] product, contains a ''Direct License'' which is locked to the [[Personal computer|PC]] where the product is installed.

From business standpoint, on the other hand, some services now try to monetize on additional services other than the media content so users can have better experience than simply obtaining the copied product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Copy protection technology is doomed | journal = Computer | date = Oct 2011 | first = D.S. | last = Wallach | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 48–49 | doi = 10.1109/2.955098 | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=955098&amp;tag=1 | accessdate = 2013-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical challenges ==
From a technical standpoint, it would seem theoretically impossible to completely prevent users from making copies of the media they purchase, as long as a "writer" is available that can write to blank media. The basic technical fact is that all types of media require a "player" — a CD player, DVD player, videotape player, computer or [[video game console]]. The player has to be able to read the media in order to display it to a human.  In turn, then, logically, a player could be built that first reads the media, and then writes out an exact copy of what was read, to the same type of media.

At a minimum, digital copy protection of non-interactive works is subject to the [[analog hole]]: regardless of any digital restrictions, if music can be heard by the human ear, it can also be recorded (at the very least, with a microphone and tape recorder); if a film can be viewed by the human eye, it can also be recorded (at the very least, with a video camera and recorder).  In practice, almost-perfect copies can typically be made by tapping into the analog output of a player (e.g. the [[loudspeaker|speaker]] output or [[headphone]] jacks) and, once redigitized into an unprotected form, duplicated indefinitely. Copying [[text-based]] content in this way is more tedious, but the same principle applies: if it can be printed or displayed, it can also be scanned and [[Optical character recognition|OCRed]]. With basic software and some patience, these techniques can be applied by a typical computer-literate user.

Since these basic technical facts exist, it follows that a determined individual will definitely succeed in copying any media, given enough time and resources. Media publishers understand this; copy protection is not intended to stop professional operations involved in the unauthorized mass duplication of media, but rather to stop "casual copying".

Copying of information goods which are downloaded (rather than being mass-duplicated as with physical media) can be inexpensively customized for each download, and thus restricted more effectively, in a process known as "[[traitor tracing]]". They can be encrypted in a fashion which is unique for each user's computer, and the decryption system can be made [[tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]].

== Methods ==

For information on individual protection schemes and technologies, see [[List of copy protection schemes]] or relevant category page.

=== Computer software ===
Copy protection for computer software, especially for games, has been a long cat-and-mouse struggle between publishers and [[software cracking|crackers]]. These were (and are) programmers who would defeat copy protection on software as a hobby, add their [[pseudonym|alias]] to the title screen, and then distribute the "cracked" product to the network of [[warez]] [[Bulletin board system|BBSes]] or Internet sites that specialized in distributing unauthorized copies of software.

==== Early ages {{anchor|Early ages}} ==== &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: [[Bad sector#Copy protection]] links here --&gt;
{{further|Bad sector#Copy protection}}
When computer software was still distributed in audio cassettes, audio copying was unreliable, while digital copying was time consuming. Software prices were comparable with audio cassette prices.&lt;ref name="Short" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nibble"&gt;Copy Protection: A History and Outlook http://www.studio-nibble.com/countlegger/01/HistoryOfCopyProtection.html&lt;/ref&gt; To make digital copying more difficult, many programs used non-standard loading methods (loaders incompatible with standard BASIC loaders, or loaders that used different transfer speed).

Unauthorized software copying began to be a problem when floppy disks became the common storage media.&lt;ref name="Nibble" /&gt; The ease of copying depended on the system; [[Jerry Pournelle]] wrote in ''[[BYTE]]'' in 1983 that "[[CP/M]] doesn't lend itself to copy protection" so its users "haven't been too worried" about it, while "[[Apple II family|Apple]] users, though, have always had the problem. So have those who used [[TRS-DOS]], and I understand that [[MS-DOS]] has copy protection features".&lt;ref name="pournelle198306"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-06/1983_06_BYTE_08-06_16-Bit_Designs#page/n411/mode/2up | title=Zenith Z-100, Epson QX-10, Software Licensing, and the Software Piracy Problem | work=BYTE | date=June 1983 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple and [[Commodore 64]] computers were extremely varied and creative because most of the floppy disk reading and writing was controlled by software (or firmware), not by hardware. The first copy protection was for cassette tapes and consisted of a loader at the beginning of the tape, which read a specially formatted section which followed.

The first protection of floppy disks consisted of changing the address marks, bit slip marks, data marks, or end of data marks for each sector.  For example, Apple’s standard sector markings were:
*'''D5 AA 96''' for the address mark. That was followed by track, sector, and checksum.
*'''DE AA EB''' concluded the address header with what are known as bit slip marks.
*'''D5 AA AD''' was used for the data mark and the end of data mark was another '''DE AA EB'''.
Changing any of these marks required fairly minimal changes to the software routines in Apple DOS which read and wrote the floppy disk, but produced a disk that could not be copied by any of the standard copiers, such as Apple's COPYA program. Some protection schemes used more complicated systems that changed the marks by track or even within a track.

====1980s Locksmith====
Pournelle disliked copy protection and, except for games, refused to review software that used it. He did not believe that it was useful, writing in 1983 that "For every copy protection scheme there's a hacker ready to defeat it. Most involve so-called nibble/nybble copiers, which try to analyze the original disk and then make a copy".{{r|pournelle198306}} [[IBM]]'s [[Don Estridge]] agreed: "I guarantee that whatever scheme you come up with will take less time to break than to think of it." While calling piracy "a threat to software development. It's going to dry up the software", he said "It's wrong to copy-protect programs ... There ought to be some way to stop [piracy] without creating products that are unusable."&lt;ref name="byte198311"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-11/1983_11_BYTE_08-11_Inside_the_IBM_PC#page/n89/mode/2up | title=IBM's Estridge | work=BYTE | date=November 1983 | accessdate=19 March 2016 |author1=Curran, Lawrence J. |author2=Shuford, Richard S. | pages=88–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, the first 'nibble' copier, Locksmith, was introduced. These copiers reproduced copy protected floppy disks an entire track at a time, ignoring how the sectors were marked.  This was harder to do than it sounds for two reasons: firstly, Apple disks did not use the index hole to mark the start of a track; their drives could not even detect the index hole. Tracks could thus start anywhere, but the copied track had to have this "write splice", which always caused some bits to be lost or duplicated due to speed variations, roughly in the same (unused for payload data) place as the original, or it would not work. Secondly, Apple used special "self-sync" bytes to achieve agreement between drive controller and computer about where any byte ended and the next one started on the disk. These bytes were written as normal data bytes followed by a slightly longer than normal pause, which was notoriously unreliable to detect on read-back; still, you had to get the self-sync bytes roughly right as without them being present in the right places, the copy would not work, and with them present in too many places, the track would not fit on the destination disk. Locksmith copied Apple II disks by taking advantage of the fact that these sync fields between sectors almost always consisted of a long string of FF (hex) bytes. It found the longest string of FFs, which usually occurred between the last and first sectors on each track, and began writing the track in the middle of that; also it assumed that any long string of FF bytes was a sync sequence and introduced the necessary short pauses after writing each of them to the copy. Ironically, Locksmith would not copy itself. The first Locksmith measured the distance between sector 1 of each track. Copy protection engineers quickly figured out what Locksmith was doing and began to use the same technique to defeat it. Locksmith countered by introducing the ability to reproduce track alignment and prevented itself from being copied by embedding a special sequence of nibbles, that if found, would stop the copy process. Henry Roberts (CTO of [http://www.nalpeiron.com Nalpeiron]), a graduate student in computer science at the University of South Carolina, reverse engineered Locksmith, found the sequence and distributed the information to some of the 7 or 8 people producing copy protection at the time.

For some time, Locksmith continued to defeat virtually all of the copy protection systems in existence. The next advance came from Henry Roberts' thesis on software copy protection, which devised a way of replacing Apple’s sync field of FFs with random appearing patterns of bytes. Because the graduate student had frequent copy protection discussions with Apple’s copy protection engineer, Apple developed a copy protection system which made use of this technique.
Henry Roberts then wrote a competitive program to Locksmith, Back It UP. He devised several methods for defeating that, and ultimately a method was devised for reading self sync fields directly, regardless of what nibbles they contained.

Copy protection sometimes caused software to not run on [[clone (computing)|clone]]s, such as the Apple II-compatible [[Laser 128]].&lt;ref name="mace19860113"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Mace |first=Scott |date=1986-01-13 |title=Two Firms Plan to Sell Apple Clone |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mi8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |magazine=InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; The back and forth struggle between copy protection engineers and nibble copiers continued until the Apple II became obsolete and was replaced by the IBM PC and its clones.

In 1989 [[Gilman Louie]], head of [[Spectrum Holobyte]], stated that copy protection added about $0.50 per copy to the cost of production of a game.&lt;ref name="louie198904"&gt;{{cite news | title=Low Shelf 'ST'eem | work=Computer Gaming World | date=April 1989 | author=Louie, Gilman | pages=4 | type=letter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other software relied on complexity; ''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' in 1988 observed that ''[[WordPerfect]]'' for the [[Atari ST]] "is almost unusable without its manual of over 600 pages!".&lt;ref name="pearlman198805"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Pearlman |first=Gregg |date=May 1988 |title=WordPerfect ST / Proving why it's the IBM PC best seller |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n1/wordperfectst.html |magazine=Antic |volume=7 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The magazine was mistaken; the ST version was so widely pirated that the company threatened to discontinue it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/newnotesquotes.html|title=Word Perfect Furor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/st-log/issue20/97_1_ST_USER.php|title=ST USER}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

====1990s CD-R====
Floppy disks were later displaced by CDs as the preferred method of distribution, with companies like [[Macrovision]] and [[Sony]] providing copy protection schemes that worked by writing data to places on the CD-ROM where a [[CD-R]] drive cannot normally write. Such a scheme had been used for the [[PlayStation]] and could not be circumvented easily without the use of a [[modchip]].

For software publishers, a less expensive method of copy protection is to write the software so that it requires some evidence from the user that they have actually purchased the software, usually by asking a question that only a user with a software manual could answer (for example, "What is the 4th word on the 6th line of page 37?"). However, this approach can be exploited with the patience to copy the manual with a [[photocopier]], and it also suffers from the issue of making the product more inconvenient for the end user to use.

==== Recent practices ====
It has become very common for software to require [[Product activation|activation]] by entering some proof of legal purchase such as:
* Name &amp; Serial, a name and serial number that is given to the user at the time the software is purchased
* A phone activation code, which requires the user to call a number and register the product to receive a computer-specific serial number.
* Device ID, specifically tying a copy of software to a computer or mobile device based on a unique identifier only known to that device (like the IMEI of a smartphone).
To limit reusing activation keys to install the software on multiple machines, it has been attempted to tie the installed software to a specific machine by involving some unique feature of the machine. [[Serial number]] in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] could not be used because some machines do not have them. Some popular surrogate for a machine serial number were date and time (to the second) of initialization of the [[hard disk]] or [[MAC address]] of Ethernet cards (although this is programmable on modern cards). With the rise of [[Hardware virtualization|virtualization]], however, the practice of locking has to add to these simple hardware parameters to still prevent copying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dominic Haigh |url=http://knol.google.com/k/dominic-haigh/securing-software-licenses-in-virtual/2zijsseqiutxo/5# |title=Copy protection on virtual systems |publisher=Knol.google.com |date=2010-06-28 |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another approach to associating user and/or machine with serial number is [[product activation]] over the Internet, where users are required to have access to the Internet so the information on which serial number is installed on which machine gets sent to a server to be authenticated. Unauthorized users are not allowed to install or use the software. [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] system is a far-reaching example of this.
With rise of [[Cloud computing]], requiring Internet access is becoming more popular for software verification. Beyond online authentication, a standalone software may be integrated with the cloud so that key data or code is stored online. This could greatly strengthen the protection; for example, the software could store a property file or execute a process needed by the application in the cloud instead on the user's computer.

==== Problems and criticisms ====
The copy protection schemes described above have all been criticized for causing problems for validly licensed users who upgrade to a new machine, or have to reinstall the software after reinitializing their hard disk. Some Internet [[product activation]] products allow replacement copies to be issued to registered users or multiple copies to the same license.
Like all software, copy-protection software sometimes contains bugs, whose effect may be to deny access to validly licensed users. Most copy protection schemes are easy to crack, and once crackers circumvent the copy protection, the resulting cracked software is then more convenient and hence more valuable than the non-cracked version, because users can make additional copies of the software. Due to this problem, user-interactive copy protection by asking questions from manuals has mostly disappeared.

In his 1976 [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]], Bill Gates complained that "most of you steal your software."  However, Gates initially rejected copy protection and said "It just gets in the way."

There is also the tool of [[software blacklist]]ing that is used to enhance certain copy protection schemes.

=== Early video games ===
During the 1980s and 1990s, video games sold on [[audio cassette]] and [[floppy disk]]s were sometimes protected with an external user-interactive method that demanded the user to have the original package or a part of it, usually the manual. Copy protection was activated not only at installation, but every time the game was executed.&lt;ref name="NGen15"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Copy Protection|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Retro Gamer]] issue 83, "Don't copy that floppy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the copy protection code was needed not at launch, but at a later point in the game. This helped the gamer to experience the game (e.g. as a demonstration) and perhaps could convince them to buy it by the time the copy protection point was reached.

Several imaginative and creative methods have been employed, in order to be both fun and hard to copy. These include:

* The most common method was requiring the player to enter a specific word (often chosen at random) from the manual. A variant of this technique involved matching a picture provided by the game to one in the manual and providing an answer pertaining to the picture (''[[Ski or Die]]'', ''[[4D Boxing]]'' and ''[[James Bond 007: The Stealth Affair|James Bond 007; the Stealth Affair]]'' used this technique). ''[[Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space]]'' (in the floppy version but not the CD version) required the user to input an astronaut's total duration in space (available in the manual) before the launch of certain missions. If the answer was incorrect, the mission would suffer a catastrophic failure.
* Manuals containing information and hints vital to the completion of the game, like answers to riddles (''[[Conquests of Camelot]]'', ''[[King's Quest 6]]''), recipes of spells (''[[King's Quest 3]]''), keys to deciphering non-Latin writing systems (''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' series, see also [[Artificial scripts in Ultima series|Ultima writing systems]]), maze guides (''[[Manhunter (game)|Manhunter]]''), dialogue spoken by other characters in the game (''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'', ''[[Dragon Wars]]''), excerpts of the storyline (most ''[[Advanced Dungeons and Dragons]]'' games and ''[[Wing Commander I]]''), or a radio frequency to use to communicate with a character to further a game (''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'').
* Some sort of code with symbols, not existing on the keyboard or the [[ASCII]] code. This code was arranged in a grid, and had to be entered via a [[virtual keyboard]] at the request "''What is the code at line 3 row 2?''". These tables were printed on dark paper (''[[Maniac Mansion]]'', ''[[Uplink (video game)|Uplink]]''), or were visible only through a red transparent layer (''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''), making the paper very difficult to photocopy. Another variant of this method—most famously used on the [[ZX Spectrum]] version of [[Jet Set Willy]]—was a card with color sequences at each grid reference that had to be entered before starting the game. This also prevented monochrome photocopying. The codes in tables are based on a mathematical formula and can be calculated by using the row, line and page number if the formula is known, since the data would have required too much disk space.
* ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'' offered a rotating wheel with halves of pirate's faces. The game showed a face composed of two different parts and asked when this pirate was hanged on a certain island. The player then had to match the faces on the wheel, and enter the year that appeared on the island-respective hole. Its ''[[Monkey Island 2|sequel]]'' had the same concept, but with magic potion ingredients. Other games that employed the [[code wheel]] system include ''[[Star Control]]''.
* ''[[Zork]]'' games such as ''[[Beyond Zork]]'' and ''[[Zork Zero]]'' came with "[[feelies]]" which contained information vital to the completion of the game. For example, the parchment found from Zork Zero contained clues vital to solving the final puzzle. However, whenever the player attempts to read the parchment, they are referred to the game package.
* The [[Lenslok]] system used a plastic [[prismatic device]], shipped with the game, which was used to descramble a code displayed on screen.

All of these methods proved to be troublesome and tiring for the players, and as such greatly declined in usage by the mid-1990s, at which point the emergence of CDs as the primary video game medium made copy protection largely redundant, since CD copying technology was not widely available at the time.&lt;ref name="NGen15"/&gt;

While not strictly a software protection, some game companies offered "value-added" goodies with the package, like funny manuals, posters, comics, storybooks or fictional documentation concerning the game (e.g. the Grail Diary for Indiana Jones or a police cadet notebook with ''[[Police Quest]]'' or the Hero's manual of ''[[Quest for Glory]]'' or a copy of the ''National Inquisitor'' newspaper in ''[[Zak McKracken]]'') in order to entice gamers to buy the package. This trend is re-emerging in modern gaming as an incentive to both buy games and discourage their resale; some games like ''[[Forza Motorsport 3]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' provide bonus in-game material that will only be given if one buys the game new.

=== Video game console systems ===
When Sega's [[Dreamcast]] was released in 1998, it came with a newer disc format, called the [[GD-ROM]]. Using a modified CD player, one could access the game functionality. Using a special swap method could allow reading a GD-ROM game through a CD-ROM just using common MIL-CD (standard CD Boot loading, commonly found on Windows Installation Discs, Linux Live CDs, and others).  Dreamcasts sold after October 2000 contain a newer firmware update, not allowing MIL-CD boot.

The [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] has a specific function: Non-booting or non-reading from CDs and [[DVD-R]]s as a method of game copy protection. Also, the Xbox is said to use a different DVD file system (instead of UDF). It has been theorized that the discs have a second partition that is read from the outside in (opposite current standards thus making the second partition unreadable in PC DVD drives) which give the tracks the appearance that the disc was spun backwards during manufacture. The [[Xbox 360]] copy protection functions by requesting the DVD drive compute the angular distance between specific data sectors on the disc. A duplicated DVD will return different values than a pressed original would.

The [[PlayStation 2]] has a map file that contains all of the exact positions and file size info of the CD in it, which is stored at a position that is beyond the file limit. The game directly calls the position at where the map file is supposed to be. This means that if the file is moved inside the limit, it is useless since the game is looking outside the limit for it, and the file will not work outside of the limit, making any copied disc unusable without a mod chip or the use of FMCB (free memory card boot).  FMCB uses the memory card to trick the built-in DVD video software into booting copied games.  Before a copied game can be played, it must have been patched with a free application.

Nintendo's [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] have their own specialty format for copy protection. It is based on DVD/miniDVD (Game Cube) technology; each disc contains some deliberately placed defects. The exact positions of these defects, which differ for each produced disc, is encoded encrypted in the [[Burst Cutting Area|BCA]] of each disc. The BCA is readable on most standard DVD-ROM Drives, but consumer burners can reproduce neither the BCA nor the defects. As an additional obfuscation mechanism, the on-disc sector format is a little bit different from normal DVDs. Nevertheless, it can be read using some consumer DVD-ROM drives with a firmware modification or "debug mode". It is also possible to hack the Wii to install unlicensed software, some of which can use the Wii's own drive to create disc images and then play these copies.

The [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]], except the [[PSP Go]], uses the [[Universal Media Disc]], a media format similar to a [[MiniDisc]]. It holds about 1.2&amp;nbsp;GB. Although it cannot be copied, one can make an [[ISO image]] (a file version of the UMD) on a memory card and play it on [[PSP homebrew|custom firmware]], which can be installed on the PSP.

The [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox One]], and [[PlayStation 4]] use Blu-ray [[Blu-ray Disc|BD-ROM]] discs. In addition to any protection provided by the consoles themselves, the BD-ROM format's specification allows for a [[ROM-Mark]] which cannot be duplicated by consumer-level recorders. The BD-ROM format, in addition, provides considerable capacity: up to 100&amp;nbsp;gigabytes per disc with potential revision to provide more (many BD-ROM games use 40-50&amp;nbsp;gigabytes), making it unwieldy for online file-sharing, a major method of video game copying. To prevent the consoles themselves being hacked and used as a means to defeat these protections (as happened with the Wii and partially with the PlayStation 3), contemporary consoles employ trusted hardware paths that authenticate the internal hardware and software prior to operation.

Some [[Video game developer|game developer]]s, such as [[Markus Persson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Please Steal My Game|url=http://getminecraftforfree.org/please-steal-my-game/|publisher=getminecraftforfree.org|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have encouraged consumers and other developers to embrace the reality of unlicensed copying and utilize it positively to generate increased sales and marketing interest.

=== Videotape ===
Companies such as [[Macrovision]] and [[Dwight Cavendish]] provided schemes to [[videotape]] publishers making copies unusable if they were created with a normal [[VCR]]. All major videotape duplicators licensed Macrovision or similar technologies to copy protect video cassettes for their clients or themselves.

Starting in 1985 with the video release of ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'', Macrovision licensed to publishers a technology that exploits the [[automatic gain control]] feature of VCRs by adding pulses to the vertical blanking sync signal.&lt;ref name="copy_prevention_patents"&gt;Some relevant patents are {{US patent|4631603}}; {{US patent|4577216}}; {{US patent|4819098}}; and {{US patent|4907093}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These pulses do not affect the image a consumer sees on his TV, but do confuse the recording-level circuitry of consumer VCRs.  This technology, which is aided by U.S. legislation mandating the presence of automatic gain-control circuitry in VCRs, is said to "plug the analog hole" and make VCR-to-VCR copies impossible, although an inexpensive circuit is widely available that will defeat the protection by removing the pulses. Macrovision has patented methods of defeating copy prevention,&lt;ref name="copy_prevention_defeat_patents"&gt;One such patent is {{US patent|5625691}}.&lt;/ref&gt; giving it a more straightforward basis to shut down manufacture of any device that descrambles it than often exists in the DRM world.

Another form of copy protection, MicroVision, was designed to prevent VCRs from recording a television program. [[List of movie television channels|Cable movie channel]]s rejected it; [[Michael J. Fuchs]] of [[HBO]] said in 1985 that MicroVision was "not good technology" because it reduced picture quality and consumers could easily bypass it, while [[Peter Chernin]] of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] said "we want to accommodate our subscribers and we know they like to tape our movies".&lt;ref name="holsopple19850605"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TBweAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=F2MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7003%2C2983721 | title=Pay-TV looks elsewhere as theatrical movies lose their appeal | work=The Pittsburgh Press | date=1985-06-05 | accessdate=25 January 2015 | author=Holsopple, Barbara | pages=C12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audio CDs ===
By 2000, [[Napster]] had seen mainstream adoption, and several music publishers responded by starting to sell some CDs with various copy protection schemes. Most of these were playback restrictions that aimed to make the CD unusable in computers with CD-ROM drives, leaving only dedicated audio CD players for playback. This did not, however, prevent such a CD from being copied via an analogue connection or by ripping the CD under operating systems such as [[Linux]], which was effective since copy-protection software was generally written for [[Microsoft Windows]]. These weaknesses led critics to question the usefulness of such protection.

CD copy protection is achieved by assuming certain feature levels in the drives. The [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CD Digital Audio]] is the oldest CD standard and forms the basic feature set beyond which dedicated audio players need no instructions. [[CD-ROM]] drives additionally need to support [[Enhanced CD|mixed mode CDs]] (combined audio and data tracks) and [[multi-session CD]]s (multiple data recordings each superseding and incorporating data of the previous session).

The play preventions in use intentionally deviate from the standards and intentionally include malformed multisession data or similar with the purpose of confusing the CD-ROM drives to prevent correct function. Simple dedicated audio CD players would not be affected by the malformed data since these are for features they do not support—for example, an audio player will not even look for a second session containing the copy protection data.

In practice, results vary wildly. CD-ROM drives may be able to correct the malformed data and still play them to an extent that depends on the make and version of the drive. On the other hand, some audio players may be built around drives with more than the basic features required for audio playback. Some car radios with CD playback, portable CD players, CD players with additional support for data CDs containing MP3 files, and DVD players have had problems with these CDs.

The deviation from the [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]] standard that defines audio CDs required the publishers of these copy-protected CDs to refrain from using the official CDDA logo on the discs or the cases. The logo is a [[trademark]] owned by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]] and licensed to identify compliant audio discs only. To prevent dissatisfied customers from returning CDs which were misrepresented as compliant audio CDs, such CDs also started to carry prominent notices on their covers.

In general the audio can always be extracted by applying the principle of the [[analog hole]]. Additionally, such programs as [[IsoBuster]] may be capable of producing hidden audio files.

Examples of CD copy protection schemes are [[Cactus Data Shield]], [[Copy Control]], and [[Data Position Measurement]].

=== Other digital media ===

More recently,{{when|date=September 2012}} publishers of music and films in digital form have turned to [[encryption]] to make copying more difficult. [[Content-scrambling system|CSS]], which is used on DVDs, is a famous example of this. It is a form of copy protection that uses [[40-bit encryption]]. Copies will not be playable since they will be missing the key, which is not writable on regular [[DVD-R]] or [[DVD-RW]] discs (except with special [[Qflix]] DVD-recorders and media). With this technique, the work is encrypted using a key only included in the [[firmware]] of "authorized" players, which allow only "legitimate" uses of the work (usually restricted forms of playback, but no conversion or modification). The controversial [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] provides a legal protection for this in the US, that would make it illegal to distribute "unauthorized" players—which was supposed to eliminate the possibility of building a DVD copier. However, encryption schemes designed for mass-market standardized media such as DVD suffer from the fundamental weaknesses that consumers have physical access to the devices containing the keys, and once implemented, the copy-protection scheme can never be changed without breaking the [[forward compatibility]] of older devices (or the [[backward compatibility]] of newer media). Since consumers are highly unlikely to buy new hardware for the sole purpose of preserving copy protection, manufacturers have been prevented from enhancing their DRM technology until recently, with the release of next-generation media such as [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. This period represents more than enough time for the encryption scheme to be defeated by determined attackers. For example, the CSS encryption system used on DVD Video was broken within three years of its market release in November 1996 (see [[DeCSS]]), but has not been changed since, because doing so would immediately render all DVD players sold ''prior'' to the change incapable of reading new DVDs—this would not only provoke a backlash amongst consumers, but also restrict the market that the new DVDs could be sold to. More recent DVDs have attempted to augment CSS with additional protection schemes. Most modern schemes like [[ARccOS Protection]] use tricks of the DVD format in an attempt to defeat copying programs, limiting the possible avenues of protection—and making it easier for hackers to learn the innards of the scheme and find ways around it.

The newest generations of optical disc media, [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]], attempt to address this issue. Both formats employ the [[Advanced Access Content System]], which provides for several hundred different decryption keys (for the varying models of players to hit the market), each of which can be invalidated ("revoked") should one of the keys be compromised. Revoked keys simply will not appear on future discs, rendering the compromised players useless for future titles unless they are updated to fix the issue. For this reason, all HD-DVD players and some Blu-ray players include an [[Ethernet physical layer|ethernet]] port, to give them the ability to download DRM updates. Blu-ray Disc goes one step further with a separate technique called [[BD+]], a virtual machine that can execute code included on discs to verify, authorize, revoke, and update players as the need arises. Since the protection program is on the disc rather than the player, this allows for updating protection programs within BD's working life by simply having newer programs included on newer discs.

[[4K resolution]] Blu-ray discs augment the existing Blu-ray protections. First, players must be dedicated devices that use protected hardware paths to ensure the entire process chain (from media to display) is not compromised. Second, some media require the use of players able to access the Internet for additional verification.

== Notable payloads ==
Over time, software publishers (especially in the case of video games) became creative about crippling the software in case it was duplicated. These games would initially show that the copy was successful, but eventually render themselves unplayable via subtle methods.
Many games use the "code checksumming" technique to prevent alteration of code to bypass other copy protection.  Important constants for the game - such as the accuracy of the player's firing, the speed of their movement, etc. - are not included in the game but calculated from the numbers making up the [[machine code]] of other parts of the game.  If the code is changed, the calculation yields a result which no longer matches the original design of the game and the game plays improperly.

* ''[[Superior Soccer]]'' had no outward signs of copy protection, but if it decided it was not a legitimate copy, it would make the [[soccer ball]] in the game invisible, making it impossible to play the game.
* In ''[[Sid Meier's Pirates]]'', if the player entered in the wrong information, they could still play the game, but the difficulty would be increased substantially.
* As a more satirical nod to the issue, if the thriller-action game ''[[Alan Wake]]'' detects that the game is cracked or a pirated copy, it will replace tips in loading screens with messages telling the player to buy the game. If a new game is created on the copied game, an additional effect will take place. As a more humorous nod to "piracy", Alan Wake will gain a black [[Eyepatch]] over his right eye, complete with a miniature [[Jolly Roger]].
* While the copy protection in ''[[Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders]]'' was not hidden as such, the repercussions of missing the codes was unusual: the player would end up in jail (permanently), and the police officer would give a lengthy and condescending speech about software copying.
* In case of copied versions of ''[[Settlers 3]]'', the [[iron smelter]]s would only produce pigs (a play on [[pig iron]]); weaponsmiths require iron to produce weapons, so players couldn't amass arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sven Liebich, Germany |url=http://www.settlers3.com/forum/bulletin.htm |title=Settlers3.com |publisher=Settlers3.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010304013018/http://www.settlers3.com/forum/bulletin.htm |archivedate=2001-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bohemia Interactive Studio]] developed a unique and very subtle protection system for its game ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis]]''. Dubbed [[FADE]], if it detects an unauthorized copy, it does not inform the player immediately but instead progressively corrupts aspects of the game (such as reducing the weapon accuracy to zero) to the point that it eventually becomes unplayable. The message "Original discs don't FADE" will eventually appear if the game is detected as being an unauthorized copy.
**FADE is also used in ''[[ArmA&amp;nbsp;II]]'', and will similarly diminish the accuracy of the player’s weapons, as well as induce a “drunken vision” effect, where the screen becomes wavy, should the player be playing on an unauthorized copy.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameburnworld.com/protections_fade.shtml |title=FADE Game Copy Protections |publisher=GameBurnWorld |date= |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**This system would also be used in ''[[Take On Helicopters]]'', where the screen would blur and distort when playing a counterfeit copy, making it hard to safely pilot a helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bohemia Interactive Details Unique Anti-Piracy Methods|url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/2011/11/10/bohemia-interactive-details-unique-anti-piracy-methods#.URBFPaWM7ww|publisher=GamePolitics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [[IndyCar Series|''IndyCar Series'' (2002 video game)]] also utilizes [[FADE]] technology to safeguard against piracy by making races very difficult to win on a pirated version. The penultimate section of the game’s manual states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Copying commercial games, such as this one, is a criminal offense and copyright infringement.''&lt;br&gt;
''Copying and re-supplying games such as this one can lead to a term of imprisonment.''&lt;br&gt;
'''''Think of a pirated game as stolen property.'''''&lt;br&gt;
''This game is protected by the FADE system. You can play with a pirated game- but not for long. The quality of a pirated game will degrade over time.''&lt;br&gt;
''Purchase only genuine software at legitimate stores.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' contained code that disabled Batman's glider cape, making some areas of the game very difficult to complete and a certain achievement/trophy impossible to unlock (gliding continuously for over 100m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/19289.cfm |title=Afterdawn.com |publisher=Afterdawn.com |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The PC version of ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' has a copy protection that swings the camera as though the player was drunk. If the player enters a vehicle it will automatically throttle, making it difficult to steer. It also damages the vehicle, making it vulnerable to collisions and bullets. An update to the game prevented unauthorised copies from accessing the in-game Internet browser, making it impossible to finish the game as some missions involve browsing the web for objectives.
*''[[EarthBound]]'' is well-documented for its extensive use of [[checksums]] to ensure that the game is being played on legitimate hardware. If the game detects that it is being played on a European [[SNES]], it refuses to boot, as the first of several checksums has failed. A second checksum will weed out most unauthorized copies of the game, but hacking the data to get past this checksum will trigger a third checksum that makes enemy encounters appear much more often than in an authorized copy, and if the player progresses through the game without giving up (or cracks this protection), a final checksum code will activate before the final boss battle, freezing the game and deleting all the save files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starmen.net/mother2/gameinfo/antipiracy/ |title=MOTHER 2 / EarthBound Anti-Piracy Measures |publisher=Starmen.Net |date= |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar copy protection system was used in ''Spyro: Year of the Dragon'', although it only uses one copy protection check at the beginning of the game (see below).
* In an unauthorized version of the PC edition of ''[[Mass Effect]]'', the game save mechanism would not work and the in-game galactic map would cause the game to crash. As the galactic map is needed to travel to different sections of the game, the player would be stuck in the first section of the game.
* If an unauthorized version of ''[[The Sims&amp;nbsp;2]]'' was used, the Build Mode would not work properly. Walls would not be able to be built on the player's property, which prevents the player from building any custom houses. Some furniture and clothing selections would not be available either.
* A March 2009 update to the [[BeeJive]] IM iPhone app included special functionality for users of the unauthorized version: the screen would read "[[PC LOAD LETTER]]" whenever the user tried to establish a connection to any IM service, then quickly switch to a YouTube clip from the movie ''[[Office Space]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/19/AR2009031900312.html |title=Beejive IM Moves To Block Out iPhone Pirates |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 2009-03-19|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Red Alert 2]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth]]'' have a copy protection system that completely wipes out the player's forces briefly after a battle begins on an unlicensed copy.  However, some who purchased the latter have encountered a [[Software bug|bug]] that caused this copy protection scheme to [[False alarm|trigger when it was not supposed to]].
* If a player pirated the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Michael Jackson: The Experience]]'', [[vuvuzela]] noises will play over the notes during a song, which then become invisible.  The game will also freeze if the player tries to pause it.
* Older versions of [[Autodesk 3ds Max]] use a [[dongle]] for copy protection; if it is missing, the program will randomly corrupt the points of the user's model during usage, destroying their work.
* Older versions of [[CDRWIN]] used a serial number for initial copy protection.  However, if this check was bypassed, a second hidden check would activate causing a random factor to be introduced into the CD burning process, producing corrupted "coaster" disks.
* [[Terminate (software)|Terminate]], a BBS terminal package, would appear to operate normally if cracked but would insert a warning that a pirated copy was in use into the [[IEMSI]] login packet it transmitted, where the [[sysop]] of any BBS the user called could clearly read it.
* ''Ubik's Musik'', a music creation tool for the [[Commodore 64]], would transform into a ''[[Space Invaders]]'' game if it detected that a cartridge-based copying device had attempted to interrupt it.  This copy protection system also doubles as an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]], as the message that appears when it occurs is not hostile ("Plug joystick in port&amp;nbsp;1, press fire, and no more resetting/experting!").
* The Amiga version of [[Bomberman]] featured a [[multitap]] peripheral that also acted as a [[dongle]].  Data from the multitap was used to calculate the time limit of each level.  If the multitap was missing, the time limit would be calculated as 0, causing the level to end immediately.
* ''[[Nevermind (game)|Nevermind]]'', a puzzle game for the Amiga, contained code that caused an unlicensed version of the game to behave as a demo.  The game would play three levels sampled from throughout the game, and then give the message "You have completed three levels; however there are 100 levels to complete on the original disc."
* In ''[[Spyro: Year of the Dragon]]'' a character named Zoe will tell the player outside the room containing the balloon to Midday Garden Home and several other areas that the player is using an unlicensed copy. This conversation purposely corrupts data. When corrupted, the game would not only remove stray gems and the ability to progress in certain areas but also make the final boss unbeatable, returning the player to the beginning of the game (and removing the save file at the same time) after about 8 seconds into the battle.&lt;ref name="Dodd, Gavin"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dodd, Gavin |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3030/keeping_the_pirates_at_bay.php |title=Keeping the Pirates at Bay: Implementing Crack Protection for Spyro: Year of the Dragon |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=2001-10-17 |accessdate=2008-03-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vN0X2AgG?url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3030/keeping_the_pirates_at_bay.php |archivedate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Atari Jaguar]] console would freeze at startup and play the sound of an enraged jaguar snarling if the inserted cartridge failed the initial security check.
* The [[Lenslok]] copy protection system gave an obvious message if the lens-coded letters were entered incorrectly, but if the user soft-reset the machine, the areas of memory occupied by the game would be flooded with the message "THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN OUR PRODUCT. NICE TRY. LOVE BJ/NJ" to prevent the user examining leftover code to crack the protection.
* An update to the sandbox game ''[[Garry's Mod]]'' enabled a copy protection mechanism that outputs the error '' "Unable to shade polygon normals" ''  if the game detects that it has been copied. The error also includes the user's [[Steam (software)|Steam]] ID as an error ID, meaning that users can be identified by their Steam account when asking for help about the error on the Internet.
* The Atari version of [[Alternate Reality: The Dungeon]] would have the player's character attacked by two unbeatable "FBI Agents" if it detected a cracked version.  The FBI agents would also appear when restoring a save which was created by such a version, even if the version restoring the save was legal.
* ''[[VGA Planets]]'', a play-by-BBS strategy game, contained code in its server which would check all clients' submitted turns for suspect registration codes.  Any player deemed to be using a cracked copy, or cheating in the game, would have random forces destroyed throughout the game by an unbeatable enemy called "The Tim Continuum" (after the game's author, Tim Wissemann).  A similar commercial game, ''[[Stars!]]'', would issue empty turn updates for players with invalid registration codes, meaning that none of their orders would ever be carried out.
* On a copied version of the original PC version of ''Postal'', as soon as the game was started, the player character would immediately shoot himself in the head.
* In ''[[Serious Sam 3: BFE]]'', if the game code detects what it believes to be an unauthorized  copy, an invincible scorpion-like monster is spawned in the beginning of the game with high speeds, melee attacks, and attacks from a range with twin chainguns making the game extremely difficult and preventing the player to progress further. Also in the level "Under the Iron Cloud", the player's character will spin out-of-control looking up in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=John|title=Serious Sam’s DRM Is A Giant Pink Scorpion|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/12/07/serious-sams-drm-is-a-giant-pink-scorpion/|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An unauthorized copy of ''[[Pokémon Black and White]]'' and their sequels will run as if it was normal, but the Pokémon will not gain any experience points after a battle. This has since been solved by patching the game's files.
* If ''[[Ace Attorney Investigations 2]]'' detects an illegitimate or downloaded copy of the game, it will convert the entire game's text into the game's symbol based foreign language, Borginian, which cannot be translated in any way.
* The unlicensed version of indie game ''[[Game Dev Tycoon]]'', in which the player runs a game development company, will dramatically increase the piracy rate of the games the player releases to the point where no money can be made at all, and disable the player's ability to take any action against it &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenheartgames.com/2013/04/29/what-happens-when-pirates-play-a-game-development-simulator-and-then-go-bankrupt-because-of-piracy/ |title=What happens when pirates play a game development simulator and then go bankrupt because of piracy? |date=April 29, 2013 |author=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/game-pirates-whine-about-piracy-in-game-dev-simulator-130429/ |title=Game Pirates Whine About Piracy in Game Dev Simulator |author=Ernesto |website=[[TorrentFreak]] |date=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Crytek's ''[[Crysis]]'', if the player uses a naive copy of the game, his bullets are replaced by harmless chickens, making it almost impossible to beat the game without cracking the game.
* In Crytek's ''[[Crysis 3]]'', if a player used an unlicensed copy of the game, he is not able to defeat the last boss (The Alpha Ceph), thus making it impossible to beat the game.
*In an unauthorized copy of ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]'', the player can still play the game normally, but will be unable to exit until he/she is defeated by an animatronic enemy, with frightening noises.

The usage of copy protection payloads which lower playability of a game without making it clear that this is a result of copy protection is now generally considered unwise, due to the potential for it to result in unaware players with unlicensed copies spreading word-of-mouth that a game is of low quality.  The authors of [[FADE]] explicitly acknowledged this as a reason for including the explicit warning message.

== Anti-piracy ==
{{Refimprove|date=October 2009}}
'''Anti-piracy''' measures are efforts to fight against [[copyright infringement]], [[counterfeit]]ing, and other violations of [[intellectual property]] laws.

It includes, but is by no means limited to, the combined efforts of corporate associations (such as the [[RIAA]] and [[MPAA]]), law enforcement agencies (such as the [[FBI]] and [[Interpol]]), and various international governments{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=What is meant by this?}} to combat copyright infringement relating to various types of creative works, such as software, music and films.  These measures often come in the form of copy protection measures such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]], or measures implemented through a [[content protection network]], such as Distil Networks or Incapsula. [[Richard Stallman]] and the [[GNU Project]] have criticized the use of the word "piracy" in these situations, saying that publishers use the word to refer to "copying they don't approve of" and that "they [publishers] imply that it is ethically equivalent to attacking ships on the high seas, kidnapping and murdering the people on them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Certain forms of Anti-Piracy (such as DRM), are considered by consumers to control the use of the products content after [[sales|sale]].

In the case ''MPAA v. Hotfile'', Judge [[Kathleen M. Williams]] granted a motion to deny the prosecution the usage of words she views as "pejorative". This list included the word "piracy", the use of which, the motion by the defense stated, would serve no purpose but to misguide and inflame the jury. The plaintiff argued the common use of the terms when referring to copyright infringement should invalidate the motion, but the Judge did not concur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title = MPAA Banned From Using Piracy and Theft Terms in Hotfile Trial  | accessdate = November 30, 2013

== Anti-piracy in file sharing ==
Today copyright infringement is often facilitated by the use of [[file sharing]]. In fact, infringement accounts for 23.8% of all internet traffic in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boorstin|first=Julia|title=Piracy Rules the Web, Dominating 23.8% of Internet Traffic|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41356625|accessdate=28 May 2013|newspaper=CNBC Media Money|date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to cut down on this, both large and small film and music corporations have issued [[DMCA]] takedown notices, filed lawsuits, and pressed criminal prosecution of those who host these file sharing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=Fox Issues DMCA Takedown To Google Over SF Chronicle Article...

== Other examples ==
* On June 30, 2010, [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) cracked down on many video-hosting websites including [[NinjaVideo]].
* RIAA sues [[file-sharing|file-sharers]] that share music over [[peer-to-peer|P2P]] networks.
* The MPAA encrypts DVD movies using the [[Content Scrambling System|CSS]] cipher, prohibiting the distribution and use of [[DeCSS]], while also having the effect of banning [[free software|free]]/[[open source software|open source]] DVD player software.
* "[[Coded Anti-Piracy]]", also called CAP codes, are utilized to put a [[forensic identification]] on films to trace back any illegal copies of them back to the source.
* ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' and many other computer games require a piece of information from the game's [[jewel case]] for the player to progress after a certain point, making unauthorized copies effectively worthless without the original jewel case; however, in the present day, said information can be easily be found on the Internet.
* [[Microsoft]] removes [[Windows Vista]] and [[Microsoft Office]] from various [[torrent tracker|torrent trackers]].
* Certain SNES games such as ''[[Super Mario All Stars]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' may sometimes show warning screens, usually caused by dirty or damaged cartridges or use of third-party peripherals.
* ''[[Rockman EXE Operate Shooting Star]]'' has anti-copying code that causes every step the player takes to reveal an enemy, also in an unauthorized copy.
* In ''[[Mirror's Edge]]'', during the game, the player's character starts to slow down making it impossible to jump over ledges and proceed further in the game.
* ''[[Classic NES Series]]'' features a "mirroring". If a Classic NES Series game is emulated or the cart doesn't feature "mirroring", the player will fall victim to copy protection. For example, in "Classic NES Series - Castlevania", the player becomes unable to move the character at all.

The '''''Cáin Adomnáin''''' (Law of Adomnán), also known as the ''Lex Innocentium'' (Law of Innocents), was promulgated amongst a gathering of [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Dál Riata]]n and [[Picts|Pictish]] notables at the [[Synod of Birr]] in [[697 in Ireland|697]]. It is named after its initiator [[Adomnán of Iona]], ninth [[Abbot of Iona]] after St. [[Columba]]. It is called the "Geneva Accords" of the ancient Irish, for its protection of women and non-combatants, extending the Law of Patrick, which protected monks, to civilians. The legal symposium at the Synod of Birr was prompted when Adomnáin had an [[aisling]] dream vision wherein his mother excoriated him for not protecting the women and children of Ireland.

==History==
During almost two centuries, and more precisely the years 697-887, nine different ordinances were promulgated and kept in the record of the annals of Ireland. Each ordinance was issued either by a saint or monastic group. Three texts of these legislations have come to us, the earliest being Cáin Adomnáin - Lex Innocentium - proclaimed by Adomnán, abbot of Iona, at the synod of Birr in 697.&lt;ref&gt; Máirín Ní Dhonnchadha, The guarantor list of Cáin Adomnáin, 697; pp. 178-215, Brepols Online, [https://doi.org/10.1484/J.Peri.3.600]. &lt;/ref&gt;

According to D.N. Dumville, it is suspected that the promulgation of this law in 697 was a centennial commemoration of Columba, who died in 597.&lt;ref name=Dumville&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/catholic_historical_review/v089/89.2dumville.html Dumville, D.N., "Review" of O'Loughlin's ''Adomnan at Birr, AD 697: Essays in Commemoration of the Law of the Innocents'' in the ''Catholic Historical Review'', pp. 283-284, Volume 89, Number 2, April 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; As a successor of Columba of Iona, Adomnán had sufficient prestige to assemble a conference of 91 chieftains and clerics from Ireland, Dál Riata, and Pictland at Birr to promulgate the new law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://birrhistsoc.com/Hist.htm#cain "Cain Adomnan", Birr Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being the site of a significant monastery, associated with Saint [[Brendan of Birr]], Birr was close to the boundary between the [[Uí Néill]]-dominated northern half of Ireland, and the southern half, where the [[kings of Munster]] ruled. It, therefore, represented a form of neutral ground where the rival kings and clerics of both sides of Ireland could meet.

Various factors, including [[Marian devotion]] in seventh- and eighth-century Ireland,&lt;ref name=Dumville/&gt; are supposed to have contributed to inspire Adomnán to introduce these laws, but it may also be that as [[Columba]]'s biographer, he was prompted by the saint's example.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Adomnán, ''Life'', II, 24 and II, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally known as the ''Law of the Innocents'' and focused on the beneficiary noncombatants. Upon its renewal in 727, it referenced its author.&lt;ref name=Charles&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g6yq2sKLlFkC&amp;pg=PA567&amp;lpg=PA567&amp;dq=C%C3%A1in+Adomn%C3%A1in&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tx7qpqFhc_&amp;sig=2bA_MTxOn8DKNvLE7Z4o32HvoWA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o2HdU7CHIde0yATDroFw&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=C%C3%A1in%20Domnaig&amp;f=false Charles-Edwards, T.M., ''Early Christian Ireland'', p.560, Cambridge University Press, 2000] {{ISBN|9780521363952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The indigenous [[Brehon Laws]] were committed to parchment about the 7th century, most likely by clerics. Most scholars now believe that the secular laws were not compiled independently of monasteries. Adomnan would have had access to the best legal minds of his generation.&lt;ref name=Grigg/&gt;

This set of laws were designed, among other things, to guarantee the safety and immunity of various types of noncombatants in warfare.&lt;ref name=foghlam&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/britonsgaelsvikings/lawoftheinnocents/index.asp "Law of the Innocents", Foghlam Alba]&lt;/ref&gt; It required, for example, that "whoever slays a woman... his right hand and his left foot shall be cut off before death, and then he shall die."

If a woman committed murder, arson, or theft from a church, she was to be set adrift in a boat with one paddle and a container of gruel. This left the judgment up to God and avoided violating the proscription against killing a woman.&lt;ref name=Grigg/&gt;

The laws also provided sanctions against many things like the killing of children, clerics, clerical students and peasants on clerical lands; rape; impugning the chastity of a noblewoman and women from having to take part in warfare. Much repeated traditional Irish laws.

The law described both the secular fines which criminals must pay and the ritual curses to which lawbreakers were subject. Bystanders who did nothing to prevent the crime were as liable as the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=Grigg&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/5817305/Aspects_of_the_Cain_Adomnans_Lex_Innocentium Grigg, Julianna. "Aspects of the Cain: Adomnan's Lex Innocentium", ''Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association'', Vol.1, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; "Stewards of the Law" collected the fine and paid it to the victim or next of kin.&lt;ref name=Charles/&gt;

==Legacy==
Adomnán's initiative appears to be one of the first systematic attempts to lessen the savagery of warfare among Christians, a remarkable achievement for a churchman on the remote outer edge of Europe. In it, he gave local expression, in the context of the Gaelic legal tradition, to a wider Christian movement to restrain violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travels-in-time.net/e/scotland12arteng.htm "Adomnán's Law of the Innocents",''Travels in Time'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It was an early example of international law in that it was to be enforced in Ériu and Albu, (Ireland and Britain) although Britain refers to only what is now northern Scotland for it was the kings of that region who were guarantors of the Law.&lt;ref name=Dumville/&gt;

As with later clerical efforts, such as the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movement in millennial [[France]], the law may have been of limited effectiveness. [[Fergus Kelly]] notes that no cases relating to the Cáin Adomnáin have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is unknown whether the harsh penalties which it mandates, which may have contradicted the general character of Irish law, were rigidly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, pp.234&amp;ndash;235: "the law texts of the ''Senchas Már'' collection consistently favour reparation by payment rather than the death penalty for murder and other serious offences (by either sex)."&lt;/ref&gt;

There are annalistic examples of the justice of the Cáin Adomnáin being applied, such as here by [[Northern Uí Néill|Cenél nEógain]] High King [[Niall Glúndub]], for whom the [[O'Neill Clan]] of [[Ulster]] are named.

* ''In 907 the sanctuary of [[Ard Macha]] was violated by [[Cearnachan mac Duilgen]] who took a captive from the church and drowned him in [[Lough Cier]] nearby.''
* ''This perpetrator was taken by Nial Glundub mac Aedha, Righ an Tuaisceirt, having replaced his brother Domnall as king of the north, and he drowned Cearnachan in the same lake Lough Cier in revenge for the violation of [[Saint Patrick|Padraicc]].''

'''Do Not Resuscitate''' ('''DNR'''), also known as '''no code''' or '''allow natural death''', is a legal order written either in the hospital or on a legal form to withhold [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) or [[advanced cardiac life support]] (ACLS), in respect of the wishes of a patient in case their [[Asystole|heart were to stop]] or they were to [[Apnea|stop breathing]]. The DNR request is usually made by the patient or health care [[power of attorney]] and allows the medical teams taking care of them to respect their wishes. In the health care community, [[allow natural death]] (AND) is a term that is quickly gaining favor as it focuses on what is being done, not what is being avoided.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Some criticize the term "do not resuscitate" because of the implication of important treatment being withheld, while research shows that only about 5% of patients who require CPR outside the hospital and only 15% of patients who require CPR while in the hospital survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17174021 | doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2006.06.135 | volume=72 | issue=3 | title=Epidemiology and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Rochester, New York | date=March 2007 | author=Fairbanks RJ, Shah MN, Lerner EB, Ilangovan K, Pennington EC, Schneider SM | journal=Resuscitation | pages=415–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 10888971 | volume=160 | issue=13 | title=Short- and long-term survival after cardiopulmonary resuscitation |date=July 2000 |vauthors=Zoch TW, Desbiens NA, DeStefano F, Stueland DT, Layde PM | journal=Arch.

A DNR does not affect any treatment other than that which would require [[tracheal intubation|intubation]] or [[CPR]]. Patients who are DNR can continue to get chemotherapy, antibiotics, dialysis, or any other appropriate treatments.
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Terminology ==
''DNR'' and ''Do Not Resuscitate'' are common terms in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This may be clarified in some regions with the addition of ''DNI'' (Do Not Intubate), although in some hospitals ''DNR'' alone will imply no [[tracheal intubation|intubation]]. Clinically, the vast majority of people requiring resuscitation will require intubation, making a DNI alone problematic. Hospitals sometimes use the expression ''no code'', which refers to the jargon term ''code'', short for ''[[Hospital emergency codes#Code Blue|Code Blue]]'', an alert a hospital's resuscitation team.

Some areas of the United States and the United Kingdom include the letter A, as in ''DNAR'', to clarify "Do Not ''Attempt'' Resuscitation." This alteration is so that it is not presumed by the patient or family that an attempt at resuscitation will be successful. Since the term DNR implies the omission of action, and therefore "giving up", some have advocated for these orders to be retermed ''Allow Natural Death''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hospicepatients.org/and.html Alternative to "DNR" Designation: "Allow Natural Death" - Making Sense in the Health Care Industry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand and Australia, and some hospitals in the UK, use the term ''NFR'' or ''Not For Resuscitation''. Typically these abbreviations are not punctuated, e.g., ''DNR'' rather than ''D.N.R.''

Resuscitation orders, or lack thereof, can also be referred to in the United States as a part of [[Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment|Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST)]] or [[Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment|Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST)]] orders&lt;ref&gt;Pollak, Andrew.  ''Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured''.  Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2017, isbn 978-1-284-10690-9, Page 540.&lt;/ref&gt;, typically created with input from next of kin when the patient or client is not able to communicate their wishes.

Another synonymous term is "''not to be resuscitated''" (''NTBR'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vincent JL, Van Vooren JP | date = Dec 2002 | title = [NTBR (Not to Be Resuscitated) in 10 questions] | url = | journal = Rev Med Brux. | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 497–9 | pmid = 12584945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently in the UK it was common to write "Not for 222" or conversationally, "Not for twos." This was implicitly a hospital DNR order, where 222 (or similar) is the hospital telephone number for the emergency resuscitation or crash team.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Advance directive and living will==
[[Advance directives]] and [[living wills]] are documents written by individuals themselves, so as to state their wishes for care, if they are no longer able to speak for themselves. In contrast, it is a physician or hospital staff member who writes a DNR "physician's order," based upon the wishes previously expressed by the individual in his or her advance directive or living will. Similarly, at a time when the individual is unable to express his wishes, but has previously used an advance directive to appoint an agent, then a physician can write such a DNR "physician's order" at the request of that individual's agent. These various situations are clearly enumerated in the "sample" DNR order presented on this page.

It should be stressed that, in the United States, an advance directive or living will is not sufficient to ensure a patient is treated under the DNR protocol, even if it is their wish, as neither an advance directive nor a living will is a legally binding document.

== Ethics ==
DNR orders in certain situations have been subject to ethical debate. In many institutions it is customary for a patient going to surgery to have their DNR automatically rescinded. Though the rationale for this may be valid, as outcomes from [[CPR]] in the operating room are substantially better than general survival outcomes after CPR, the impact on patient autonomy has been debated. It is suggested that facilities engage patients or their decision makers in a  'reconsideration of DNR orders' instead of automatically making a forced decision.&lt;ref&gt;Dugan D, Riseman J. Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders in an Operating Room Setting #292. Journal of Palliative Medicine [serial online]. July 2015;18(7):638-639.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is accumulating evidence of a racial bias in DNR adoption. A 2014 study of end stage cancer patients found that non-Latino white patients were significantly more likely to have a DNR order (45%) than black (25%) and Latino (20%) patients. The correlation between preferences against life-prolonging care and the increased likelihood of advance care planning is consistent across ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Garrido M, Harrington S, Prigerson H. End-of-life treatment preferences: A key to reducing ethnic/racial disparities in advance care planning?. Cancer (0008543X) [serial online]. December 15, 2014;120(24):3981-3986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical dilemmas occur when a patient with a DNR attempts suicide and the necessary treatment involves ventilation or CPR. In these cases it has been argued that the principle of beneficence takes precedence over patient autonomy and the DNR can be revoked by the physician.&lt;ref&gt;Humble M. Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders and Suicide Attempts. National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly [serial online]. Winter2014 2014;14(4):661-671.&lt;/ref&gt; Another dilemma occurs when a medical error happens to a patient with a DNR. If the error is reversible only with CPR or ventilation there is no consensus if resuscitation should take place or not.&lt;ref&gt;Hébert P, Selby D. Should a reversible, but lethal, incident not be treated when a patient has a do-not-resuscitate order?. CMAJ: Canadian Medical Association Journal [serial online]. April 15, 2014;186(7):528-530.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also ethical concerns around how patients reach the decision to make themselves a DNR. One study found that when questioned in more detail, many patients who were DNR actually would have wanted the excluded interventions depending on the scenario. Most would prefer life saving intubation in the scenario of [[angioedema]] which typically resolves in days. One fifth of the DNR patients would want resuscitation for [[cardiac arrest]] but to have care withdrawn after a week. It is possible that providers are having a "leading conversation" with patients or mistakenly leaving crucial information out when discussing DNR.&lt;ref&gt;Capone R. PROBLEMS WITH DNR AND DNI ORDERS. (Cover story). Ethics &amp; Medics [serial online]. March 2014;39(3):1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; One study reported that physicians repeatedly give high intensity care to patients while deciding they themselves would be DNR under similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians provide high-intensity end-of-life care for patients, but "no code" for themselves.
Medical Ethics Advisor Volume: 30 Issue 10 (2014) {{ISSN|0886-0653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the ethical issue of discontinuation of an [[implantable cardioverter defibrillator]] (ICD) in DNR patients in cases of medical futility. A large survey of [[Electrophysiology]] practitioners, the heart specialists who implant [[pacemakers]] and ICD's noted that the practitioners felt that deactivating an ICD was not ethically distinct from withholding CPR thus consistent with DNR. Most felt that deactivating a pacemaker was a separate issue and could not be broadly ethically endorsed. Pacemakers were felt to be unique devices, or ethically taking a role of "keeping a patient alive" like [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Daeschler M, Verdino RJ, Caplan AL, Kirkpatrick JN | year = 2015 | title = Defibrillator Deactivation against a Patient's Wishes: Perspectives of Electrophysiology Practitioners | url = | journal = Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology | volume = 38 | issue = 8| pages = 917–924 | doi = 10.1111/pace.12614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage by country==
DNR documents are widespread in some countries and unavailable in others. In countries where a DNR is unavailable the decision to end resuscitation is made solely by physicians.

=== Middle East ===
DNRs are not recognized by [[Jordan]]. Physicians attempt to resuscitate all patients regardless of individual or familial wishes.&lt;ref name="The Globe and Mail "&gt;{{cite news |title = Mideast med-school camp: divided by conflict, united by profession

In [[Israel]], it is possible to sign a DNR form as long as the patient is dying and aware of their actions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

=== United Kingdom ===
[[File:Scotland DNACPR - obverse.png|thumbnail|DNACPR form as used in Scotland]]

==== England and Wales ====
In [[England and Wales]], CPR is presumed in the event of a [[cardiac arrest]] unless a ''do not resuscitate'' order is in place. If they have capacity as defined under the [[Mental Capacity Act 2005]] the patient may decline resuscitation, however any discussion is not in reference to consent to resuscitation and instead should be an explanation.&lt;ref name="Resus Council Consent."&gt;{{cite web|title=Decisions relating to cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A joint statement from the British Medical Association, the Resuscitation Council (UK) and the Royal College of Nursing|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/dnar.pdf|website=Resus.org.uk|publisher=Resuscitation Council (UK)|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients may also specify their wishes and/or devolve their decision-making to a proxy using an [[advance directive]], which are commonly referred to as '[[Living Wills]]'. Patients and relatives cannot demand treatment (including CPR) which the doctor believes is futile and in this situation, it is their doctor's duty to act in their 'best interest', whether that means continuing or discontinuing treatment, using their clinical judgment. If they lack capacity relatives will often be asked for their opinion out of [[respect]].

==== Scotland ====
In [[Scotland]], the terminology used is "Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation" or "DNACPR". There is a single policy used across all of [[NHS Scotland]]. The legal standing is similar to that in England and Wales, in that CPR is viewed as a treatment and, although there is a general presumption that CPR will be performed in the case of cardiac arrest, this is not the case if it is viewed by the treating [[clinician]] to be futile. Patients and families cannot demand CPR to be performed if it is felt to be futile (as with any medical treatment) and a DNACPR can be issued despite disagreement, although it is good practice to involve all parties in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR): Integrated Adult Policy|author=Scottish Government|publisher=NHS Scotland|date=May 2010|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/312784/0098903.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States the documentation is especially complicated in that each state accepts different forms, and [[advance directives]] and [[living wills]] may not be accepted by [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] as legally valid forms. If a patient has a living will that specifies the patient requests of DNR but does not have a properly filled out state-sponsored form that is co-signed by a physician, EMS may attempt resuscitation.

The DNR decision by patients was first litigated in 1976 in [[In re Quinlan]]. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the right of Karen Ann Quinlan's parents to order her removal from [[artificial ventilation]]. In 1991 Congress passed into law the [[Patient Self-Determination Act]] that mandated hospitals honor an individual's decision in their healthcare.&lt;ref name="The continuing ethical dilemma of the do-not-resuscitate order "&gt;{{cite news |title = The continuing ethical dilemma of the do-not-resuscitate order |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FSL/is_n4_v67/ai_20972811/ |accessdate = 2009-08-23 |date = April 1998 |work = AORN Journal |quote = The right to refuse or terminate medical treatment began evolving in 1976 with the case of Karen Ann Quinlan v New Jersey (70NJ10, 355 A2d, 647 [NJ 1976]). This spawned subsequent cases leading to the use of the DNR order.(4) In 1991, the Patient Self-Determination Act mandated hospitals ensure that a patient's right to make personal health care decisions is upheld. According to the act, a patient has the right to refuse treatment, as well as the right to refuse resuscitative measures.(5) This right usually is accomplished by the use of the DNR order. | first=Evelyn | last=Eckberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-nine states currently permit the next of kin to make medical decisions of incapacitated relatives, the exception being [[Missouri]].  Missouri has a Living Will Statute that requires two witnesses to any signed advance directive that results in a DNR/DNI code status in the hospital.

In the United States, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[advanced cardiac life support]] (ACLS) will not be performed if a valid written "DNR" order is present. Many states do not recognize [[living wills]] or [[health care proxy|health care proxies]] in the prehospital setting and prehospital personnel in those areas may be required to initiate resuscitation measures unless a specific state-sponsored form is properly filled out and cosigned by a physician.&lt;ref name="DO NOT RESUSCITATE – ADVANCE DIRECTIVES FOR EMS

===Canada===

Do not resuscitate orders are similar to those used in the United States. In 1995, the [[Canadian Medical Association]], [[Canadian Hospital Association]], [[Canadian Nursing Association]], and [[Catholic Health Association of Canada]] worked with [[Canadian Bar Association]] clarify and create a '''Joint Statement on Resuscitative Interventions''' guideline for use to determine when and how DNR orders are assigned.&lt;ref name="caringtotheend.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caringtotheend.ca/body.php?id%3D515%26cc%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715000749/http://www.caringtotheend.ca/body.php?id=515&amp;cc=1 |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNR orders must be discussed by doctors with the patient or patient agents or patient's significant others. Unilateral DNR by medical professionals can only be used if the patient is in a vegetative state.&lt;ref name="caringtotheend.ca"/&gt;

===Australia===

In Australia, Do Not Resuscitate orders are covered by legislation on a state-by-state basis.

In Victoria, a Refusal of Medical Treatment certificate is a legal means to refuse medical treatments of current medical conditions.  It does not apply to palliative care (reasonable pain relief; food and drink).  An Advanced Care Directive legally defines the medical treatments that a person may choose to receive (or not to receive) in various defined circumstances.  It can be used to refuse resuscitation, so as avoid needless suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dwdv.org.au/resources/dwdv-forms|title=Respect for the right to choose - Resources|publisher= Dying with dignity, Victoria|date=2017|accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In NSW, a Resuscitation Plan is a medically authorised order to use or withhold resuscitation measures, and which documents other aspects of treatment relevant at end of life.  Such plans are only valid for patients of a doctor who is a NSW Health staff member.  The plan allows for the refusal of any and all life-sustaining treatments, the advance refusal for a time of future incapacity, and the decision to move to purely palliative care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/ActivePDSDocuments/PD2014_030.pdf|title=Using resuscitation plans in end of life decisions|publisher=NSW government health department|date=2014-09-08|accessdate=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
DNRs are not recognized by [[Italy]]. Physicians must attempt to resuscitate all patients regardless of individual or familial wishes. Italian laws force healthcare staff to resuscitate a patient even if the patient has a DNR or does not wish to live. There are jail penalties (from 6 to 15 years) for healthcare staff breaching this law, e.g. "omicidio del consenziente".&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Omicidio del consenziente (ordinamento penale italiano)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}} Therefore in [[Italy]] a signed DNR has no legal value.

[[Image:Eastgate Centre, Harare, Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The pink-hued Eastgate Centre, with its distinctive chimneys]]
[[File:Natural_ventilation_high-rise_buildings.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic of the natural ventilation of the building]]
The '''Eastgate Centre''' is a shopping centre and office block in central [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]] whose architect is [[Mick Pearce]]. Designed to be ventilated and cooled by entirely natural means, it was probably the first building in the world to use natural cooling to this level of sophistication. It opened in 1996 on Robert Mugabe Avenue and Second Street, and provides 5,600 m² of retail space, 26,000 m² of office space and parking for 450 cars.

== Designing for thermal control ==

The Eastgate Centre's design is a deliberate move away from the "big glass block". Glass office blocks are typically expensive to maintain at a comfortable temperature, needing substantial heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. They tend to recycle air, in an attempt to keep the expensively conditioned atmosphere inside, leading to high levels of air pollution in the building. Artificial air-conditioning systems are high-maintenance, and Zimbabwe has the additional problem that the original system and most spare parts have to be imported, squandering foreign exchange reserves.

Mick Pearce, the architect, therefore took an alternative approach. Because of its altitude, Harare has a [[temperate]] climate despite being in the tropics, and the typical daily temperature swing is 10 to 14&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Arup&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastgate Development, Harare, Zimbabwe|url=http://www.arup.com/feature.cfm?pageid=292|publisher=Arup|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114141220/http://www.arup.com/feature.cfm?pageid=292|archivedate=14 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes a mechanical or passive cooling system a viable alternative to artificial air-conditioning.

== Passive cooling ==

[[Passive cooling]] works by storing heat in the day and venting it at night as temperatures drop.

* Start of day: the building is cool.
* During day: machines and people generate heat, and the sun shines. Heat is absorbed by the fabric of the building, which has a high [[heat capacity]], so that the temperature inside increases but not greatly.
* Evening: temperatures outside drop. The warm internal air is vented through chimneys, assisted by fans but also rising naturally because it is less dense, and drawing in denser cool air at the bottom of the building.
* Night: this process continues, cold air flowing through cavities in the floor slabs until the building's fabric has reached the ideal temperature to start the next day.

Passively cooled, Eastgate uses only 10% of the energy needed by a similar conventionally cooled building.&lt;ref name="AfP"&gt;Architects for Peace. Profile and excerpt from the [http://www.architectsforpeace.org/mickprofile.php jury report] of the 2003 Prince Claus Award, presented to Mick Pearce on 10 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastgate is emulated by London's [[Portcullis House]] (2001), opposite the [[Palace of Westminster]]. The distinctive giant chimneys on which the system relies are clearly visible.

== Modern use of traditional solutions ==

To work well, the building must be very carefully designed. After computer simulation and analysis, the engineering firm [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup]], gave Pearce a set of rules.
&lt;blockquote&gt;They said that no direct sunlight must fall on the external walls at all and the north façade [direction of summer sun] window-to-wall area must not exceed 25%. They asked for a balance between artificial and external light to minimise energy consumption and heat gain. They said all windows must be sealed because of noise pollution and unpredictable wind pressures and temperatures, relying on ducted ventilation. Above all, windows must be light filters, controlling glare, noise and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Jon | last = Atkinson |date=October 1995 | title = Emulating the Termite | journal = The Zimbabwean Review | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 16–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To help with this last, the windows have adjustable blinds, but Pearce also used deep overhangs to keep direct sun off windows and walls. Deep eaves are a traditional solution in Africa, shading the walls completely from the high summer sun, while allowing the lower winter sun to warm the building in the morning.

Further, passive cooling systems are particularly appropriate for this part of Africa because, long before humans thought of it, passive cooling was being used by the local [[termite]]s. Termite mounds include flues which vent through the top and sides, and the mound itself is designed to catch the breeze. As the wind blows, hot air from the main chambers below ground is drawn out of the structure, helped by termites opening or blocking tunnels to control air flow.

Pearce's practice is in Harare, and he specialises in buildings which are low cost, low maintenance, and have low environmental impact. His projects try to make best use of locally available resources, and include Harare International School Arts Centre, Harare Hindoo Temple and [[Chinhoyi]] Provincial Hospital, Zimbabwe. In 2003 Pearce was awarded the [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]] for culture and development, for his work on Eastgate.

'''''Eldred v. Ashcroft''''', 537 U.S. 186 (2003), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upholding the [[United States constitutional law|constitutionality]] of the 1998 [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] (CTEA). The practical result of this was to prevent a number of works from entering the [[public domain]] in 1998 and following years, as would have occurred under the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. Materials which the plaintiffs had worked with and were ready to republish were now unavailable due to copyright restrictions.

Internet publisher [[Eric Eldred]] was the lead petitioner, and was joined by a group of commercial and non-commercial interests who relied on the public domain for their work (including [[Dover Publications]]) and a large number of ''[[amicus curiae|amici]]'' including the [[Free Software Foundation]], the [[American Association of Law Libraries]], the [[Bureau of National Affairs]], and the [[College Art Association]]. Eldred was represented by [[Lawrence Lessig]] and a team at the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/10/lessig-3/|title=Lawrence Lessig's Supreme Showdown|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting the law was [[United States Attorney General|United States Attornies General]] [[Janet Reno]] and [[John Ashcroft]], along with a set of ''[[amicus curiae|amici]]'' including the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]].

==Background==
[[Image:Eric Eldred.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Eric Eldred, the lead plaintiff.]]
The [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] (or CTEA) extended existing [[copyright term]]s by an additional 20 years from the terms set by the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]. The law affected both new and existing works (making it both a ''prospective'' extension as well as a ''retroactive'' one). Specifically, for works published before January 1, 1978 and still in copyright on October 27, 1998, the term was extended to 95 years. For works authored by ''individuals'' on or after January 1, 1978 (including new works), the copyright term was extended to equal the life of the author plus 70 years. For works authored by joint authors, the copyright term was extended to the life of the last surviving author plus 70 years. In the case of [[work for hire|works-for-hire]], anonymous or pseudonymous works, the term was set at 95 years from the date of first publication, or 120 years from creation.

The practical result of this was to prevent a number of works from entering the [[public domain]] in 1998 and following years, as would have occurred under the Copyright Law of 1976. Materials which the plaintiffs had worked with and were ready to republish were now unavailable due to copyright restrictions.

The lead petitioner, [[Eric Eldred]], is an [[Internet]] publisher. Eldred was joined by a group of commercial and non-commercial interests who relied on the public domain for their work. These included [[Dover Publications]], a commercial publisher of [[paperback book]]s; [[Luck's Music Library, Inc.]], and [[Edwin F. Kalmus &amp; Co., Inc.]], publishers of orchestral [[sheet music]]; and a large number of ''[[amicus curiae|amici]]'' including the [[Free Software Foundation]], the [[American Association of Law Libraries]], the [[Bureau of National Affairs]], and the [[College Art Association]].

Supporting the law were the [[United States government|U.S. government]], represented by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in an ''[[ex officio]]'' capacity (originally [[Janet Reno]], later replaced by [[John Ashcroft]]), along with a set of ''[[amicus curiae|amici]]'' including the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]].

==District court==
The original complaint was filed in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] on January 11, 1999. The plaintiffs' argument was threefold:

#That by retroactively extending copyright terms, Congress had violated the requirements of the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]]'s [[Copyright Clause]], which gives Congress the following power: &lt;blockquote&gt;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing ''for limited Times'' to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries&lt;/blockquote&gt;Plaintiffs argued that by reading this formulation so as to allow for any number of retroactive extensions, Congress could in practice guarantee an unlimited period of copyright protection, thus thwarting the intent of the clause.
#That any copyright law must be subject to scrutiny under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], thereby ensuring a balance between freedom of speech and the interests of copyright.
#That the doctrine of [[public trust]] requires the government to show a public benefit to any transfer of public property into private hands, and that the CTEA violates this doctrine by withdrawing material from the public domain.

In response, the government argued that Congress does indeed have the latitude to retroactively extend terms, so long as the individual extensions are also for "limited times," as required by the Constitution. As an argument for this position, they referred to the [[Copyright Act of 1790]], the first Federal copyright legislation, which applied Federal protection to existing works. Furthermore, they argued, neither the First Amendment nor the doctrine of public trust is applicable to copyright cases.

On October 28, 1999, Judge [[June Green]] issued a brief opinion rejecting all three of the petitioners' arguments. On the first count, she wrote that Congress had the power to extend terms as it wished, as long as the terms themselves were of limited duration. On the second count, she rejected the notion of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] scrutiny in copyright cases, based on her interpretation of ''[[Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.|Harper and Row Publishers, Inc., v. Nation Enterprises]]'', an earlier Supreme Court decision. On the third count, she rejected the notion that public trust doctrine was applicable to copyright law.

==Court of Appeals==
The plaintiffs appealed the decision of the district court to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], filing their initial [[Brief (law)|brief]] on May 22, 2000, and arguing the case on October 5 of the same year in front of a three-judge panel. Arguments were similar to those made in the district court, except for those regarding the public trust doctrine, which were not included in the appeal.

Instead, the plaintiffs extended their argument on the copyright clause to note that the clause requires [[United States Congress|Congress]] to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts," and argued that retroactive extensions do not directly serve this purpose in the standard ''[[quid pro quo]]'' previously required by the courts.

The case was decided on February 16, 2001. The appeals court upheld the decision of the district court in a 2-1 opinion. In his dissent, Judge [[David Sentelle]] agreed with the plaintiffs that CTEA was indeed unconstitutional based on the "limited Times" requirement. Supreme Court precedent, he argued, held that one must be able to discern an "outer limit" to a limited power; in the case of retrospective copyright extensions, Congress could continue to extend copyright terms indefinitely through a set of limited extensions, thus rendering the "limited times" requirement meaningless.

Following this ruling, plaintiffs petitioned for a rehearing ''[[en banc]]'' (in front of the full panel of nine judges). This petition was rejected, 7&amp;ndash;2, with Judges Sentelle and [[David Tatel]] dissenting.

==Supreme Court==
On October 11, 2001, the plaintiffs filed a petition for [[certiorari]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. On February 19, 2002, the Court granted certiorari, agreeing to hear the case.

Oral arguments were presented on October 9, 2002. Lead counsel for the plaintiff was [[Lawrence Lessig]]; the government's case was argued by [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] [[Theodore Olson]].

Lessig focused the Plaintiffs' brief to emphasize the Copyright clause restriction, as well as the First Amendment argument from the Appeals case. The decision to emphasize the Copyright clause argument was based on both the minority opinion of Judge Sentelle in the appeals court, and on several recent Supreme Court decisions authored by Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]: ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' (1996) and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000).

In both of those decisions, Rehnquist, along with four of the Court's more conservative justices, held Congressional legislation unconstitutional, because that legislation exceeded the limits of the Constitution's Commerce clause. This profound reversal of precedent, Lessig argued, could not be limited to only one of the enumerated powers. If the court felt that it had the power to review legislation under the Commerce clause, Lessig argued, then the Copyright clause deserved similar treatment, or at very least a "principled reason" must be stated for according such treatment to only one of the enumerated powers.

On January 15, 2003, the Court held the CTEA constitutional by a 7&amp;ndash;2 decision. The majority opinion, written by Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], relied heavily on the Copyright Acts of [[Copyright Act of 1790|1790]], [[Copyright Act of 1831|1831]], [[Copyright Act of 1909|1909]], and [[Copyright Act of 1976|1976]] as precedent for retroactive extensions. One of the arguments supporting the act was the life expectancy has significantly increased among the human population since the 18th century, and therefore copyright law needed extending as well. However, the major argument for the act that carried over into the case was that the Constitution specified that Congress only needed to set time limits for copyright, the length of which was left to their discretion. Thus, as long as the limit is not "forever," any limit set by Congress can be deemed constitutional.

A key factor in the CTEA’s passage was a 1993 European Union (EU) directive instructing EU members to establish a baseline copyright term of life plus 70 years and [[Rule of the shorter term|to deny this longer term to the works of any non-EU country whose laws did not secure the same extended term]]. By extending the baseline United States copyright term, Congress sought to ensure that American authors would receive the same copyright protection in Europe as their European counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/search/display.html?terms=copyright&amp;url=/supct/html/01-618.ZS.html |title=Eldred V. Ashcroft |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court declined to address Lessig's contention that ''Lopez'' and ''Morrison'' offered precedent for enforcing the Copyright clause, and instead reiterated the lower court's reasoning that a retroactive term extension '''can''' satisfy the "limited times" provision in the copyright clause, as long as the extension itself is limited instead of perpetual. Furthermore, the Court refused to apply the proportionality standards of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] or the free-speech standards in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to limit Congress's ability to confer copyrights for limited terms.

[[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]] dissented, arguing that the CTEA amounted to a grant of perpetual copyright that undermined public interests. While the constitution  grants Congress power to extend copyright terms in order to "promote the progress of science and useful arts," CTEA granted precedent to continually renew copyright terms making them virtually perpetual. Justice Breyer argued in his dissent that it is highly unlikely any artist will be more inclined to produce work knowing their great-grandchildren will receive royalties. With regard to retroactive copyright extension, he viewed it foolish to apply the government's argument that income received from royalties allows artists to produce more work saying, "How will extension help today’s Noah Webster create new works 50 years after his death?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/eldredd1.pdf |title=Supreme Court Decision on Eldred v Ashcroft - Breyer J., dissenting |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate dissenting opinion, [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]] also challenged the virtue of an individual reward, analyzing it from the perspective of patent law. He argued that the focus on compensation results only in “frustrating the legitimate members of the public who want to make use of it (a completed invention) in a free market.” Further, the compelling need to encourage creation is proportionally diminished once a work is already created. Yet while a formula pairing commercial viability to duration of protection may be said to produce more economically efficient results in respect of high technology inventions with shorter shelf-lives, the same perhaps cannot be said for certain forms of copyrighted works, for which the present value of expenditures relating to creation depend less on scientific equipment and research and development programs and more on unquantifiable creativity.&lt;ref&gt;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/01-618d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig expressed surprise that no decision was authored by Chief Justice Rehnquist or by any of the other four justices who supported the ''Lopez'' or ''Morrison'' decisions. Lessig later expressed regret that he based his argument on precedent rather than attempting to demonstrate that the weakening of the public domain would cause harm to the economic health of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/March-April-2004/story_lessig_marapr04.msp |title=How I Lost The Big One |publisher=Legal Affairs |date=2003-01-15 |accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
Within a year of ''Eldred'', it was serving as decisive precedent. Two cases, ''Luck’s Music Library, Inc. v. Ashcroft and Peters'' and ''Golan v. Ashcroft and Peters'', challenged the constitutionality of the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]] on the grounds that its "restoration amendment," which provided copyright restriction to foreign works that were in the public domain because foreign works were formerly not copyrightable, violated the First Amendment rights of those who would no longer be able to perform the works without observing copyright. The court cited ''Eldred'' and dismissed ''Luck's Music'' on the grounds that the First Amendment did not protect the ability to use others' words as much as it does protect one's ability to use their own. ''Golan v. Ashcroft and Peters''{{'}}s [[Uruguay Round]] portion survived a motion to dismiss even though its own challenge to the Sonny Bono Act did not.&lt;ref name="2004report"&gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |date=2004 |title=Annual Report of the Register of Copyrights |url=https://www.copyright.gov/reports/annual/2004/annual2004.pdf |publisher=United States Copyright Office |page= |access-date=2018-08-22 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That case culminated in ''[[Golan v. Holder]]'', which held that there was nothing in the Constitution preventing the government from taking works out of the public domain.

A 2007 case, ''[[Kahle v. Gonzales]]'', worked from the ''Eldred v. Ashcroft'' opinion to argue that a change in copyright law as drastic as the change from opt-in to opt-out required a review in regard to freedom of speech. The plaintiffs, represented by Lawrence Lessig, argued that the limitations placed on speech and expression by copyright were drastically expanded and possibly too limiting.{{fact|date=August 2018}} The Ninth Circuit determined that the argument was too similar to the one adjudicated in ''Eldred'' and dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN2247399120070122 | work=Reuters | title=U.S. court upholds copyright law on "orphan works" | date=January 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2783">In the field of [[law and economics]], the '''English rule''' (capitalized as '''English Rule''' in some jurisdictions) is a rule controlling assessment of [[attorneys' fees|lawyers' fees]] arising out of [[litigation]]. The English rule provides that the party who loses in court pays the other party's legal costs. The English rule contrasts with the [[American_rule_(attorney's_fees)|American rule]], under which each party is generally responsible to pay its own attorneys' fees, unless a [[statute]] or [[contract]] provides for that assessment. The rationale for the English rule is that a litigant (whether bringing a claim or defending a claim) is entitled to legal representation and, if successful, should not be left out of pocket by reason of his or her own legal fees. It should be borne in mind that, in virtually all English civil litigation, damages are merely compensatory.

Nearly every Western democracy other than the United States follows the English rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointoflaw.com/loserpays/overview.php "Loser Pays"] [[Walter Olson]], pointoflaw.com, accessed March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Capisio |first=Mary V. |date=2002 |title=Awards of Attorneys Fees by Federal Courts, Federal Agencies and Selected Foreign Countries |publisher= Nova Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States jurisdictions==
In the United States the "American rule" is generally followed, each party bearing its own expense of litigation.  Alaska has long been an exception to the U.S. pattern, where the English rule applies.  A very limited version of the English rule was adopted in Texas during the 2011 legislative session that applies only to the filing of a baseless lawsuit.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 91a.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Texas goes English by jettisoning American Rule on legal fees |url=http://blog.civiliansguidetolawyers.com/2011/05/23/texas-goes-english-by-jettisoning-american-rule-on-legal-fees/  |accessdate=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Then Texas governor [[Rick Perry]] called in his state of the state address for a one-way version of the English rule which would apply only to those who initiate a suit, the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Texas May Consider a Bill Forcing Losers in a Suit to Pay Opponents’ Legal Fees |first=Morgan |last=Smith |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/us/11ttloser.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The case began when{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Fiske, a [[Kansas]] resident, proclaimed the preamble of the radical labor union the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That the working class and the employing class have nothing in common, and that there can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of working people and the few who make up the employing class have all the good things of life. Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the earth and the machinery of production and abolish the wage system. Instead of the conservative motto, 'A fair day's wages for a fair day's work,' we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, 'Abolition of the wage system.' By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the [[new society within the shell of the old]].&lt;ref name=Ted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAC/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A Kansas statute defined "[[criminal syndicalism]]" as "the doctrine which advocates crime, physical violence, arson, destruction of property, sabotage, or other unlawful acts or methods, as a means of accomplishing or effecting industrial or political ends, or as a means of effecting industrial or political revolution, or for profit . . ." The law was applied by a state court and was charged if the accused in some fashion held these views and formed a group of followers with a similar intent.  Fiske was tried and convicted of violating this act, and the judgement was upheld in the Supreme Court of Kansas.  He then appealed to the Federal Supreme Court where his case was heard.&lt;ref name=Ted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAC/&gt;

==Trial==
The federal question was whether the Syndicalism Act as applied in this case was repugnant to the [[due process]] clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The state offered no evidence as to the true beliefs and practices of Fiske and his organization. Fiske claimed that his organization in no way sought to bring about industrial change by illegal or criminal means.&lt;ref name=Ted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAC/&gt;

The state of Kansas could prove neither that Fiske had any actual or imminent intent to illegally change the economic structure of the United States nor that he intended to overthrow the US government. Fiske's words were thus protected by the First Amendment and so could not be barred.&lt;ref name=Ted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAC/&gt;

==Decision==
The Syndicalism Act was called "an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the police power of the State." The law, applied as it had, was found to be a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgement of the state court was reversed, and Fiske was found to be not in violation of any law.&lt;ref name=Ted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAC/&gt;

==Importance==
This court decision further solidified the importance of the Due Process Clause by ensuring that the state recognize all the legal rights of a person and prevents the government from violating rights without a justifiable and pressing reason to do so. The case would also reinforce the "[[imminent lawless action]]" clause of ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' in the future as well as other court cases, which ruled that commitment and imminent intent to act upon the plans was needed to convict someone of a similar criminal violation such as in this case. The case was seen as a victory for proponents of a stronger definition of the First Amendment and protected speech.&lt;ref name=Ted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Justia/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAC/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7222">A '''Frankenstein veto''' occurs when an American state [[Governor (United States)|Governor]] selectively deletes words from a bill, stitching together the remainder (''à la'' [[Victor Frankenstein]]) to form a new bill different from that passed by the [[State legislature (United States)|legislature]].

The practice requires that a Governor have (or successfully claim) the power to [[veto]] individual words in a bill passed by the legislature rather than the bill ''in toto''. It became particularly prominent in [[Wisconsin]], where it was used by Governors of both parties "to create spending or to redirect tax funds in ways never approved by the Legislature"&lt;ref name="jsApr208"&gt;Steven Walters. "[http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/29395824.html Voters drive stake into Frankenstein veto: governor may not cut and stitch words]". ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'', April 2, 2008. See also [http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/29335219.html]&lt;/ref&gt; by "string[ing] together pieces of separate sentences to create a single new sentence...."&lt;ref name="jsJun3009"&gt;Steven Walters. "[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/49559377.html Doyle's veto of committee might have been unconstitutional]". ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'', June 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wkow"&gt;"[http://www.wkowtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=10634376 Governor says so-called Frankenstein veto slip-up fixable]". [[WKOW]]-Madison, Wisconsin.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Governor [[Jim Doyle]] used selective deletion to transform "a 272-word section of the Legislature's budget into a 20-word sentence that took $427 million from the transportation budget and gave it to public schools."&lt;ref name="jsApr208" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/2005_frankenstein_veto.pdf This was illustrated by ''The New York Times'' at]&lt;/ref&gt; The same technique was used the following year to raise the levy limits on local governments from 2% to 3.86%.&lt;ref name="jsOct2708"&gt;Patrick Marley, Steven Walters, and Stacy Forster. "[http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/29335304.html Governor gets last word(s): Expansive veto authority enables Doyle to raise limit on local property tax levies]". ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'', October 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'', in response, stated that "no Governor should be allowed to veto all but a couple dozen words and figures across reams of text in state budgets to unilaterally create law from scratch."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-177308730.html Vote 'yes' to ban Crazy Veto: voters on Tuesday can finally ban the 'Frankenstein' veto]". ''Wisconsin State Journal'', March 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the practice "a legislative twist on the game of [[Mad Libs]]."&lt;ref&gt;Monica Davey. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/us/03wisconsin.html Wisconsin Voters Excise Editing From Governor’s Veto Powers]". ''The New York Times'', April 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WISN-TV|WISN]] provided a satirical example of how the Frankenstein veto works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEPZ6a2l4RE Video on WISN's youtube channel]; the Governor's original statement can be found at [http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/journal_media_detail_print.asp?prid=3199&amp;locid=19]&lt;/ref&gt; Start with Governor Doyle's press release on the retirement of [[Brett Favre]]:

{{quote|Governor Jim Doyle released the following statement today regarding the retirement of Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre:

"Like all Packer fans, I was disappointed to hear Brett Favre will not be suiting up in the green and gold next season. It has been a privilege for all of us in Wisconsin to have been able to watch one of the all-time great quarterbacks, one of the greatest all-time athletes, year after year, take the field and lead the Pack. For 16 years, Brett Favre brought fun and excitement to [[Lambeau Field]]. His talent, energy and enthusiasm for the game will be missed.

"I want to thank Brett Favre on behalf of Packer fans everywhere for his commitment to the Packers, Green Bay, and all of Wisconsin."}}

The Frankenstein veto allows that statement to be transformed into this one: "Governor Jim Doyle will be suiting up in the green and gold next season as quarterback of the Packers." The trick is in selective deletion:

{{quote|Governor Jim Doyle &lt;s&gt;released the following statement today regarding the retirement of Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre:

“Like all Packer fans, I was disappointed to hear Brett Favre &lt;/s&gt;will&lt;s&gt; not&lt;/s&gt; be suiting up in the green and gold next season&lt;s&gt;. It h&lt;/s&gt;as&lt;s&gt; been a privilege for all of us in Wisconsin to have been able to watch one of the all-time great &lt;/s&gt;quarterback&lt;s&gt;s, one of the greatest all-time athletes, year after year, take the field and lead the Pack. For 16 years, Brett Favre brought fun and excitement to Lambeau Field. His talent, energy and enthusiasm for the game will be missed.

"I want to thank Brett Favre on behalf &lt;/s&gt;of&lt;s&gt; Packer fans everywhere for his commitment to &lt;/s&gt;the Packers&lt;s&gt;, Green Bay, and all of Wisconsin&lt;/s&gt;."}}

With this tool, and sufficient audacity, "Governors could basically 'veto' into law just about anything they wanted."&lt;ref&gt;Scott Milfred. "[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/189872365.html Monster-of-an-editorial crusade abolishes 'Frankenstein' veto: persistence, creativity a powerful combination]". ''The Masthead'', Winter 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisconsin had previously eliminated an even more extreme version—dubbed the "[[Vanna White]] veto"—in 1990 "when they prohibited state leaders from deleting individual alphabetic letters and numerical characters in a bill to change the intent of the legislation"&lt;ref name="stateline"&gt;Daniel Vock. "[http://www.stateline.org/live/details/story?contentId=201710 Govs enjoy quirky veto power]". ''Stateline'', April 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in response to its controversial use by then-Governor [[Tommy Thompson]].&lt;ref name="jsNov607"&gt;Steve Schultze. "[http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/31964344.html Walker won't play Frankenstein]". ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'', November 6, 2007. An illustration of the outer limits of the Vanna White veto can be seen [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630162520/http://www.wisdc.org/frankenstein-veto-testimony.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment to the [[Wisconsin Constitution]] passed in 2008 sought to curb the practice even further,&lt;ref name="jsApr208" /&gt; but its prohibition on "crossing out words and numbers to create a new sentence from two or more sentences" left intact the Governor's power to "cross out words within a sentence to change its meaning, remove individual digits to create new numbers or delete entire sentences from paragraphs."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2008/04/02/wisconsin-voters-approve-limits-on-governors-frankenstein-veto Wisconsin Voters Approve Limits on Governor's Frankenstein Veto]". Associated Press, April 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This loophole has allowed the practice to continue, albeit less frequently.&lt;ref name="jsJun3009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wkow" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24932">The '''JNR dismissal lawsuit''' is a lawsuit that resulted from the privatization of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) in 1987, and its breakup into the seven [[Japan Railways Group]] companies. In March 1990, 1,047 mostly [[Labor unions in Japan|union]] workers were laid off, 966 of whom were from the [[National Railway Workers' Union]] (Kokuro),&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn19980528a4.html Court nullifies JR rehiring order May 28, 1998] Retrieved on July 26, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; and two decades of lawsuits followed. The dispute was eventually settled in June 2010 for 20 billion yen, or about 22 million yen per worker for 904 plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100629a5.html Top court settles 23-year JNR unionist suit June 29, 2010] Retrieved on July 26, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Plans for privatization===
JNR, organized as a public corporation in 1949, had become unprofitable over subsequent decades.&lt;ref&gt; Japan Railway and Transport Review [http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr08/f04_nak.html Privatization and Beyond: The JR Case] Retrieved on July 25, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)| Liberal Democratic Party]] government of prime minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] decided to privatize the organization.&lt;ref&gt; Zenroren website [http://www.zenroren.gr.jp/jp/english/2010/07/english100706_02.html Statement on the legal settlement of 23 year lawsuit over Japan Railway Company’s discrimination in employment against members of particular unions June 29, 2010] Retrieved on July 25, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; Around this time other government bodies were also either wholly or partially privatized, such as [[Japan Tobacco]]&lt;ref&gt; Japan Tobacco website [http://www.jt.com/about/outline/history/index.html History of JT] Retrieved on July 25, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt; NTT website [http://www.ntt.com/aboutus_e/history/ History] Retrieved on July 25, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Unionization of JNR workers===
The 326,000 workforce of JNR was highly unionized, with workers represented by a number of unions. By far the largest union was the [[National Railway Workers' Union]] (Kokuro), with 200,000 members. [[National Railway Motive Power Union]] (Doro), which had split off from Kokuro in 1951, had 38,000 members. Zendoro, which had been expelled from Doro in 1974, had 3,000 members.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Doro-Chiba]], which broke off from Doro in 1979, had 1,100 members.&lt;ref&gt; Time magazine [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1074844,00.html Japan: Paralysis on the Tracks] Retrieved August 15 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 28 1985 strike===
[[Doro-Chiba]] staged a 24-hour strike on November 28, 1985, to protest against the plans to privatize JNR and lay off workers. The government strongly condemned the strike, as government workers in Japan are forbidden to strike. In addition there were a number of acts of sabotage and vandalism that stranded 10 million commuters in Tokyo and 200,000 in Osaka. The 24-hour strike caused 135 trains between Tokyo and Chiba prefecture to be cancelled, and JNR's management decided to fire more than 100 workers for staging the illegal walkout.&lt;ref&gt; Associated Press website [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Two-Railway-Employees-Among-48-Arrested-on-Sabotage-Charges/id-e9b0ac434ce2b6d8df2b354273855804 Two Railway Employees Among 48 Arrested on Sabotage Charges December 5, 1985] Retrieved on August 15, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Middle Core Faction November 28 1985 sabotage===
In addition to the Doro-Chiba strike, a substantial amount of sabotage was done by the then-1,300 member strong radical leftist group [[Japan Revolutionary Communist League, National Committee (Middle Core Faction)|Middle Core Faction]], who claimed responsibility and said their actions were to support Doro-Chiba's strike.&lt;ref&gt; Associated Press website [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Two-Railway-Employees-Among-48-Arrested-on-Sabotage-Charges/id-e9b0ac434ce2b6d8df2b354273855804 Two Railway Employees Among 48 Arrested on Sabotage Charges December 5, 1985] Retrieved on August 15, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; Communications lines were cut, fires were set at 27 locations in seven prefectures, and heavy damage was done to [[Asakusabashi Station]] in Tokyo around 7 a.m. by masked figures wearing helmets and throwing firebombs. No injuries were reported. Police raided offices of the Middle Core Faction and Doro-Chiba, and damage to bullet trail lines near Hiroshima that delayed trains between Tokyo and Kyushu appeared to have been caused by a time bomb&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press website [http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Sabotage-Paralyzes-Tokyo-Rail-Network/id-a21ed1776a429ebab7ae6b63f18db38eSabotage Paralyzes Tokyo Rail Network. November 29 1985] Retrieved on August 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and by noon 48 people were arrested, including leaders of the Middle Core Faction. Representatives of the larger Kokuro and Zendoro unions representing JNR workers condemned the "anti-social" attacks and apologized to commuters.&lt;ref&gt;The LA Times [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-29/news/mn-4958_1_rail-lines Millions Stalled as Japanese Radicals Sabotage Government-Owned Rail Lines] Retrieved on August 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to sources inside the labor movement, Doro-Chiba was controlled by the Middle Core Faction.&lt;ref&gt; Christian Science Monitor [http://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1202/otrain.html Rail attack shakes Japan unions.

There was substantial pressure on union members to leave their unions, and within a year, Kokuro's membership fell from 200,000 to 44,000. Workers who had supported the privatization, or those who left Kokuro, were hired at substantially higher rates than Kokuro members.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100304a9.html 'Unfair' '87 dismissal of JNR unionists slammed March 4, 2010] Retrieved on August 2, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

Around 7,600 workers were transferred in this way, and around 2,000 of them were hired by JR firms, and 3,000 found work elsewhere. Mitomu Yamaguchi, a former JNR employee from Tosu in Saga prefecture who had been transferred to the JNR Settlement Corporation, later stated that their help in finding work consisted of giving him photocopies of recruitment ads from newspapers.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20031223a2.html Top court rules against ex-JNR workers December 23, 2003] Retrieved on August 6, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal, administrative, and political campaign for rehiring==
===Labor Commission cases===
In 1987, the [[Labour Relations Commission (Japan)|Central Labor Relations Commission]] in Tokyo ruled that the [[JR Group]] had to either rehire or compensate workers who were not hired when JNR was privatized. The Labor Commission ruled that it was an [[Unfair Labor Practice (Japan)|Unfair Labor Practice]] as the members of Kokuro had been targeted, and anti-union discrimination is illegal under article seven of Japan's [[Trade Union Act of 1949|Trade Union Act]]. It also ruled that the JR Group companies, not the defunct JNR, were responsible.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn19980528a4.html Court nullifies JR rehiring order May 28, 1998] Retrieved on July 26, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

A group of 23 petitions filed after 1991 alleged that 1,800 union members in six prefectures had been discriminated against in violation of article seven of the [[Trade Union Act of 1949]]. Local labor relations commissions recognized discrimination in three prefectures, (Kanagawa, Tokyo, and Akita) and an order for redress was issued. The company appealed this to the Central Labour Relations Commission in Tokyo. The Central Labour Relations Commission brokered a deal, and in 2005, Kokuro withdrew the 23 cases claiming anti-union discrimination against its members. In return, the company paid compensation estimated at 360 million yen.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20051109a6.html JR East settles Kokuro wage discrimination row November 9, 2005] Retrieved on August 2, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

From 1987 to 2006, Kokuro filed 340 complaints with various [[Labour Relations Commission (Japan)|labor relations commissions]], mostly related to the dismissal of the 1,047 JNR workers. In November 2006 the union and JR East struck an agreement to settle 61 related to discrimination against union members employed by JR. Kokuro agreed to withdraw the labor commission cases, and JR East agreed to pay compensation. This was considered to be a major step forward in reconciling Kokuro to JR.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20061030a2.html JR East, Kokuro strike blanket deal October 30, 2006] Retrieved on August 2, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuits===
The post-privatization dismissals resulted in a number of lawsuits. In 1994 and 1995, six JR Group companies brought lawsuits in the [[Tokyo District Court]] over the 1987 Labor Relations Commission ruling that the JR group was responsible for the non-hiring and that unfair labor practices had been committed. On May 28, 1998, rulings were handed down. In the case bought by the Honshu carriers, presiding Judge Saburo Takase said that while JR companies were responsible for selecting personnel to start up their new entities, they were not obligated to compensate unhired JNR workers. He said that if there were unfair labor practices were committed in choosing employees, the JR companies are responsible, but the labor commission should only order the firms to repeat their employment process, not to rehire the workers. He said an order to rehire unionists was illegal.

Presiding Judge Yasushige Hagio, ruling on the Hokkaido and Kyushu carriers' case, said that the JR Group companies were not responsible for personnel decisions following the JNR privatization, so he nullified the commission's order.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn19980528a4.html Court nullifies JR rehiring order May 28, 1998] Retrieved on July 26, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Labor Relations Commission appealed and in December 2003, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal requesting that the former JNR employees in the labor unions that opposed the JNR privatization in 1987 be hired by the private Japan Railway companies that succeeded JNR.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20061130b1.html Kokuro threatens lawsuit over JNR privatization row November 30, 2006] Retrieved on July 31, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

The first petty bench of the Supreme Court gave a split decision. Presiding Justice Takehisa Fukazawa and Justice Niro Shimada said the JR firms bear this responsibility as employers and said the case should be sent back to the Tokyo High Court. However, the three other justices disagreed and stated that JR bore no responsibility for any unfair labor practices that may have been committed.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20031223a2.html Top court rules against ex-JNR workers December 23, 2003] Retrieved on August 6, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

In another case, of 283 plaintiffs in September 2005, the Tokyo District Court ruled that JNR had discriminated against union employees when recruiting for positions at the new JR companies.
It was the first time a court had recognized [[Unfair Labor Practice (Japan)|unfair labor practices]] by the now-defunct JNR or its affiliates and ordered compensation over the JR firms' refusal to hire JNR employees. Presiding judge Koichi Nanba ruled that the [[Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency]] should pay ¥5 million to each of the plaintiffs. Despite ruling that they had been discriminated against, he didn't order their re-hiring, stating that "There were reasonable causes for dismissal."&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20050916a1.html Damages awarded over nonhiring of JNR unionists September 16, 2005] Retrieved on August 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20061130b1.html Kokuro threatens lawsuit over JNR privatization row November 30, 2006] Retrieved on July 31, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2006, at the Tokyo District Court, more than 500 Kokuro members, the union itself, and relatives of workers who died since the privatization planned to launch a 30 million yen damages lawsuit over the refusal to rehire the workers, making a total of 540 plaintiffs suing the [[Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency]]. Kokuro sought compensation for the loss of union fees incurred when the JR companies did not hire the union members, but this was intended as leverage to encourage political parties to intervene and for the agency to settle the labor dispute. A Kokuro official stated: "This suit is for securing an option to solve problems through the court before the statute of limitations expires. We will consider dropping the suit when a political solution becomes feasible."&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20061130b1.html Kokuro threatens lawsuit over JNR privatization row November 30, 2006] Retrieved on July 31, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2008, the Tokyo District Court turned down a case filed by 32 union members and three relatives of a deceased member which had been filed in November 2004. Judge Shigeru Nakanishi said the statute of limitations had expired, regardless of whether or not [[Unfair Labor Practice (Japan)|unfair labor practices]] had occurred. He did not state an opinion on whether or not such discrimination had occurred.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20080314a2.html JNR unionists' suit over lost jobs foiled by statute March 14, 2008] Retrieved on July 31, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

===First attempted political settlement===
In 2000, the ruling political bloc at the time (the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], [[New Komeito]], and the now-defunct [[New Conservative Party]] suggested a compromise where the lawsuits would be dropped in return for urging the JR groups to rehire the workers in return for Kokuro acknowledging that JR had no responsibility for originally failing to employ them. The opposition [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]] functioned as an intermediary between the union and the ruling parties. the Social Democratic Party is affiliated to the [[National Trade Union Council (Japan)|National Trade Union Council (Zenrokyo)]], the trade union confederation that Kokuro belongs to. In January 2001, Kokuro voted to accept the plan, but there were various factions within the union with different viewpoints. In 2002, with the ruling block threatening to withdraw the deal, Kokuro voted again to withdraw their lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20020528a4.html Kokuro to drop lawsuits against Japan Railways May 28, 2002] Retrieved on July 26, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, the three ruling parties withdrew from the agreement. Kokuro had agreed to it but did not expel members who refused to accept it and had launched a separate lawsuit against the [[JNR Settlement Corporation]] in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20021130b6.html Ruling parties to pull out of JNR accord November 30, 2002] Retrieved on August 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Labour Organization view===
Kokuro and Zendoro bought the case to the [[International Labour Organization]], claiming anti-union discrimination and that this violated the right to organize as stipulated in the ILO Convention No. 98 concerning freedom of association. They brought the case to the ILO Committee on the Freedom of Association for settlement. The committee wrote a report which was then approved by the ILO's ruling body. The ILO's view was that the dismissed workers "were not hired by the JR companies not because of discrimination against the labor unions but because their members had refused wide-area transfers to other regions."&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Institute for Labor Policy and Training [http://www.jil.go.jp/jil/bulletin/year/2001/vol40-02/03.htm ILO Recommendation concerning the Hiring of Former JNR Workers Vol.40-No.2 February 1, 2001] Retrieved on August 6, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Towards a final settlement===
After the [[Japanese general election, 2009|2009 election victory]] of the [[Democratic Party of Japan]], the coalition of three ruling parties; the [[Democratic Party of Japan]], [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Kokumin Shinto]] plus the opposition party [[New Komeito]] drafted a settlement package.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100304a9.html 'Unfair' '87 dismissal of JNR unionists slammed March 4, 2010] Retrieved on August 2, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; In the settlement plan the former JR workers were to receive ¥29.5 million each.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100225a2.html 900 axed JNR unionists may get ¥29.5 million each February 25, 2010] Retrieved on August 6, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

An attached document described the dismissal of the 1047 former JNR workers as "an unfair labor practice on an unprecedented scale." The proposed settlement package included a ¥28 billion financial component, and a request for the JR companies to hire around 230 former JNR workers aged up to 55.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100304a9.html 'Unfair' '87 dismissal of JNR unionists slammed March 4, 2010] Retrieved on August 2, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, then-transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]], announced that he and then-deputy prime minister [[Naoto Kan]] and [[Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan|Chief Cabinet Secretary]] [[Hirofumi Hirano]] finalized plans for a settlement.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100407a6.html Ministers mull settlement for JNR unionists April 7, 2010] Retrieved on August 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The JR group companies were reluctant to rehire the workers, so that part of the settlement was abandoned. The political parties had proposed ¥24 million yen per worker, the government had proposed ¥20 million. The figure was settled at ¥22 million. The total settlement amount was reduced to ¥20 billion, to be divided into payments of ¥22 million each for 910 households of "reconciliation money," making a total of ¥14.2 billion. Kokuro and other bodies were to receive ¥5.8 billion to be used to help the former workers find work.&lt;ref&gt; The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20100410a5.html Axed JNR ranks OK ¥22 million apiece April 10, 2010] Retrieved on August 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ed20100415a2.html EDITORIAL: Justice for former JNR workers April 15, 2010] Retrieved on August 2, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement==
===Settlement details===
23 years after the original privatization, on June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court settled the dispute between the workers and the [[Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency]]. The agency said it would pay 20 billion yen, approximately 22 million yen per worker, to 904 plaintiffs. However, as the workers were not reinstated, it was not a full settlement.&lt;ref&gt; UNHCR website [https://archive.is/20121228064038/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,JPN,,4fd8894332,0.html 2012 Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights - Japan, 6 June 2012] Retrieved on July 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the settlement, Kokuro and Kenkoro (Zendoro) dropped all its lawsuits, including unfair labor practice litigation not directly related to the firing of the 1,047 workers. Pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the settlement, Kokuro and Kenkoro did not file any unfair labor practice lawsuit thereafter.

===Doro-Chiba's rejection of settlement===
[[Doro-Chiba]] is a union which in 1979 split off from Doro (the National Railway Motor Power Union).&lt;ref&gt; The LA Times [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-29/news/mn-4958_1_rail-lines Millions Stalled as Japanese Radicals Sabotage Government-Owned Rail Lines November 29 1985] Retrieved on August 6 2012 &lt;/ref&gt; Doro merged with Tetsuro, a company union which had split off from Kokuro decades ago, and formed JR-Soren (Japan Confederation of Railway Workers' Unions --JRU) and actively promoted the privatization of JNR. Doro-Chiba had nine members who were not employed by JR after the privatization in 1987 and the union refused to accept the 2010 settlement. The union vowed to continue the struggle against the dismissals and against the privatization of JNR.&lt;ref&gt; Doro-Chiba website [http://www.doro-chiba.org/english/dc_en_10/dc_en_10_03.htm Don't put off the fire of the struggle of 1,047 dismissed national railway workers!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3964">The '''Kansas City preventive patrol experiment''' was a landmark experiment carried out between 1972 and 1973 by the [[Kansas City Police Department (Missouri)|Kansas City Police Department]] of [[Kansas City, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;http://petermoskos.com/readings/kelling_et_al_1971_kansas_city_preventive_patrol.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was evaluated by the [[Police Foundation]]. It was designed to test the assumption that the presence (or potential presence) of police officers in marked cars reduced the likelihood of a crime being committed. It was the first study to demonstrate that research into the effectiveness of different policing styles could be carried out responsibly and safely.

==Design==
The experiment was designed to answer the following questions:
# Would citizens notice changes in the level of police patrol and crime?
# Would different levels of visible police patrol affect recorded crime or the outcome of victim surveys?
# Would citizen fear of crime and attendant behavior change as a result of differing patrol levels?
# Would their degree of satisfaction with police change?

The design took three different police beats in Kansas City, and varied patrol routine in them. The first group received no routine patrols, instead the police responded only to calls from residents. The second group had the normal level of patrols, while the third had two to three times as many patrols.

The experiment had to be stopped and restarted three times because some patrol officers believed the absence of patrols would endanger citizens. (Kelling et al. 1974).

This was upheld for 12 months, from 1 October 1972 to 30 September 1973. 

Victim surveys, reported crime rates, arrest data, a survey of local businesses, attitudinal surveys, and trained observers who monitored police-citizen interaction were used to gather data. These were taken before the start of the experiment (September 1972), and after (October 1973), giving 'before' and 'after' conditions for comparison.

==Major findings==
# Citizens did not notice the difference when the frequency of patrols was changed.
# Increasing or decreasing the level of patrol had no significant effect on resident and commercial burglaries, auto thefts, larcenies involving auto accessories, robberies, or vandalism–crimes.
# The rate at which crimes were reported did not differ significantly across the experimental beats.
# Citizen reported fear of crime was not affected by different levels of patrol.
# Citizen satisfaction with police did not vary.

==Conclusions drawn==
The Kansas City Police Department drew the conclusion that routine preventive patrol in marked police cars has little value in preventing crime or making citizens feel safe and that resources normally allocated to these activities could safely be allocated elsewhere.

A significant factor realised was that crime prevention was more highly dependent on the willingness of citizens to report suspicious and/or criminal behaviour to Police than the levels or types of patrol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6745">The term "'''knowledge commons'''" refers to information, data, and content that is collectively owned and managed by a community of users, particularly over the Internet. What distinguishes a knowledge commons from a [[commons]] of shared physical resources is that digital resources are [[Rivalry (economics)|non-subtractible]]; that is, multiple users can access the same digital resources with no effect on their quantity or quality.&lt;ref name="ostrom"&gt;{{cite book |title= Understanding Knowledge as a Commons - From Theory to Practice |url=https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/EQM07412.pdf|last= Hess |first= Charlotte |author2=Ostrom, Elinor  |year= 2007 |publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-262-08357-7 |pages= 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual background ==

The term 'commons' is derived from the medieval economic system ''[[the commons]]''. Today, the knowledge commons act as a frame of reference for a number of domains, including [[open education|Open Educational]] resources such as the MIT [[OpenCourseware]], free digital media such as Wikipedia, [[Creative commons]]–licensed art, open-source research,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua M. Pearce, "[https://www.academia.edu/1861756/Open_Source_Research_in_Sustainability Open Source Research in Sustainability]", ''Sustainability: the Journal of Record'', '''5'''(4), pp. 238-243, 2012. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/sus.2012.9944 DOI] [https://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1867941/Open_Source_Research_in_Sustainability free and open access]&lt;/ref&gt; and open scientific collections such as the [[Public Library of Science]] or the [[Science Commons]], [[Free Software]] and [[Open Design]]. According to research by Charlotte Hess and [[Elinor Ostrom]],&lt;ref name="ostrom"/&gt; the conceptual background of the knowledge commons encompasses two intellectual histories: first, a European tradition of battling the enclosure of the "intangible commons of the mind",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyle |first1=James |year=2003 |title=The Second Enclosure Movement and the Construction of the Public Domain |journal=Law and Contemporary Problems |publisher= |volume=66 |issue=1-2 |pages=33–74 |url=http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/66LCPBoyle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123190230/http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/66LCPBoyle/ |archivedate=2010-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; threatened by expanding intellectual property rights and privatization of knowledge. Second, a tradition rooted in the United States, which sees the knowledge commons as a shared space allowing for free speech and democratic practices, and which is in the tradition of the town commons movement and commons-based production of scholarly work, [[open science]], open libraries, and collective action.&lt;ref name="ostrom"/&gt;

The production of works in the knowledge commons is often driven by [[collective intelligence]] respectively the wisdom of crowds and is related to knowledge communism as it was defined by [[Robert K. Merton]], according to whom scientists give up [[intellectual property rights]] in exchange for recognition and esteem.

Ferenc Gyuris argues, that it is important to distinguish "information" from "knowledge" in defining the term "knowledge commons". He argues that "knowledge as a shared resource" requires that both information must become accessible and potential recipients must become able and willing to internalize it as 'knowledge'. ''"Therefore, knowledge cannot become a shared resource without a complex set of institutions and practices that give the opportunity to potential recipients to gain the necessary abilities and willingness"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gyuris |first1= Ferenc |year= 2014 |title= Basic education in communist Hungary. A commons approach |journal= International Journal of the Commons |publisher= |volume= 8 |issue= 2 |pages= 531–553 |url= http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/article/view/458/401 |doi=10.18352/ijc.458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyleft ==

A main principle of the knowledge commons is that the traditional "[[copyright]]" is being replaced by "[[copyleft]]". Copyleft licenses grant licensees all necessary rights such as right to study, use, change and redistribute—under the condition that all future works building on the license are again kept in the commons.
The most popular applications of the 'copyleft' principle are the [[GNU]] Software Licenses (GPL, LGPL and GFDL by Free Software Foundation) and the [[share-alike]] licenses under [[creative commons]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21771">'''Legal financing''' (also known as '''litigation financing''', '''professional funding''', '''settlement funding''', '''third-party funding''', '''legal funding''', '''lawsuit loans''' and, in England and Wales, '''[[Litigation Funding (UK)#Litigation Funding|litigation funding]]''') is the mechanism or process through which litigants (and even [[law firms]]) can finance their [[litigation]] or other legal costs through a third party funding company.

Similar to [[legal defense fund]]s, legal financing companies provide [[money]] for lawsuits but are more often used by those without strong financial resources. Furthermore, legal financing is more likely to be used by plaintiffs, whereas legal defense funds are more likely to be used by defendants. Money obtained from legal financing companies can be used for any purpose, whether for litigation or for personal matters.  On the other hand, money obtained through legal defense funds are solely used to fund litigation and legal costs.

Legal financing companies provide a [[Nonrecourse debt|nonrecourse]] [[cash advance]] to litigants in exchange for a percentage share of the [[judgment]] or [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. Despite some superficial similarity to an [[unsecured loan]] with a traditional lender, legal financing operates differently from a [[loans|loan]]. Litigation funding is generally ''not'' considered a [[loan]], but rather as a form of an [[Asset purchase agreement|asset purchase]] or [[Venture capital|venture capital]]. Legal funding advances are not debt and are not reported to the credit bureaus, so a litigant's [[credit ratings]] will not be affected by a litigant obtains a legal funding advance.

Legal financing companies normally provide money in the form of a lump sum payment, and generally, no specific account is established for the litigant. If the case proceeds to [[trial]] and the litigant loses, the third party funding company receives nothing and loses the [[money]] they have invested in the case.&lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Investors Put Money on Lawsuits to Get Payouts|first=Binyamin|last=Appelbaum|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 14, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/business/15lawsuit.html|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if the litigant loses, he does not have to repay the [[money]]. In addition, litigants generally do not have to pay monthly fees after obtaining legal financing. Instead, no payments of any kind are made until the case settles or judgment is obtained, which could occur months or years after legal funding is received. Accordingly, to qualify for funding with a legal financing company, a litigant's case must have sufficient merit that the company deems its investment in the case to be worth the risk.

In [[tort]] litigation, legal financing is most commonly sought in [[personal injury]] cases, but may also be sought for commercial disputes, [[civil rights]] cases, and [[workers' compensation]] cases.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Binyamin|title=Lawsuit Loans Add New Risk for the Injured|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/business/17lawsuit.html|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=16 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While Third Party Litigation Funding is not a new concept, it is relatively new to the United States and has its roots in the old English principles of champerty and maintenance. Some U.S. states still prohibit or materially limit champerty and other allow it with some restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://insolvencyintel.abi.org/i/954366-third-party-litigation-funding-where-do-we-go-now/3?|title=ABI Journal - Third-Party Litigation Funding: Where Do We Go Now?|website=insolvencyintel.abi.org|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little financial assistance is available from traditional sources to help injured plaintiffs cover the cost of litigation or pay their personal expenses while a case remains pending. [[Plaintiffs]] may turn to credit cards and personal [[loans]] to cover litigation fees, attorneys' fees, court filings, personal finances, and living expense shortfalls while they wait for litigation to be resolved. The obligation to repay that debt is not affected by the outcome of the plaintiff's lawsuit.

In many jurisdictions, and throughout the United States, [[Legal ethics|attorney rules of ethics]] preclude an attorney from advancing money in the form of loans to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule 4-210 Payment of Personal or Business Expenses Incurred by or for a Client|url=http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/Conduct-Discipline/Rules/Rules-of-Professional-Conduct/Current-Rules/Rule-4-210|website=California Rules of Professional Conduct|publisher=The State Bar of California|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawsuitloan"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lawsuit Loan|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/lawsuit_loan.html|website=Expert Law|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of legal financing provides qualified plaintiffs with a means of paying the cost of litigation and their personal expenses, without having to resort to traditional borrowing.

==Qualification for litigation financing==
Legal funding companies do not provide legal advice to applicants, nor do they provide referrals to [[attorney at law|attorneys]]. Thus, to qualify for legal financing a plaintiff must have already hired an attorney. To apply  for legal financing, the plaintiff must complete an application form and provide supporting documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merzer|first1=Martin|title=Cash-now Promise of Lawsuit Loans Under Fire|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/03/29/cash-now-promise-lawsuit-loans-under-fire.html|accessdate=31 May 2017|agency=Fox Business|date=19 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As legal financing companies only recover their investment if the plaintiff recovers money from the funded lawsuit, the merits of the plaintiff's case must be strong, meaning that the plaintiff has a strong argument that the defendant is liable for the damages claimed in the lawsuit. The defendant in the case (the person or company being sued) must also have the ability to pay a judgment, whether by virtue of its own financial strength or through insurance coverage.  The injured party's attorney must also agree to the legal financing and generally must to sign an agreement consenting to the legal financing.

Additional qualification or approval factors may include the total amount of damages sought, a sufficient potential margin of recovery to justify the [[investment]], the background of the applicant, and laws of the applicant's place of residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindeman|first1=Ralph|title=Third-Party Investors Offer New Funding Source for Major Commercial Lawsuits|url=http://www.fulbrookmanagement.com/third-party-investors-offer-new-funding-source-for-major-commercial-lawsuits/|website=Fulbrook Capital Management, LLC|publisher=BNA: Daily Report for Executives|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=5 Mar 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal financing companies limit their investment to specific types of lawsuits, such as a [[personal injury]] claim or commercial litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGee|first1=Jamie|title=Investors look to make millions backing lawsuits|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2014/05/20/lawsuit-financing-carves-niche/9306059/|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=The Tennessean|date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
[[Lawsuits]] are expensive and may progress slowly, over a period of many months or years.&lt;ref name="elfund"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-Settlement Lawsuit Funding in Personal Injury Cases|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/lawsuit_funding.html|website=Expert Law|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, many plaintiffs may feel considerable financial pressure, and may need money to pay the costs of litigation, as well as the costs of supporting themselves. When obtained during the course of [[tort]] litigation, legal financing may help a plaintiff who has immediate needs, such as medical care, and cannot afford to wait until the litigation concludes to obtain money. A severely injured plaintiff might have significant personal expenses due to disability or loss of income and may face significant personal and medical debt, and as a result may feel considerable pressure to enter into an early settlement.&lt;ref name="lawsuitloan" /&gt; A defendant may recognize a plaintiff's financial need and offer a low settlement in anticipation that the plaintiff will not be able to afford continued litigation.

The desperate situation of plaintiffs is reflected in a finding by the American Legal Finance Association, an industry group for legal financing companies, that over 62% of funds provided to plaintiffs are used to stop a [[foreclosure]] or an [[eviction]] action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Legal Funding|url=http://www.parabellumcap.com/docs/faq/ALFA-About-Legal-Funding.pdf|website=Parabellum Capital|publisher=American Legal Finance Association|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
One concern about litigation funding is that it is costly to the plaintiff, and may take a very large chunk out of plaintiff's eventual [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] or verdict. After paying attorney fees and the amount owed to the legal financing company, the plaintiff may receive little or no additional money beyond any amount received from the advance.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Appelbaum|first1=Binyamin|title=Lawsuit Loans Add New Risk for the Injured|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/business/17lawsuit.html|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=16 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some concern that, if widely adopted, litigation finance could prolong litigation and reduce the frequency of settlements of civil lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third Party Litigation Funding (TPLF)|url=http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/issues/third-party-litigation-funding|website=U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform|publisher=U.S. Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of civil lawsuits published in the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies found that between 80% and 92% of cases settle.&lt;ref name="ELSTrial"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galanter|first1=Marc|title=The Vanishing Trial: An Examination of Trials and Related Matters in Federal and State Courts|journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies|date=Nov 2004|volume=1|issue=3|pages=459–570|url=http://epstein.wustl.edu/research/courses.judpol.Galanter.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that most plaintiffs who decided to pass up a settlement offer and proceed to trial ended up recovering less money than if they had accepted the settlement offer.&lt;ref name="ELSTrial" /&gt;

The legal financing industry has come under fire from critics for actual and potential legal and ethical violations.&lt;ref name="elfund" /&gt; For example, some companies have been found to violate state [[Usury|usury]] laws (laws against unreasonably high interest rates), [[Champerty and maintenance|champerty]] laws (laws prohibiting third parties from furthering a lawsuit for an interest in the recovery), or to require action by the applicant's lawyer that might be unethical under state rules of professional conduct.&lt;ref name="NYCBar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Formal Opinion 2011-2: Third Party Litigation Financing|url=http://www.nycbar.org/member-and-career-services/committees/reports-listing/reports/detail/formal-opinion-2011-2-third-party-litigation-financing|website=New York City Bar|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major criticism of litigation funding is that its cost is disproportionate to the risk accepted by litigation finance companies.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan" /&gt; As lenders thoroughly evaluate claims before they agree to provide financing, they have a very high likelihood of recovering their fee at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, and further limit potential losses by providing financing in amounts that are relatively small as compared to the plaintiff's anticipated recovery.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan" /&gt;

In June 2011, the New York City Bar Association addressed some of the ethical issues raised by lawsuit financing in an ethics opinion about third-party non-recourse legal funding. It concluded that with due care a lawyer could help a client obtain legal financing, and that non-recourse litigation financing “provides to some claimants a valuable means for paying the costs of pursuing a legal claim, or even sustaining basic living expenses until a settlement or judgment is obtained.”&lt;ref name="NYCBar" /&gt; Many lawyers advise clients to pursue legal financing only as a last resort, when other forms of financing are not available.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ELSTrial" /&gt;

==England and Wales==

Litigation funding has been permitted in England and Wales since 1967 (and in insolvency matters since the late nineteenth century). However, the recent years have seen its growing acceptance as part of the litigation landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The evolution of litigation  finance|url=http://www.burfordcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Corporate-finance-and-litigation-funding-Issue-3-FINAL-sm.pdf|website=Burford|publisher=Burford Capital, LLC|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in the case of ''Arkin v Borchard Lines Ltd &amp; Others'', the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] made it clear that litigation funding is a legitimate method of financing litigation. In January 2010, Chapter 11 of the ''Jackson Review of Civil Litigation Costs'' was published, effectively providing judicial endorsement to litigation funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Civil Litigation Costs|url=http://funds4claims.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/jacksonfinalreport140110.pdf|publisher=The Stationery Office|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, a ''Code of Conduct for Litigation Funders'' was launched, which sets out the standards of best practice and behaviour for litigation funders in England and Wales. The Code of Conduct provides transparency to claimants and their solicitors. It requires litigation funders to provide satisfactory answers to certain key questions before entering into relationships with claimants. Under the Code, litigation funders are required to give assurances to claimants that, among other things, the litigation funder will not try to take control of the litigation, the litigation funder has the money to pay for the costs of the funded litigation and the litigation funder will not terminate funding absent a material adverse development. The Code has been approved by Lord Justice Jackson and commended by the Chair of the [[Civil Justice Council]], [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury]], the President of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third Party Funding: Code for Conduct for Litigation Funders|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/related-offices-and-bodies/advisory-bodies/cjc/third-party-funding/|website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|publisher=Judicial Press Office|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulatory body responsible for litigation funding and ensuring compliance with the Code is the Association of Litigation Funders (ALF). The Board of Directors of ALF comprises representatives from Calunius, Woodsford and [[Harbour Litigation Funding]]. The members of ALF have adopted the Code and undertake to comply at all times with it.

==South Africa==
Litigation funding is generally unregulated in [[South Africa]], but it appears that it has quietly become part of the [[Law of South Africa|South African legal landscape]], getting little to no resistance in the face of what used to be portrayed as ''contra bonos mores champertous'' agreements, which are, by definition, illegal.&lt;ref name="litigationfunding.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|title=Litigation Funding in South Africa|url=http://www.litigationfunding.co.za/lfsa_article.pdf|publisher=Litigation Funding Magazine|accessdate=30 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729012837/http://www.litigationfunding.co.za/lfsa_article.pdf|archivedate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''pactum de quota litis'' is defined as “an agreement to share the proceeds of one or more lawsuits” and it is the duty of the court to ascertain, of its own motion, the lawfulness of such agreement as it cannot lend its assistance to the execution of agreements and transactions which are contrary to law. An initial distinction between an acceptable and an objectionable ''pactum de quota litis'' was formulated in ''Hugo &amp; Möller N.O. v Transvaal Loan, Finance and Mortgage Co'', 1894 (1) OR 336. The Court held that a fair agreement to provide the necessary funds to enable an action to be proceeded with, in consideration for which the person lending the money is to receive an interest in the property sought to be recovered, must not be considered per se to be ''contra bonos mores''. The court was concerned about potential abuses for such agreements, such using them for purposes of gambling with litigation cases.

Several cases have provided further guidelines for such litigation financing agreements. In Hadleigh Private Hospital (Pty) Ltd t/a Rand Clinic v Soller &amp; Manning Attorneys and Others 2001 (4) SA 360 (W), the Court affirmed that an agreement to share the proceeds of one or more lawsuits is not necessarily unlawful and must indeed be considered acceptable when a litigant is not in a financial position to fund his litigation completely. In another case, the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|South Africa Supreme Court of Appeal]] held, in ''PriceWaterHouse Coopers Inc and Others v National Potato Co-operative Ltd'', 2004 (6) SA 66 (SCA), that the "although the number of reported cases concerned with champertous agreements diminished, courts have still adhered to the view that generally they are unlawful and that litigation pursuant to such agreements should not be entertained". However, the Supreme Court sought to clarify any disagreements and took a different route.

The Supreme Court ruled that:
* An agreement in terms of which a stranger to a lawsuit advances funds to a litigant on condition that his remuneration, in case the litigant wins the action, is to be part of the proceeds of the suit is not contrary to public policy or void, and
* The existence of such an assistance agreement cannot be the base of a defense in the action. In June 2010, in an [[interlocutory]] ruling rendered in the same case, the High Court found that the funder is, after all, a co-owner of the claim and should, therefore, be joined as a party to the trial. Therefore, an order for costs may be made directly against him to the extent that the funded party cannot support them even after the termination of the funding agreement.&lt;ref name="litigationfunding.co.za"/&gt;

==United States==
Legal financing is a fairly recent phenomenon in the United States, beginning in or around 1997.&lt;ref name="americanlegalfin.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About ALFA|url=http://www.americanlegalfin.com/FactsAboutALFA.asp|publisher=ALFA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207025034/http://www.americanlegalfin.com/FactsAboutALFA.asp|archivedate=2011-12-07|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Litigation funding is available in most U.S. [[jurisdictions]].  Litigation funding is most commonly sought in [[personal injury]] cases, but may also be sought for commercial disputes, [[civil rights]] cases, and [[workers' compensation]] cases. The amount of money that [[plaintiffs]] receive through legal financing varies widely, but often is around 10 to 15 percent of the expected value of judgment or settlement of their lawsuit.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt;  Some companies allow individuals to request additional funding at a later date. The amount of money available depends on the policies of the financing company and the characteristics of the plaintiff's lawsuit.

One major division in litigation finance is between consumer and commercial financing companies. While consumer financing generally consists of small advances between $500 and $2000 directly for individual plaintiffs, commercial financing for companies to pursue legal claims generally is dedicated towards payment of litigation costs.&lt;ref name="NYTLoan"/&gt; The largest legal financing companies in the space are commercial, including public companies.

Litigation funders generally evaluate cases based on legal merit, amount of damages, and financial viability of the defendant. Many funders also specialize in specific areas of litigation or have restrictions on funding size and funding structure.&lt;ref name="ATL19Oct16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lat|first1=David|title=Litigation Finance: What Lawyers Need To Know|url=http://abovethelaw.com/2016/10/litigation-finance-what-lawyers-need-to-know/|accessdate=July 12, 2017|publisher=Above the Law|date=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Legal Financing Association (ALFA) is a trade association that represents consumer legal financing companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is ALFA?|url=https://americanlegalfin.com/what-is-alfa/|website=ALFA|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALFA's main goals are to establish voluntary standards for the legal funding industry and to serve as the liaison with the public, government officials, and the media.&lt;ref name="americanlegalfin.com"/&gt;  While ALFA is a non-profit organization, most legal funding companies are for-profit organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">The '''Legitimacy Act 1931''' was an [[List of Acts of the Oireachtas|Act]] of the [[Oireachtas]]. The purpose of the Legitimacy Act 1931 was to amend the law relating to children born out of wedlock.

==Act==
The fundamental principle of the Legitimacy Act 1931 is exposed in article 1(1):  
"''Subject to the provisions of this section where the parents of an illegitimate person marry or have married one another, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the marriage shall, if the father of the illegitimate person was or is at the date of the marriage domiciled in Saorstát Eireann, render that person, if living, legitimate from the commencement of this Act, or from the date of the marriage, whichever is the later.''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legitimacy Act, 1931 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1931/act/13/enacted/en/print.html |website=Irish Statute Book |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Act allowed children to be legitimised by the subsequent marriage of their parents, provided that neither parent had been married to a third party at the time of the birth or the ten months prior. In those circumstances, the legitimised birth was re-entered in the birth indexes for that year (sometimes many years after the original birth). The original entry would be annotated to refer to the new entry. The Act was similar in purpose to the Legitimacy Act 1926 passed by Westminster.

The Act was sponsored by [[Frank Fahy]] a Fianna Fáil TD from [[Galway (Dáil constituency)|Galway]] and [[Patrick Little]], Fianna Fáil TD for [[Waterford (Dáil constituency)|Waterford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legitimacy Act , 1931 (Act 13 of 1931) Legitimacy Bill, 1929 (Bill 53 of 1929) |url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/1929/53/?tab=debates |website=www.oireachtas.ie |publisher=Government of Ireland |accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''limited liability company''' ('''LLC''') is the [[United States of America|US]]-specific form of a [[private limited company]]. It is a [[business]] structure that can combine the [[Flow-through entity|pass-through taxation]] of a [[partnership]] or [[sole proprietorship]] with the [[limited liability]] of a [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwindt|first1=Kari|title=Limited Liability Companies: Issues in Member Liability|journal=UCLE Law Review|date=1996|volume=44|page=1541|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uclalr44&amp;div=43|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Limited liability company (LLC)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/limited_liability_company_llc|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An LLC is not a corporation in and of itself; it is a legal form of a [[company]] that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs are well-known for the flexibility that they provide to business owners; depending on the situation, an LLC may elect to use corporate tax rules instead of being treated as a partnership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc | title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) | publisher=Internal Revenue Service| access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, under certain circumstances, LLCs may be organized as not-for-profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard A. |last1=McCray |first2=Ward L. |last2=Thomas |title=Limited Liability Companies as Exempt Organizations |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopich00.pdf | publisher=Internal Revenue Service | access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or [[medical services]], may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a '''professional limited liability company''' ('''PLLC''').&lt;ref name="accountingtoday"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akalp|first1=Neil|title=Should You Structure Your Accounting Firm as an LLC, PLLC or PC?|url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/should-you-structure-your-accounting-firm-as-an-llc-pllc-or-pc|website=Accounting Today | publisher=SourceMedia | date=10 August 2016 | access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited liability company (LLC) is a hybrid [[legal person|legal entity]] having certain characteristics of both a [[corporation]] and a [[partnership]] or [[sole proprietorship]] (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC is a type of [[voluntary association|unincorporated association]] distinct from a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is [[limited liability]], and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of [[flow-through entity|pass-through]] [[taxation in the United States|income taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Limited Liability Company (LLC)|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/limited_liability_company.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bischoff|first1=Bill|title=The advantages of owning real estate in a single-member LLC|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-advantages-of-owning-real-estate-in-a-single-member-llc-2017-05-01|website=MarketWatch, Inc.|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although LLCs and corporations both possess some analogous features, the basic terminology commonly associated with each type of legal entity, at least within the United States, is sometimes different. When an LLC is formed, it is said to be "organized,” not "incorporated" or "chartered,” and its founding document is likewise known as its "[[articles of organization]]," instead of its "[[articles of incorporation]]" or its "corporate charter.” Internal operations of an LLC are further governed by its "[[operating agreement]]," rather than its "[[by-law|bylaws]]." The owner of beneficial rights in an LLC is known as a "member," rather than a "[[shareholder]].” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Kevin|title=What Is the Difference Between a Shareholder Vs. a LLC Member?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-shareholder-vs-llc-member-61708.html|accessdate=7 September 2017|agency=Houston Chronicle|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[ownership]] in an LLC is represented by a "membership interest" or an "LLC interest" (sometimes measured in "membership units" or just "units" and at other times simply stated only as [[percentage]]s), rather than represented by "[[share (finance)|shares of stock]]" or just "shares" (with ownership measured by the number of shares held by each shareholder). Similarly, when issued in physical rather than electronic form, a document evidencing ownership rights in an LLC is called a "membership certificate" rather than a "[[stock certificate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Scott E.|title=Forming Your Own Limilted Liability Company|date=1996|publisher=Dearborn Trade Publishing|isbn=9780936894935|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAP5gXGGFFEC|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego [[Piercing the corporate veil|piercing theories]] as corporate shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macey|first1=Jonathan R.|title=The Three Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/03/27/the-three-justifications-for-piercing-the-corporate-veil/|website=The Three Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. As long as the LLC and the members do not [[commingling|commingle]] funds, it is difficult to pierce the LLC veil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Shaun M.|title=Piercing the Veil of the Limited Liability Company, from Sure Bet to Long Shot: Gallinger v. North Star Hospital Mutual Assurance, Ltd.|journal=Journal of Corporate Law|date=1996|volume=22|page=131|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jcorl22&amp;div=14|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandervoort|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Piercing the Veil of Limited Liability Companies: The Need for a Better Standard|journal=DePaul Business and Commercial Law Journal|date=2004|volume=3|page=51|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/depbcl3&amp;div=10|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the [[charging order]] mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adkisson|first1=Jay|title=The Misunderstood Charging Order|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2013/04/30/the-misunderstood-charging-order/|website=Forbes|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Delaware Code, Title 6, Chapter 18, Limited Liability Company Act|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c018/sc06/index.shtml|website=State of Delaware|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first state to enact a law authorizing limited liability companies was [[Wyoming]] in 1977. The form did not become immediately popular, in part because of uncertainties in tax treatment by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. After an IRS ruling in 1988 that Wyoming LLCs could be taxed as partnerships, other states began enacting LLC statutes. By 1996, all 50 states had LLC statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/law_trends_news_practice_area_e_newsletter_home/llc.html|title=LLCs: Is the Future Here? A History and Prognosis|last=|first=|date=October 2004|website=www.americanbar.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flexibility and default rules==
LLCs are subject to fewer regulations than traditional corporations, and thus may allow members to create a more flexible management structure than is possible with other corporate forms. As long as it remains within the confines of state law, the operating agreement is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pros and Cons of a Limited Liability Company (LLC)|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/pros-and-cons-of-a-limited-liability-company-llc-2517-1.html|website=AllBusiness.com|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.

The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. Even the use of a single member LLC affords greater protection for the assets of the member, as compared to operating as an unincorporated entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Shari P.|title=Single Member LLC Vs. Sole Proprietorship Liability|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/single-member-llc-vs-sole-proprietorship-liability-81147.html|website=Houston Chronicle|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in ''Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp., 59 A. 3d 1206 (2012)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13162396720159555258|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Falby|first1=Bruce E.|title=Delaware amends its LLC Act: managers and controllers owe fiduciary duties unless LLC agreement provides otherwise|url=https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2013/08/delaware-amends-its-llc-act--managers-and-contro__/|website=DLA Piper|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. The written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bainbridge|first1=Stephen|title=Didn't sign your LLC operating agreement? Think that'll get you off? Think again.|url=http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2014/09/didnt-sign-your-llc-operating-agreement-think-thatll-get-you-off-think-again.html|website=ProfessorBainbridge.com|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income tax==
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iss4.pdf |title=Instruction SS-4 (Rev. January 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a "disregarded entity" for tax purposes (unless another tax status is elected), and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on [[Form 1040#1040|Schedule C]] of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLC Filing as a Corporation or Partnership|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/llc-filing-as-a-corporation-or-partnership|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice: once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders.  Thus, more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akalp|first1=Nellie|title=How to Structure Your Startup to Avoid Double Taxation|url=http://mashable.com/2012/02/09/business-incorporation-taxes/|website=Mashable|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf |title=IRS Form 8832 (Rev. January 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular [[C corporation]] (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the [[dividend]]s or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an [[S corporation]] (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as a S-corporation as the best possible [[small business]] structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Small-Business-Taxes/Limited-Liability-Company-Taxes/INF12029.html |title=Tax Advantages of Corporations - Updated for Tax Year 2016 |publisher=TurboTax |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
* Choice of [[entity classification election|tax regime]]. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a [[sole proprietor]], partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
* A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title26-vol8/pdf/CFR-2010-title26-vol8-sec1-704-1.pdf Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1] are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
* The owners of the LLC, called members, are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
* In the United States, an S corporation has a limited number of stockholders, and all of them must be U.S. tax residents; an LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
* Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
* [[Flow-through entity|Pass-through taxation]] (i.e., no [[double taxation]]), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
* Using default tax classification, [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
* LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC) (see, for example, the case of ''Sturm v. Harb Development''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sturm v. Harb Development, 298 Conn. 124, 2 A.3d 859 (2010)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4103942001146152039|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* LLCs in some states can be set up with just one [[natural person]] involved.
* Less risk of being "stolen" by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against "hungry" [[investor]]s).
* For real estate companies, each separate property can be owned by its own individual LLC, thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from cross-liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Benefits of Limited Liability Companies|url=https://cornerstonelaw.us/6-benefits-limited-liability-companies/|website=Cornerstone Law Firm|publisher=Cornerstone Law Firm, LLC|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Although there is no statutory requirement for an [[operating agreement]] in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.
* It may be more difficult to raise [[financial capital]] for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual [[initial public offering|IPO]]. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
* Many jurisdictions—including [[Alabama]], [[California]], [[Kentucky]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]—levy a [[franchise tax]] or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.
** Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
** In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profit—unless the entity is tax exempt—must at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.
* Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
* The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers. (This could also be seen as an advantage to some.)
* Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposes—for example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[HMRC]] in the [[United Kingdom]], see [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/dtmanual/DT19853A.htm HMRC Tax Manuals, DT19853A]&lt;/ref&gt; This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
* The principals of LLCs use many different titles—e.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC's behalf.

==Variations==
* A Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L.) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a [[Physician|doctor]], [[chiropractor]], [[lawyer]], [[accountant]], [[architect]], [[landscape architect]], or [[engineer]], require the formation of a PLLC.&lt;ref name="accountingtoday"/&gt; However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC's members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.
* A [[Series LLC]] is a special form of a Limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.
* An [[L3C]] is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.
* An Anonymous Limited Liability Company is a LLC for which ownership information is not made publicly available by the state. This is typically accomplished by using a third-party to act as the organizer and [[registered agent]] of the LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donahue|first1=Larry|title=Just How "Anonymous" are Anonymous LLC's?|url=https://www.l4sb.com/blog/just-anonymous-anonymous-llcs/|website=Law 4 Small Business, P.C.|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Polish Republic]] adopted the '''March Constitution''' on 17 March 1921, after ousting the occupation of the [[Germany|German]]/[[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] forces in the 1918 [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland Uprising]], and avoiding conquest by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s in the 1920 [[Polish-Soviet War]]. The Constitution, based on the French one{{clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!-- which one? --&gt;, was regarded as very democratic. Among others, it expressly ruled out discrimination on racial or religious grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niall Ferguson]], The War of the World, The Penguin Press, New York 2006, page 271&lt;/ref&gt; It also abolished all  [[royal title]]s and state privileges, and banned the use of [[blazon]]s.

It was partially adjusted by the 1926 [[August Novelization]], and superseded by the [[Polish Constitution of 1935]] (April Constitution).

The laws were administered (from the late thirteenth-century onwards) by the [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Wardens of the Marches]] in times of war between England and Scotland, and by "Conservators of the truce" in times of peace, although, given that periods of truce were invariably subject to [[Border Reivers|cross-border raiding]], piracy and ransom-taking, the two roles were often amalgamated into that of "warden-conservator".  The work of the courts was done at periodic gatherings of plaintiffs and defendants, along with the designated warden-conservators and the jurors ("recognitors") from both England and Scotland, at a pre-decided place either side of the border line on what were called "days of march" (or "days of truce").

In England, March law ran side-by-side with English [[Common law]], often in an unclear way (and with the latter sometimes being subverted by the Wardens to their own ends). As well as common law, March Law had elements of [[Equity (legal concept)|Equity]] and [[Military law]] in its make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neville|first1=Cynthia J.|title=Keeping the peace in the Northern marches in the later middle ages|journal=English Historical Review|date=February 1994|volume=109|issue=430|pages=1–25, p.1|jstor=574872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March law was usually most in force during times of truce, as, during times of war with the Scots, the English Crown, claiming sovereignty over Scottish territory, would refuse to recognise a separate judicial entity in Scotland.

==Background==
From the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] to 1603 and the [[Union of the Crowns]], [[Scottish marches|the borderlands of England and Scotland]] suffered from armed raids and open warfare. The warfare was driven by the attempts of the English crown to claim suzerainty over Scotland and the consequent resistance of the Scottish crown. In addition, the Scottish Crown would often support the French in the latter's wars with England (the "Auld alliance"). The [[Border Reivers|raiding]] was due to armed bands of local magnates, lairds or clan chiefs and their retainers (the [[Border Reivers]]) on both sides of the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] (including sometimes the Wardens' own men) crossing the border to take captives and/or animals and wreak damage on property.

Because of the threat of war and/or raiding, it simply was not worth local people raising crops or animals with any expectation of keeping hold of them : the result was that clans on both sides of the border, especially in the more remote regions, became mobile or semipermanent residents, stealing others' crops and animals in order to feed themselves.

The lack of effective Royal landholding in the region, plus the difficulties in getting to the remote regions concerned, meant that peacekeeping power was devolved to the great northern families who were themselves often in conflict with the Crown and with each other. Compensation paid to victims was defrayed out of the magnates' own pockets, so this meant that they had an interest in using raiding to claw back their expenses.

The result was devastation for local people on either side of the border for three hundred years. Raids and retaliatory raiding took place regularly even during times of formal truce between the two countries. Access to justice for victims, especially as regards compensation, was virtually impossible via the normal legal methods. [[Felons]] simply crossed the border to escape capture and to evade the relevant legal system that would have applied to the local inhabitants.  There was no compensation or restitution available either under existing law. Hence the need for an alternative - the March law.

==Origins==
The origins of March law are obscure and have been the subject of some dispute. The (first) codification of 1249, (when twelve knights, six each from England and Scotland, convened on the border to write down "the laws and customs of the march" at the instigation of [[Henry III of England]] and [[Alexander II of Scotland]]) seems to refer to practices dating back some time. Some historians have suggested pre-Norman origins, others have said that there is a mixture of pre-Norman and post-Norman elements in the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neville|first=Cynthia J.|title=Violence, custom and law : the Anglo-Scottish border lands in the later middle ages|location=Edinburgh|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date=1998|pages=xiv, 1-226, p.1-2|ISBN=0748610731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1249 text&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neilson|first=G. (ed.)|title=The March laws|date=1971|location=Edinburgh|publisher=Stair Society|series=Stair Society miscellany vol.1|pages=11–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; has articles concerning: the proclaiming of the alleged offence on both sides of the border; the use of pledges to ensure that the plaintiffs and defendants turned up at the day of march; the use of jurors from both kingdoms; the payment of compensation to victims (such as "manbote" as regards murder); the method of proof in contested disputes (usually judicial duel or "wager of battle", known as " handwarcelle"); and the guarantee of sanctuary to those who confessed.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven of the thirteen clauses were concerned with apprehending offenders; the types of offences were not listed, but were probably to do with acts against the person and property.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1994, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The border disputes of the thirteenth-century (before the setting-up of the Wardenial system) were usually settled, if the plaintiffs decided against using common law, by an enquiry made by the [[sheriff]]. The use of English common law or [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] writs was a competing system of justice in the borders.

==Later developments==
With the coming to power of [[Edward I of England]] and the almost continuous warfare due to the [[Scottish Wars of Independence]], March law was effectively put into abeyance until the middle of the fourteenth-century. The beginning of the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] in 1296 saw the establishment of the system of Wardens and Conservators mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reid|first=R. R.|title=The Office of Warden of the March : its origin and early history|journal=English Historical Review|volume=32|date=1917|pages=479–496}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the judicial capacity of the Wardens was restricted to matters of military import (e.g.: arresting those attempting to evade military service). However, the 1320s saw the Conservators, in times of peace, take on the judicial role that had previously belonged to the sheriffs.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.20, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1346, when the marches region was divided into East and West marches, and when [[Edward III of England]] wanted to keep the peace on the Scottish border while he was involved in France, the Wardens were given the Conservators' judicial functions in addition to their own military ones. The Wardens' courts operated in tandem with common law ones, and were held in addition to those at the days of truce.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.38, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward III made further attempts to involve the Crown with border law, and to regularise its machinery. He appointed [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick]] to join the Wardens as their supervisor; the 1367 commission included the requirement to have a quorum (of two) on the judicial bench; days of march were agreed on in advance; felons were required to be presented by English and Scottish juries before being sent before the Warden and a mixed tribunal (assuming not yet proven guilty); the guilty had to make restitution within fifteen days (if they had no goods to hand over and no lord to vouch for them, they were set to ransom); sheriffs were told to assist the Wardens in capturing suspects who had taken flight; for the first time, lesser nobility were brought into the system as conservators.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.52-54&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A Border Reiver - geograph.org.uk - 343129.jpg|thumb|left|A Border Reiver : statue in Carlisle]]
Richard II's reign saw a failed attempt by the English Crown to lessen the power of the northern magnates and to manipulate their hold on the Wardenships (the Wardens becoming paid officers by the end of the 1380s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storey|first=R. L.|title=The Wardens of the marches of England towards Scotland, 1377-1489|journal=English Historical Review|year=1957|volume=72|issue=285|pages=593–615}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also saw intensive cross-border raiding and destruction. However, the use of border law was strengthened, perhaps because the region fell more closely under the influence of the Wardens (particularly the Percies and Nevilles in England and the Douglas family in Scotland). For example, the problem of felons fleeing to the various [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] where the King's writ did not run, was partially solved by making the lord of one of the largest of them (the Bishop of Durham who held the [[Liberty of Durham]]) Warden of the East March. Distraining ('poinding') was abolished in 1386 as being unworkable, and responsibility for compensation was given to the Wardens alone.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.76,77&lt;/ref&gt;

The indenture relating to the truce of 1386 between the English and Scots clarified the types of offences against truces that would be subject to border law. These included: homicide, the carrying off of persons, ransom-taking, the taking of castles, fortresses and walled-towns, armed and mounted raids, cattle reiving (theft). In 1397, it was agreed that written bills of complaint would be submitted by plaintiffs before being forwarded to the conservators of both countries.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.77,79&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the fourteenth-century, it has been argued, March law "had achieved the status of a system of law, complete with a hallowed and proven tradition, a body of written record, and a legitimate purpose" and "both complemented and supplemented the working of English common law."&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the reigns of [[Henry IV of England]] and [[Henry V of England]] saw the revival of Edward I's claim over Scotland, and March law went into abeyance once more. In addition, the revolts of the Percies against the Crown, as well as feuds amongst the border Wardens, meant that border law was not championed, despite the pleas made by [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]] to his father to reinstate the days of march. The borderers suffered much deprivation due to cross-border raiding and recourse to the common law failed to bring any restitution, even when the justices were present to hold the assizes.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.96-124&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of [[Henry VI of England]] saw a revival in March law as the regime sought to ally itself with Scotland. The truce of 1424 between the two countries resurrected the border tribunals. It sought to ban all reprisals; when these took place the offenders had to seek negotiation before the Wardens. Seeking redress for cross-border felonies would from now on be done in the Wardenial courts (as opposed to being dealt with at the tribunals set up at the days of march).&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.115-116&lt;/ref&gt;

The indentures agreed in 1429, between the English commissioners sent as envoys to Scotland and the Scottish representatives, laid the foundation for fifteenth-century border law. The nature of the offences to be dealt with by border law was enumerated : "homicide, mayhem ('manyheing'), assault, breach of safe conduct, theft of animals and chattels, the unlawful grazing and pasturing of animals and treason." Procedures were laid down : for example, amongst other provisions,  suspects who had attacked people moving under safe conduct were to be handed over to the Wardens of the opposite realm for punishment; challenges made by defendants were to be submitted to a mixed English and Scottish jury; English jurors were to be nominated by the Scots and vice versa; a kind of extradition system was devised; days of march were to have clerks available to make written records of proceedings; goods stolen by raiders from the opposite side of the border but found on the victim's side were to be argued over at a future day of march. If the accused was found innocent, the person taken with the goods had to forfeit them and seek compensation for the loss at a day of march. A second indenture covered the method of dealing with losses due to piracy (as vexatious a problem as that of land-based theft). On land, it set up a mechanism of establishing 'proofs' using men versed in the law and local men of standing (from England and Scotland) as jurors who established the facts of cases before they were presented to the cross-border tribunals. The provisions in the 1429 indentures were the first real attempt to bring the Anglo-Scottish border into the ambit of international law, rather than relying on the ad hoc, intermittent activity of local magnates (the Warden-Conservators).&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.129-135&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Well Armed Raiders - geograph.org.uk - 951954.jpg|thumb|right|Well Armed Raiders. Photo: Malcolm Carruthers]]

In 1451, arrangements were made to bring March law closer to English practice in the courts of [[Admiralty court|Admiralty]] and [[High Court of Chivalry|Chivalry]], in that Scottish plaintiffs could now take their cases to the Chancellor of England if English wrongdoers failed to turn up at the border tribunals. Other provisions led to the closer supervision of the Warden-Conservators by their respective governments.

The grip of families such as the Percies and Nevilles on the wardenships meant that the wardenial courts were busier than ever and competing with, and beating, the common law courts for business.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.140, 145&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward IV of England]] took advantage of the Scots' reluctance to support Henry VI to maintain the relatively favourable conditions in which March law had been operating. The provisions concerning March law laid out in the truce documents of 1464 were not much more than a reiteration of those of 1457 that Henry VI and James II had signed. Border law worked even with the coming-back into power (briefly) of Henry VI and the accession of [[James III of Scotland]]. In 1473, new procedures for dealing with cross-border homicides were instituted, along with a limit on the number of retainers that could be invited to the days of march (which often ended in riotous behaviour, in part due to the sheer numbers of opposing armed bands).&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.154-158&lt;/ref&gt; The war between England and Scotland of 1480-84 put the border courts into abeyance once more, but Edward did not want them dismantled and his successor, [[Richard III of England]], despite his enmity towards the Scots, revived them.

In 1484, Richard and James made an attempt (like many monarchs before them) to lessen the power of their 'over-mighty subjects' in the border lands by separating the wardenial work from that of the Conservators of the truce. The indenture signed between them made the Wardens strictly responsible for military operations, but the chasing down and prosecution of criminals in the borders remained in the hands of 'lesser' lords who had intimate knowledge of local affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

==March law, 1485-1603==
Despite the animosity between [[Henry VII of England]] and [[James IV of Scotland]], as well as the reluctance of the borderers themselves to agree to any truce between the two countries, March law continued to be used during the late fifteenth-century and early sixteenth-century. The [[Treaty of Ayton]] of 1497 had provisions for border law and its administration, particularly concerning the apprehending and safe keeping of march-related suspects. The treaty of peace and marriage of 1502 had clauses related to how the Wardens or their deputies should notify their opposite march officials within ten days of the arrest of suspects and of the charges against the latter. Those charged with homicide were to be taken to a day of march, and if convicted by a mixed English and Scottish panel, were to be handed over to the appropriate Warden for punishment (the death penalty). Limited raids of reprisals were allowed, both on land and at sea. The Crowns were to supervise the days of march rigorously and local men and civil lawyers would be appointed as conservators.

On the English side, Henry continued the practice of Richard III who had been awarded the wardenship of the West march when Duke of Gloucester, and, on becoming King, had retained the title of Warden, appointing a lieutenant or deputy-warden to do the work. From now on, Wardenships were to be held by royal princes and the lieutenants were to be drawn from the ranks of the lesser gentry (such as the Dacres). Done to save expense, as well as to reduce the power of the great northern magnates, this act saw the beginning of the end of the wardenship as it had been previously and the rise of the [[Council of the North]] to prominence cemented this development.

March law continued under Henry's Tudor successors, only being abolished when the [[Union of the Crowns]] took place and [[James VI of England]] dealt a final blow to the [[Border reivers]].&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.170-174&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop of Carlisle, [[William Nicolson]], in his 1705 compilation of treaties called ''Leges Marchiarum'' that dealt with border law, included those of 1533 ([[Henry VIII of England]]); 1549 ([[Edward VI of England]]); 1553 ([[Mary I of England]]); 1563 and 1596 (both of [[Elizabeth I of England]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=William|title=Leges marchiarum : or, border laws...|location=London|publisher=printed for Tim.

==March law and English common law==
March law persisted in use on the Anglo-Scottish border, often against the wishes of English monarchs, (Edward I, for example, attempted to abolish it in favour of a uniform common law system), for several reasons.

Firstly, although there was a northern [[Assizes|assize]] circuit in operation in mediaeval times, " as the kings of England quickly learned after 1237, the substantive and procedural rules of the common law were ill-equipped to cope with the problems attendant on the establishment of an artificial political boundary." In particular, it was impossible to use the common law procedures to obtain redress and reparation from those who gave alleigance to another country.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.191, 193&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the constant warfare or threat of warfare, as well as the threat of armed raiders, meant that justices were reluctant to travel north to carry out their duties.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional factors for the longevity of a separate border law include: the possible existence of a discrete "borderland" province, where allegiances were not so much to the distant centres of government but were more local in nature (Strathclyde British, Norse, Angles, Scots, Anglo-Saxon and Normans had all contributed to the border area's mix of peoples); the fluidity of the border itself;
the lack of royal landholding in the borders leading to a reliance on local magnates, such as the Percies and Douglases, who were given quasi-judicial power as Warden-Conservators and who filled a judicial "vacuum in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neville|first=Cynthia J.|title=Scottish influences on the mediaeval laws of the Anglo-Scottish marches|journal=Scottish historical journal|volume=81|issue=2|date=October 2002|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these factors, however, March law was seen by the monarchs of the two countries as being supplemental to their respective domestic law, and not as a substitute for the latter. In England, the common law still operated alongside March law during the whole period.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1994, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==March law and [[Scots law]]==
Neville makes a case for Scottish legal practice, (or Scottish custom at least), having more of an influence on the development of March law than English common law, claiming March law to be "a system of law that drew heavily, if not primarily, on Scottish legal practices." &lt;ref&gt;Neville, 2002, p.161-184, p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the use of "hand and horne" (also known as "hot and cold trod" from the fifteenth-century on) in the pursuit of stolen goods, which was similar to the English [[hue and cry]] but permitting the crossing of borders, was a Scottish custom. Similarly, trial by combat remained a feature of Scottish, and border, practice when its use was declining in England, and the use of mixed (English and Scottish) juries "approximated Scottish legal practice more closely than they did those of English juries."&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 2002, p.172-3, 175&lt;/ref&gt; The use of pledges and sureties 
(" inborch" and "utborch"), reparation by a convicted person ("assythment"), and the use of [[distraint]], known as "poinding" in the borders, were all Scottish features.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 2002, p.176-178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Days of march : practicalities==
The indentures to the truce of 1398 stipulate that days of march (also known as "days of truce") should be held monthly.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was never adhered to, for a number of reasons: the hostility of the new Lancastrian regime put border law into abeyance soon after the indenture was signed, and the increase of violence amongst the border magnates (particularly between the Percy and Douglas families) disrupted the workings of the law. In later times, it may simply have been that mutual dislike between the opposing Wardens, or political tactics, was enough to cause extensive delays.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.127&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the places designated for the days of truce, most seem to have been, by the sixteenth- century, on the Scottish side of the border line.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to that century, various favourite places were used and included Hadden Stank, Redden Burn, and [[Lochmaben]] in the Scottish West marches (plus [[Gretna, Scotland|Gretna]], [[Dumfries]] and Lilliot Cross occasionally). In the Scottish middle march, Cocklaw near [[Roxburgh]] and Redeswire ([[Carter Bar]]) were used. In the English West march, the Sands in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Rockcliffe, Cumbria|Rockcliffe]] and [[Kershopefoot]] were used and in the East, [[Norham]], [[Coldstream]], [[Wark on Tweed|Wark]], [[Ebchester]] and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] were mentioned in the records.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|publisher=Ordnance Survey|title=In search of the border reivers : new historical map and guide featuring over 800 reiver sites|edition=1998|ISBN=0319009378}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Lochmaben Stone - geograph.org.uk - 1055490.jpg|thumb|left| The [[Lochmaben Stone]], a meeting-place for truces on the Border]]

Once the place and date had been arranged, and the elaborate precautions taken at the coming together of the two sides, the bills of complaint against those of the opposite nation were presented to the Warden of one's own March.  These were then passed on to the Warden of the opposite March and the accused were summoned and those to face punishment were presented. Bills were 'fouled' (a guilty verdict given), 'cleared' (an innocent verdict), or 'fouled conditionally' (an assumption of guilt because the accused had failed to turn up).&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.128-131&lt;/ref&gt;

The truce period was supposed to last until the sunrise of the day following the end of the day, or days, of truce, although occasionally this did not happen (as with the taking by the English of [[Kinmont Willie Armstrong|Kinmont Willie]] at the breaking up of a truce day at Kershopefoot in 1596).&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.284-299&lt;/ref&gt;

==Days of march : purpose and effectiveness==
Ostensibly, March law was used as a dispute settlement procedure. However, the days of march and the use of March law also had a political and diplomatic dimension.

At a time when raiding across the border and fighting between armed bands threatened to escalate into open warfare between the two countries, the use of days of march and March law was useful in defusing the situation. In negotiatons between the two countries, truce-time infringements were discussed in an effort to smooth the rocky diplomatic road. This linking of national and local concerns at "great days of march" (when ambassadors might be present as well as the Warden-Conservators) was a deliberate ploy from Edward III's time onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, 1998, p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the irregular contact between the Wardens of both sides helped to maintain a "back-channel" between the two Crowns.

March law did not stop raiding across the border between England and Scotland, but it did offer a safety valve that prevented such raids from breaking out into open warfare between the two countries. It was most effective when there was a truce between the realms and least effective during times of war. It was the only mechanism available that offered any chance of compensation for losses and the apprehending of cross-border fugitives.

The effectiveness of March law depended heavily on the energy and probity of the Warden-Conservators and their deputies (many of both of which were in league with the reivers). An example of the continual problem (almost the continual impossibility) of enforcing the law, is given in the preamble to the 1563 indenture, which bemoans the "negligence of some officers, and lack of due execution of the laws and orders of the said marches of both the realms." &lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, 1705, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Frustration and vendettas sometimes led to lynch law, outside the ambit of March law, an example being King James V's order to hang Johnnie Armstrong and his followers without trial in 1530.
[[File:John Armstrong memorial - geograph.org.uk - 1039517.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Johnnie Armstrong]]

Although Neville lays emphasis on the mixed jury of English and Scottish, Fraser shows how, in the sixteenth-century at least, bills of complaint brought to the days of march could also be settled by the process of 'avower' (an 'avower' being a "countryman of the accused's, acceptable as a referee to both plaintiff and defendant, who would swear to the truth of the case"). The third method of determining the result was by the Warden's oath (where the Warden declared, on his honour, that the case was a valid one) &lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.130&lt;/ref&gt; All three methods were open to abuse : the avower might be in a feud with someone and not impartial; an accused could be quit of the charge merely by means of an oath of innocence; witnesses or the defendants sometimes simply did not turn up to the day of march (despite penalties for not doing so); the Wardens tried to maintain a balance of reparations between Scots and English, and this meant that lesser cases did not get heard; intimidation by the reivers' armed members present at the day of march must have been another factor.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.131-135&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to know just how many bills of complaint were put forward to the Wardens as a proportion of the actual victims of raiding. An alternative was to instigate a " hot trod" (within six days of the offence taking place, otherwise it became a "cold trod"). This was a lawful posse of men who had the right under the trod rules to recover stolen property and to even cross the border in doing so. The trod was fraught with danger as those taking part were sometimes ambushed by the ones being pursued and the opportunities for double-dealing were large. A third alternative, to execute a reprisal raid on the original raiders, was equally dangerous. It may be, therefore, that those who used March law and the days of march were those who did not have sufficient allies and family members to carry out a trod or reprisal.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.89-95&lt;/ref&gt;

An indication, perhaps, of the ineffectiveness of March law was the addition of judicial powers during the sixteenth-century, when conditions seemed to have deteriorated markedly across the Marches. There were three types of ways in which judicial action was removed from the ambit of March law: armed judicial expeditions sanctioned by the monarch (usually the Scottish one), Warden-led reprisals officially sanctioned and carried out across the borderline ('Warden rodes'), and, thirdly, encouraging (or not discouraging) reivers to undertake their own reprisals (this was illegal in terms of March law, of course).&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.167, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the kinship ties between the border 'clans' (across the border line as well as either side of it), which meant that the Wardens could often not trust their officers to carry out their orders;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.50-51&lt;/ref&gt; given the threats to potential witnesses; the use of [[blackmail]] (a word first heard of in the borderlands of England and Scotland); and given the collusion of some of the local magnates, lairds and Wardens, it is not surprising that March law "could and did sometimes work surprisingly well, but it was at best a [[Finger in the dike|finger in the dyke]]." &lt;ref&gt;Fraser, 1971, p.xxi&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan''''', 458 U.S. 718 (1982), was a case decided 5-4 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The court held that the [[Single-sex education|single-sex admissions]] policy of the [[Mississippi University for Women]] violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan|458|718|1982}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of the case==
The Mississippi University for Women was established in 1884 in [[Columbus, Mississippi]] and originally called the Industrial Institute and College, later changed to Mississippi State College for Women. It was the first state-supported [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college in the United States]]. In 1971, the School of Nursing was established, initially offering a two-year [[associate's degree]], and later four-year [[baccalaureate degree]] and [[graduate degree]] programs.

In 1979, Joe Hogan, a [[registered nurse]] and nursing supervisor in Columbus who did not have a baccalaureate degree in nursing, applied for admission to the MUW School of Nursing's baccalaureate program.  Although he was otherwise qualified, he was denied admission to the School of Nursing. School officials provided the option to [[Academic audit|audit courses]] in which he was interested, but he could not enroll for credit because he was male. Hogan could have attended classes and received credit in one of Mississippi's two [[Public university|public]], [[coeducation]]al programs leading to a [[Bachelor of Science in Nursing]], but these were at the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]] (178 miles from Columbus) and the [[University of Mississippi]] in [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]] (114 miles from Columbus). Hogan filed an [[Lawsuit|action]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi]], claiming the single-sex admissions policy of MUW's School of Nursing violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment, and seeking [[Injunction|injunctive]] and [[declaratory relief]] as well as [[compensatory damages]].

==Case history==
The District Court ruled in favor of the Mississippi University for Women, concluding that maintenance of MUW as a single-sex school bears a [[Rational basis review|rational relationship]] to the State's legitimate interest "in providing the greatest practical range of educational opportunities for its female student population." The court held that the admissions policy was not arbitrary:  providing single-sex schools is consistent with a respected, though by no means universally accepted, educational theory that single-sex education affords unique benefits to students. Stating that the case presented no issue of fact, the court informed Hogan that it would enter [[summary judgment]] dismissing his claim unless he tendered a factual issue. When Hogan offered no further evidence, the District Court entered summary judgment in favor of the State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mensbiz.net/subpage%20mississippi%20university.html{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] reversed, holding that because the admissions policy discriminated on the basis of gender, a rational relationship test was improper, and the proper test was whether the gender-based admissions policy was [[Intermediate scrutiny|substantially related]] to an important governmental objective. The court, while recognizing that the State has a significant interest in providing educational opportunities for all its citizens, found that the State failed to show that providing a unique educational opportunity for females but not for males had any substantial relationship to that interest.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Supreme Court's ruling did not require that the entire university become coeducational; however, the Board of Trustees of Mississippi State Institutions of Higher Learning ordered the university to change its policies to allow the admission of qualified males into all university programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihl.state.ms.us/universities.html&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2005-2006 academic year, MUW’s student body was approximately 15% male.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ihl.state.ms.us/research/fast_facts_0506.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court's ruling also did not require the school to change the name of the school, and as a result the school remains "Mississippi University for Women." Suits have been filed against the university to change the name claiming that its name and mission discourage males from applying for admission. These suits were dismissed as groundless and had no effect on the name.

In 2002, the administration of the university considered changing the name&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muw.edu/publicaffairs/2002_prnews/021119_name_change_1.html |title=MUW |publisher=Muw.edu |date=2002-11-19 |accessdate=2012-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206012907/http://www.muw.edu/publicaffairs/2002_prnews/021119_name_change_1.html |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pursued efforts to do so despite opposition, particularly from alumnae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meridianstar.com/local/x681116449/MUW-name-change-doesn-t-sit-well-with-some-locals |title=MUW name change doesn’t sit well with some locals |publisher=Meridian Star |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her convocation speech on August 11, 2008, President Limbert announced a new proposal to remove "women" from the university's name which was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdispatch.com/articles/2008/08/11/local_news/local02.txt |accessdate=August 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708130305/http://www.cdispatch.com/articles/2008/08/11/local_news/local02.txt |archivedate=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57537">[[File:Palacky Court Room 1.JPG|thumb|A law school's moot courtroom]]
'''Moot court''' is an [[extracurricular activity]] at many [[law school]]s in which participants take part in simulated court or [[arbitration]] proceedings, usually involving drafting memorials or memoranda and participating in [[oral argument]]. In most countries, the phrase "moot court" may be shortened to simply "moot" or "mooting". Participants are either referred to as "mooters" or, less conventionally, "mooties".

Moot court involves a simulated [[appellate court]] (appellate advocacy) or arbitral case, which is different from a [[mock trial]] that involves a simulated [[jury trial]] or [[bench trial]] (trial advocacy). Moot court does not involve actual [[testimony]] by witnesses, [[cross-examination]], or the presentation of [[evidence law|evidence]], but is focused solely on the application of the law to a common set of evidentiary assumptions, facts, and clarifications/corrections to which the competitors are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D.|last2=Kind|first2=Vanessa|date=2017-09-12|title=Using a moot to develop students’ understanding of human cloning and statutory interpretation|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0968533217726350|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|doi=10.1177/0968533217726350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not a moot in the traditional sense, [[alternative dispute resolution]] competitions focusing on [[mediation]] and [[negotiation]] have also branded themselves as moot competitions in recent times, as had role-playing competitions in the past.

Moot court is one of the key extracurricular activities in many law schools (the others being [[law review]] and [[legal clinic|clinical work]] around the world). Depending on the competition, students may spend a semester researching and writing the written submissions or memorials, and another semester practicing their oral arguments, or may prepare both within the span of a few weeks. Whereas domestic moot court competitions tend to focus on municipal law such as [[criminal law]] or [[contract law]], regional and international moot competitions tend to focus on subjects such as [[public international law]], [[international human rights law]], [[international humanitarian law]], [[international criminal law]], [[international trade law]], international [[maritime law]], international commercial [[arbitration]], and [[foreign direct investment]] arbitration. [[Procedural law|Procedural issues]] pertaining to [[jurisdiction]], [[standing (law)|standing]], and [[choice of law]] are also occasionally engaged, especially in arbitration moots.

In most moot court competitions, each side is represented by two speakers or oralists (though the entire team composition may be larger) and a third member, sometimes known as of counsel, may be seated with the speakers. Each speaker usually speaks between 10 and 25 minutes, covering one to three main issues. After the main submissions are completed, there will usually be a short round of rebuttal and even surrebuttal. Depending on the format of the moot, there may be one or two rounds of rebuttal and surrebuttal, and communications between speakers may or may not be prohibited. Throughout the course of the submissions, judges may ask questions, though in some competitions questions are reserved to the end of submissions. In larger competitions, teams have to participate in up to ten rounds; the knockout/elimination stages are usually preceded by a number of preliminary rounds to determine seeding (power seeding is often used). Teams almost always must switch sides (applicant/appellant/claimant on one side, and respondent on the other) throughout a competition, and, depending on the format of the moot, the moot problem usually remains the same throughout. The scores of the written submissions are taken into consideration for most competitions to determine qualification and seeding, and sometimes even up to a particular knockout stage.

==International moot court competitions==
International moot competitions are generally targeted at students and only allow participants who have not [[bar examination|qualified to practice law]] in any jurisdiction. However, there are a handful of international moot competitions that are targeted at young lawyers, such as the [[Essex Court Chambers-Singapore Academy of Law Moot|ECC-SAL Moot]], which is a regional moot started in 2012 and is jointly organised by [[Essex Court Chambers]] and the [[Singapore Academy of Law]]. 

The first table below lists some of the more notable international moot competitions for students, the second table lists the champions and finalists for the major or grand slam competitions, while the third and final table lists the champions and finalists for the minors and regionals. Major or grand slam international moots typically refer to class-leading moots or those that attract a substantial number of teams, while smaller or less established and region-only competitions are known as minors and regionals respectively; "international" class moots are sandwiched between grand slams and minors and regionals in terms of scale and prestige.&lt;ref name="lawgazette.com.sg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lawgazette.com.sg/news/events/another-season-record-breaking-international-moot-court-achievements-smu/|title=Another Season of Record-Breaking International Moot Court Achievements (SMU) - The Singapore Law Gazette|date=1 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/smu-team-wins-moot-contest-in-the-hague|title=SMU team wins moot contest in The Hague|first=|last=hermes|date=15 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lawgazette18"/&gt; Some countries also divide competitions into various tiers of prestige for the purpose of awarding points in league tables, with moots such as the [[Jessup Moot|Jessup]] and [[Vis Moot|Vis]] competitions being considered as belonging to the highest tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legallyindia.com/the-bench-and-the-bar/mooting-premier-league-is-back-mpl-7-sees-nliu-nalsar-uils-nls-lead-after-strong-start-in-2016-00011130-8208|title=Mooting Premier League is back: MPL 7 sees Nalsar, UILS, NLS, NLIU lead after strong 2016 start|first=Kian|last=Ganz|website=www.legallyindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operation====
Law schools structure their moot court programs differently. Some moot court organizations accept a small group of people for membership, and those members each participate in a number of national or regional moot court competitions. Other schools accept a larger number of members, and each member is matched with one competition. A few schools conduct moot court entirely intramurally. Moot court competitions are typically sponsored by organizations with interest in one particular area of law, and the moot court problems address an issue in that field. Competitions are often judged by legal practitioners with expertise in the particular area of law, or sometimes by sitting judges.

The basic structure of a moot court competition roughly parallels what would happen in actual appellate practice. Participants will typically receive a problem ahead of time, which includes the facts of the underlying case, and often an [[Legal opinion|opinion]] from a lower court that is being challenged in the problem. Students must then research and prepare for that case as if they were lawyers or advocates for one or sometimes both of the parties. Depending on the competition, participants will be required to submit written [[legal brief|briefs]], participate in oral argument, or both. The case or problem is often one of current interest, sometimes mimicking an actual case, and sometimes fabricated to address difficult legal issues.

A number of moot court competitions focus on specific areas of law. For example, the [[First Amendment Center]] annually holds a National First Amendment Moot Court Competition, in which the judges have included numerous [[United States court of appeals|United States Circuit Court]] judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?item=moot_court National First Amendment Moot Court Competition].&lt;/ref&gt;

====The American Collegiate Moot Court Association====
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
In the United States, undergraduates experience moot court in a variety of disciplines and a variety of settings. The most common are in-class exercises that are assigned by professors. Other schools actually form competitive teams. These teams often compete in intramural events, some in statewide competitions, or they can enter tournaments sponsored by the [[American Collegiate Moot Court Association]]. While undergraduate moot court is still a relatively new [[forensics]] activity, when compared with speech and debate and intercollegiate [[mock trial]], by 2010, there were 248 teams who competed at the regional tournaments. The regional tournaments vary by size, but there is a standardized process for awarding bids to nationals. Currently, teams that finish in the top 25 percent of each regional earn an automatic bid to the national tournament. The remainder of the 64 team field is awarded to at-large teams with the best records at the qualifying events. No school can earn more than eight bids to the national field. ACMA tournaments currently have three preliminary rounds and a series of elimination rounds are very much like the “sudden death”/”one-and-done” nature of the NCAA basketball tournament. The qualifying tournaments are held during the fall semester, most are in November, and the championship tournament is in mid-January.

Undergraduate moot court cases pose two certified questions. The case (known as the “record”) includes an appellate majority opinion and a dissent. The “library” is a closed one. Typically, the record includes twenty opinions that students can rely upon for their arguments. Rules allow them to refer to cases cited in the cases directly included in the record. However, they can only rely on these cases within cases to the degree that they were used by the authorities directly in the record. All teams competing in ACMA-sponsored events will argue the same case. ACMA students have engaged in oral argument on issues such as [[same-sex marriage]], national health care, privacy under the 4th Amendment, life terms for minors who are not guilty of [[murder]] or [[attempted murder]], [[freedom of religion]], a federal ban on firearms on school grounds, and warrantless domestic [[wiretapping]] of suspected terrorists. Cases are written by the ACMA. The case problem is released on the ACMA website by May 1 of each year.

Undergraduate moot court teams consist of two oral advocates. The advocates are responsible for knowing both issues&amp;nbsp;– but typically are only asked about one certified question. Each team will receive 20 minutes to argue its case, and each advocate must speak for a minimum of seven minutes. Teams are judged on their forensics, knowledge of the law, demeanor, and ability to answer questions from the bench.

Good judges are the key to a good moot court hearing. Judges are typically lawyers or members of the state or federal bench. At times, law students (especially those with past undergraduate moot court experience) are asked to judge. Past judges at ACMA events have included former US Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] and federal judges [[Otis Wright]] and [[George Schiavelli]].

The ACMA also sponsors a brief writing contest. Students are not required to prepare briefs in order to compete for the oral advocacy national title. Teams who enter follow a specific set of rules and compete for prizes. The competition is judged by lawyers and law professors. This competition is named for the late Sandra Knerr, who along with her husband, was a dedicated supporter of intercollegiate moot court.

===United Kingdom===
The courts systems differ in various parts of the [[United Kingdom]]. Thus, the style of a moot will often vary depending in which jurisdiction it is to be heard, although some national competitions do exist. The principal differences are between the laws in [[Scotland]] and those in [[England and Wales]].

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales the moot will typically simulate proceedings in either the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] or the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]]. Moot questions generally involve two [[questions of law]] that are under dispute and come with a set of facts about the case that have been decided at the first instance trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlight.demon.co.uk/law/mooting/first.html#facts|title=Mooting Net - How to Moot I|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the question will surround a subject that is unclear under the present state of the law and for which no direct precedent exists. Mooting is a team effort, consisting of senior or lead [[counsel]] and junior counsel. It is normal practice for the senior counsel to take on the first point and the junior the second; although this may vary depending upon the exact nature, and necessary length, of the arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlight.demon.co.uk/law/mooting/first.html#split|title=Mooting Net - How to Moot I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the question will focus on one area of law, e.g. [[tort]], [[contract]], [[criminal law]] or [[property law]].

The question will be provided to the teams a few weeks in advance of the moot along with details as to which of the [[appellant]] or [[wikt:respondent|respondent]] they are to represent. It is then up to each team to prepare their case as though they were [[barrister]]s. Authority for each argument is necessary and will usually take the form of precedent from [[case law]] but may also involve [[legislation]]. Reliance may also be placed on governmental papers, research from [[NGO]]s and academic journals and texts.

A few days before the moot takes place each team will prepare and exchange their skeleton arguments or [[legal brief|brief]]. Copies will also be provided to the judge along with the moot problem. The judge is normally an academic or practising solicitor or barrister. The moot itself takes the form of an [[oral argument]]. The competition may also allow the appellants an additional few minutes in order to reply to the respondents arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstlight.demon.co.uk/law/mooting/day.html#reply|title=Mooting Net - How to Moot II&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the presentation of arguments has concluded, the judge will retire to deliberate on both the law and the overall winning of the moot. A moot is not won and lost on the legal argument, but on the advocacy skills of the participants. It is often the case that the team that has the weaker legal argument is in a better position as they have to argue that much more persuasively.

====Scotland====
In [[Scots Law|Scotland]] a moot can be set in a variety of fora; in civil law problems it is set most commonly in either the Inner House of the [[Court of Session]] or in the [[House of Lords]], although it is not uncommon for a moot to be heard in the [[Sheriff Court]] before the Sheriff or Sheriff Principal. Occasionally, an [[Employment Appeal Tribunal]] may also be used as a forum for a Scottish civil law moot. If the moot problem concerns Criminal Law, the moot will most likely be heard as though in the Appellate division of the [[High Court of Justiciary]] (commonly known as the Court of Criminal Appeal).

The moot points and style of the problem are similar to that of England and Wales stated above; however, the format of the moot is significantly different. Junior counsel is more likely to take the first moot point and senior counsel the second (this can however be reversed depending on the problem). The format of the moot is far more adversarial than that of English and Welsh moots. This is primarily due to a more adversarial legal system. This manifests itself in different ways, most notably with the appellants and respondents facing each other during a moot, rather than, as in England and Wales, facing the judge.

There is only one national Scottish competition, the Alexander Stone National Legal Debate, administered by the Law School at the [[University of Glasgow]]. All Scottish universities that offer the LL.B. are eligible to take part, although in recent years the competition has been fought out mainly between Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Strathclyde universities. The final is held in the Alexander Stone Court Room at the University of Glasgow in February or March each year. There are also several annual inter-varsity competitions between law schools, including the Glasgow Sheriff's Cup (the University of Glasgow v the University of Strathclyde) and the Granite City Moot ([[the University of Aberdeen]] v [[Robert Gordon University]]). These competitions are ordinarily judged by a [[Senator of the College of Justice]]. 

Law schools also take part in UK-wide competitions, such as the [[Oxford University Press]] and the [[English Speaking Union Moot]]. These moots are UK-wide in participation, but typically follow the style and law of moots in England and Wales. The University of Glasgow reached the semi-final of the English Speaking Union moot in 2008 and the final in 2005. The University of Dundee reached the semi finals of The Oxford University Press moots in 2009.

Judges in Scottish moots are typically legal academics, solicitors, sheriffs, advocates or Senators of the College of Justice.

===India===
Surana and Surana International Attorneys have been conducting various moot competitions from mid 1990s including Surana &amp; Surana International Technology Law Moot Court Competition, Surana &amp; Surana National Corporate Law Moot Court Competition, and [[Surana and Surana Moots|Surana &amp; Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition]].

[[Image:Note_verbale_model.PNG|thumb|right|A typical note verbale will have the country's emblem on the top left.]]
'''Note verbale''' ({{IPA-fr|nɔt vɛʁ.bal}}, '''verbal note''') is a piece of [[diplomatic correspondence]] prepared in the third person and unsigned: less formal than a note (also called a [[letter of protest]]) but more formal than an [[aide-mémoire]]. A note verbale can also be referred to as a '''third person note''' (TPN). 

==Example==

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Ukrainian party categorically denies extension of sovereignty of the Russian Federation on Ukrainian territory, and reserves the right to exercise measures in accordance with international law and the laws of Ukraine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Pacifism''' is opposition to [[war]], [[militarism]], or [[violence]]. The word ''pacifism'' was coined by the French peace campaigner [[Émile Arnaud]] (1864–1921) and adopted by other peace activists at the tenth Universal Peace Congress in [[Glasgow]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;''The Abolition of War: the Peace Movement in Britain, 1914–1919'' by [[Keith Robbins]]. University of Wales Press, 1976. {{ISBN|978-0-7083-0622-2}} (p.10).&lt;/ref&gt; A related term is ''[[ahimsa]]'' (to do no harm), which is a core philosophy in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. While modern connotations are recent, having been explicated since the 19th century, ancient references abound.

In modern times, interest was revived by [[Leo Tolstoy]] in his late works, particularly in ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]''. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (1869–1948) propounded the practice of steadfast [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent opposition]] which he called "[[satyagraha]]", instrumental in its role in the [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Its effectiveness served as inspiration to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], [[James Bevel]],&lt;ref&gt;James L. Bevel, The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement" by Randy Kryn, a paper in [[David Garrow]]'s 1989 book ''We Shall Overcome, Volume II'', Carlson Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]&lt;ref name="aavw.org"&gt;"Searching for the Enemy of Man", in Nhat Nanh, Ho Huu Tuong, Tam Ich, Bui Giang, Pham Cong Thien. ''Dialogue''. Saigon: La Boi, 1965. P.&amp;nbsp;11–20., archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website, [http://www.aavw.org/protest/king_journey_abstract09.html King's Journey: 1964 - April 4, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt; and many others in the [[civil rights movement]].

== Definition ==
Pacifism covers a spectrum of views, including the belief that international disputes can and should be peacefully resolved, calls for the abolition of the institutions of the military and war, opposition to any organization of society through governmental force ([[anarcho-pacifism|anarchist or libertarian pacifism]]), rejection of the use of physical violence to obtain political, economic or social goals,  the obliteration of force, and opposition to violence under any circumstance, even defence of self and others. Historians of pacifism [[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Thomas Paul Socknat define pacifism "in the sense generally accepted in English-speaking areas" as "an unconditional rejection of all forms of warfare".&lt;ref&gt;''Challenge to Mars: Essays on Pacifism from 1918 to 1945''. Edited by Brock and Socknat University of Toronto Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8020-4371-2}} (p. ix)&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Jenny Teichman]] defines the main form of pacifism as "anti-warism", the rejection of all forms of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism and the Just War: A Study in Applied Philosophy'' by Jenny Teichman. Basil Blackwell, 1986
{{ISBN|0-631-15056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teichman's beliefs have been summarized by [[Brian Orend]] as "...&amp;nbsp;A pacifist rejects war and believes there are no moral grounds which can justify resorting to war. War, for the pacifist, is always wrong." In a sense the philosophy is based on the idea that the ends do not justify the means.&lt;ref&gt;''War and International Justice: a Kantian perspective'' by Brian Orend. Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-88920-337-7}} p.&amp;nbsp;145–6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral considerations ===

[[File:Pacifista Arresto.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-war activist arrested in [[San Francisco]] during the March 2003 protests against the war in [[Iraq]]]]
Pacifism may be based on [[morality|moral]] principles (a [[deontological]] view) or [[pragmatism]] (a [[consequentialist]] view). Principled pacifism holds that at some point along the spectrum from war to interpersonal physical violence, such violence becomes morally wrong. Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and interpersonal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found. Pacifists generally reject theories of [[Just War]].

=== Nonviolence ===
Some pacifists follow principles of [[nonviolence]], believing that nonviolent action is morally superior and/or most effective. Some however, support physical violence for emergency defence of self or others. Others support [[property damage|destruction of property]] in such emergencies or for conducting symbolic acts of resistance like pouring red paint to represent blood on the outside of military recruiting offices or entering air force bases and hammering on military aircraft.

Not all [[nonviolent resistance]] (sometimes also called [[civil resistance]]) is based on a fundamental rejection of all violence in all circumstances. Many leaders and participants in such movements, while recognizing the importance of using non-violent methods in particular circumstances, have not been absolute pacifists. Sometimes, as with the civil rights movement's march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, they have called for armed protection. The interconnections between civil resistance and factors of force are numerous and complex.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]. Includes chapters by specialists on the various movements.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute pacifism===

An absolute pacifist is generally described by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] as one who believes that human life is so valuable, that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense. The principle is described as difficult to abide by consistently, due to violence not being available as a tool to aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815030756/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/against/pacifism_1.shtml|title=Ethics - War: Pacifism|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/against/pacifism_1.shtml|website=BBC|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Police actions and national liberation==
Although all pacifists are opposed to war between [[nation states]], there have been occasions where pacifists have supported military conflict in the case of [[civil war]] or [[revolution]].&lt;ref name="ffw"&gt;"When the American Civil War broke out&amp;nbsp;... both the American Peace Society and many former nonresistants argued that the conflict was not properly war but rather police action on a grand scale" Brock, Peter, ''Freedom from War: Nonsectarian Pacifism, 1814–1914'' University of Toronto Press, 1991 {{ISBN|0-8020-5883-3}}, (p. 176)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, during the [[American Civil War]], both the [[American Peace Society]] and some former members of the [[Non-Resistance Society]] supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]'s military campaign, arguing they were carrying out a "[[police action]]" against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose act of [[Secession]] they regarded as criminal.&lt;ref name="ffw" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Valarie H., ''The Advocates of Peace in Antebellum America''. Mercer University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-726-2}} (p.158).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], French pacifist [[René Gérin]] (1892–1957) urged support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].&lt;ref name="tpod"&gt;Ingram, Norman. ''The Politics of Dissent : Pacifism in France, 1919–1939''. University of Edinburgh, 1988.  (p. 219)&lt;/ref&gt; Gérin argued that the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Nationalists]] were "comparable to an individual enemy" and the Republic's war effort was equivalent to the action of a domestic police force suppressing crime.&lt;ref name="tpod"/&gt;

In the 1960s, some pacifists associated with the [[New Left]] supported [[wars of national liberation]] and supported groups such as the [[Viet Cong]] and the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], arguing peaceful attempts to liberate such nations were no longer viable, and war was thus the only option.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century'', by Peter Brock and [[Nigel Young]]. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}}  (p.296)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early traditions of pacifism==
[[File:Apotheosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Vasily Vereshchagin|Vereshchagin]]'s painting ''[[The Apotheosis of War]]'' (1871) came to be admired as one of the earliest artistic expressions of pacifism]]
Advocacy of pacifism can be found far back in history and literature.

===China===
During the [[Warring States period]], the pacifist [[Mohist]] School opposed aggressive war between the feudal states. They took this belief into action by using their famed defensive strategies to defend smaller states from invasion from larger states, hoping to dissuade feudal lords from costly warfare. The [[Seven Military Classics]] of ancient China view warfare negatively, and as a last resort. For example, the ''[[Three Strategies of Huang Shigong]]'' says: "As for the military, it is not an auspicious instrument; it is the way of heaven to despise it", and the ''[[Wei Liaozi]]'' writes: "As for the military, it is an inauspicious instrument; as for conflict and contention, it runs counter to virtue".&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Realism: Strategic Culture and Grand Strategy in Chinese History|first=Alastair I|last=Johnston|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1998|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lemba===
The [[Lemba people|Lemba]] religion of southern French Congo, along with its symbolic herb, is named for pacifism : "''lemba, lemba''" (peace, peace), describes the action of the plant ''lemba-lemba'' (''Brillantaisia patula T.

===Moriori===
[[File:Chatham Island Tree Carving.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Moriori tree carving found in the Chatham Islands.]]
The [[Moriori people|Moriori]], of the [[Chatham Islands]], practiced pacifism by order of their ancestor [[Nunuku-whenua]]. This enabled the Moriori to preserve what limited resources they had in their harsh climate, avoiding waste through warfare. In turn, this led to their almost complete annihilation in 1835 by invading [[Ngāti Mutunga]] and [[Ngāti Tama]] [[Māori people|Māori]] from the [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]] region of the [[North Island]] of New Zealand. The invading Māori killed, enslaved and [[cannibalism|cannibalised]] the Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled : "[The Maori] commenced to kill us like sheep&amp;nbsp;... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed - men, women and children indiscriminately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]] | publisher = W.W.

===Greece===
In [[Ancient Greece]], pacifism seems not to have existed except as a broad moral guideline against violence between individuals. No philosophical program of rejecting violence between states, or rejecting all forms of violence, seems to have existed. Aristophanes, in his play [[Lysistrata]], creates the scenario of an [[Athens|Athenian]] woman's anti-war sex strike during the [[Peloponnesian War]] of 431–404 BC, and the play has gained an international reputation for its anti-war message. Nevertheless, it is both fictional and comical, and though it offers a pragmatic opposition to the destructiveness of war, its message seems to stem from frustration with the existing conflict (then in its twentieth year) rather than from a philosophical position against violence or war. Equally fictional is the nonviolent protest of [[Hegetorides]] of [[Thasos]]. [[Euripides]] also expressed strong anti-war ideas in his work, especially ''[[The Trojan Women]]''.&lt;ref name="fsn"&gt;"Peace, War and Philosophy" by F. S. Northedge, in [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Volume 6, Collier Macmillan, 1967 (pgs&amp;nbsp;63–67).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
Several Roman writers rejected the militarism of Roman society and gave voice to anti-war sentiments,&lt;ref name="fsn" /&gt;
including [[Propertius]], [[Tibullus]] and [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;''Restless Youth in Ancient Rome'', Emiel Eyben, Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0-203-16848-8}},  p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Seneca the Younger]] criticised warfare in his book ''[[Naturales quaestiones]]'' (circa 65 AD).&lt;ref&gt;''Panorama of the Classical World'' by Nigel Spivey and Michael Squire. Getty Publications, 2011, {{ISBN|1-60606-056-2}} (p.200).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{See also|Christian pacifism}}
Throughout history many have understood [[Jesus]] of Nazareth to have been a pacifist,&lt;ref name="weidhorn"&gt;{{Cite journal|  first =Manfred |last = Weidhorn | title = Pacifism Lost | journal = International Journal of Humanities and Peace | year = 2004 | volume = 20|issue = 1|pages = 13–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on his [[Sermon on the Mount]]. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should "not resist an evildoer" and promoted his [[turn the other cheek]] philosophy. "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well&amp;nbsp;... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Matthew+5 oremus Bible Browser : Matthew 5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Luke+6 oremus Bible Browser : Luke 6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aqa"&gt;{{Cite book| title = GCSE Religious Studies for AQA Christianity: Christianity: Behaviour, Attitudes &amp; Lifestyles | first = Joanne | last = Cleave |author2=Geddes, Gordon D. |author3=Griffiths, Jane | publisher = Heinemann Educational Publisher | location = Oxford | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-435-30714-2 | page = 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Testament story is of Jesus, besides preaching these words, surrendering himself freely to an enemy intent on having him killed and proscribing his followers from defending him.

There are those, however, who deny that Jesus was a pacifist&lt;ref name="weidhorn" /&gt; and state that Jesus never said not to fight,&lt;ref name="aqa" /&gt; citing examples from the New Testament. One such instance portrays an angry Jesus driving dishonest market [[Cleansing of the Temple|traders from the temple]].&lt;ref name="aqa" /&gt;  A frequently quoted passage is Luke 22:36: "He said to them, 'But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must [[Sell your cloak and buy a sword|sell his cloak and buy one]].'" Pacifists have typically explained that verse as Jesus fulfilling prophecy, since in the next verse, Jesus continues to say: "It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment." Others have interpreted the non-pacifist statements in the New Testament to be related to [[self-defense]] or to be metaphorical and state that on no occasion did Jesus shed blood or urge others to shed blood.&lt;ref name="weidhorn" /&gt;

==Modern history==
[[File:Edward Hicks - Penn's Treaty.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Penn's Treaty with the Indians|Penn's Treaty]] with the Indians. This treaty was never violated.]]
Beginning in the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] gave rise to a variety of new Christian sects, including the [[Peace churches|historic peace churches]]. Foremost among them were the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), [[Amish]], [[Mennonites]], and [[Church of the Brethren]]. The humanist writer [[Desiderius Erasmus]] was one of the most outspoken pacifists of the [[Renaissance]], arguing strongly against warfare in his essays ''[[The Praise of Folly]]'' (1509) and ''The Complaint of Peace'' (1517).&lt;ref name="fsn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Erasmus, Desiderius" by Garrett L. McAinsh, in ''The World Encyclopedia of Peace''.Edited by [[Linus Pauling]], [[Ervin László]], and [[Jong Youl Yoo]]. Oxford : Pergamon, 1986. {{ISBN|0-08-032685-4}}, (Volume 1, p.293).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quakers were prominent advocates of pacifism, who as early as 1660 had repudiated violence in all forms and adhered to a strictly pacifist interpretation of [[Christianity]]. They stated their beliefs in a declaration to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "We utterly deny all outward wars and strife, and fightings with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretense whatever; this is our testimony to the whole world.  The Spirit of Christ&amp;nbsp;... which leads us into all truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quaker Traditions of Pacifism and Nonviolence|url=http://events.stanford.edu/events/352/35227/|author=Eric Roberts|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout the many 18th century wars in which Britain participated, the Quakers maintained a principled commitment [[Conscientious objector|not to serve in the army and militia]] or even to pay the alternative £10 fine.

The English Quaker [[William Penn]], who founded the [[Province of Pennsylvania]], employed an anti-militarist public policy. Unlike residents of many of the colonies, Quakers chose to trade peacefully with the Indians, including for land. The colonial province was, for the 75 years from 1681 to 1756, essentially unarmed and experienced little or no warfare in that period.

From the 16th to the 18th centuries, a number of thinkers devised plans for an international organisation that would promote peace, and reduce or even eliminate the occurrence of war. These included the French politician [[Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully|Duc de Sully]], the philosophers [[Émeric Crucé]] and the [[Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre|Abbe de Saint-Pierre]], and the English Quakers William Penn and [[John Bellers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Power and the Pursuit of Peace: Theory and Practice in the History of Relations between States'', by [[Francis Harry Hinsley]], Cambridge University Press, 1967, {{ISBN|0-521-09448-8}}, (pp.&amp;nbsp;13–45).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Thinking About Peace in History" by [[Charles Chatfield]], in ''The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective : Essays in Honour of Peter Brock'', edited by [[Harvey L. Dyck]]. Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-8020-0777-5}} (p.&amp;nbsp;36–51).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacifist ideals emerged from two strands of thought that coalesced at the end of the 18th century. One, rooted in the secular [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], promoted peace as the rational antidote to the world's ills, while the other was a part of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical religious revival]] that had played an important part in the campaign for the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. Representatives of the former included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in ''Extrait du Projet de Paix Perpetuelle de Monsieur l'Abbe Saint-Pierre'' (1756),&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley, pp.&amp;nbsp;46–61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]], in his ''Thoughts on Perpetual Peace'',&lt;ref&gt;Hinsley, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–80.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeremy Bentham]] who proposed the formation of a peace association in 1789. Representative of the latter, was [[William Wilberforce]] who thought that strict limits should be imposed on British involvement in the [[French Revolutionary War]] based on Christian ideals of peace and brotherhood. Bohemian [[Bernard Bolzano]] (1781–1848) taught about the social waste of militarism and the needlessness of war. He urged a total reform of the educational, social, and economic systems that would direct the nation's interests toward peace rather than toward armed conflict between nations.

===Peace movements===
During the period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], although no formal peace movement was established until the end of hostilities, a significant peace movement animated by universalist ideals did emerge, due to the perception of Britain fighting in a [[reactionary]] role and the increasingly visible impact of the war on the welfare of the nation in the form of higher taxation levels and high casualty rates. Sixteen peace petitions to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] were signed by members of the public, anti-war and anti-[[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] demonstrations convened and peace literature was widely published and disseminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx4xr3PsdI8C&amp;dq=freemason+hall+1843+london+peace&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Origins of War Prevention: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1730–1854|author=Ceadel, Martin|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press,|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Richard, Vanity Fair, 1880-09-04.jpg|thumb|"Peace". Caricature of [[Henry Richard]], a prominent advocate of pacifism in the mid-19th century]]
The first peace movements appeared in 1815–16. In the United States the first such movement was the [[New York Peace Society]], founded in 1815 by the theologian [[David Low Dodge]], and the [[Massachusetts Peace Society]]. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on [[Christianity|Christian]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism to 1914 : an overview'' by Peter Brock. Toronto, Thistle Printing, 1994. (pp.&amp;nbsp;38–9).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peace Society|London Peace Society]] (also known as the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace) was formed in 1816 to promote permanent and universal peace by the [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[William Allen (philanthropist)|William Allen]]. In the 1840s, British women formed "Olive Leaf Circles", groups of around 15 to 20 women, to discuss and promote pacifist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Long Road to Greenham : Feminism and Anti-Militarism in Britain since 1820'', by [[Jill Liddington]]. London, Virago, 1989 {{ISBN|0-86068-688-4}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;14–5).&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace movement began to grow in influence by the mid-nineteenth century. The London Peace Society, under the initiative of American consul to [[Birmingham]] [[Elihu Burritt]] and the reverend [[Henry Richard]], convened the first [[International Peace Congress]] in London in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Peace.html?id=JCgvvXUzu-oC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Peace: A History of Movements and Ideas|author=Cortright, David|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congress decided on two aims: the ideal of peaceable arbitration in the affairs of nations and the creation of an international institution to achieve that. [[Henry Richard|Richard]] became the secretary of the Peace Society in 1850 on a full-time basis, a position which he would keep for the next 40 years, earning himself a reputation as the 'Apostle of Peace'. He helped secure one of the earliest victories for the peace movement by securing a commitment from the [[Great Power]]s in the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] at the end of the [[Crimean War]], in favour of arbitration. On the European continent, wracked by [[1848 Revolution|social upheaval]], the first peace congress was held in [[Brussels]] in 1848 followed by [[Paris]] a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gustave Moynier and the peace societies|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnaw.htm|publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]|author=André Durand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing a recession in support due to the resurgence of militarism during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Crimean War]], the movement began to spread across Europe and began to infiltrate the new [[working class]] [[socialism|socialist]] movements. In 1870, [[Randal Cremer]] formed the [[International Arbitration League|Workman's Peace Association]] in London. Cremer, alongside the French economist [[Frédéric Passy]] was also the founding father of the first international organisation for the arbitration of conflicts in 1889, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]. The [[National Peace Council]] was founded in after the 17th [[Universal Peace Congress]] in London (July August 1908).

An important thinker who contributed to pacifist ideology was Russian writer [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In one of his latter works, ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]'', Tolstoy provides a detailed history, account and defense of pacifism. Tolstoy's work inspired a [[Tolstoyan movement|movement named after him]] advocating pacifism to arise in Russia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;''Tolstoy's Pacifism'', by [[Colm McKeogh]], Cambria Press, 2009, {{ISBN|1-60497-634-9}}, (pp.&amp;nbsp;105–107).&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a major early influence on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] (1869–1948), and the two engaged in regular correspondence while Gandhi was active in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century'', by [[Peter Brock]] and [[Nigel Young]]. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}} (p.73)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertha von Suttner]], the first woman to be a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, became a leading figure in the peace movement with the publication of her novel, ''Die Waffen nieder!'' ("Lay Down Your Arms!") in 1889 and founded an Austrian pacifist organization in 1891.

===Non-violent resistance===
[[File:WeFightCartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|"Leading Citizens want War and declare War; Citizens Who are Led fight the War" 1910 cartoon]]
In New Zealand, during the latter half of the 19th century British colonists used many tactics to confiscate land from the indigenous [[Māori people|Māori]], including warfare. In the 1870s and 1880s, [[Parihaka]], then reputed to be the largest Māori village in New Zealand, became the centre of a major campaign of non-violent resistance to European occupation of confiscated land in the area. One Māori leader, [[Te Whiti-o-Rongomai]], inspired warriors to stand up for their rights without using weapons, which had led to defeat in the past. In 1881 he convinced 2000 Maori to welcome battle-hardened British soldiers into their village and even offered food and drink. He allowed himself and his people to be arrested without resistance for opposing land confiscation. He is remembered as a great leader because the "passive resistance" his practice prevented British massacres and even protected far more land than violent resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/conflict/pacifistofparihaka.htm Winder, Virginia, "Conflict and Protest  - Pacifist of Parihaka - Te Whiti o Rongomai"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705092832/http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/conflict/pacifistofparihaka.htm |date=July 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] was a major political and spiritual leader of India, instrumental in the [[Indian independence movement]]. The Nobel prize winning great poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], who was also an Indian, gave him the honorific  "[[Mahatma]]", usually translated "Great Soul." He was the pioneer of a brand of nonviolence (or ''[[ahimsa]]'') which he called ''[[satyagraha]]''—translated literally as "truth force". This was the resistance of tyranny through civil disobedience that was not only nonviolent but also sought to change the heart of the opponent. He contrasted this with ''duragraha'', "resistant force," which sought only to change behaviour with stubborn protest.

During his 30 years of work (1917–1947) for the independence of his country from the [[British Raj]], Gandhi led dozens of nonviolent campaigns, spent over seven years in prison, and [[hunger strike|fasted nearly to the death]] on several occasions to obtain British compliance with a demand or to stop inter-communal violence.  His efforts helped lead India to independence in 1947, and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom worldwide.

===World War I===
[[File:The Deserter.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|''The Deserter'' (1916) by [[Boardman Robinson]]]]
Peace movements became active in the Western world after 1900, often focusing on Treaties that would settle disputes through arbitration, and efforts to support the Hague conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Hollander,  ''Elusive Dove: The Search for Peace During World War I'' (2014), ch 1 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=RZHLAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=4jcnQMsOb9&amp;sig=c9hArkuNZq6iMvmVh8uTPdEeYsk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sudden outbreak of the [[First World War]] in July 1914 dismayed the peace movement. Socialist parties in every industrial nation had committed themselves to antiwar policies, but when the war came, all of them, except in Russia and the United States, supported their own government. There were highly publicized dissidents, some of whom went to jail for opposing the draft laws, like [[Eugene Debs]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Harry W. Laidler, Harry W. ''Socialism in thought and action'' (1920) covers wartime roles in many countries [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DKINAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=harry+laidler+socialism&amp;ots=r5TR5vSoqn&amp;sig=izQuyzD-HCFuo_FNvpyEt78HMPo#v=onepage&amp;q=harry%20laidler%20socialism&amp;f=false online].&lt;/ref&gt;  In Britain, the prominent activist [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]] went to prison for refusing military service, citing his convictions as an "International Socialist and a Christian"&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Adam, ''To end all wars : a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914–1918'', p. 277, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011, {{ISBN|0-618-75828-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[socialism|socialist]] groups and movements were [[antimilitarist]], arguing that war by its nature was a type of governmental coercion of the [[working class]] for the benefit of [[capitalism|capitalist]] elites. The French socialist pacifist leader [[Jean Jaurès]] was assassinated by a nationalist fanatic on July 31, 1914.  The national parties in the [[Second International]] increasingly supported their respective nations in war and the International was dissolved in 1916.
 
[[File:Peace-Marcher.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|A World War I-era female peace protester]]
In 1915 the [[League of Nations Society]] was formed by British [[liberalism|liberal]] leaders to promote a strong international organisation that could enforce the peaceful resolution of conflict. Later that year the [[League to Enforce Peace]] was established in America to promote similar goals. [[Hamilton Holt]] published an editorial in his New York City weekly magazine the ''Independent'' called "The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal" on September 28, 1914. It called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt's plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Viscount James Bryce]], a former ambassador from the U.K. to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, 56-7&lt;/ref&gt; These and other initiatives were pivotal in the change in attitudes that gave birth to the [[League of Nations]] after the war.

Some of the many groups that protested against the war, as well as the traditional peace churches, were the [[Woman's Peace Party]] (which was organized in 1915 and led by noted reformer [[Jane Addams]]), the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) (also organized in 1915),&lt;ref&gt;

===Between the two World Wars===
[[File:Красноармейцы-пацифисты.png|thumb|The soldiers of the red Army in Russia, who on religious grounds refused to shoot at the target (evangelicals or Baptists). Between 1918 and 1929]]
The immense loss of life during the war, for what became regarded as futile reasons, caused a sea-change in public attitudes to militarism. Organisations formed in this period included the [[War Resisters' International]]&lt;ref&gt;''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915–1963'' by Scott H. Bennett. New York, Syracuse University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8156-3028-X}}, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], the [[No More War Movement]] and the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU). The [[League of Nations]] also convened several disarmament conferences in the inter-war period such as the [[Geneva Naval Conference|Geneva Conference]].

Pacifism and revulsion with war were very popular sentiments in 1920s Britain. A stream of novels and poems on the theme of the futility of war and the slaughter of the youth by old fools were published, including, [[Death of a Hero]] by [[Richard Aldington]], [[Erich Remarque]]'s translated [[All Quiet on the Western Front]] and [[Beverley Nichols]]'s expose ''Cry Havoc''. A debate at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1933 on the motion 'one must fight for King and country' captured the changed mood when the motion was resoundingly defeated. [[Hugh Richard Lawrie Sheppard|Dick Sheppard]] established the [[Peace Pledge Union]] in 1934 totally renouncing war and aggression. The idea of collective security was also popular; instead of outright pacifism the public generally exhibited a determination to stand up to aggression, but preferably with the use of economic sanctions and multilateral negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Hom-c5.html|title=Pacifism|publisher=[[University of Wellington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the Peace Pledge Union later joined the Bruderhof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; during its period of residence in the Cotswolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, English, Jews and Germans lived side by side despite local persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Peace-Experiment-Bruderhof-Community/dp/1532639988|title=A Christian Peace Experiment: The Bruderhof Community in Britain, 1933–1942|last=Randall|first=Ian M.|last2=Wright|first2=Nigel G.|date=2018-03-14|publisher=Cascade Books|isbn=9781532639982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had a strong pacifist wing in the early 1930s and between 1931 and 1935 was led by [[George Lansbury]], a Christian pacifist who later chaired the No More War Movement and was president of the PPU. The 1933 annual conference resolved unanimously to "pledge itself to take no part in war". "Labour's official position, however, although based on the aspiration towards a world socialist commonwealth and the outlawing of war, did not imply a renunciation of force under all circumstances, but rather support for the ill-defined concept of 'collective security' under the League of Nations. At the same time, on the party's left, [[Stafford Cripps]]'s small but vocal [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]] opposed the official policy, on the non-pacifist ground that the League of Nations was 'nothing but the tool of the satiated imperialist powers'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.exeter.ac.uk/exeter/bitstream/10036/26952/3/Rearmament.pdf Richard Toye, ''The Labour Party and the Economics of Rearmament, 1935–1939''] {{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lansbury was eventually persuaded to resign as Labour leader by the non-pacifist wing of the party and was replaced by [[Clement Attlee]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhiannon Vickers, ''Labour and the World'',  Manchester University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7190-6745-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-7190-6745-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the threat from [[Nazi Germany]] increased in the 1930s, the Labour Party abandoned its pacifist position and supported re-armament, largely due to the efforts of [[Ernest Bevin]] and [[Hugh Dalton]] who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s policy of [[appeasement]].&lt;ref&gt;A.J.Davies, ''To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Party from Keir Hardie to Tony Blair'', Abacus, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[League of Nations]] attempted to play its role of ensuring world peace in the 1920s and 30s, although with the increasingly revisionist and aggressive behaviour of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Imperial Japan]], it ultimately failed to maintain such a world order. [[Economic sanctions]] were used against states that committed aggression, such as Italy when it [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Abyssinia]], but there was no will on the part of the principal League powers, Britain and France, to subordinate their interests to a multilateral process or to disarm at all themselves.

The [[Spanish Civil War]] proved a major test for international pacifism, and the work of pacifist organisations (such as [[War Resisters' International]] and the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]) and individuals (such as [[José Brocca]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón|Amparo Poch]]) in that arena has until recently{{when|date=May 2011}} been ignored or forgotten by historians, overshadowed by the memory of the [[International Brigades]] and other militaristic interventions. Shortly after the war ended, [[Simone Weil]], despite having volunteered for service on the republican side, went on to publish ''[[The Iliad or the Poem of Force]]'', a work that has been described as a pacifist manifesto.&lt;ref name="NYB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=4551 |title=War and the Iliad |publisher=The New York Review of books |accessdate=29 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501053342/http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&amp;product_id=4551 |archivedate=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as [[Richard B. Gregg]], devised plans for a campaign of [[nonviolent resistance]] in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Lynd, Staughton. ''Nonviolence in America: a documentary history'', Bobbs-Merrill, 1966, (pps.&amp;nbsp;271–296).&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Berkeley, California. University of California Student Peace Strike. About half of the students assembled at the... - NARA - 532103.tif|thumb|upright=0.9|A peace strike rally at [[University of California]], Berkeley, April 1940]]
With the start of [[World War II]], pacifist and anti-war sentiment declined in nations affected by war. Even the communist-controlled [[American Peace Mobilization]] reversed its anti-war activism once Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. After the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]], mainstream [[isolationist]] groups like the [[America First Committee]], declined, but many smaller religious and socialist groups continued their opposition to war. [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that the necessity of defeating [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] was a unique circumstance where war was not the worst of the possible evils; he called his position ''relative pacifism''. Shortly before the outbreak of war, British writers such as [[E. M. Forster]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[David Garnett]] and [[Storm Jameson]] all rejected their earlier pacifism and endorsed military action against Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Patterson, "Pacifists and Conscientious Objectors", in Adam Piette and Mark Rawlinson, ''The Edinburgh Companion to Twentieth-Century British and American War Literature'', Edinburgh University Press 2012. {{ISBN|0-7486-3874-1}}  (p. 311).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[Albert Einstein]] wrote: "I loathe all armies and any kind of violence; yet I'm firmly convinced that at present these hateful weapons offer the only effective protection."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on [http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/infodocs/people/pp-einstein2.html Albert Einstein] at Peace Pledge Union, and but also discussed in detail in articles in Einstein, Albert (1954), ''Ideas and Opinions'', New York: Random House, {{ISBN|0-517-00393-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British pacifists [[Reginald Sorensen, Baron Sorensen|Reginald Sorensen]] and [[Cecil John Cadoux|C. J. Cadoux]], while bitterly disappointed by the outbreak of war, nevertheless urged their fellow pacifists "not to obstruct the war effort".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ceadel, ''Pacifism in Britain, 1914–1945 : The Defining Of A Faith''. Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1980. {{ISBN|0-19-821882-6}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;298–99).&lt;/ref&gt;

The French pacifists [[André and Magda Trocmé]] helped conceal hundreds of Jews fleeing the Nazis in the village of [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon]].&lt;ref name="pph"&gt;''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: The Story of Le Chambon and How Goodness Happened There'' Philip P. Hallie, (1979)  New York: Harper &amp; Row, {{ISBN|0-06-011701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the Trocmés were declared [[Righteous Among the Nations]].&lt;ref name="pph" /&gt;

Pacifists in the [[Third Reich]] were dealt with harshly; German pacifist [[Carl von Ossietzky]],&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olaf Kullmann]], a Norwegian pacifist active during the Nazi occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Socknat, pp.&amp;nbsp;402–3.&lt;/ref&gt; were both imprisoned in concentration camps and died as a result of their mistreatment there. Austrian farmer [[Franz Jägerstätter]] was executed in 1943 for refusing to serve in the [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[In Solitary Witness: The Life and Death of Franz Jägerstätter]]'' by [[Gordon Zahn]].Springfield, Illinois: Templegate Publishers. {{ISBN|0-87243-141-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the war, it was discovered that "[[The Black Book]]" or ''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'' list of Britons to be arrested in the event of a Nazi invasion of the UK included three active pacifists; [[Vera Brittain]], [[Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Aldous Huxley]] (who had left the country).&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard R. Doerries, ''Hitler's Intelligence Chief: Walter Schellenberg'', New York.

London; The Peace Pledge Union, {{ISBN|978-0-902680-51-7}} (p.14)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were [[conscientious objectors]] and war [[tax resisters]] in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  The United States government allowed sincere objectors to serve in noncombatant military roles. However, those [[draft dodgers|draft resisters]] who refused any cooperation with the war effort often spent much of each war in federal prisons. During World War II, pacifist leaders like [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Ammon Hennacy]] of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]] urged young Americans not to enlist in military service.

===Later twentieth century===
[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police at an [[Opposition to Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War protest]], 1967]]
[[Martin Luther King Jr]] (1929–68), a [[Baptist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]], led the [[civil rights movement]], which successfully used Gandhian [[nonviolent resistance]] to repeal laws enforcing racial segregation and work for integration of schools, businesses and government. In 1957, his wife [[Coretta Scott King]], [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Benjamin Spock]], and others formed the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (now [[Peace Action]]) to resist the [[nuclear arms race]]. In 1958 British activists formed the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] with Bertrand Russell as its president.

In 1960, [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] came to the US to study [[comparative religion]] at [[Princeton University]] and subsequently was appointed lecturer in Buddhism at [[Columbia University]]. Thich Nhat Hanh had written a letter to Martin Luther King in 1965 entitled "Searching for the Enemy of Man" and during his 1966 stay in the US met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="aavw.org"/&gt; King gave his famous speech at the [[Riverside Church]] in New York City in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aavw.org/special_features/speeches_speech_king01.html Beyond Vietnam]", 4 April 1967, speech made by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Riverside Church, NYC, archived on the African-American Involvement in the Vietnam War website&lt;/ref&gt; his first to publicly question the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.

Other examples from this period include the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] led by [[Cory Aquino]], and the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square Protests]] which included the broadly publicized "[[Tank Man]]" incident.

On December 1, 1948, President [[José Figueres Ferrer]] of [[Costa Rica]] abolished the [[military of Costa Rica|Costa Rican military]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2019.htm Costa Rica]". U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the abolition of the military was introduced in Article 12 of the Costa Rican constitution. The budget previously dedicated to the military is now dedicated to providing health care services and education.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/opinion/07kristof.html?_r=1 The Happiest People]".

==Religious attitudes{{anchor|Pacifism and religion}}==
{{see also|Religion and peacebuilding}}

===Ahmadiyya===
{{Further|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad}}
According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of Islam, pacifism is a strong current, and jihad is one's personal inner struggle and should not be used violently for political motives. Violence is the last option only to be used to protect religion and one's own life in extreme situations of persecution. [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, said that in contrary to the current views, Islam ''does not allow the use of sword in religion, except in the case of defensive wars, wars waged to punish a tyrant, or those meant to uphold freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Jihad-Brochure.pdf|title=Jihad the True Islamic Concept|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadiyya claims its objective to be the peaceful propagation of [[Islam]] with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the pen. Ahmadis point out that as per prophecy, who they believe was the promised messiah, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, rendered the concept of violent jihad unnecessary in modern times. They believe that the answer of hate should be given by love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000064.html|title=Jihad of the Pen|accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahá'í Faith===
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] abolished [[religious war|holy war]] and emphasized its abolition as a central teaching of his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://bahai-library.com/wilmette_lawh_ridvan_notes | last = Troxel | first = Duane |author2=Cole, Juan |author3=Lambden, Stephen | title = Tablet of Ridván: Wilmette Institute faculty notes | date =17 October 2003 | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | publisher = bahai-library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bahá'í Faith does not have an absolute pacifistic position. For example, Bahá'ís are advised to do social service instead of active army service, but when this is not possible because of obligations in certain countries, the [[Bahá'í laws|Bahá'í law]] of ''loyalty to one's government'' is preferred and the individual should perform the army service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=1 | title = Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | first = Peter | last = Mazal | date = 21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ud1"&gt;{{Cite book| url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/UD/ud-136.html | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi|title = Unfolding Destiny|pages = 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, noted that in the Bahá'í view, absolute pacifists are anti-social and exalt the individual over society which could lead to anarchy; instead he noted that the Bahá'í conception of social life follows a moderate view where the individual is not suppressed or exalted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-144.html#gr1 | title = Directives from the Guardian | last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | pages = 53–54 | publisher = Baha'i Publishing Trust | location = India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the level of society, Bahá'u'lláh promotes the principle of [[collective security]], which does not abolish the use of force, but prescribes "a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Shoghi
 |last=Effendi |authorlink= Shoghi Effendi |year= 1938 |title= The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn= 0-87743-231-7 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-52.html#gr1 | pages = 191–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of collective security from the Bahá'í teachings states that if a government violates a fundamental norm of international law or provision of a future world constitution which Bahá'ís believe will be established by all nations, then the other governments should step in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = Danesh |last = Sarooshi | year = 1994 | title = Search for a Just Society, Review | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | url = http://bahai-library.com/saroosh_huddleston_just_society | accessdate = 13 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism and violence|Engaged Buddhism|Religion and peacebuilding#Buddhism and peacebuilding}}

Buddhism is generally seen as among the least violent religious traditions,&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Warfare by Michael Jerryson and Mark Juergensmeyer / Oxford University Press 2010, p.3 {{ISBN|978-0-19-539484-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ahimsa]] (do no harm), is a primary virtue in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Baroni2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Josephine Baroni|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smNM4ElP3XgC&amp;pg=PA3|date=January 2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-2240-6|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aung San Suu Kyi]] is a Buddhist [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] pro-democracy activist and leader of the [[National League for Democracy]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma), who became State Counsellor (similar to prime minister) of Myanmar in April 2016. A devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], Suu Kyi won the [[Rafto Prize]] and the [[Sakharov Prize|Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought]] in 1990 and in 1991 was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a repressive [[military dictatorship]]. One of her best known speeches is the "Freedom From Fear" speech, which begins, "It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1991/kyi-bio.html |title=Aung San Suu Kyi — Biography |publisher=Nobel Foundation |accessdate=4 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian pacifism}}
[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|right|''[[Blessed are the peacemakers|Blessed are the Peacemakers]]'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]]]]

====Peace churches====
[[Peace churches]] are Christian denominations explicitly advocating pacifism.  The term "historic peace churches" refers specifically to three church traditions: the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Mennonites]] (and some other [[Anabaptists]], such as [[Amish]] [[Hutterites]], and the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof_Communities|title=Bruderhof Communities - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[Quakers]] (Religious Society of Friends). The historic peace churches have, from their origins as far back as the 16th century, always taken the position that [[Jesus]] was himself a pacifist who explicitly taught and practiced pacifism, and that his followers must do likewise. Pacifist churches vary on whether physical force can ever be justified in [[self-defense]] or protecting others, as many adhere strictly to [[nonresistance]] when confronted by violence.  But all agree that violence on behalf of a country or a government is prohibited for Christians.

====Pentecostal churches====
Jay Beaman's thesis&lt;ref name='beaman'&gt;Beaman, J: Pentecostal Pacifism: The Origin, Development, and Rejection of Pacific Belief among the Pentecostals, Center for Mennonite Brethren Studies, Hillsboro, Kansas, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; states that 13 of 21, or 62% of American Pentecostal groups formed by 1917 show evidence of being pacifist sometime in their history. Furthermore, Jay Beaman has shown in his thesis&lt;ref name='beaman'/&gt; that there has been a shift away from pacifism in the American Pentecostal churches to more a style of military support and chaplaincy. The major organisation for Pentecostal Christians who believe in pacifism is the PCPF, the [[Pentecostal Charismatic Peace Fellowship]].

The [[United Pentecostal Church]], the largest Apostolic/[[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness]] denomination, takes an official stand of conscientious objection: its Articles of Faith read, "We are constrained to declare against participating in combatant service in war, armed insurrection&amp;nbsp;... aiding or abetting in or the actual destruction of human life. We believe that we can be consistent in serving our Government in certain noncombatant capacities, but not in the bearing of arms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritualabuse.org/aof.html The Articles of Faith 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Christian denominations====
[[File:Constantines-Sword.png|thumb|left|The shadow of the cross symbolizes the connection between religion and war in ''[[Constantine's Sword|Constantine's Sword (film)]]'']]
The [[Peace Pledge Union]] was a pacifist organisation from which the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship (APF) later emerged within the Anglican Church. The APF succeeded in gaining ratification of the pacifist position at two successive [[Lambeth Conferences]], but many Anglicans would not regard themselves as pacifists. South African Bishop [[Desmond Tutu]] is the most prominent Anglican pacifist. [[Rowan Williams]] led an almost united Anglican Church in Britain in opposition to the 2003 [[Iraq War]].  In Australia [[Peter Carnley]] similarly led a front of bishops opposed to the [[Government of Australia]]'s involvement in the invasion of Iraq.

The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] is concerned with both social justice and pacifist issues, and voiced consistent opposition to the [[Spanish Civil War]] and World War II. Many of its early members were imprisoned for their opposition to [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworker.org/ Catholic Worker Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Roman Catholic Church, the [[Pax Christi]] organisation is the premiere pacifist lobby group. It holds positions similar to APF, and the two organisations are known to work together on ecumenical projects. Within Roman Catholicism there has been a discernible move towards a more pacifist position through the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Popes [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]] and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] were all vocal in their opposition to specific wars. By taking the name [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], some suspected that [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] would continue the strong emphasis upon nonviolent conflict resolution of his predecessor. However, the Roman Catholic Church officially maintains the legitimacy of Just War, which is rejected by some pacifists.

In the twentieth century there was a notable trend among prominent Roman Catholics towards pacifism.  Individuals such as [[Dorothy Day]] and [[Henri Nouwen]] stand out among them. The monk and mystic [[Thomas Merton]] was noted for his commitment to pacifism during the [[Vietnam War]] era.  Murdered [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] Bishop [[Óscar Romero]] was notable for using non-violent resistance tactics and wrote meditative sermons focusing on the power of prayer and peace. [[School of the Americas Watch]] was founded by Maryknoll Fr. Roy Bourgeois in 1990 and uses strictly pacifist principles to protest the training of Latin American military officers by United States Army officers at the School of the Americas in the state of Georgia.

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] also tends towards pacifism, though it has accepted defensive warfare through most of its history. However, more recently{{when|date=May 2011}} it took a strong stance towards the war in Lebanon and its large community there refused to take up arms during its civil wars. It also supports dialogue with Islam.  In 1998 the Third Pre-conciliar Pan-Orthodox Conference drew up a text on "the contribution of the Orthodox Church to the achievement of peace" emphasizing respect for the human person and the inseparability of peace from justice. The text states in part: "Orthodoxy condemns war in general, for she regards it as a consequence of the evil and sin in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incommunion.org/articles/for-the-peace-from-above/the-orthodox-church-and-peace Clément, Olivier, "The Orthodox Church and Peace Some Reflections"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902132037/http://incommunion.org/articles/for-the-peace-from-above/the-orthodox-church-and-peace |date=2009-09-02 }} on the Orthodox Peace Fellowship website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has stated in the [[Baptist Faith and Message]], "It is the duty of Christians to seek peace with all men on principles of [[righteousness]]. In accordance with the spirit and teachings of Christ they should do all in their power to put an end to war."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp#xvi SBC, " Baptist Faith and Message 2000"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Methodist Church]] explicitly supports conscientious objection by its members "as an ethically valid position" while simultaneously allowing for differences of opinion and belief for those who do not object to military service.&lt;ref&gt;Article V, section 2 of [http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=4&amp;mid=989 The United Methodist Church and Peace]&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Rastafari Movement]]'s Mansion [[Mansions of Rastafari#Niyabinghi|Nyabinghi]] are specifically noted for having a large population of Pacifist members, though not all of them are.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Ahimsa}}

Non violence, or [[ahimsa]], is a central part of Hinduism and is one of the fundamental [[Yamas]] - self restraints needed to live a proper life. The concept of ahimsa grew gradually within Hinduism, one of the signs being the discouragement of ritual animal sacrifice. Most Hindus today have a vegetarian diet. There are debates on how far the principle of ahimsa applies and if there is such a thing as a "just war".

===Jainism===
[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Non-violence, Compassion for all life, human and non-human]], is central to [[Jainism]]. Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment. Killing any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably terrible. It is a religion that requires monks, from all its sects and traditions, to be [[vegetarian]]. Some Indian regions, such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination are also vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, Kurt, Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Mohtilal Banarsidass, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
The attitude of Jews toward pacifism, as with most other aspects of religion, is heavily influenced by the Holocaust which was a program of Nazi Germany to murder every man, woman and child who was Jewish as well as people of other religions who had a Jewish grandparent.  As a result, some six million people were exterminated by various means because the Nazis considered them Jews and therefore unworthy of life.  In hindsight, there were opportunities for a number of years to defeat Nazi Germany before it could build a military force strong enough to capture and kill most of the Jews of Europe.&lt;ref name="May, Earnest R. 2000"&gt;May, Earnest R., ''Strange Victory: Hitler's Conquest of France'' (Hill and Wang ed. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Forces which deterred the democracies from acting to stop Hitler early on and at a much, much lower cost in human life were pacifism, appeasement, and isolationism.&lt;ref name="May, Earnest R. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Lynne, ''Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939–1941''(Random House 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  People who offered no resistance to the Nazis enabled them to carry out their oppression and aggression, costing tens of millions of lives in World War II. Had pacifism gained more support, the Allies might have lost the war and virtually all Jews would have been killed.
 
The Jewish Peace Fellowship is a New-York based [[nonprofit]], [[Jewish denominations|nondenominational]] organization set up to provide a [[Judaism|Jewish]] voice in the [[peace movement]]. The organization was founded in 1941 in order to support Jewish [[conscientious objectors]] who sought exemption from combatant military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpeacefellowship.org/index.php?p=about Jewish Peace Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt; It is affiliated to the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifor.org/members.htm IFOR Members] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423022546/http://www.ifor.org/members.htm |date=April 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The small [[Neturei Karta]] group of anti-Zionist, ultra-orthodox Jews, supposedly take a pacifist line, saying that "Jews are not allowed to dominate, kill, harm or demean another people and are not allowed to have anything to do with the Zionist enterprise, their political meddling and their wars.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/aboutus/index.cfm What is the Neturei Karta?]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Neturei Karta group do support groups such as [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]] that are violent towards Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/anti-zionist-ultra-orthodox-jews-celebrate-sabbath-in-gaza-1.265558 Anti-Zionist ultra-Orthodox Jews celebrate Sabbath in Gaza]&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Bible is full of examples when Jews were told to go and war against enemy lands or within the Israelite community as well as instances where God, as destroyer and protector, goes to war for non-participant Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Niditch, Susan, ''War in the Hebrew Bible'' (Oxford University Press ed. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Holocaust Remembrance Day (called Yom Hashoah in Hebrew) is a day a remembrance for many Jews as they honor those who fought to end the Hitler government which starved, shot, gassed and burned over six million Jews to death.  It is observed on the day corresponding to the 27th day of the month of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Remembrance Day Calendar, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, ushmm.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raëlism===
Non-violence is an important doctrine within [[Raëlism]]. The founder of this religion Rael has said "''The one holding the weapon is as responsible as the one giving the orders''".

[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|[[Erich Maria Remarque|Remarque]]'s anti-war novel ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' was banned and burned by war-glorifying Nazis]]
While many governments have tolerated pacifist views and even accommodated pacifists' refusal to fight in wars, others at times have outlawed pacifist and anti-war activity. In 1918, The United States Congress passed the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]. During the periods between World Wars I and World War II, pacifist literature and public advocacy was banned in [[Italy]] under [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Germany]] after the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]],&lt;ref name="bz"&gt;Benjamin Ziemann, "Pacifism"
in ''World Fascism:An Encyclopedia'', edited by Cyprian P. Blamires. ABC-CLIO Ltd, 2006.  {{ISBN|1-57607-940-6}} (p.&amp;nbsp;495–6)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Francoist Spain|Spain]] under [[Francisco Franco]],&lt;ref&gt;Brock and Young, pp.&amp;nbsp;96–7, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name="nsleu"&gt;''Notes sur l'anarchisme en U.R.S.S : De 1921 à nos jours''.Les Cahiers du Vent du Chemin. Paris,1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In these nations, pacifism was denounced as cowardice; indeed, Mussolini referred to pacifist writings as the "propaganda of cowardice".&lt;ref name="bz" /&gt;

Today, the United States requires that all young men register for selective service but does not allow them to be classified as conscientious objectors unless they are drafted in some future reinstatement of the draft, allowing them to be discharged or transferred to noncombatant status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objector.org/advice/conscientious_objector-6.html#pgfId-183 "Conscientious Objection Today, Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some European governments like [[Swiss Civilian Service|Switzerland]], [[Greece]], [[Norway]] and [[Germany]] offer [[civilian service]]. However, even during periods of peace, many pacifists still refuse to register for or report for military duty, risking criminal charges.

Anti-war and "pacifist" political parties seeking to win elections may moderate their demands, calling for [[de-escalation]] or major [[arms reduction]] rather than the outright [[disarmament]] which is advocated by many pacifists. [[Green parties]] list "[[non-violence]]" and "[[decentralization]]" towards anarchist co-operatives or minimalist village government as two of their ten key values. However, in power, Greens often compromise. The German Greens in the cabinet of Social Democrat [[Gerhard Schröder]] supported an intervention by German troops in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001 if that they hosted the peace conference in Berlin. However, during the 2002 election Greens forced Schröder to swear that no German troops would invade Iraq.

The controversial [[democratic peace theory]] holds that [[liberal democracies]] have never (or rarely) made war on one another and that lesser conflicts and internal violence are rare between and within democracies. It also argues that the growth in the number of democratic states will, in the not so distant future, end warfare.

Some pacifists and [[multilateralism|multilateralists]] are in favor of international criminal law as means to prevent and control international aggression. The [[International Criminal Court]] has jurisdiction over war crimes, but the crime of aggression has yet to be clearly defined in international law.

The [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] enforces a mild pacifist character on the Italian Republic, as Article 11 states that "Italy repudiates war as an instrument offending the liberty of the peoples and as a means for settling international disputes&amp;nbsp;..." Similarly, Articles 24, 25 and 26 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Constitution]] (1949), Alinea 15 of the French Constitution (1946), Article 20 of the [[Constitution of Denmark|Danish Constitution]] (1953), [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] (1947) and several other mostly European constitutions correspond to the United Nations Charter by rejecting the institution of war in favour of [[collective security]] and peaceful cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/peace/unitednationsreform2007/liste24list_en.html "Constitutional clauses providing for limitations of national sovereignty to achieve cooperation, peace and disarmament"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720025109/http://www.ne.jp/asahi/peace/unitednationsreform2007/liste24list_en.html |date=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacifism and abstention from political activity===
However, some pacifists, such as the [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[autarchist]] [[Robert LeFevre]], consider the state a form of warfare. In addition, for doctrinal reason that a manmade government is inferior to divine governance and law, many pacifist-identified religions/religious sects also refrain from political activity altogether, including the [[Anabaptists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Mandaeans]]. This means that such groups refuse to participate in government office or serve under an oath to a government.

===Anarcho-pacifism===
{{Main|Anarcho-pacifism}}
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Henry David Thoreau]], early proponent of [[anarcho-pacifism]]]]Anarcho-pacifism (also pacifist anarchism or anarchist pacifism) is a form of [[anarchism]] which completely rejects the use of violence in any form for any purpose. The main precedent was [[Henry David Thoreau]] who through his work [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] influenced the advocacy of both Leo Tolstoy and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] for [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence The pacifist and anarchist tradition by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; As a global movement, Anarchist pacifism emerged shortly before [[World War II]] in the Netherlands, Great Britain and the United States and was a strong presence in the subsequent campaigns for [[nuclear disarmament]].

Violence has always been controversial in anarchism. While many anarchists during the 19th century embraced [[propaganda of the deed]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and other anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change. He argued that anarchism must by nature be nonviolent since it is, by definition, opposition to coercion and force and since the state is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic. His philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by [[Mohandas Gandhi]], an [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] leader and pacifist who self-identified as an anarchist. [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]] was also instrumental in establishing the pacifist trend within the anarchist movement.&lt;ref name=woodcock&gt;{{Cite book|last=Woodcock |first=George |title=Anarchism: a History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements |publisher=Broadview Press |location=Peterborough |year=2004 |isbn=1-55111-629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France anti-militarism appeared strongly in individualist anarchist circles as [[Émile Armand]] founded "Ligue Antimilitariste" in 1902 with [[Albert Libertad]] and George Mathias Paraf-Javal.

===Opposition to military taxation===
Many pacifists who would be conscientious objectors to military service are also [[tax resistance|opposed to paying taxes]] to fund the military. In the United States, [[The National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund]] works to pass a national law to allow conscientious objectors to redirect their tax money to be used only for non-military purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacetaxfund.org/aboutus/mission.htm Mission of National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165301/http://www.peacetaxfund.org/aboutus/mission.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One common argument against pacifism is the possibility of using violence to prevent further acts of violence (and reduce the "net-sum" of violence). This argument hinges on [[consequentialism]]: an otherwise morally objectionable action can be justified if it results in a positive outcome. For example, either violent rebellion, or foreign nations sending in troops to end a dictator's violent oppression may save millions of lives, even if many thousands died in the war. Those pacifists who base their beliefs on [[deontology|deontological]] grounds would oppose such violent action. Others would oppose organized military responses but support individual and small group self-defense against specific attacks if initiated by the dictator's forces. Pacifists may argue that military action could be justified should it subsequently advance the general cause of peace.

Still more pacifists would argue that a nonviolent reaction may not save lives immediately but would in the long run. The acceptance of violence for any reason makes it easier to use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message that violence is, in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.

In light of the common criticism of pacifism as not offering a clear alternative policy, one approach to finding "more effective ways" has been the attempt to develop the idea of "defence by [[civil resistance]]", also called "[[social defence]]". This idea, which is not necessarily dependent on acceptance of pacifist beliefs, is based on relying on [[nonviolent resistance]] against possible threats, whether external (such as invasion) or internal (such as [[coup d'état]]).
[[File:Ghetto Vilinus.gif|thumb|Jewish armed resistance against the Nazis during World War II]]

There have been some works on this topic, including by [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]]&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, ed. ''The Strategy of Civilian Defence: Non-violent Resistance to Aggression'', Faber, London, 1967. (Also published as ''Civilian Resistance as a National Defense'', Stackpole Books, Harrisburg, USA, 1968; and, with a new Introduction on "Czechoslovakia and Civilian Defence", as ''Civilian Resistance as a National Defence'', Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, and Baltimore, USA, 1969. {{ISBN|0-14-021080-6}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gene Sharp]].&lt;ref&gt;Gene Sharp, ''Social Power and Political Freedom'', Porter Sargent, Boston, 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;195–261. {{ISBN|0-87558-093-9}} (paperback); and ''Civilian-based Defence: A Post-military Weapons System'', Princeton University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-691-07809-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no country has adopted this approach as the sole basis of its defence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], in Roberts and Garton Ash (ed.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics'', Introduction, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; (For further information and sources see [[social defence]].)

Japanese, Italian and Nazi aggression that precipitated [[World War II]] often is cited {{By whom|date=June 2010}}as an argument against pacifism. If these forces had not been challenged and defeated militarily, the argument goes, many more people would have died under their oppressive rule. [[Adolf Hitler]] told the British Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] in 1937 that the British should "shoot Gandhi, and if this doesn't suffice to reduce them to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of the Congress, and if that doesn't suffice shoot 200, and so on, as you make it clear that you mean business."&lt;ref&gt;Ghose, Sankar (1992). ''Jawaharlal Nehru, A Biography'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=MUeyUhVGIDMC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p.138]. Allied Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] noted in his [[Second Book]]: "...&amp;nbsp;Later, the attempt to adapt the living space to increased population turned into unmotivated wars of conquest, which in their very lack of motivation contained the germ of the subsequent reaction. Pacifism is the answer to it. Pacifism has existed in the world ever since there have been wars whose meaning no longer lay in the conquest of territory for a Folk's sustenance. Since then it has been war's eternal companion. It will again disappear as soon as war ceases to be an instrument of booty hungry or power hungry individuals or nations, and as soon as it again becomes the ultimate weapon with which a Folk fights for its daily bread."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Adolf Hitler#The Second book (1928)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermann Göring]] described, during an interview at the [[Nuremberg Trials]], how denouncing and outlawing pacifism was an important part of the Nazis' seizure of power: "The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country."&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Hermann Göring#Nuremberg Diary (1947)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators on the most nonviolent forms of pacifism, including [[Jan Narveson]], argue that such pacifism is a self-contradictory doctrine. Narveson claims that everyone has rights and corresponding responsibilities not to violate others' rights. Since pacifists give up their ability to protect themselves from violation of their right not to be harmed, then other people thus have no corresponding responsibility, thus creating a paradox of rights. Narveson said that "the prevention of infractions of that right is precisely what one has a right to when one has a right at all". Narveson then discusses how rational persuasion is a good but often inadequate method of discouraging an aggressor. He considers that everyone has the right to use any means necessary to prevent deprivation of their civil liberties and force could be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Narveson, January 1965. "Pacifism: A Philosophical Analysis." ''Ethics'', LXXV: 4, pp&amp;nbsp;259–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''paralegal ''' is an individual, qualified by education, training or work experience, who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency, or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible. However, this definition varies depending on the jurisdiction; in Ontario, Canada, paralegals are independent legal practitioners, licensed by the [[Law Society of Ontario]] to provide legal services to members of the public. Licensed paralegals in Ontario may manage their own legal firm. They  are employed as municipal and provincial prosecutors and may be appointed as justices of the peace.

A paralegal is a person trained in legal matters who performs tasks requiring knowledge of the law and legal procedures. A paralegal is not a lawyer but can be employed by a law office or work freelance at a company or law office. Paralegals are not allowed to offer legal services. Legal Ethics for Paralegals on their own and must perform their legal work under an attorney or law firm (except in Ontario, Canada). Many paralegals have their own companies and are called Law Agents,{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} providing services such as settlements, court filings, legal research and other auxiliary legal services. These tasks often have instructions from a solicitor attached. Other tasks may only be the title of a task to be performed with no instructions of how it is to be completed.  Often the instructing legal entity relies on the expertise of a paralegal in regard to how compliance is to be met in completing tasks.

In the U.S. a paralegal is protected under the theory that paralegals are working as an enhancement of an attorney and what he or she does is due to instruction by the attorney and the attorney is ultimately responsible. Paralegals often have taken a prescribed series of courses in law and legal processes. Paralegals may analyze and summarize depositions, prepare and answer interrogatories, draft procedural motions and other routine briefs, perform legal research and analysis, draft research memos, and perform case and project management. Paralegals often handle drafting much of the paper work in probate cases, divorce actions, bankruptcies, and investigations. Consumers of legal services are typically billed for the time paralegals spend on their cases.

The definition of paralegal varies by country. In the United States, they are not authorized by the government or other agency to offer legal services (including legal advice) except in Washington State in the same way as lawyers, nor are they officers of the court, nor are they usually subject to government-sanctioned or court-sanctioned rules of conduct. In contrast, in [[Ontario]], Canada, paralegals are licensed and regulated the same way that lawyers are. In Ontario, licensed paralegals provide permitted legal services to the public and appear before certain lower courts and administrative tribunals.

== Official definitions ==
Various professional organizations offer official definitions of a paralegal. These definitions typically have slight differences.
* From the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (NFPA) [USA]:  "A paralegal is a person, qualified through education, training or work experience to perform substantive legal work that requires knowledge of legal concepts and is customarily, but not exclusively, performed by a lawyer. This person may be retained or employed by a lawyer, law office, governmental agency or other entity or may be authorized by administrative, statutory or court authority to perform this work. Substantive shall mean work requiring recognition, evaluation, organization, analysis, and communication of relevant facts and legal concepts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralegals.org/ |title=NFPA web site |publisher=Paralegals.org |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) [USA]:  "Legal assistants (also known as paralegals) are a distinguishable group of persons who assist attorneys in the delivery of legal services. Through formal education, training and experience, legal assistants have knowledge and expertise regarding the legal system and substantive and procedural law which qualify them to do work of a legal nature under the supervision of an attorney." This is the NALA's former 1984 definition. In 2001, the organization adopted the American Bar Association's (ABA) definition of a paralegal/legal assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nala.org/AboutParalegals.aspx NALA web site]&lt;/ref&gt;
* From National Association of Legal Secretaries (NALS) [USA]: "A legal assistant/paralegal is a person, qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible."&lt;ref name="NALS.org: About NALS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nals.org/?page_id=26 |title=NALS.org: About NALS |publisher=NALS.org |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the American Association for Paralegal Education (AAfPE) [USA]: "Paralegals perform substantive and procedural legal work as authorized by law, which work, in the absence of the paralegal, would be performed by an attorney. Paralegals have knowledge of the law gained through education, or education and work experience, which qualifies them to perform legal work. Paralegals adhere to recognized ethical standards and rules of professional responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafpe.org/p_about/whatis.htm AAfPE web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615183105/http://www.aafpe.org/p_about/whatis.htm |date=June 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the Institute of Paralegals [United Kingdom]: "A paralegal is a non-lawyer who does legal work that previously would have been done by a lawyer, or if done by a lawyer, would be charged for."
* From the Paralegal Society of Ontario [Canada]: "A paralegal is an individual qualified through education or experience licensed to provide legal services to the general public in areas authorized by the Law Society of Upper Canada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralegalsociety.on.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20:what-is-a-paralegal&amp;catid=2:faqs&amp;Itemid=107 |title=What is a paralegal? |publisher=Paralegalsociety.on.ca |date=2008-02-29 |accessdate=2011-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827175243/http://www.paralegalsociety.on.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20:what-is-a-paralegal&amp;catid=2:faqs&amp;Itemid=107 |archivedate=2011-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the National Association of Licensed Paralegals [United Kingdom]: "A person who is educated and trained to perform legal tasks but who is not a qualified solicitor or barrister."

== Difference between paralegals and legal secretaries ==
A legal secretary is generally a secretary who has a basic understanding of legal terminology and the specific formatting required by a particular court or government agency. Legal secretaries are also typically responsible for keeping case files organized and indexed, often taking on the duties of a [[Clerk|file clerk]]. Although legal secretaries may be trained to prepare some basic legal papers and letters, they generally have little or no knowledge of particular legal doctrines, statutes or regulations, and typically have no training or experience in conducting legal research or drafting legal documents, pleadings, motions, briefs or other court papers. On the other hand, a typical paralegal in the United States can perform all of these tasks under an attorney or law office.  Paralegals bill for their time at a higher rate than legal secretaries.

== Education, training, and certification ==

Most paralegals have completed a formal paralegal education program.  However, some paralegals have only on-the-job paralegal training. Formal paralegal education programs may result in a certificate, diploma, higher diploma, advanced diploma, associate degree, bachelor's degree, [[master's degree]], or paralegal certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralegalcertificates.org/training/ |title=Paralegal Training: paralegalcertificates.org |accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many paralegals have completed all of their training before entering the profession, while others have completed their education while working their way up from the mailroom in a law firm.  Many paralegals take Continuing Legal Education (CLE) courses to fulfill the requirements of their firm, state, or association.

== Economics ==

The paralegal phenomenon is a legal-economics argument in all jurisdictions – they exist precisely because they are not lawyers and thus can do the work much more cheaply.&lt;ref name="Paralegal purgatory" /&gt; Other than expertise, the main constraint on what work a paralegal can or cannot do tends to be local rules that reserve (i.e. give a monopoly to) particular activities to lawyers.  Each jurisdiction tends to have its own "reserved activities list".

According to United States law,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} there are five specific acts which only a licensed attorney can perform:

# Establish the attorney–client relationship
# Give legal advice
# Sign legal papers and pleadings on behalf of a party
# Appear in court on behalf of another (i.e. the client)&lt;ref&gt;Non-attorneys, including paralegals, can appear in a representative capacity in many types of administrative hearings (that is, hearings held by administrative agencies located within the executive branch, as opposed to courts formally organized as part of the judiciary).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Set and collect fees for legal services

Beyond the five acts above, the paralegal can perform practically any other task, including [[legal research]], [[legal writing]], factual investigation, preparation of exhibits, and the day-to-day tasks of case management. The key is that attorneys are entirely responsible for the actions of their paralegals, and, by signing and filing court documents drafted by paralegals (or [[law clerk]]s), attorneys make those documents their own.

=== Trends in usage of paralegals ===
In the United States, the need for accredited qualifications and bar licensure limits the number of licensed attorneys. At the same time, there are many legal tasks for which a bar license is unnecessary but some amount of legal training is helpful. In order to lower costs, businesses may choose to employ paralegals to undertake such tasks instead of a more expensive lawyer.  Paralegal time is typically billed at only a fraction of what a lawyer charges, and thus to the paralegal has fallen those substantive and procedural tasks which are too complex for [[legal secretary|legal secretaries]] (whose time is not billed) but for which lawyers can no longer bill.  This in turn makes lawyers more efficient by allowing them to concentrate solely on the substantive legal issues of the case, while paralegals have become the "case managers."

The growing demand of paralegal professionals at a very rapid rate has resulted in schools and colleges catering to such education popping up everywhere. It has been found through a survey that currently 50,000 students are enrolled in paralegal education courses. The American Association for Paralegal Education (AAPE) itself has more than 450 members; 260 of them are ABA-approved. Seminars and events are being held by various institutes to help broaden the knowledge base of the paralegal service providers and the importance associated with it. Although the nation is experiencing a recession, the paralegal profession continues to grow. Law firms and legal departments are cutting costs and increasing access to legal services by hiring paralegals.

The United Kingdom has gone one step further. Much legal work by lawyers for the poorer elements of society is [[legal aid|legally aided]], or paid for by the state. As overall costs have risen due to more people than ever engaging with the law, the government has reduced such legal aid. As a result, the work has become uneconomic for many and they have ceased doing it. Paralegal advisory firms are stepping in to fill the gap.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The increased use of paralegals has slowed the rising cost of legal services and serves in some small measure (in combination with contingency fees and insurance) to keep the cost of legal services within the reach of the regular population. However, one commentator has warned that "our profession makes a serious error if it uses legal assistants only as economic tools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Paralegal Medical Consultants ==
Some attorneys who practice in fields involving medical care have only a limited knowledge of healthcare and medical concepts and terminology. Therefore, Legal Medical Consultants which are professional physicians, paramedics, nurses and respiratory therapists, have become fully trained as paralegals in the manner described above and assist behind the scenes on these cases, in addition to serving as expert witnesses from time to time.

=== Australia ===
[[Australia]] has a distinct regime for the utiliziation of paralegals.&lt;ref name=Crowley&gt;Jill Irene Cowley, ''A comparative study of paralegalism in Australia, the United States of America, and England and Wales'', Thesis for [[Southern Cross University]] (Lismore, NSW, Australia 2004).  Found at [http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&amp;context=theses Southern Cross University website].  Accessed August 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one [[paralegal studies]] scholar:
{{quote|The legal profession’s monopoly in Australia is, however, confined to the right of appearance in a court of law and to the preparation of certain documents for reward, which leaves a vast field of legal tasks open to performance by other workers, including paralegals.|Jill Irene Cowley&lt;ref name=Crowley /&gt;}}
Furthermore, Australian paralegals have "little formal recognition of, or status accorded" them, yet they "require specialist education."&lt;ref name=Crowley /&gt;

=== Canada ===
In Canada, paralegals (except in Ontario) are generally trained assistants who assist lawyers, and work under the supervision of lawyers. Paralegals are not regulated by legislation (except in Ontario) and are not professionals in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.usask.ca/documents/research/deans-forum/10_Non-LawyerLegalServices_PolicyDiscussion_2015DeansForum.pdf A discussion paper on introducing paralegals into the Saskatchewan legal market]&lt;/ref&gt; Some provinces (such as British Columbia) allow lawyers to designate certain paralegals to provide additional services to clients. However, lawyers remain fully responsible for all action or omission of the designated paralegals. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/legalfeeds/author/elizabeth-raymer/lsbc-discontinues-paralegals-in-court-pilot-7252/ LSBC discontinues ‘paralegals in court’ pilot]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontario====
In Ontario, paralegals are licensed by the [[Law Society of Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsuc.on.ca|title=The Law Society of Upper Canada|work=lsuc.on.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario is with Washington State the only jurisdiction in the western hemisphere where paralegals are licensed and the profession is regulated as officers of the court. Licensed paralegals operate within a defined scope of practice, representing clients in matters such as provincial offenses (traffic tickets, etc.), immigration, landlord &amp; tenant disputes, labor law, small claims court (under $25,000), and specific criminal matters. They are currently not permitted to represent clients in family court or wills and estates.  By virtue of their office, licensed paralegals are commissioners for taking affidavits (swearing oaths).

In the province of [[Ontario]] paralegals are a regulated body within the legal system. Paralegals become commissioners upon licensing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commissioner for Taking Affidavit and Non-Lawyer Notaries|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/courts/notary_public/default.asp|website=Attorney General of Ontario|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may become non-lawyer notaries, [[Crown prosecutor]], municipal prosecutor or a justice of the peace if appointed.

Ontario recently became the first jurisdiction in North America to provide for the licensing of independent paralegals. This task will be the responsibility of the [[Law Society of Ontario]] (founded in 1797), which already regulates Ontario's 40,000 or so lawyers. Aspiring paralegals must complete an accredited educational program and complete a licensing exam. The Society will also be responsible for disciplining paralegals who do not conform to rules of professional conduct, known as the Paralegal Rules of Conduct.

In Ontario, as of December 2017, licensed paralegals are now endorsed and recognized as [[officers of the court]]. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.lawsocietygazette.ca/paralegal-update/paralegals-officers-of-the-court/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law Society began issuing the first paralegal licenses to grandparent applicants who fulfilled all the necessary licensing requirements (including insurance) in April 2008.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/paralegal/QandA.jsp#1 |title=Paralegal Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Rc.lsuc.on.ca |accessdate=2011-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103083639/http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/paralegal/QandA.jsp#1 |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paralegals who provide legal services to the public must carry [[professional liability insurance]] in accordance with By-Law 6, Part II, section 12 (1). Licensees must provide written proof of their compliance with this requirement to carry mandatory insurance before they begin providing legal services, as well as on an annual basis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;  Paralegal services may be provided via a sole proprietorship, partnership or professional corporation.  Licensees are strongly encouraged to seek professional advice on the best business structure for their particular situations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; A paralegal license allows a paralegal to independently represent clients in provincial offences court, summary conviction criminal court, small claims court and administrative tribunals such as the Financial Services Commission of Ontario or the [[Workplace Safety and Insurance Board]]. The role that a paralegal has in the United States is similar to the role of a law clerk or legal assistant in Ontario. Many paralegals in Ontario work in the areas of permitted practice for paralegals and also work alongside lawyers in areas of practice that are only permitted to be practiced by lawyers. It is illegal for paralegals in Ontario to independently practice in an area of law that is permitted only for lawyers. An example of this is family law, or an indictable offence in criminal law.

All lawyers and paralegals who practice law and provide legal services in Ontario, are required to complete the CPD program. Continuing professional development (CPD) is the maintenance and enhancement of a lawyer or paralegal's professional knowledge, skills, attitudes and professionalism throughout the individual's career. It is a positive tool that benefits lawyers and paralegals and is an essential component of the commitment they make to the public to practice law or provide legal services competently and ethically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/cpd/cpdFAQ.jsp |title=CPD Requirement – Continuing Professional Development |publisher=Rc.lsuc.on.ca |accessdate=2011-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425202549/http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/cpd/cpdFAQ.jsp |archivedate=2011-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main|Judicial scrivener}}
In Japan, the institution of {{nihongo|[[judicial scrivener]]|司法書士|'''shihō shoshi'''}} exists, and functions similarly to paralegals. Scriveners perform legal work, above the level of secretary but below the level of attorney, and may be attached to an attorney's office or operate independently. Scriveners may represent clients in some low-level matters, but not in more advanced stages of litigation. As with lawyers in Japan, scriveners are regulated and must pass an exam.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, legal assistants or paralegals must have extensive knowledge of the law and the administration of justice. Their duties may include: liaising with clients of their employers to assist in solving legal problems, legal research, preparing cases for court and liaising with the public. This programme is uniquely designed to impart a comprehensive overview of all aspects of paralegal specialisation and an understanding of individual rights and the rights of others. Paralegal offers the use and application of skills and competencies related to Criminal Law and Procedure, Civil Litigation, Wills and Estates, Dispute Resolution, Legal Advise, Property Law and Conveyancing as well as Legal Office Practice Management and Debt Collecting/Counselling.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Paralegals in South Africa are hired mostly by Legal Aid South Africa, big corporations, Patent law firms, legal firms, Estate agents, Government Departments etc. to provide legal support to those corporate world. Legal support may be by legal research, investigation/inspectors, legal advice or legal assistance. Certification may be acquired at: Tshwane University of Technology National Diploma in Legal Assistance/Paralegal, University Of Johanesburg Diploma in Paralegal, UNISA National Diploma in Law, South African School of Paralegals, Intec College Diploma in Paralegal, South African Law School Qualification in Paralegal, Damelin College Paralegal, Boston City Campus Paralegal certificate. Salaries range from R60,000 to R450,000 per year depending on experience.
Newly established law firms in South Africa are likely to hire qualified Paralegals with 3 year qualification in Legal Studies to provide Legal assistance. Though the South African Law Society and The Minister of Justice do want to come with regulation to guide paralegals in South Africa just like Canada and the USA, many practicing attorneys and Advocates did disprove in many instances however the new legislation is pending.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== South Korea ===
{{Main|Judicial scrivener}}
In South Korea a similar system to the Japanese exists, and is known as '''''beopmusa''''' (Hangul: {{lang|ko|법무사}}, Hanja: {{lang|ko|法務士}}).

=== United Kingdom ===
==== England and Wales ====
The original concept of paralegals in the UK started with the Paralegal Association in the mid-1980s (now the National Association of Licensed Paralegals). However the oldest incorporated professional body for paralegals in the UK who set the competency standards for paralegals and legal secretaries, issue legal qualifications, and support, represent and promote paralegals is the Institute Of Paralegals.

Both the Association and Institute have similar roles in recognising and registering Paralegals but do not always agree on all the principles of practice{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.

However, it is only recently that paralegals have begun to be seen as more than merely assistants to qualified lawyers. They are now a newly emergent, and increasingly distinct, group of legal professionals.

Due to a lack of metrics it is unclear exactly how many paralegals there are in the United Kingdom. The Office of National Statistics and the register of Standard Occupational Classification estimate that there are currently 76,000 mid-skilled “legal associate professionals.” Research published in 2014 by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) predicts that this figure is set to grow by 17% within the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newlawjournal.co.uk/nlj/content/paralegal-conundrum|title=The paralegal conundrum – New Law Journal|website=www.newlawjournal.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is estimated that there are now almost 4,000 government registered/regulated paralegal advisory firms offering services that would previously have been offered only by lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}This is because most legal work in the United Kingdom is deregulated and therefore there is nothing to stop anyone from opening their own paralegal law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiop.org/careers/your-own-firm.html|title=Institute of Paralegals – Your Own Firm?|website=www.theiop.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the term ‘paralegal’ is not protected like the term ‘solicitor’ anyone may call himself/herself a paralegal without any qualification or registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiop.org/membership/what-is-a-paralegal-2.html|title=Institute of Paralegals – Am I a Paralegal?|website=www.theiop.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional bodies are lobbying for this to change and the term ‘paralegal’ to become a protected title.&lt;ref name="Paralegal purgatory" /&gt;

Paralegals in England and Wales may only offer limited legal advice, as may any person, with the following exceptions strictly forbidden:

# Undertaking the activities reserved to solicitors under the Solicitors Act 1974;
# Undertaking immigration work if not registered with the Office of the Immigrations Services Commissioner;
# Undertaking certain types of claims/compensation related work if not registered with the Ministry of Justice.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Solicitors Act 1974]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&amp;PageNumber=54&amp;NavFrom=2&amp;activeTextDocId=2188768 |title=Statutelaw.gov.uk |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; reserves certain activities for solicitors. Broadly, these include:
* Preparing and lodging documents concerning the conveying or charging of land. Since repealed and now also conducted by [[Licensed conveyancer|Licensed Conveyancers]]
* Undertaking probate law.
* Undertaking litigation (except in the small claims court).

Paralegals technically have very limited rights to conduct litigation/rights of audience before courts/tribunals. In practice though many appear in courts and particularly tribunals at all levels as assistants.

Paralegals also act as Police Station Representatives if they are accredited, giving general advice to clients held in police custody.

==== Scotland ====
Scotland has separate legal jurisdiction from the rest of the United Kingdom. The term "paralegal" came into use from the 1980s. There have always been individuals undertaking legal work but not qualified as a solicitor but they would have had other titles such as 'legal assistant'. From the early 1990s the term "paralegal" became more common. In 1993 Scottish Paralegals Association was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-paralegal.org.uk|title=Scottish Paralegal Association - Scottish Paralegal Association|website=www.scottish-paralegal.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a voluntary body whose remit is to promote the interests of paralegals in Scotland. From 1991 Scotland's colleges began to offer paralegal qualifications, awarded by the Scottish Qualification Authority, namely the Higher National Diploma and Certificate in Legal Services. They were offered by Central College of Commerce, Stevenson College and Dundee College. As a result of the efforts of the Scottish Paralegal Association and in particular its president Christine Lambie, in 2010 the Law Society of Scotland, the solicitors' professional body, instituted the Law Society of Scotland Registered Paralegal scheme. This was a voluntary scheme providing a professional status for high quality paralegals. Around 400 paralegals, mainly individuals who had come through the ranks in legal firms, joined the scheme. From 2010 Scottish Qualification Authority and Stirling University offered qualifications for individuals wishing to enter the Registered Paralegal profession. Paralegals qualify in particular legal domains, e.g., Domestic Conveyancing; and Wills &amp; Executries. In 2017 the name of the scheme was changed to Law Society of Scotland Accredited Paralegal scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawscot.org.uk/members/membership-and-fees/categories-and-fees/accredited-paralegals/|title=Accredited Paralegals - Law Society of Scotland|website=Law Society of Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==== Professional societies ====
The largest number of paralegals in the UK are represented by the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx). Unlike other paralegal bodies CILEx is an Approved Regulator, meaning all its members are independently regulated in the public interest and must comply with a code of conduct, including all its paralegal members. CILEx is also the only body that provides paralegals with a limited progression route to lawyer status.

CILEx provides a non-University route to qualification as a non-qualified lawyer, with the majority of its members learning on-the-job and working as paralegals. It is open to those with or without law degrees, and allows paralegals to progress through to ultimately become fully qualified lawyers, partners, advocates, coroners and judges, subject to achieving the correct level of qualifications, skills, and experience.

Since 1994 City and Guilds, in association with CILEx, has offered the UK's leading range of nationally and internationally approved qualifications for paralegals and legal secretaries, which have been taken by over 20,000 people. They offer a Level 2 Award/Certificate/Diploma in Legal Studies qualification. This provides the underpinning knowledge which will help in day-to-day work and will also allows progression onto the CILEx route to becoming a lawyer. The qualification is divided into units and is assessed by way of assignments and a multiple-choice test. A Level 3 Diploma in Vocational Paralegal Studies qualification is also available, and this is equivalent to A-level standard. The qualification is divided into units and again, is assessed by way of assignments. The qualifications are also recognised by the CILEx as a route into their membership grades.

The Institute of Paralegals (IOP) administer a Route to Qualification: the nationally recognised career path for professional paralegals. They also set and administer Competency Standards for paralegals and legal secretaries.
The Institute of Paralegals (IOP) are:
* an incorporated paralegal representative body in the United Kingdom whose application for institute status was supported by the Bar Council, Law Society, Crown Prosecution Service and Citizens Advice
* the only body for professional paralegals to have relied on state funding to help develop the paralegal profession
* an organisation which publishes a Paralegal Code of Conduct
* a member of LawCare
* an organisation which publishes Competency Standards for the paralegal profession (drafted with the assistance of law firms and (in part) by Her Majesty's Land Registry and vetted for professional conduct requirements by the Solicitors Regulation Authority)
* an organisation which administers a paralegal career path – the Route to Qualification. The R2Q turns a job into a career, and an occupation into a profession. It is supported by scores of local law societies, university law schools, law firms and others

NALP (National Association of Licensed Paralegals) is an awarding body for paralegal qualifications, recognised as an awarding organisation by Ofqual, the regulator of qualifications in England and Wales. NALP offers self-regulation and Licensing for paralegals in England &amp; Wales. NALP's objective is to raise the profile of paralegals in the UK and has dedicated itself to the promoting the status of paralegals and paralegal training in the United Kingdom and abroad. NALP offers affordable accessible training and qualifications at all levels. NALP is a not for profit company limited by guarantee.

There are various levels of certification and membership according to the level of training, qualification and experience. To become a Licensed Paralegal a person should have an acceptable qualification in law, e.g., the Association's Diploma in Paralegal Studies, ILEX, Law Degree or HND (plus a procedural law qualification) or any other qualification deemed suitable, and who can satisfy the other criteria laid down by the Association namely: knowledge, competence, dedication, character requirements and continuous professional development.

NALPs mission is to re-enforce and increase its position as the leading professional organisation catering for the career paralegal not only within the legal profession but also within commerce, industry and the private and public sectors and will strive to ensure the proper recognition of its members as an integral part of the legal profession by the quality of its qualifications, professional development and the standards of behaviour and its regulatory powers laid down for its members. It will encourage, promote and develop the role and practice of the paralegal and represent the best interests of its members.

The Institute of Paralegals (IOP) is an incorporated professional body for paralegals in the UK. A not-for-profit organisation, they set the competency standards for paralegals and legal secretaries, issue legal qualifications, and support, represent and promote paralegals.
The National Association of Licensed Paralegals(NALP) was established in 1987 and is the professional self-regulatory governing body for accredited paralegals. Access into the profession can either be with a law degree or without. Those who are already graduates can take The Post Graduate Diploma in Paralegal Practice (PPC) (similar to the LPC for solicitors). Those that have no previous qualification can do the Diploma in Paralegal Studies. The NALP is an awarding body regulated by OFQUAL and is also a member of the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (based in the US).

As a not-for-profit professional body incorporated by guarantee, they were formed in 2003. They were granted institute status by the UK government in 2005, with the support of, amongst others, The Law Society of England &amp; Wales, the Bar Council, Citizens Advice and the Crown Prosecution Service, all of whom recognised the need for the developing paralegal profession to have a representative body.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

IOP offer: The Registered Paralegal, Certified Paralegal and Qualified Paralegal designations and believe these are not a 'licence to practice' as a paralegal. IOP state: "There is no such as a 'licensing scheme' operating in England and Wales. Anyone implying otherwise (i.e. that you need to do a particular course to qualify) is misrepresenting the position. You become a paralegal simply by getting a job as a paralegal. The majority of paralegals still do not have any formal legal qualifications. The only paralegals needing prior permission before practising are paralegal law firms or paralegal sole practitioners who come under the remit of the Ministry of Justice Or Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner."

The National Association of Licensed Paralegals is working to improve recognition for paralegals and has done so for nearly 24 years, having introduced qualifications and standards and self-regulation to the profession and is recognised by The Law Society of England as the professional body for paralegals in England &amp; Wales.

==== Salary ====
In the United Kingdom paralegal salaries in law firms can range from around £15,000 in some rural or suburban areas&lt;ref name="Paralegal purgatory"&gt;[http://l2b.thelawyer.com/training-paralegal-purgatory/3017068.article Paralegal purgatory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419015851/http://l2b.thelawyer.com/training-paralegal-purgatory/3017068.article |date=2014-04-19 }} ''Lawyer 2B'', 2014-03-24&lt;/ref&gt; but may reach as high as £60 – £80,000 for the most senior in the larger city firms and some PLCs.
A paralegal can also work as a freelance offering their services to solicitors performing tasks such assisting Counsel at court and taking notes in court and presenting applications to District Judges in chambers. They can be paid on a daily or hourly rate earning up to £60 – £260 per day.

=== United States ===

In the United States, paralegals originated as assistants to lawyers at a time when only lawyers offered legal services. In those jurisdictions where the local legal profession/judiciary is involved in paralegal recognition/accreditation, the profession of paralegal still basically refers to those people working under the direct supervision of a lawyer. The profession of paralegal varies greatly between the states, because some states do require paralegals to be licensed. In other jurisdictions however, such as the [[United Kingdom]], the lack of local legal profession/judiciary oversight means that the definition of paralegal encompasses non-lawyers doing legal work, regardless of whom they do it for. Although most jurisdictions recognize paralegals to a greater or lesser extent, there is no international consistency as to definition, job-role, status, terms and conditions of employment, training, regulation or anything else and so each jurisdiction must be looked at individually.

In the United States, there is no such thing as a paralegal ''licensed'' by a government body; rather, paralegals can be "registered," "certified," or ''certificated'' by private organizations.

There are two major national organizations that offer professional certification to paralegals who meet voluntary regulation standards: the National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA) established in 1976&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nala.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309145543/http://www.nala.org/ |date=2012-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Federation of Paralegal Associations (NFPA) established in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralegals.org|title=National Federation of Paralegal Associations|work=paralegals.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both NALA and the NFPA offer professional certification exams that should not be confused with a paralegal certificate offered by an officially accredited college or university.

NALA offers its Certified Legal Assistant or Certified Paralegal examination, a comprehensive two-day examination that covers the following subjects: Communications, Ethics, Legal Research, Judgment and Analytical Ability, American Legal System and four sub-sections selected by the applicants from a list of nine substantive areas of the law. These sub-section tests cover general knowledge of the following practice areas: Administrative Law, Bankruptcy, Business Organizations, Civil Litigation, Contracts, Criminal Law and Procedure, Estate, Planning and Probate, Family Law and Real Estate. After successful completion of the examination, NALA awards the paralegal the "CLA" (Certified Legal Assistant) or "CP" (Certified Paralegal) designation. Both the "CLA" and "CP" designations are proprietary trademarks owned by NALA. Paralegals who have attained further education and received a paralegal certificate are referred to as "Certificated" unless they have passed the examination and have been awarded the "Certified" designation. Additionally, those paralegals who receive the "Certified Paralegal" designation then have the opportunity to earn the "Advanced Certified Paralegal" designation. There is a 45 to 50 percent pass rate for persons taking the NALA exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralegalcertificateprograms.com/tips.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313202516/http://www.paralegalcertificateprograms.com/tips.html |archivedate=2011-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFPA offers its non-accredited Paralegal Advanced Competency Exam, which is a four-hour exam on a variety of legal topics; those who pass that exam can call themselves PACE-Registered Paralegals and display the "RP" designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller |first=Roger |author2=Mary Meinzinger Urisko |year=2007 |title=West's paralegal today |isbn=1-4180-5032-6 |publisher=Delmar Learning |location=Albany, N.Y. |oclc=84737349 |pages=2, 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NFPA’s core purpose is to advance the paralegal profession and is committed to the profession’s Code of Ethics.

Some states have considered the licensure of paralegals.  Whether paralegals should be licensed or certified is one of the most important issues for paralegals today.

==== Difference between paralegals and lawyers ====
The greatest differences between lawyers and paralegals are that lawyers give legal advice, can set fees, appear as counsel of record in court, and sign pleadings (and other court documents) in a representative capacity. A paralegal who attempts to do any of these acts will be in violation of the [[unauthorized practice of law]] statutes in most U.S. states. Paralegals are responsible for handling tasks such as legal writing, research, and other forms of documentation for the lawyers for whom they work.

==== Penalties for unauthorized practice ====
Paralegals are restrained from exercising independence and prohibited from providing even basic legal advice to consumers of legal advice. In her book, ''Access to Justice'', Stanford law professor Deborah Rhode states: "Over four-fifths of surveyed attorneys have supported prosecution of lay practitioners, and the profession has repeatedly blocked licensing proposals that would enable independent paralegals to offer routine services. Many local, state and national bar associations have recently launched initiatives to broaden the definition, raise the penalties, and increase the enforcement of unauthorized practice prohibitions."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Access to Justice'', Oxford: University Press (2004), at 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, legal document assistants actually advertise themselves as paralegals. Many states, including Florida, have enacted laws or bar rules which require any person referring to himself or herself as a paralegal to work under the supervision of a licensed attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridabar.org/divexe/rrtfb.nsf/FV/B8F1801F71B62CE9852573E5005497A9 |title=Section 20-2.1, Rules Regulating the Florida Bar |publisher=Floridabar.org |accessdate=2011-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928172833/http://www.floridabar.org/divexe/rrtfb.nsf/FV/B8F1801F71B62CE9852573E5005497A9 |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule would prohibit those individuals working as "independent paralegals" from using the title "paralegal".

==== Salary ====
In the United States, as of May 2012, the median annual salary for a paralegal was [[US$]]46,990.

Paralegals have been used in the United States for almost 50 years. A law firm in Los Angeles used a paralegal to prepare Estate Planning Documents such as Will and Trusts beginning in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;personal experience-I was a paralegal at that firm from 1970-1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paralegal Service or Document Preparers ====
There are a variety of services available to the general public depending on the State of residence. These companies have been known as Paralegal Services until they were required to change their names.  These companies are now typically known to the general public as Court Document Preparers or Court Forms Providers.  The State of Florida has numerous companies that prepare court documents for a variety of issues, such as Divorce, Bankruptcy, Paternity, Custody, Modification of Child Support, Name Change, Wills, Power of Attorney, Quit Claim Deeds, etc.  If you do not have the ability to remedy your situation because of the high cost fees of any attorney a Court Document Preparer can save thousands of dollars.  Such document preparers, however, frequently come under the scrutiny of various state bar organizations by overstepping the basic document preparation and engaging in what could be considered "unauthorized practice of law."  Such document preparation is indeed cost-saving for those who truly want to represent themselves in a legal matter, but want to pay someone to create the required documents.  If problems arise in the legal case, however, the person who hired the paralegal service needs to understand that there is typically no legal liability on the part of the paralegal service and that such institutions cannot be sued for legal malpractice.  Again, the philosophy is that the person utilizing such service is representing himself or herself in all legal matters and merely hiring a document preparer.

==== California ====

In California, under [[Business and Professions Code]] §&amp;nbsp;6450, a paralegal must have at least one of the following:
# An ABA approved paralegal certificate.
# A certificate of completion of a paralegal program at, or a degree from, a postsecondary institution that requires the successful completion of a minimum of 24 semester, or equivalent, units in law-related courses and that has been accredited by a national or regional accrediting organization or approved by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education.
# A bachelor's degree or advanced degree in any subject and at least one year of experience performing legal tasks under the supervision of an attorney that has at least three years' legal experience in California himself.  The attorney must sign a written declaration stating the paralegal is qualified to perform legal tasks.
# Before December 31, 2003, have completed a high school diploma or general equivalency diploma and a minimum of three years of law-related experience under the supervision of an attorney that has at least three years' legal experience in California himself.  The attorney must sign a written declaration stating the paralegal is qualified to perform legal tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6450-6456 |title=Business and Professions Code Section 6450-6456 |publisher=Official California Legislative Information |accessdate=July 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503130111/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6450-6456 |archivedate=May 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until Business and Professions Code §&amp;nbsp;6450 was signed into law by Governor [[Gray Davis]] in 2000, there was little regulation of paralegals in California. One of the purposes of regulation under Business and Professions Code §&amp;nbsp;6450 was to shut down the paralegals who were providing self-help legal services to consumers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} There had been relatively few consumer complaints against paralegals; instead most of the complaints were from lawyers who urged the California State Bar to police the unauthorized practice of law (UPL).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In response, the State Bar appointed a Public Protection Committee to look at the L.A. bar's claim.  Then, "in 1988, the Public Protection Committee unanimously recommended that the California legislature completely abolish the state's UPL laws. It further concluded that independent paralegals should be allowed to provide all types of legal services as long as they are registered with a state agency and disclose their non-lawyer status to all customers." After many local bar associations reacted in dismay, "The California Bar then appointed a third group (The Commission on Legal Technicians) to restudy the issue. This commission largely agreed with the conclusions of its predecessors and recommended that non-lawyers be authorized by the California Supreme Court to deliver legal services in several major areas (bankruptcy, family, immigration, and landlord-tenant), under the terms of a licensing scheme that would be supervised by an independent state agency."&lt;ref&gt;See Ralph Warner, The Independent Paralegal’s Handbook, California: Nolo (2004), pages 278 &amp; 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

This development culminated in some paralegals being forced to give up the title paralegal for Legal Document Assistant (LDA) in order to administer legal services directly to the public in the allowed areas under California Bus &amp; Prof. Code §&amp;nbsp;6400. Paralegals who are members of professional associations are also bound by those associations' codes of ethics many of which include sections prescribing that members not offer legal services directly to the public without the supervision of an attorney or law firm.&lt;ref&gt;See NALA Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility" (Canon 2 "A paralegal may perform any task which is properly delegated and supervised by an attorney…"); the NFPA "Model Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility" (1.8: "A Paralegal Shall Not Engage In The Unauthorized Practice of Law"); and NALS "Code of Ethics &amp; Professional Responsibility" (Canon 7:  Members of this association, unless permitted by law, shall not perform paralegal functions except under the direct supervision of a lawyer").&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paralegals in popular culture ==
Unlike nurses and [[physician assistant]]s, paralegals have not caught the popular imagination and rarely are seen or mentioned in fictional or non-fiction legal television programs, or in legal fiction in print. There are however exceptions.

The most famous is probably [[Erin Brockovich]], a real legal clerk whose participation in a [[toxic tort]] case became a major motion picture. In the movie ''[[Eagle Eye (film)|Eagle Eye]]'' (2008) starring [[Shia LaBeouf]] and [[Michelle Monaghan]], Monaghan plays a single mom who works as a paralegal.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Craig, Paralegals and Legal Assistants in Film and Television; [http://community.globeuniversity.edu/paralegal/?p=93 Community.globeuniversity.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803140659/http://community.globeuniversity.edu/paralegal/?p=93 |date=2009-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable exception is the character [[Della Street]], from the ''[[Perry Mason]]'' novel, television and movie series.  Although Mason identifies Della as "my confidential secretary", the projects he assigns her are entirely consistent with the law office work performed by experienced paralegals.

[[Allison DuBois]], the lead character in ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]'' played by [[Patricia Arquette]], was in training to become a paralegal in addition to her consultation work with the Phoenix, Arizona District Attorney's office.

[[John Grisham]] includes many paralegals in his novels; for example, Rudy Baylor (the main character in ''[[The Rainmaker (novel)|The Rainmaker]]'') works briefly as a paralegal – and his associate Deck Shifflet subsequently becomes Rudy's paralegal when he starts his own firm.
(although he terms himself a 'paralawyer')

''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]'', an esoteric cartoon comedy, features a paralegal in the form of Avenger, Harvey Birdman's eagle, who is usually seen managing files, preparing and presenting documents to the attorneys, and drafting letters to clients. Avenger will usually accompany the charismatic, yet often underprepared, Birdman into court, and whisper case information and advice into his ear. Despite not knowing English, he is by far the most competent employee of Sebben &amp; Sebben.

[[FX (TV network)|FX]]'s ''[[The Riches]]'' in which Doug Rich, a con-artist played by [[Eddie Izzard]], impersonates a lawyer at a cutthroat real estate development company. Rich's apparent lack of legal knowledge is often compensated by Aubrey McDonald, a highly skilled paralegal who manages to help guide the undereducated anti-hero through more than a few sticky situations.

USA Network's "[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]" features a young paralegal named Rachel, played by [[Meghan Markle]], who greatly assists a young aspiring lawyer with various research and otherwise. She is a highly respected member of the firm and is considered to be of help to many of her co-workers. Rachel's desire one day to become a lawyer is one of the major stories of the series. As paralegal, she lives between a lot of appreciation for her hard work and a constant reminder (going both from herself and other people) that she's not a "real" lawyer at the end.

In [[Eoin Colfer]]'s book ''The Supernaturalists'', paralegals are lawyers that double as mercenaries to apprehend and then prosecute offenders for the person, or more common, company who hired them.

In the musical ''[[Dear Evan Hansen]]'', Evan Hansen's mother, Heidi, is studying to become a paralegal.

A few current and former paralegals have also ventured into politics, including [[Amanda Reeve]] (Arizona State Legislature) and [[Michael Strautmanis]] (friend of 44th president of The United States [[Barack Obama]] and former member of [[White House Staff]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brian craig, Current and Former Paralegals Involved in Politics, available at: {{cite web |url=http://community.globeuniversity.edu/paralegal/?p=211 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203090441/http://community.globeuniversity.edu/paralegal/?p=211 |archivedate=2011-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3177">{{Wills, trusts, estates}}
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, a '''personal representative''' or '''legal personal representative''' is a person appointed by a court to administer the estate of another person. If the estate being administered is that of a deceased person, the personal representative is either an [[executor]] if the deceased person left a will or an [[administrator of an estate|administrator]] of an [[intestate]] estate.&lt;ref&gt;Hayton &amp; Marshall (2005) '''1-127'''-'''1-128'''&lt;/ref&gt; In other situations, the personal representative may be a guardian or trustee, or other position. As a [[fiduciary]], a personal representative has the duties of [[loyalty]], [[Duty of candor|candor]] or [[honesty]], and [[good faith]]. In the United States, ''punctilio of honor'', or the highest standard of honor, is the level of scrupulousness that a fiduciary must abide by.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meinhard v. Salmon]]'', 164 N.E. 545 (N.Y. 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

In either case of a deceased estate, a [[probate court]] of competent jurisdiction issues a finding of fact, including that a will has or has not been filed, and that an executor or administrator has been appointed. These are often referred to as "'''letters testamentary'''", "'''letters of administration'''" or "'''letters of representation'''", as the case may be. These documents, with the appropriate [[death certificate]], are often the only license a person needs to do the banking, stock trading, real estate transactions, and other actions necessary to marshal and dispose of the deceased's estate in the name of the estate itself.

==Types==
There are a number of types of personal representatives, including:&lt;!-- Please respect alphabetical order --&gt;
* [[Administrator (law)|Administrator]]
* [[De bonis non administratis|Administrator ''de bonis non'']] - one acting without complete authority
* [[Alternate executor]]
* [[Ancillary administration|Ancillary administrator]]
* [[Conservator (law)|Conservator]]
* [[Executor]] or executrix (term for females)
* [[Legal guardian]]
* [[Overseer (law)|Overseer]] - an assistant to an executor, now mostly obsolete
* [[Public administrator]]

==U.S. Department of Defense==
In the U.S., the [[Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants]] appointed a [[Personal Representative (CSRT)]] to meet with each captive who was still being held in [[extrajudicial detention]] in the [[United States]] [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s, in [[Cuba]], in August 2004, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] forced the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to  start convening [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s.  Such a personal representative is more like a ''[[guardian ad litem]]''.

The more centralized a state, the more citizens will likely try and affect the political agenda.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|year=2016|title=The Political Agenda Effect and State Centralization|url=http://www.nber.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/papers/w22250.pdf|journal=NBER|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, many political elites tend to prefer a non-centralized state where they can maintain more control over the political agenda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The “Political Agenda Effect” asserts that when citizens from different backgrounds get together, their agenda will change in a way that takes their demands away from elites to focus more on public goods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The “Escalation Effect” contends that if citizens get together, this will induce elites to form national resources to fight against them and maintain the political agenda the way they desire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The impact agenda is the increasing requirements for researchers to prove that there are real world impacts from their research. It is related to the political agenda because often governments measure a positive real world impact only in terms of the political agenda they have.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  When it comes to building the political agenda, there are three main models which are commonly cited: the outside initiative model, mobilization model, and inside initiative model.

== What Players Affect the Political Agenda ==

=== Political and Policy Elites ===
The political agenda is essentially defined as what governmental officials find important to discuss.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/prespowers.html|title=Presidential Powers under the U. S. Constitution|last=Linder|first=Doug|website=law2.umkc.edu|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those closest to the policy process have the biggest control on what issues reach the political agenda. They are the ones with the most power to decide which ideas or issues have the most importance, and which ideas or issues are unimportant. For example, the President of the United States, has the power to make treaties, appoint [[ambassador]]s, appoint judges of the [[supreme court]] etc. These types of powers ultimately shape what voices are present in parliament and subsequently what issues reach the political agenda.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Non-governmental Activist Groups ===
Some non-governmental activist groups, such as neighborhood associations,  advocate for civic beautification or improvement of communities.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/31611-ngos-and-global-policy-making.html|title=NGOs and Global Policy-Making|last=Forum|first=James Paul - Global Policy|website=www.globalpolicy.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other important activist groups, like those oriented towards [[human rights]] and social [[justice]], campaign for broad ideals. These groups work to put continuous pressure on government leaders that shape the agenda. If enough pressure is exerted onto political leaders through activist groups, it can change which issues and ideas ultimately reach the political agenda.  For example the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) and the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), usually try to influence politicians on professional jobs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Private Sector Lobbyists ===
Private sector lobbyists affect the political agenda by influencing the decisions and ideas of political leaders. When large-scale private corporations have a vested influence in a policy area, they can use their money and power to try to either keep or eliminate an issue from the political agenda. For example, private food lobbyist spent $101 Million in 2015 to fight against GMO Labeling and its prevalence on the political agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ewg.org/research/lobbying-anti-labeling-groups-tops-100m|title=Food Lobby Spends $101 Million in 2015 to Avert GMO Labeling|work=EWG|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of private sector lobbyists is made even stronger with the trend of revolving door lobbyists. This is when those who previous worked within government and gained knowledge of it, then enter the private sector to lobby.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ukessays.com/essays/politics/impact-of-lobbyists-on-public-policies-politics-essay.php|title=Impact Of Lobbyists On Public Policies Politics Essay|work=UKEssays|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When those people who once served as public officials go into the private sector, they can work to influence their former colleagues. Stern’s study in 2009 found that since 1998, 43 percent of the 198 members of US Congress who left government to join private life have registered to lobby.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Think tanks ===
[[Think tank]]s are in need of financial backing. Most times wealthy and established investors who wish to advance a certain idea or cause onto the political agenda establish them. These issues or causes may include: economics, taxes, [[foreign policy]], global development, education, children and families, or healthcare.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/politics-government/how-think-tanks-represent-causes-and-agendas-in-washington-d-c/|title=How Think Tanks Represent Causes and Agendas in Washington, D.C. - dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of think tanks that promote a certain political perspective onto the political agenda are the [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] and [[American Enterprise Institute]] which are highly conservative. On the other side, the [[Center for American Progress]], are more liberal with their motives.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Courts ===
When the courts make a decision that changes a previous line of thinking, that idea immediately is on the political agenda because laws and [[public administration]] must change accordingly.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/who-sets-the-agenda-in-politics-20110314-1bu8g.html|title=Who sets the agenda in politics?|last=Gallop|first=Geoff|date=2011-03-15|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mabo decision by the High Court in 1992 which overturned previous laws about establishing native titles is an example of this.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== World Events ===
When something unexpected happens it can force the political agenda to change immediately. For example, when [[Hurricane Katrina]] or the [[September 11 attacks|World Trade Centre]] attacks occurred they were unexpected but priority changing events. When big world events (i.e. disasters/tragedies) occur they are often followed by a policy response as well, and so what issues and ideas reach the political agenda are sometimes changed simply due to what happened in the world.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Varying Theories on Who Sets the Agenda ==
There are three main theories on how political agendas are set and which groups have the greatest say in the decisions regarding them. They are; the pluralist theory, the elitist theory, and the institutional theory.

=== The Pluralist theory ===
The [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] theory suggests that policy-making is divided into several categories or “arenas”. Groups that do not have any power in one particular arena, most often have power in another arena. There is a marketplace for competing policies, and interests, and any group may win the arena. [[Election]]s often determine who gets to decide on each public policy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~msaintg/ppa590/agenda.htm|title=PPA 590 WOMEN &amp; PUBLIC POLICY|last=|first=|date=2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Elitist Theory ===
In the [[Elitism|elitist]] theory a main power elite dominates the entire agenda setting process to serve their own interests. These interests hold the power in all the arenas and they always win every election. There are very few people that actually organize into separate interest groups. In order to retain power and control, the main elite works at keeping key issues off the agenda. This suppression of issues threatens [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== The Institutional Theory ===
This theory believes that legislative committees and [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] institutions are the main controllers of the agenda.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because social interests and issues have much impact on what is considered by the legislative committees and bureaucratic institutions, individuals do not benefit from agenda decisions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This type of system leads to more [[Conservatism|conservative]] policy decisions than those under the pluralist scenario, but far more conservative than under the elite scenario.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Political Agenda and the Media ==
The media is tightly linked to what issues gain importance on the political agenda. It affects what ideas become widespread and therefore what is demanded from politicians. Numerous studies have done research to prove this:

Hajo B Boomgaarden and Rens Vliegenthart write on the media’s relation to political agenda in their article ''Explaining the rise of anti-immigrant parties: The role of news media content''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boomgaarden|first=Hajo G.|last2=Vliegenthart|first2=Rens|title=Explaining the rise of anti-immigrant parties: The role of news media content|url=https://dx.doi.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/10.1016/j.electstud.2006.10.018|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=26|issue=2|pages=404–417|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2006.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this article they study the media coverage on anti-immigration in the [[Netherlands]] for the period of 1990 to 2002 and found that it directly relates to the success of anti-immigration populist parties such as Centrumdemocraten (CD), the Centrum Partij (CP), and the Lijst Pim Fortuyn (LPF) during the same time period. Their analysis used the importance of news media as the explanatory factor of why anti-immigration gained prevalence on the political agenda, while controlling for other real world factors and developments at the time such as the influence of the economy, immigration, or the leadership of then President [[Pim Fortuyn]]. This was done by conducting a content analysis of five of the most popular Dutch national newspapers. The empirical results showed support of anti-immigration was around 4% in 1994, and rose to 16% in 2001 during the same time that media coverage of anti-immigration was at its peak. This means, the test showed that media content can be held at least partly responsible for the rise of anti-immigrant parties in the Netherlands and the changing of the political agenda in this way.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A similar study done by Julie Sevenans, Stefaan Walgrave &amp; Gwendolyn Joanna Epping compares the behavior of politicians in comparison to the media on a global scale.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study was completed during one week, in Flemish Belgium. Every day, eight news outlets were studied and fully coded for a total of 2448 cases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study looked at individual politicians cognitive attention for these specific news stories, via a face-to face survey of MPs to see if they recalled, hadtalked about, or considered the content covered in these news outlets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The results showed that the prominence and usefulness of a news story affect whether a news story is noticed, talked about or considered by [[Member of parliament|MPs]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This work showed that political agenda-setting effects most likely begin from the selective adoption on the cognitive, and individual level of MPs. Politicians both consume the news much how regular citizens by paying more attention the most prominent stories. However, they are also selective in that they pay the most attention to news that is political in nature or match their interests. More specifically, politicians pay more attention to: news that is more prominent, about the region their parliament is responsible for, issues they are personally specialized in, news about issues that are salient for their party, and news about politics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All of these claims were confirmed by statistical analysis. Relating to the political agenda, the implications of the fact that MPs care so much about media reports are twofold: some MPs may think media coverage is reflective of public opinion, while others may feel the media affect what the public sees as important.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In either case, politicians are interpreting that the public cares about major news stories and taking this into account when setting the political agenda.

George Edwards and Dan Wood conducted a time series analysis of presidential, mass media and congressional attention to five political issues: crime, education, health care, U.S.-Soviet relations, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who influences whom? The president, Congress, and the media|last=Edwards|first=George|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end conclusion was that most of the time presidents react corresponding to fluctuations in media attention on an issue.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It too showed a relationship between the media and political agenda.

== Political Agenda Lag ==
Although the media does often have an effect on the political agenda, these results are not always immediate. Dearing and Rogers (1996)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; conducted a study on this and concluded that time lags from what is in the media transferring in the political agenda can take up to a few weeks to several months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Political Agenda and State Centralization ==
The political agenda is tied to state centralization because the more centralized a state is, the more political elites have control over the political agenda. However if a state is too centralized, the more the public may feel they need they need to advocate to change the political agenda as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Political Agenda can be further broken down into two concepts: the political agenda effect, and the escalation effect.

=== The Political Agenda Effect ===
The political agenda effect states that state [[Centralisation|centralization]] alters the dynamics of political action and conflict in society. State centralization, which involves elites coordinating nationally, induces citizens to organize nationally as well, rather than at the local or the “[[Parochialism|parochial]]” level. When  this happens and citizens from different regions, sectors, interests, backgrounds, or ethnicity all join together to organize and discuss certain policies their agenda will change in a direction that switches their demands from power-holders to focus more on public goods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this case then a state that has a higher level of [[Centralisation|centralization]] it may incite citizens to try and change the agenda themselves. Therefore,  political elites might instead prefer a non-centralized state where they can still maintain more control over the political agenda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Elites may strategically opt for a non-centralized state in order to induce the citizens to not organize nationally and thus avert the political agenda effect.

=== The Escalation Effect ===
The “Escalation Effect” contends that if citizens get together, it will force elites to form national resources to fight against them and maintain the political agenda the way they desire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the case that citizens band together in a national organization, this will entice political elites to also form a national organization and pool their resources together in attempt to fight against the citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; National organizations created by citizens might have a lower probability of success in comparison to organizations formed by elites, but in either case they will still indirectly benefit the weaker citizen groups, who would have otherwise remained unorganized. An escalation of the conflict can be seen as ensuing in this scenario.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Impact Agenda ==
The beginnings of the concept of the “impact agenda” can be traced to William Waldegrave’s 1993 white paper “Realizing Our Potential”.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jun/01/making-impact-scientists|title=Making an impact: when science and politics collide|last=Smith|first=Adam|date=2012-06-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact agenda describes how there are increasing requirements set out by the state  for researchers to relate their studies to real world issues in order to validate their research and access government funding. This is shown by the fact that the Biological and Sciences Research Council announced in 2012 that it expects its institutes to detail impact. This idea has been heavily criticized by scientists for allowing non-scientists to pick winners and losers and for constraining researchers to only create an impact that is aligned with the government's political agenda.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Models of  Political Agenda Building ==
Roger Cobb, Jennie Keith Ross and Marc Howard Ross developed the “models of agenda building” theory to specify three different models: the outside initiative model, mobilization model, and inside initiative model. These models are designed to show the different ways the political agenda changes.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Roger|last2=Ross|first2=Jennie-Keith|last3=Ross|first3=Marc Howard|date=1976-01-01|title=Agenda Building as a Comparative Political Process|jstor=1960328|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=70|issue=1|pages=126–138|doi=10.2307/1960328}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study related success of an idea being translated from the "[[Public Agenda|public agenda]]" (being discussed regularly) to the “formal agenda” (government taking serious considerations into making changes in that specific area).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Success in this study meant an issue was placed on the formal agenda and given attention by decision makers. Results showed that achieving agenda status is more difficult in modern nations than in smaller nations rooted in face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; More specifically:
# The more [[homogeneous]] a society is, the higher the ability to achieve agenda status&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
# A higher internal migration rate and population increase, means achieving agenda status will be more difficult&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
# The higher amount of potential agendas in which a specific issue may be placed, the higher the success rate of reaching the political agenda&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
# The fewer issues around redistribution of material resources in a given society, the greater the chance of reaching the political agenda&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
The study also found that there are components of political agendas that hold true across nations and across different models:
# The greater the proportion of issues not reaching the formal agenda, the higher the level of discontent and political instability within the wider community&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
# As the time gap between an issue being raised and it reaching formal agenda status increases, so does public instability&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Outside initiative model ===
The outside initiative model discusses the process where issues arise in non-governmental organizations and then are expanded to reach the formal agenda.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The order of events starts with a grievance, an expansion of interest supported by nongovernmental groups, and then an exertion of pressure onto decision makers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It is about the process through which issues arise in non-governmental groups and are then expanded sufficiently to reach, first the public agenda and then the formal agenda.  The outside initiative model is most prevalent in [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] societies.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== The mobilization model ===
The mobilization model is focused around political agenda issues that are initiated within government and subsequently reach the public agenda and formal agenda status. Its focus is on the internal mechanism and how politicians work to get ideas formalized onto the agenda. However, success in implementation does require support from the public under this model as well.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The mobilization model is most commonly linked with [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] societies, or those societies which emphasize a wide gap between the leader and his or her followers.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Inside initiative model ===
The inside initiative model describes when issues are initiated within government, but supporters make no effort to expand it to the public.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It is a model that is opposed to public participation. Instead, supporters of the issues rely solely on their own ability to apply the right amount of pressure to ensure formal agenda status. The inside access model is most often seen in societies with high concentrations of wealth and status.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The '''Program on Energy Efficiency in Artisanal Brick Kilns in Latin America to Mitigate Climate Change''' (EELA) is a program of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) which is implemented by Swiss contact in conjunction with its partners in nine countries in [[Latin America]]. The objective is to mitigate [[climate change]] through the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions in Latin America and to improve the quality of life of the population in the areas of intervention.

==The problem==
Artisanal brick producers in Latin America use fuel with high environmental impact in [[kiln]]s with low [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. Wood, tires and plastics, among other fuels, are used to fire bricks, contributing to air pollution and deforestation as well as increasing the causes of climate change. Despite their contribution to the construction industry and the generation of jobs, artisanal brick producers largely operate informally and are generally excluded from social, environmental and economic public policies.

==The approach==
The EELA program is focused on developing management models for artisanal brick producers, and includes activities that range from the adoption of more efficient production processes that require less fuel and emit less greenhouse gases, to the creation of new products that use less raw materials.

==EELA activities==
:* Innovation through the introduction of technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are financially viable for artisanal brick producers.
:* Working in coordination with public bodies to incorporate the artisanal brick production sector within the national climate change mitigation agenda.
:* Taking account of lessons learned within the countries, and promoting the exchange of experiences among them.

==Areas of operation==
EELA began its first phase working with 970 artisanal brick producers in seven areas located in San Juan (Argentina), Cochabamba (Bolivia), Serido (Brazil), Nemocon (Colombia), Cuenca (Ecuador), Leon (Mexico) and Cusco (Peru). In 2012, Nicaragua and Honduras joined the initiative. The experience gained in the pilot areas will serve as a basis to expand EELA’s intervention at a national level.

==Aims==
EELA hopes to reduce the GHG emissions of artisanal brick producers in the countries of operation by 30% and increase their income by 10%.

==Artisanal brick producers in San Jeronimo, Cusco, Peru==
In conjunction with the Ministry of Production, the Regional Directorate of Production and the Municipality of San Jeronimo, EELA works to promote good manufacturing practices to better employ heat as well as provide technical assistance in the following areas:
:* Mixers designed to optimize time and resources
:* Extrusion machinery to use less raw materials and diversify production
:* Fans to make kiln combustion more effective

EELA constructed a downdraft kiln that is more efficient than a traditional kiln and that is affordable for an artisanal brick producer. The kiln is being replicated by brick producers in San Jerónimo, Cuenca (Ecuador) and in Mexico.

==Challenges==
In a second phase, EELA will seek to improve the management models through the use of knowledge gained from its first phase. 
&lt;!--THIS NEXT SECTION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND AND CERTAINLY NOT A STYLE OF WRITING THAT IS OK IN WIKIPEDIA. SO PLEASE REWRITE IN PLAIN ENGLISH (OR DELETE!)!!.......
==EELA as a facilitator== 
The development of a market approach will be used as a strategy to incorporate artisanal brick producers in a comprehensive system and determine how to generate effective and large-scale changes on the basis of the identification of market barriers and stakeholder incentives.

EELA will try to ensure the future sustainability of its activities by adopting a facilitating role that will seek to influence the market and articulate its different stakeholders without becoming one of them. Within this context, EELA will foster the creation of conditions that will allow the artisanal brick producer access to different technological innovations while considering the dynamics of the market itself.--&gt;

==Joint effort==
EELA is supported by a group of partners that includes both public and private entities with experience in the brick sector, in each of the countries in which it operates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1942">Under [[common law]], '''public-interest privilege''' prevents the compulsory disclosure of documents or information which is against the public interest.  There is a balance between public interests- if the public interest in secrecy is greater than the public interest in disclosure, it will be privileged.  The public interest in disclosure is the principle that a court of justice ought not be denied access to relevant information, and that the opposing party should have access to all relevant information to make their case.&lt;ref&gt;''Sankey v Whitlam'' (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other privileges, this right is not vested in any party or entity.  The court may, of its own motion, prevent admission of evidence if it thinks it may disclose privileged information.  The government need not be a party to proceedings for privilege to be raised.&lt;ref&gt;''Sankey'' at 44&lt;/ref&gt; Privilege, being vested in the public interest and not a party, cannot be waived by a party.   However, if the information has been published elsewhere this is a very strong factor towards the public interest of disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;''Sankey'' at 45&lt;/ref&gt;

This privilege may be claimed on two bases.  Firstly, that the documents belong to a class of documents which the public interest requires should not be disclosed.  In [[Australia]], even for documents belonging to a very high level documents, such as cabinet papers, the court must interrogate whether it really is prejudicial to the public interest to disclose it.&lt;ref&gt;Sankey&lt;/ref&gt;  Australian judges in general have been more willing to disclose information than judges in [[England]] or [[Canada]]. &lt;ref&gt;Suzanne McNicol, Law of Privilege (1st ed, 1992) at 410&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Richardson v Schwarzenegger''''' was an [[internet]] [[defamation]] case heard in the United Kingdom [[High Court of Justice]] (Queen’s Bench Division), on 29 October 2004.  Claimant [[Anna Richardson]], a prominent British television presenter, claimed to have been libeled in the 2 October 2003 issue of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', which was available in print and online in the UK, as a result of statements made by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]’s then gubernatorial campaign manager.  

One key issue in this case was to determine the appropriate [[Venue (law)|venue]]: Can a suit be brought before a United Kingdom jurisdiction for statements made by an American in [[California]] which are immune from suit under local law?

==Facts of the case==

The claimant, Anna Richardson, made no claims against the authors of the allegedly defamatory ''Los Angeles Times'' article, nor against the publishers of the paper.  The three defendants were (1) [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], (2) Sean Walsh, the campaign spokesman whose application to dismiss service ultimately came before the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], and (3) [[Sheryl Main]], Mr. Schwarzenegger’s publicist.

Richardson had previously claimed that Schwarzenegger had “groped” her during a December 2000 interview in London. Although Walsh was not present for the interview in question, he categorically denied the allegations and suggested that they were little more than cheap political tricks.

Richardson claimed that this denial implied that she had “deliberately and dishonestly fabricated” the allegations. She further noted that the damage to her reputation caused by the statement was felt in the UK due to the availability of the ''[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]]'' both in print and online in the UK.

Walsh claimed Britain was an improper forum in which to litigate the case.  Walsh’s attorney, [[Richard Spearman]], described the case as follows:
{{cquote|… This case is about whether a spokesman for a foreign politician in a local election campaign who was asked by a foreign newspaper to respond on behalf of the foreign electoral candidate to allegations concerning the past conduct of that candidate, and he provided a response that is immune from suit under local law and is protected by qualified privilege under our system in circumstances where malice is not and could not reasonably be alleged, should nevertheless be amenable to the exorbitant jurisdiction of the English court ...}}

==Decision of the High Court==
Walsh’s application to set aside an order giving the claimant permission to serve her claim had previously been refused by a lower court and was the subject of the present appeal before [[David Eady|Mr. Justice Eady]] of the [[High Court of Justice]]. In upholding the lower court's original order, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] began its analysis of the issue by noting that, as a result of ''[[Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. v Gutnick]]'', it is "...well settled now that an internet publication takes place in any jurisdiction where the relevant words are read or downloaded."

Next, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] reasoned similarly to the court in ''[[Calder v. Jones]]'', 465 U.S. 783 (1984) which employs the “Effects Test” commonly used in American personal jurisdiction cases. Accordingly, the judge identified the following factors as supporting the Court’s jurisdiction:

(i) The claimant was a United Kingdom citizen.

(ii) She was both resident and worked [in the UK].

(iii) She was widely known and had an established reputation in [the UK].

(iv) She had no comparable connection with any other jurisdiction, including the United States.

(v) On the basis of the presumption of damage established in ''[[Shevill v. Presse Alliance]]'', damage to her reputation in [the UK] is presumed.

(vi) The underlying events (should there be a plea of justification) took place in London.

(vii) English law is applicable to publication in [the UK].

Unlike the ''[[Calder v. Jones]]'' test, however, the High Court did not find it necessary for Walsh to have "directly targeted" the UK, but reasoned that jurisdiction was proper because it was "arguable that the foreign politician intended or foresaw the consequences".  The suit was ultimately settled.&lt;ref name='BBC News August 26, 2006'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Schwarzenegger Libel Settled | date=August 26, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5288194.stm| work =BBC News Online | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-03 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holding==

The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] held that the correct forum is the one where it is just and reasonable for the defendant to answer for his alleged wrongdoing. The claimant was a UK citizen who lived and worked in the UK. She had an established reputation in the UK. She had no comparable connection with any other jurisdiction. Thus, damage was presumed to that reputation in the UK and the UK was the proper [[Venue (law)|venue]].

The '''right to Internet access''', also known as the '''right to broadband''' or '''freedom to connect''', is the view that all people must be able to access the [[Internet]] in order to exercise and enjoy their rights to [[Freedom of Speech|freedom of expression and opinion]] and other [[fundamental human rights]], that states have a responsibility to ensure that [[Internet access]] is broadly available, and that states may not unreasonably restrict an individual's access to the Internet.

==History==

===2003: World Summit on the Information Society===
In December 2003 the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) was convened under the auspice of the [[United Nations]]. After lengthy negotiations between governments, businesses and civil society representatives the WSIS Declaration of Principles was adopted reaffirming the importance of the Information Society to maintaining and strengthening [[human rights]]:&lt;ref name=WSIS-03&gt;[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html "Declaration of Principles"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, 12 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1. We, the representatives of the peoples of the world, assembled in Geneva from 10–12 December 2003 for the first phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, declare our common desire and commitment to build a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge, enabling individuals, communities and peoples to achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life, premised on the purposes and principles of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and respecting fully and upholding the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

...


3. We reaffirm the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the [[right to development]], as enshrined in the [[Vienna Declaration]]. We also reaffirm that [[democracy]], [[sustainable development]], and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as good governance at all levels are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. We further resolve to strengthen the rule of law in international as in national affairs.}}

The [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]] Declaration of Principles makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] in the "[[information society|Information Society]]" in stating:

{{quote|4. We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[information society|Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of opinion and expression]]; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organization. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits the Information Society offers.&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;}}

===2009–2010: BBC World Service poll===
A poll of 27,973 adults in 26 countries, including 14,306 Internet users,&lt;ref&gt;For the BBC poll Internet users are those who used the Internet within the previous six months.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted for the [[BBC World Service]] between 30 November 2009 and 7 February 2010 found that almost four in five Internet users and non-users around the world felt that access to the Internet was a fundamental right.&lt;ref name=BBCPoll-2010&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/08_03_10_BBC_internet_poll.pdf "BBC Internet Poll: Detailed Findings"], BBC World Service, 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 50% strongly agreed, 29% somewhat agreed, 9% somewhat disagreed, 6% strongly disagreed, and 6% gave no opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8548190.stm "Internet access is 'a fundamental right'"], ''BBC News'', 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011: UN Special Rapporteur report===
In May 2011, the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, [[Frank La Rue]], submitted a report to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] "exploring key trends and challenges to the right of all individuals to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds through the Internet". The report made 88 recommendations on the promotion and protection of the right to [[freedom of expression]] online, including several to secure access to the Internet for all. Other recommendations call on states to respect online anonymity, adopt privacy and data protection laws, and to decriminalize [[defamation]]. La Rue's recommendations explained that:&lt;ref name=LaRue-2011/&gt;
*67. Unlike any other medium, the Internet enables individuals to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds instantaneously and inexpensively across national borders. By vastly expanding the capacity of individuals to enjoy their right to freedom of opinion and expression, which is an "enabler" of other human rights, the Internet boosts economic, social and political development, and contributes to the progress of humankind as a whole. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages other Special Procedures mandate holders to engage on the issue of the Internet with respect to their particular mandates.
*78. While blocking and filtering measures deny users access to specific content on the Internet, States have also taken measures to cut off access to the Internet entirely. The Special Rapporteur considers cutting off users from Internet access, regardless of the justification provided, including on the grounds of violating intellectual property rights law, to be disproportionate and thus a violation of article 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
*79. The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to ensure that Internet access is maintained at all times, including during times of political unrest.
*85. Given that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human progress, ensuring universal access to the Internet should be a priority for all States. Each State should thus develop a concrete and effective policy, in consultation with individuals from all sections of society, including the private sector and relevant Government ministries, to make the Internet widely available, accessible and affordable to all segments of population.

Media coverage of the report suggested that La Rue had declared Internet access itself a [[human right]] by emphasising that "the Internet has become a key means by which individuals can exercise their right to freedom and expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://techland.time.com/2011/06/07/united-nations-report-declares-internet-access-a-human-right/ | work=TIMETechland| first=Jenny | last=Wilson | title=United Nations Report Declares Internet Access a Human Right | date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/internet-a-human-right/ | work=Wired | first=David | last=Kravets | title=U.N. Report Declares Internet Access a Human Right | date=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his report La Rue stressed that "There should be as little restriction as possible to the flow of information via the Internet, except in a few, very exceptional, and limited circumstances prescribed by international human rights law." La Rue also emphasised that "any restriction must be clearly provided by law, and proven to be necessary and the least intrusive means available for the purpose of protecting the rights of others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11108&amp;LangID=E |publisher=UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights |location=Geneva |title=Internet should remain as open as possible – UN expert on freedom of expression |date=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet Society's Global Internet User Survey===
In July and August 2012 the [[Internet Society]] conducted online interviews of more than 10,000 Internet users in 20 countries. In response to the statement "Access to the Internet should be considered a basic human right":&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/9367/20170911022514/https://www.internetsociety.org/sites/default/files/rep-GIUS2012global-201211-en.pdf "Global Internet User Survey 2012"], Internet Society, 20 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*  83% responded that they somewhat or strongly agreed
* 14% that they somewhat or strongly disagreed
* 3% didn't know.

=== 2016: UN Resolution ===
In Summer of 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Council released a [[non-binding resolution]] condemning intentional disruption of internet access by governments. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/4/12092740/un-resolution-condemns-disrupting-internet-access|title=UN condemns internet access disruption as a human rights violation|last=Vincent|first=James|date=2016-07-04|website=The Verge|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution reaffirmed that "the same rights people have offline must also be protected online".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent practice of the UN treaty-based bodies indicates growing interest in ensuring access to the Internet. In addition, Internet-related recommendations formulated under the [[Universal Periodic Review]] mechanism are as numerous as those related to the [[right to food]] and the [[Human right to water and sanitation|right to water]] – both of which are well-established human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szoszkiewicz|first=Łukasz|date=2018-09-30|title=Internet Access as a New Human Right?

==Ensuring that access is broadly available and preventing unreasonable restrictions==

Several countries have adopted laws that require the state to work to ensure that Internet access is broadly available or preventing the state from unreasonably restricting an individual's access to information and the Internet:
* [[Costa Rica]]: A 30 July 2010 ruling by the Supreme Court of Costa Rica stated: "Without fear of equivocation, it can be said that these technologies [information technology and communication] have impacted the way humans communicate, facilitating the connection between people and institutions worldwide and eliminating barriers of space and time. At this time, access to these technologies becomes a basic tool to facilitate the exercise of fundamental rights and democratic participation (e-democracy) and citizen control, education, freedom of thought and expression, access to information and public services online, the right to communicate with government electronically and administrative transparency, among others. This includes the fundamental right of access to these technologies, in particular, the right of access to the Internet or World Wide Web."&lt;ref&gt;[http://200.91.68.20/pj/scij/busqueda/jurisprudencia/jur_texto_sentencia.asp?nValor2=483874&amp;tem1=013141&amp;param7=0&amp;lResultado=3&amp;nValor1=1&amp;strTipM=T&amp;strLib=LIB "Judgement 12790 of the Supreme Court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217120514/http://200.91.68.20/pj/scij/busqueda/jurisprudencia/jur_texto_sentencia.asp?nValor2=483874&amp;tem1=013141&amp;param7=0&amp;lResultado=3&amp;nValor1=1&amp;strTipM=T&amp;strLib=LIB |date=17 December 2015 }}, File 09-013141-0007-CO, 30 July 2010.

* [[Estonia]]: In 2000, the parliament launched a massive program to expand access to the countryside. The Internet, the government argues, is essential for life in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0701/p07s01-woeu.html "Estonia, where being wired is a human right"], Colin Woodard, ''Christian Science Monitor'', 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links to other rights==

===Right to freedom of speech===

The right to Internet access is closely linked to the right of freedom of speech which can be seen to encompass freedom of expression as well. Two key facets of the Internet are highlighted by Stephanie Borg Psaila - the Internet's content and the Internet's infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;‘UN declares Stephanie Borg Psailia, "Internet access a human right’ – does it really?" [http://igbook.diplomacy.edu/2011/06/internet-access (http://igbook.diplomacy.edu/2011/06/internet-access)]&lt;/ref&gt; The infrastructure is necessary in order to deliver the service to the masses but requires extensive positive action. The content loaded onto the Internet however is seen as something that should be available to all, with few or no restrictions; limits on content have been viewed as the key breach of human rights, namely the right to freedom of speech.

The Internet's power is said to lie in its removal of a government’s control of information.&lt;ref name="egyptindependent.com"&gt;Sherif Elsayed-Ali, "Internet access is integral to human rights" [http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/601891 (http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/601891)]&lt;/ref&gt; Online on the Internet, any individuals can publish anything, which allows citizens to circumvent the government’s official information sources. This has threatened governing regimes and lead to many censoring or cutting Internet service in times of crisis.

[[China]] and [[Iran]] are currently the two world’s largest censorship users. Both nations use extensive firewall systems to block any information from the Internet which they perceive to be offensive or threatening to their regimes.&lt;ref name="thehumanrightsblog.com"&gt;Paul Scrom "SOPA &amp; PIPA: Human Rights in Intellectual Property &amp; Freedom of Speech" [http://www.thehumanrightsblog.com/?p=1202 (http://www.thehumanrightsblog.com/?p=1202)]&lt;/ref&gt; If a citizen of these nations is caught dissenting from the nation using the Internet then they may face severe penalties, even the removal of civil liberties.

In contrast to this, censorship which has been initiated by the United States is focused more on the protection of intellectual property. While the right to proportion of one’s individual ideas is recognized, there is widespread fear that wide-ranging powers awarded in anti-piracy laws will lead to the abuse of freedom of expression and censorship.&lt;ref name="thehumanrightsblog.com"/&gt;

The removal or censorship of Internet in turn could be seen as a breach of the human right of freedom of speech.

One such particular incident was in Egypt, where the government of [[Hosni Mubarak]] shut down the Internet a number of times during the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|2011 uprising]] in an attempt to suppress the protests, which happened during the [[Arab Spring]]. Even though services were only cut off for a few days, this stifled Egyptians' ability to access basic services – such as ambulances – which has been blamed by some for escalating the death toll of protesters.&lt;ref name="egyptindependent.com"/&gt;  In response to this, [[Google]] and [[Twitter]] developed a voice mail service for Egyptians to leave messages which in turn were posted onto Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;Doha Centre for Media Freedom, "Internet access - a human right?" [http://www.dc4mf.org/en/content/internet-access-human-right (http://www.dc4mf.org/en/content/internet-access-human-right)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the report to the [[OSCE]] on Internet access as a fundamental human right, Professor Yaman Akdenian states that the right to freedom of expression must be universal including the technology which will enable it. Restrictions on this right and any mediums required to fulfill it should only be permitted if they comply with international norms and are balanced again the public interest. Furthermore, the author noted that new technologies which arise in aiding the freedom of expression will require new approaches. Thus rules governing the use of non-digital media cannot be assumed to apply to digital media too. Furthermore, it was also noted in the paper presented to the OSCE that extra measures should be taken to ensure vulnerable groups such as children have access to Internet and literacy programs.&lt;ref name="http://www.osce.org/fom/80723"&gt;Yaman Akdenian "Freedom of Expression on the Internet" [http://www.osce.org/fom/80723 (http://www.osce.org/fom/80723)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to development===

The [[right to development]] is a third generation right recognized by the UN General Assembly. The Internet's role in securing this right has been noted by human rights scholars and activists in several ways.&lt;ref&gt;Molly McHugh (8 June 2011), [http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/un-declares-internet-access-a-human-right "UN declares Internet access a human right"], Digital Trends, accessed 17 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing access to technology such as mobile phones has already proven to provide developing nations with further economic development opportunities. Increasing access to the Internet can, for example, improve low income individuals' access to financial services such as savings accounts and enable online trading.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Greeley and Eric Ombok (8 September 2011), [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/in-kenya-securing-cash-on-a-cell-phone-09082011.html "In Kenya, Securing Cash on a Cell Phone"], ''Business Week'', accessed 17 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, [[Frank La Rue]], in his 2011 report to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] emphasised that "without Internet access, which facilitates economic development and the enjoyment of a range of human rights, marginalized groups and developing States remain trapped in a disadvantaged situation, thereby perpetuating inequality both within and between States".&lt;ref name=LaRue-2011&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf "VI. Conclusions and recommendations"], ''Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue'', Human Rights Council, Seventeenth session Agenda item 3, United Nations General Assembly, 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; La Rue's report led to arguments that in order to secure Internet access as a human right and to facilitate every nation's economic development, governments should act to ensure universal access, just as governments should act to ensure access to [[utilities]] such as [[drinking water|water]] and [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;Huffington Post:  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/08/internet-access-human-right-united-nations-report_n_872836.html Internet Access Is A Human Right, United Nations Report Declares], accessed 4 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The advocacy group ''[[A Human Right]]'' estimates that 4.6 billion people worldwide currently do not have Internet access and that increasing access to the Internet by just 10% can add 1.28–2.5% to the GDP of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahumanright.org/ A Human Right], accessed 17 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to freedom of assembly===

Traditionally the right to [[freedom of assembly]] covered peaceful gatherings such as protests in physical public spaces such as town squares but as technology progresses we are seeing a revolution in the way people meet and interact. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has stated, "cyber space, after all, is the public square of the 21st century".&lt;ref name="icnl.org"&gt;Douglas Rutzen and Jacob Zenn, "Association and Assembly in the Digital Age"[http://www.icnl.org/research/journal/vol13iss4/art_1.htm (http://www.icnl.org/research/journal/vol13iss4/art_1.htm)]&lt;/ref&gt; Today we are seeing an increase in the relevance of internet and the right to freedom of assembly. Even signing an online petition has been known to cause arrests and the internet has become a useful tool in the organization of protest movements and demonstrations.&lt;ref name="icnl.org"/&gt;

It is widely recognized that without the contribution of the Internet and social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook recent political events such as the Arab Spring could not have occurred, or at least not to the same extent.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Vinton Cerf, "Internet Access Is Not a Human Right" [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/opinion/internet-access-is-not-a-human-right.html (https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/opinion/internet-access-is-not-a-human-right.html)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jillian York, "Middle East memes: a guide" [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/20/middle-east-memes-guide?INTCMP=SRCH (http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/20/middle-east-memes-guide?INTCMP=SRCH)]&lt;/ref&gt; The role these mediums had were to allow the communication and mass dispatch of protests and other movements.

Internet access was also pivotal in the [[Occupy movement]]. A collective of journalists involved in the movement stated in regards to access to internet, "[a]ccess to open communications platforms is critical for the human species evolution and survival".&lt;ref&gt;Communition is your right,"What Does Occupy Wall Street Have To Do With Internet Freedom and Media Reform? Everything!"[http://www.communicationisyourright.org/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-internet-freedom-media-reform/ (http://www.communicationisyourright.org/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-internet-freedom-media-reform/)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications and complications==

===Implementation===

Implementing the right to Internet access can be accomplished by requiring that [[universal service]] providers provide a mandatory minimum connection capability to all desiring home users in the regions of a country they serve.

Much of the [[Spanish-speaking countries|Spanish speaking world]] has celebrated Internet Day since 2005, including many initiatives of increasing network access. [[Panama]] has 214 "infoplazas"&lt;ref&gt;[http://itidjournal.org/itid/article/viewArticle/196 ITID Journal] Measuring the Contribution of Internet Plazas&lt;/ref&gt; which are places of free Internet access. (from Hoy (from Ecuador) on May 17, 2011, called "Derechos Humanos y accesso de la red central celebracion del Dia de Internet".)

===Critiques of the human right to Internet access===

High-profile criticism of the notion that access to the Internet should be considered a human right comes from [[Vint Cerf]] who is often dubbed the "father of the Internet". Cerf claims that internet access cannot be a right in itself. Cerf sums up his argument when he states "Technology is an enabler of rights, not a right itself." This has been seen as a narrow interpretation by some human rights commentators including [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Edwards, "Is Internet Access A Human Right?" [http://blog.amnestyusa.org/business/is-internet-access-a-human-right/ (http://blog.amnestyusa.org/business/is-internet-access-a-human-right/)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cerf concedes the Internet plays an important role in civil participation which leads him to conclude that Internet access should be a civil right, but he does not agree with it being afforded the higher status of a human right.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

This article has sparked much debate online about the scope of human rights and whether Internet access should be afforded that status.

Many have pointed to weaknesses in Cerf's argument. Cerf notes that the positive act of providing Internet access would be too onerous on governments and in any case governments do not have a duty to provide all their citizens with access to other forms of communication such as telephones. Egyptian human rights activist Sherif Elsayed-Ali argues that the notion of rights have the ability to change as social contexts change. He claims that one must look at right in the context complete denial to the world population of that right would lead to a detriment in the quality of life. Elsayed-Ali claims without the Internet we would be taking a step back in our development with news and innovation in crucial sectors such as health and technology would take much longer to spread across the globe.&lt;ref name="egyptindependent.com"/&gt;

There has also been criticism of Cerf's framing of the Internet as something less important than the right to "freedom from torture or freedom of conscience", as it might be better compared to other basic human rights like those found in Article 25 of the UDHR, notably "the right to a standard of living … including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a25&lt;/ref&gt; [[A Human Right]], a non-profit organization, also took issue with Cerf's belief that placing technology in the pantheon of human rights is a mistake because "we will end up valuing the wrong things". They argue that "The potpourri of protocols, wires, and bits that make the Internet are no more special than the hammer and nails used to build a home, and to classify either as a human right would be a sincere mistake. But just as a home is much more than the sum of its parts, so is the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahumanright.org/blog/2012/01/vint-cerf-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2/|title=A Human Right: Everyone Connected|first=A Human|last=Right|website=A Human Right}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Schepis, a colleague of Cerf at Google, defends Cerf's conclusion on the grounds that advocates for a human right to the Internet improperly define the qualifications of a human right. Schepis argues that human rights should only protect things that are instrumentally necessary for membership in a political community and, although the Internet is instrumentally valuable for membership, it should not be seen as a human right in and of itself because it is not necessary for membership. In claiming a human right to the Internet, advocates devalue the overall effectiveness of human rights as tools of justification in global political arena through a process called "human rights inflation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jpl/article/view/22541/14534 "Is There a Human Right to the Internet?"], Brian Skepys, ''Journal of Politics and Law'', Vol. 5, No. 4 (November 2012), pages 15-29, Canadian Center of Science and Education, ISSN 1913-9047, doi: 10.5539/jpl.v5n4p15. Retrieved 26 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that it is ridiculous to consider internet access a human right, as that would mean that all human beings up until the invention of the internet were deprived of a basic human right, which would be an impossibility if it is a natural, inalienable right.

Others point to the fact that it is not the Internet itself which is the right but rather the access to the Internet which should be an enshrined right. The European Union's European Commission Vice President Viviance Reding stated that "The rules therefore provide that any measures taken '''regarding access to''' or use of, services and applications must respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, including the right to privacy, freedom of expression and access to information and education as well as due process." ''(Emphasis added)''&lt;ref&gt;Don Reisinger, "Vint Cerf: Internet access isn't a human right" [http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-57352967-17/vint-cerf-internet-access-isnt-a-human-right/ (http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-57352967-17/vint-cerf-internet-access-isnt-a-human-right/)]&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of this right through censorship or the denial of service could amount in a breach to several human rights which are fulfilled through online participation.

La Rue thus emphasizes "Each state should thus develop a concrete and effective policy to make the Internet widely available, accessible, and affordable to all segments of population."

===Three strikes===
{{main|Graduated response}}

In response to copyright infringement using [[peer-to-peer]] software, the [[creative industries]], reliant on copyright, advocate what is known as a "graduated response" which sees consumers disconnected after a number of notification letters warning that they are infringing copyright. The content industry has sought to gain the co-operation of [[Internet service providers]] (ISPs), asking them to provide subscriber information for [[IP addresses]] identified by the content industry as engaged in copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="Klosek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=67534|title=United States: Combating Piracy And protecting privacy: A European Perspective |last=Klosek  |first=Jacqueline |date=9 October 2008 |publisher= Mondaq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal for [[Internet service providers]] to cut off Internet access to a subscriber who had received three warning letters of alleged copyright infringement was initially known as "three strikes", based on the baseball rule of "[[English language idioms derived from baseball|three strikes and you're out]]". The approach was later termed "graduated response". Media attention has focused on attempts to implement such an approach in France (see the [[HADOPI law]])&lt;ref name="cjicl.com"&gt;N. Lucchi, [http://www.cjicl.com/uploads/2/9/5/9/2959791/cjicl_19.3_lucchi_article.pdf "Access to Network Services and Protection of Constitutional Rights: Recognizing the Essential Role of Internet Access for the Freedom of Expression"], Cardozo Journal of International and Comparative Law (JICL), Vol. 19, No. 3, 2011. Available at http://www.cjicl.com/uploads/2/9/5/9/2959791/cjicl_19.3_lucchi_article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK (see the [[Digital Economy Act 2010]]), though the approach, or variations of it, has been implemented in a number of other countries, or attempts are made to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Anderson| first = Nate| title = IFPI: "Three strikes" efforts hit worldwide home run| publisher = Ars Technica| date = 19 August 2008| url = https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2008/08/ifpi-three-strikes-efforts-hit-worldwide-home-run.ars| accessdate = 26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future regulation of the Internet===

The Internet as a whole is seen as a medium which is outside of any one state's jurisdiction, while portions of the Internet are subject to laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate.&lt;ref&gt;"Balancing Internet regulation and human rights" [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990182 (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990182)]&lt;/ref&gt; Going forward, international dialogue has begun on how the Internet should be regulated.

Human rights activists are lobbying for any regulation on the Internet to be in the form of protections of rights rather than in limiting access to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrit Eicker, "Internet Access: a Human Right?" [http://wir-sprechen-online.com/2012/01/06/internet-access-a-human-right/ (http://wir-sprechen-online.com/2012/01/06/internet-access-a-human-right/)]&lt;/ref&gt; Any attempt to regulate "harmful" or illegal activities online can face difficulties as states differ in their definitions of both.&lt;ref name="http://www.osce.org/fom/80723"/&gt;.

===Breadth of ensured provision===
{{see also|Universal service|National broadband plans from around the world}}
The type and breadth of access which is ensured by an enshrined right can also widely vary, with governments which have pursued an enshrinement of a right to broadband often setting seemingly-adequate minimum targets of speed, number of home connections, type of provision, etc.

The '''"Slave Reparations Act"''' (also called the '''Slavery Reparation Tax Credit''', '''Black Tax Credit''' or '''Black Inheritance Tax Refund''') is a [[tax fraud]] related to the concept of [[reparations for slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/ir-02-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The scam claims that filers can receive $5,000 or increased social security payouts for [[African-Americans]] born in the United States between 1911 and 1926.

It claims that African-Americans are entitled to a $5,000 slavery reparation tax credit. Below is a sample solicitation:

{| style="border-style:solid;border-width:2px;border-color:blue" width=80%
|-
|
:BORN PRIOR TO THE YEAR OF 1928 AND OF THE BLACK ETHNIC RACE?

:DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WAS BORN UP UNTIL 1927? DID YOU KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS REFUNDING MONIES TO ANYONE ALIVE THAT WAS BORN UP UNTIL THE YEAR OF 1927 DUE TO THE SLAVE REPARATION ACT? FOR INFORMATION CONTACT:

:
::(Scammer's name and address [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]])
:

:PROVIDE THEM WITH THE FOLLOWING INFO AND AN APPLICATION WILL BE MAILED TO YOU FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A $5000.00 CHECK WHICH CAN BE EITHER ATTACHED TO YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK OR ISSUED IN ONE LUMP SUM:

:NAME
:ADDRESS
:PHONE#
:SOCIAL SECURITY
:DATE OF BIRTH


|}

The goal of the scam is to get the victim to send all of their information to the scammer.  By doing this, the scammer will gain the ability to commit [[identity theft]] on the victim.

This scam may have resulted from unpassed congressional legislation in 1999 to explore slave reparations. The bill, H.R. 40, would have created a commission to study the possibility of actual reparations to slave families.

Another payout quotes $43,209 as the estimated value of "[[40 acres and a mule]]," supposedly laid out in an 1866 bill that was passed by Congress but was vetoed by President [[Andrew Johnson]]. No such bill was entered into Congress in 1866. It is based on an actual order by [[Union Army|Union]] General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15|Special Field Order No. 15]], that set aside land from [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to [[Jacksonville, Florida]] for the exclusive use of freed slaves. Each family would receive {{convert|40|acre|m2}} from this holding. Sherman may have acted on his own authority. No record exists of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] or the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] authorizing this action.

The [[Freedmen's Bureau]] controlled over {{convert|850,000|acre|km2}} of confiscated land in 1865, and many of its officials intended to settle blacks on it. As President Johnson began to restore property to former Confederates, commissioner [[Oliver Otis Howard]] issued Circular 13. The document, put out in July, ordered rapid establishment of forty-acre plots in violation of presidential pardons.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Eric (1988). ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877''. [[Harper &amp; Row]]. pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Sherman's precedent and Howard's instructions, the White House issued Howard's Circular 15 in September 1865 ordering restoration of land to pardoned owners and taking them back from freed slaves who had received them under Special Field Order No. 15.

The [[Southern Homestead Act of 1866]] did make public land in some states available to freed slaves. Most of this land was swampy or distant from travel routes or was claimed by lumber companies.

In April 2002, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) received more than 100,000 attempts to claim reparation tax credits and paid out more than $30 million in erroneous refunds. The IRS continued to report false tax credit scams and claims in 2003 and 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8360">'''Special Field Orders No. 64''' (series 1864) were military orders issued during the [[American Civil War]], on September 4, 1864, by General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], commander of the [[Military Division of the Mississippi]] of the United States Army, and was issued during the [[Atlanta Campaign]] after learning that the Confederate forces commanded by Lieut. Gen. [[John Bell Hood|John B. Hood]] had evacuated [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] on Sept. 1, 1864.&lt;ref name=Garrett637&gt;Garrett, ''Atlanta and Environs'', p 637-638&lt;/ref&gt;

This order signaled the end of the [[Atlanta Campaign]] that began with the [[Battle of Rocky Face Ridge]] fought May 7–13, 1864, north of [[Dalton, Georgia]]. This order detailed the occupation of [[Atlanta]] and the country near the city. The [[Army of the Cumberland]] was to occupy Atlanta. The [[Army of the Tennessee]] was to occupy [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]] and the head of Camp Creek. The [[Army of the Ohio]] was to occupy [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]].&lt;ref name=OR&gt;[http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moawar&amp;cc=moawar&amp;idno=waro0076&amp;node=waro0076%3A4&amp;view=image&amp;seq=803&amp;size=100 O.R.

Series 1 - Volume 38 (Part V) pp 837-838&lt;/ref&gt; Thus began the occupation of Atlanta. During their stay in Atlanta, the troops would build their own quarters, evacuate most of the civilian population, rest, replace worn out equipment, reorganize, and make preparations for their next campaign. When Sherman’s troops began their [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] on November 15, all assets of military value in Atlanta would be destroyed.&lt;ref name=Garrett637&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{voting}}

'''Straight-ticket voting''' or '''straight-party voting''' is the practice of [[voting]] for every candidate that a [[political party]] has on a general election [[ballot]].  In general, straight-ticket voting was a very common occurrence until around the 1960s and 1970s.  Since that time, straight-ticket voting has declined in the United States among the general voting population; however, strong partisans (that is, strong party identifiers) have remained straight-ticket voters.&lt;ref&gt;Hershey, Marjorie Randon. Party Politics in America 12th ed. 2007: Longman Classics in Political Science. Pages 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the parties, it was nearly impossible not to vote on a straight-party line vote. Voters would receive a colored ballot with that party's nominees on it.  A split-ticket vote would require two different colored ballots, which confused the voter.{{fact|date=August 2018}}  Often, the voter would choose a specific party, and vote for everyone from that party. Some states have had an option (sometimes known as a '''master lever''')&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/01/10/governor-backs-elimination-master-lever/x68o68mDu9AD1LOTJN5OlO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; to select "vote straight-ticket Democrat" and "vote straight-ticket Republican" that voters can check instead of voting for each race; states that do so include [[Alabama]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]]. West Virginia, Michigan, and Iowa abolished this practice in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, though Michigan's repeal was blocked by a federal judge due to discrimination issues in 2016 but was reinstated by the 6th Circuit Court and Supreme Court in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/07/21/federal-judge-blocks-michigan-ban-straight-party-voting/87392104/ Federal judge blocks Michigan ban on straight-party voting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/09/07/supreme-court-michigan-straight-ticket/1220941002/ Supreme Court keeps ban on Michigan straight-ticket voting]&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan voted to restore straight-ticket voting through a ballot proposal in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/michigan-voting-proposal-3-results/1885266002/&lt;/ref&gt; Texas's straight-ticket repeal will be effective in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/01/texas-gov-greg-abbott-signs-bill-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting/ Gov. Abbott signs bill to eliminate straight-ticket voting beginning in 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Straight-ticket voting in individual states ==

The straight-ticket voting option differs slightly from state to state.

=== Michigan ===

General-election ballots in Michigan have three sections:

* The partisan section, which includes candidates for partisan offices;
* The non-partisan section, which includes candidates for judgeships, most municipal offices, and school boards; and
* The proposals section, which includes state and local ballot issues.

Voters in Michigan had long been able to vote a straight ticket or a split ticket (voting for individual candidates in individual offices).

Straight-ticket voting only involved the partisan section of the ballot, meaning that if an individual wished to vote in a non-partisan race or for or against a proposal, they had to cast those votes individually. One area in which this issue received attention was in races for the [[Michigan Supreme Court]]. All parties on the ballot can nominate candidates for Justice of the Supreme Court at their party conventions (2–3 months before the election for primary-eligible parties, or before the August primary for alternative parties which nominate only at conventions or county caucuses).  However, the races appear on the ballot in the nonpartisan section, meaning that a straight-ticket vote for either of these parties would not include a vote for that party's candidates for Supreme Court.

The [[Michigan Legislature]] passed and Governor [[Rick Snyder]] signed SB 13 on January 5, 2015, which repeals and abolishes straight-ticket voting in the state. This follows failed attempts to abolish it in 1964 and 2001-2002 after voter referenda repealing abolition. With a $5 million appropriation in SB 13, however, a voter referendum is no longer possible due to a constitutional prohibition on referenda on bills appropriating moneys by the Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/05/snyder-signs-bill-eliminating-straight-ticket-voting/78302866/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2016/01/gov_rick_snyder_signs_bill_eli.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Michigan voters passed a ballot proposal that restored straight-ticket voting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/06/michigan-voting-proposal-3-results/1885266002/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Carolina ===

North Carolina had an option for voting "straight party" (using the term from an NC ballot) that did not include a vote for the President and Vice President of the United States, through the 2012 elections. A [[voter ID]] law enacted in 2013 abolished all straight-ticket voting in the state, and went into effect in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governor.state.nc.us/newsroom/press-releases/20130812/governor-mccrory-signs-popular-voter-id-law Governor McCrory Signs Popular Voter ID into Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v8.pdf NC General Assembly: SESSION LAW 2013-381]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill eliminating it was HB 589.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the former system, North Carolina made separate selections for the President/Vice President and the straight-party option.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://www.app.sboe.state.nc.us/enrs/samples/DURHAM/8GDURH03.pdf sample ballot from Precinct 3, Durham, North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt; This idiosyncrasy on the North Carolina ballot was described by some as "a ballot flaw,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norden |first1=Lawrence |last2=Chen |first2=Margaret |title=How Bad is North Carolina’s Ballot Flaw? The Numbers Say, Pretty Bad. |date=October 21, 2008 |url=http://www.brennancenter.org/blog/archives/how_bad_is_north_carolinas_ballot_flaw_the_numbers_say_pretty_bad/ |publisher=brennancenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially resulting in voters failing to cast a vote for President and Vice President when doing so was their intent. It was introduced in the 1960s to shore up Democrats at the state level as Republicans were gaining strength at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This Year's Butterfly Ballot |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/opinion/27mon2.html?ref=opinion |newspaper=Nytimes.com |date=October 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 presidential election, there was a 3.15% "undervote" (i.e. (total voter turnout - total votes for President and Vice President) / total voter turnout); in the 2004 presidential election, there was a 2.57% undervote. This means that in raw numbers, more than 92,000 North Carolina voters in the 2000 election turned out to vote but did not vote for president; similarly, in 2004, more than 75,000 North Carolina voters turned out to vote but not vote for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The Institute for Southern Studies |title=Voting Rights Watch: Could confusing ballots swing the presidential election in NC? |date=October 20, 2008|url= http://southernstudies.org/facingsouth/2008/10/voting-rights-watch-could-confusing.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Texas ===
[[File:Straight Party voting on Harris County, Texas ballot in 2008 (299101265).jpg|thumb|Straight-party option on Texas ballot in the 2008 general election]]
In Texas, a vote for a straight-party ticket casts votes for all party candidates in all races where the party is fielding a candidate and the voter is eligible to cast a vote, from the President/Vice President (or Governor) to the county constable or justice of the peace. On June 1, 2017, Governor [[Greg Abbott]] signed into law House Bill 25, which eliminates the straight-ticket voting option in Texas for all races beginning in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCullough|first1=Jolie|title=Gov. Abbott signs bill to eliminate straight-ticket voting beginning in 2020|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/01/texas-gov-greg-abbott-signs-bill-eliminate-straight-ticket-voting/|website=TexasTribune.org|publisher=Texas Tribune, Inc.|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter, however, may vote a straight-party ticket and subsequently cast an individual vote in a particular race.  This may happen in cases where
#the voter's party did not field a candidate in a specific race, and the voter wants to cast a vote in that race for one of the candidates from another party, and/or
#the voter does not wish to support the party's candidate in a specific race, but wishes to vote for another candidate in that race.  (However, Texas does not have a "none of the above" option; in a case where a voter wishes not to vote for any candidate in a race where his/her party is fielding one, the voter must cast a vote in each individual race separately and cannot choose the straight-party option.)  An individual vote will override the straight-party vote, but only in those specific races where an individual vote is cast.

Straight-party voting is only available in the general election for partisan elections.  It is not available for:
*party primary elections
*non-partisan races (such as City Council or School Board elections); even if a slate of candidates is endorsed by a particular group the slate cannot be elected on a single ticket, each candidate must be selected individually.
*ballot issues (such as an amendment to the [[Texas Constitution]] or a measure to approve bonds and assess taxes for their repayment), even if a political party officially endorses or opposes such an amendment.

In those cases where a partisan election is combined with a non-partisan election and/or ballot issues, the voter can vote straight-party in the partisan portion, but then must vote individually in the other portion(s).&lt;ref&gt;Texas Election Code, Section 52.071&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West Virginia ===

In West Virginia, voting "straight party" included a vote for all candidates of the party voters selected, including the President and Vice President of the United States. Non-partisan candidates had to be voted separately. In 2015, however, straight-ticket voting was eliminated as an option on ballots through an Act of the State Legislature signed by Governor [[Earl Ray Tomblin]], SB 249.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/straight-ticket-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
The [[Seneca Nation of Indians]], which operates under a republican form of government on reservations within the bounds of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], offers a straight-ticket voting option. To qualify, a political party must field candidates in each seat up for election in a given year. In practice, only the Seneca Party, which has been the [[dominant-party system|dominant party]] in the nation's politics for decades, has ever received the straight-ticket option. Opponents of the Seneca Party have accused the party of using the straight-ticket option to eavesdrop on voters and punish them with the loss of their jobs if they do not use it, also using the promise of jobs to those running in opposing parties to get them to drop out and deny those parties the straight-ticket option.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Rick (October 26, 2016). [http://www.salamancapress.com/news/j-c-seneca-seeks-seneca-nation-presidency-again/article_7a699e4c-9a2c-11e6-a6d8-6bb82d32b950.html J.C. Seneca seeks Seneca Nation presidency again].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6603">'''SurfWatch, Inc.''' was a Los Altos, CA-based company which pioneered the first software that allowed users to block explicit content on the Internet.  By disallowing computers from accessing specified sites and by screening for newsgroups likely to contain [[Internet pornography|sexually explicit]] material, SurfWatch was able to aid parents, educators and employers in preventing  access to offensive material from a specific computer. The Apple Macintosh version of SurfWatch 1.0 first shipped in May 1995 and was followed by the Microsoft version in July of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Surfwatch company fact sheet, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its specific locus of control, SurfWatch and various similar software programs played an instrumental role in 
helping to overturn the [[Communications Decency Act]], as they offered an alternative to [[internet censorship]]. Because 
Surfwatch gave users a choice as to what should be blocked, it offered an alternative to broad censorship of online 
material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/evidence-testimony/7238802-1.html “SurfWatch plays crucial role in overturning communications decency act”], June 12, 1996, accessed January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Surfwatch has been criticized by 
[[Peacefire]] for unfairly blocking gay and lesbian resource sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peacefire.org/censorware/SurfWatch/ “Surfwatch examined”], accessed January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founders==

Surfwatch was founded by Ann Duvall, Bill Duvall, and Jay Friedland.  

Ann Duvall, President of SurfWatch software had performed a wide variety of roles in high-tech prior to her involvement 
with SurfWatch. 

Bill Duvall, CEO of Surfwatch, had been previously involved in founding and developing technology companies for 30 years. 
In the course of his work, he gained the distinction of writing the software which sent the first package across the 
Internet in 1969. He coauthored [[Request for Comments|RFC]]’s 1, 2 and 3.  Bill is featured in a video on the 40th anniversary of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/highlights/10291969 Computer History Museum: Happy 40th Birthday to a Radical Idea!]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since their work on SurfWatch, Bill Duvall and Ann Duvall have gone on to create [[red states and blue states|“ChoosetheBlue.com,”]] a website that provided information as to which companies had employees that primarily supported democratic candidates 
and which companies had employees who primarily supported republican candidates. The site was intended to encourage 
consumers to spend money in places that would support democratic causes.&lt;ref&gt;Skalka, Jennifer.[http://www.eszter.com/press/ChicagoTribune-14Dec04.pdf “Blue voters now urged to buy blue”], “Chicago tribune”,December 14, 2004, accessed January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Friedland, who acted as Vice President of Marketing and Sales had 15 years of experience in high-tech management at the time of SurfWatch’s creation. He has since gone on to assist Internet start-up companies in establishing new business models for commerce on the net. Currently, he works as Vice President of Strategy and Sustainability for Zero Motorcycles and as Legislative Director for [[Plug In America]].

==Software in Court==

In 1995, the U.S. Senate set out to ban Internet users from posting illicit content. In the measure, the Senate endorsed “severe penalties” for those who posted “everything from child pornography to profanity.” Despite the seeming impossibility of accurate enforcement, the measure outraged many American citizens. Those who opposed the measure believed that censorship of the Internet was an infringement on their right to free speech. Opponents of the Congressional legislation believed that technology that blocks access is preferable to an outright ban.&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, John. [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/24/business/internet-software-developer-in-an-acquisition.html “Internet software developer in acquisition”], “The New York Times”, April 24, 1996, accessed January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the legislation, SurfWatch was one of the only companies offering an Internet filter. A majority of the technology industry believed the best way to shield children from inappropriate content was, as journalist Steve Lohr put it, “with specialized software, enabling parents to block access to certain computer-network traffic.”&lt;ref&gt;Lohr, Steve. [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/business/senate-bill-escalates-computer-smut-debate.html?pagewanted=2 “Senate bill escalates computer smut debate”], “The New York Times”, June 16, 1995, accessed January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as an alternative to complete Internet censorship, software such as SurfWatch played a key role in the overturning of the 1996 [[Communications Decency Act]], for it provided Internet users to limit access controlled audiences, rather than limiting the whole of Internet content to all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10225">[[Chicken]]-beheading rituals are a quasi-judicial [[ritual]] in [[Taiwanese culture]] that have acted as a dispute resolution mechanism for complicated and emotionally charged disputes that have not been settled in traditional courts or through private mediation. Chicken-beheading rituals have come to be associated with personal honesty in Taiwanese society and become more of a symbol of integrity than an actuality in contemporary [[Taiwan]].

== History ==
Chicken-beheading rituals have historical roots in the legal traditions of China’s [[Fujian Province]], where over 70% of Taiwanese citizens can trace their lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ma|Cartier|2003|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In feudal Fujianese society, individuals who were suspected of theft were taken before images of [[judge]]s and forced to proclaim an oath of innocence.&lt;ref name="Jordan_44"&gt;{{harvp|Jordan|Morris|Moskowitz|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Someone hiding behind the judge image would then point at the defendant who would supposedly break down and confess if they were guilty.&lt;ref name="Jordan_44"/&gt;

[[Legal trials]] were also often conducted in the presence of images of deities as a way of forcing individuals to be honest. Temple managers even sometimes acted as judges themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jordan|Morris|Moskowitz|2004|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Fujianese trials have been embedded into Taiwanese culture and many other aspects of Fujianese tradition have also been transferred into Taiwanese chicken-beheading rituals, notably the use of oaths of innocence (赌咒, duzhou “oath－making”- literally meaning to gamble on an oath) and use of local deities to encourage people to fear breaking their oaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Katz|2009|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader sense, the history of chicken-beheading rituals represents the important role that religion plays in Taiwanese society; Taiwanese citizens turn to their local city deity to arbitrate when the [[History of law in Taiwan|Taiwanese legal system]] is insufficient.

The exact dates of the first instances of chicken-beheading rituals in Taiwan are unknown, yet the rituals were frequently practiced throughout the 19th Century and were still common during the [[Japanese rule of Taiwan]] in the first half of the 20th Century. However, the rate of chicken-beheading rituals declined as Taiwan rapidly modernised in the later half of the 20th Century.

== Ritual==
When [[mediation|private mediation]] has not worked and the Taiwanese legal system has been bypassed or failed to resolve a complicated dispute, chicken-beheading rituals have been used as a [[dispute mechanism|dispute resolution mechanism]].

The actual chicken-beheading ritual involves two individuals at odds with one another over a dispute that may be personal or legal in nature. Both bring a chicken to their local [[temple]] which is often the temple of their [[City God|local city god]]; the individuals then proclaims an oath of innocence while standing before their [[god]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Katz|2009|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An oath of innocence normally involves a brief description of where somebody lives, their age, a description of their version of the contested events and a statement proclaiming one’s innocence and remonstrating that they are an honourable person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Overmyer|2003|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the person will make a contingent curse upon themselves, promising that some kind of grave misfortune will happen to them or their families if they lied in their oath.&lt;ref name="Katz_74"&gt;{{harvp|Katz|2009|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicken-beheading rituals can have a wide variety of ramifications, but generally help resolve the complicated disputes in question.

== Examples ==

Japanese legal academic [[Masuda Fukutaro]] recorded an example of successful dispute resolution through the ritual in Dongshan township, pre-World War Two, Taiwan, during Japanese rule.&lt;ref name="Jordan_38_39"&gt;{{harvp|Jordan|Morris|Moskowitz|2004|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual, Wang Buren, borrowed 50 yuan from his friend, Chen Youyi, but did not return the money to Chen’s [[widow]] after Chen died. Instead he asserted that he had already paid it. Chen’s widow was told by the local court that as her husband had not kept a receipt of the loan, she could not bring the matter to court. She was distraught and so forced Wang to conduct a chicken-beheading ritual with her at the temple of the city god in Dongshan to determine who was telling the [[truth]].&lt;ref name="Jordan_38_39"/&gt; Twenty days after proclaiming his oath of innocence, Wang was seen babbling and maniacally running through the streets, saying that he would be happy to give 100 yen to Chen’s widow to resolve the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jordan|Morris|Moskowitz|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the chicken-beheading ritual successfully forced the [[Culpability|guilty party]] to admit his wrongdoing and thereby resolved the issue.

In another example, a wealthy man’s home was [[robbed]], and he blamed his assistant, who denied all knowledge of the [[crime]]. The assistant brought a [[Rooster|white cockerel]] to the local city god in order to prove his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Katz|2009|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ritual, he made it clear that he would be willing to suffer death if he was indeed guilty. Consequently, the real culprit feared so much for his life that he returned what he had stolen.

In both cases, the chicken-beheading ritual forced the guilty parties to confess and thus assisted in successfully resolving disputes.

== Symbolism ==
Taiwanese chicken-beheading rituals have often led to the resolution of disputes because of what they symbolise.

Taiwanese chicken-beheading rituals are deeply laden with [[symbol]]ism. The chicken is considered a representation of the human that is [[beheading]] it. The implication of beheading the chicken is that the human would be willing to die or lose their integrity if their oath of innocence was false. In such a god fearing society, as [[Religion in Taiwan|Taiwan traditionally has been]], the gravitas involved in symbolically [[killing yourself]] after proclaiming your honesty and innocence has a profound power in the cultural imagination of society.

The reasons for using chickens, as opposed to other animals, in this ritual are both symbolic and practical. Chickens symbolise the [[sun]] (陽) and positive forces of life and vitality in Chinese and Taiwanese culture. However, it is commonly understood that the main reason chickens were used is that chickens remained extremely cheap and plentiful in both [[Southern China]] and Taiwan. As such, ordinary people could not only easily decapitate a chicken without much hassle but also conveniently buy one from their local [[butcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|De Groot|1964|pp=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Due to their bloody nature, chicken-beheading rituals are rarely performed in modern Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Katz_74"/&gt;

However, many [[politicians]] make oaths of innocence in local temples to boost their chances of getting elected. In spring 2001 the Taiwanese politician, Yan Qingbiao was accused of [[extortion]] and [[attempted murder]]. He made an oath proclaiming that he was a man of integrity and innocent of any wrongdoing in one of Taiwan’s most renowned temples, the Zhenlan Gong.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Overmyer|2003|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; This asservation served to bolster his [[political capital]] as the dramatic display made his [[constituent (politics)|constituent]]s believe that he was indeed an honest and good man.

Chicken-beheading rituals are occasionally referred to metaphorically in modern [[Politics of the Republic of China|Taiwanese politics]]. When James Soong, was accused of embezzling funds from his own [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang (KMT) Party]], he was depicted performing a chicken-beheading ritual to prove his innocence in a cartoon by the ''[[Liberty Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Overmyer|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cartoon vehemently ridiculed Soong because he was a member of the [[Westernisation|Westernised]] elite and would not engage in such a traditional ritual. The cartoon also demonstrated how the image of a chicken being beheaded still resounded in the minds of the Taiwanese people.

In this way chicken-beheading rituals are used in an allegorical sense in modern Taiwan, mostly in the political sphere, and few chickens are actually beheaded. The honour and sincerity that has been historically attached to chicken-beheading rituals remains a potent force in Taiwanese society.

As of 1996, when it was formed, the original judges on the Court were Chief Judge [[Earl H. Carroll]] (D. Ariz.), and Judges [[Michael Anthony Telesca]] (W.D. N.Y.), [[David Dudley Dowd, Jr.]] (N.D. Ohio), [[William Clark O'Kelley]] (N.D. Ga.) and [[Alfred M. Wolin]] (D. N.J.).&lt;ref name="initial-members"/&gt;

According to Karen Redmond, a public information officer in the Administrative Offices of the U.S. Courts, as of October 15, 2016 the current members of the Court are: [[Rosemary M. Collyer]] (D. D.C.), Chief Judge; [[Harold Albert Baker]] (C.D. Ill.); [[James Parker Jones]] (W.D. Va.); [[William C. O'Kelley]] (N.D. Ga.); and [[Thomas B. Russell]] (W.D. Ky.).

The Court is modeled after the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], and was created by {{USPL|104|132}}, the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], codified at {{USC|8|1531|1537}}.

As of 2018, the Court has never received an application from the Attorney General for the removal of an alien terrorist, and had therefore conducted no proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

The '''Vienna Convention on Consular Relations''' of 1963 is an international [[treaty]] that defines a framework for [[consulate|consular]] [[International relations|relations]] between independent states. A consul normally operates out of an embassy in another country, and performs two functions: (1) protecting in the host country the interests of their countrymen, and (2) furthering the commercial and economic relations between the two states.

The treaty provides for [[consular immunity]].&lt;ref name="Boczek"&gt;Boleslaw Adam Boczek, ''International Law: A Dictionary'' (Scarecrow Press, 2014), pp. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty has been ratified by 179 states.&lt;ref name="unparticipants"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=III-6&amp;chapter=3&amp;clang=_en|title=Vienna Convention on Consular Relations|publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Convention was adopted at [[Vienna]] on April 24, 1963, the United Nations Conference on Consular Relations, which took place at the [[Hofburg|Neue Hofburg]] from March 4 to April 22, 1963. Its official texts are in the English, French, Chinese, Russian and Spanish languages, which the Convention provides are [[Equal authenticity rule|equally authentic]].&lt;ref name="untreaty"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20596/volume-596-I-8638-English.pdf|title=Vienna Convention on Consular Relations|publisher=[[United Nations Treaty Series]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key provisions==
The treaty contains 79 articles.&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt; The preamble to the Convention states that customary international law continues to apply to matters not addressed in the Convention.&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boczek"/&gt; Some significant provisions include.&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;
 
* Article 5 lists thirteen functions of a consul, including "protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, both individuals and [[bodies corporate]], within the limits permitted by international law" and "furthering the development of commercial, economic, cultural and scientific relations between the sending State and the receiving State."&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;
* Article 23 provides that the host nation may at any time and for any reason declare a particular member of the consular staff to be [[persona non grata]], and the sending state must recall this person within a reasonable period of time, or otherwise this person may lose their consular immunity.&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;
* Article 31 provides that the consular premises are [[inviolability|inviolabile]] (i.e., the host nation may not enter the consular premises, and must protect the premises from intrusion or damage).&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;
* Article 35 provides that freedom of communication between the consul and their home country must be preserved, that [[Diplomatic bag|consular bags]] "shall be neither opened nor detained"; and that a consular courier must never be detained.&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;
* Article 37 provides that with the host country must "without delay" notify consular officers of the sending state if one of the sending state's nationals dies or has  a guardian or trustee appointed over him. The article also provides that consular officers must be informed "without delay" if a vessel with the sending state's nationality is [[Shipwreck|wrecked]] or [[runs aground]] "in the [[territorial sea]] or [[internal waters]] of the receiving State, or if an [[Aircraft registration|aircraft registered]] in the sending State suffers an accident on the territory of the receiving State."&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;
* Article 36 addresses communications between consular officers and nationals of the sending state. The Convention provides that "consular officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of the sending State and to have access to them." Foreign nationals who are arrested or detained be given notice "without delay" of their right to have their embassy or consulate notified of that arrest, and "consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the sending State who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation."&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;
* Article 40 provides that "The receiving State shall treat consular officers with due respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity."&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;
* Articles 58-68 deal with [[honorary consul]]ar officers and their powers and functions.&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;

===Consular immunity===
The Convention (Article 43)&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt; provides for [[consular immunity]]. Some but not all provisions in the Convention regarding this immunity reflect [[customary international law]].&lt;ref name="Boczek"/&gt; Consular immunity is a lesser form of [[diplomatic immunity]]. Consular officers and consular employees have "functional immunity" (i.e., immunity from the jurisdiction of the receiving state "in respect of acts performed in exercise of consular function"), but do not enjoy the broader "personal immunity" accorded to diplomats.&lt;ref name="Boczek"/&gt; 

==State parties to the convention==
[[File:Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.svg|thumb|right|334px|{{legend|#00aa00|Parties}}{{legend|#eeee00|Signatories}}
{{legend|#ff1111|Non-signatory UN member states}}]]

There are 179 state parties to the convention including most [[UN member states]] and [[UN observer]] states [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine]]. The signatory states that have not ratified the convention are: [[Central African Republic]], [[Israel]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Republic of Congo]]. The UN member states that have neither signed nor ratified the convention are: [[Afghanistan]], [[Burundi]], [[Chad]], [[Comoros]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Palau]], [[San Marino]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[South Sudan]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Uganda]].

==Application of the treaty by the United States==
In March 2005, following the decisions of the [[International Court of Justice]] in the [[LaGrand case|''LaGrand'' case]] (2001) and ''[[Avena case|''Avena'' case]]'' (2004), the United States withdrew from the Optional Protocol to the Convention concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, which confers the ICJ with compulsory jurisdiction over disputes arising under the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Wouters, Sanderijn Duquet &amp; Katrien Meuwissen, "The Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consular Relations" in ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Diplomacy'' (eds. Andrew F. Cooper, Jorge Heine &amp; Ramesh Thakur: Oxford University Press, 2013), pp. 515-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Zimmermann, "Between the Quest for Universality and its Limited Jurisdiction: The Role of the International Court of Justice in enhancing the International Rule of Law" in ''Enhancing the Rule of Law through the International Court of Justice'' (eds. Giorgio Gaja &amp; Jenny Grote Stoutenburg: [[Brill Nijhoff]], 2014), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that foreign nationals who were not notified of their right to consular notification and access after an arrest may not use the treaty violation to suppress evidence obtained in police interrogation or belatedly raise legal challenges after trial (''[[Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon'', 548 U.S. 331 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court further ruled that the decision of the ICJ directing the United States to give "review and reconsideration" to the cases of 51 Mexican convicts on death row was not a binding domestic law and therefore could not be used to overcome state procedural default rules that barred further post-conviction challenges (''[[Medellín v. Texas]]'').&lt;ref&gt;''Medellín v. Texas'', 552 U.S. 491 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, prior to its withdrawal from the Optional Protocol, the U.S. brought a case to the ICJ against [[Iran]]&amp;mdash;''[[United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran]]'' (''United States v Iran'')&amp;mdash;in response to the [[Iran hostage crisis|seizure of United States diplomatic offices and personnel by militant revolutionaries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[International Court of Justice]], 24 May 1980, [http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/64/6291.pdf Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113041837/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/64/6291.pdf |date=13 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">The '''Vilnius Declaration''' was a declaration adopted by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) during the 18th annual session of its [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|parliamentary assembly]], that took place in [[Vilnius]] from 29 June to 3 July 2009.

The declaration contained 28 resolutions that addressed a number of issues, including "...strengthening of the OSCE, election observation, the [[food security]] in the OSCE area, the world financial crisis and the social consequences of that crisis, Iran, Afghanistan, human rights and civil liberties, arms control and disarmament in Europe, labour migration in Central Asia, energy security, climate change, water management, freedom of expression on the Internet, and a moratorium on the death penalty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.osce.org/pa/51129 |title= Press release issued by the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly |author= |date= 3 July 2009 |work= |publisher= [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] |accessdate= 2012-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its condemnation of [[totalitarianism]] and support for the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]] provoked protests by [[Russia]] and international media attention.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8133749.stm Resolution on Stalin riles Russia]. [[BBC]]. 3 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condemnation of totalitarianism==
Its resolution on "Europe Reunited: Promoting Human Rights and Civil Liberties in the OSCE Region in the 21st Century" is notable for its condemnation of [[totalitarianism]]. The resolution states that "in the twentieth century European countries experienced two major totalitarian regimes, Nazi and Stalinist, which brought about genocide, violations of human rights and freedoms, war crimes and crimes against humanity," urges all OSCE members to take a "united stand against all totalitarian rule from whatever ideological background," condemns "the glorification of the totalitarian regimes, including the holding of public demonstrations glorifying the Nazi or Stalinist past," and expresses support for the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]], which was proclaimed by the [[European Parliament]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oscepa.org/images/stories/documents/activities/1.Annual%20Session/2009_Vilnius/Final_Vilnius_Declaration_ENG.pdf |title= Vilnius Declaration of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and resolutions adopted at the eighteenth annual session |author=  |date= 29 June – 3 July 2009 |work=  |publisher= [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCEPA) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111155028/http://www.oscepa.org/images/stories/documents/activities/1.Annual%20Session/2009_Vilnius/Final_Vilnius_Declaration_ENG.pdf|archivedate=2010-01-11|accessdate= 2011-05-14 |dead-url= yes |quote=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution was criticized by [[Russia]], as Joseph Stalin "continues to be a hero to many Russians".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The Russian delegation tried but failed to have the resolution withdrawn. Of 213 present delegates from 50 countries, 201 supported the resolution, 8 voted against and 4 abstained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/45389/ The Kremlin rises to Stalin’s defense again].

'''Volunteering''' is generally considered an [[altruistic]] activity where an individual or group provides services for no financial or social gain "to benefit another person, group or organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=John|title=Volunteering|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2000|issue=26|page=215|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.215|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.215|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human [[quality of life]]. Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Volunteering|url=http://nationalservice.gov|accessdate=12 April 2017|website=[[Corporation for National and Community Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as [[medicine]], [[education]], or [[emergency rescue]]. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a [[natural disaster]].

==Etymology and history==

The verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun ''volunteer'', in [[Circa|C]].1600, "one who offers himself for military service," from the [[Middle French]] ''voluntaire''.&lt;ref name="Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=volunteer|title=Etymology:VOLUNTEER|accessdate=2012-04-30|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word ''volunteering'' has more recent usage—still predominantly military—coinciding with the phrase ''community service''.&lt;ref name="Etymology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jocote.org/2010/12/volunteer-whats-in-a-word/|publisher=Jocote.org|accessdate=2012-04-30|title=The origin of the word "Volunteering"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a military context, a [[volunteer military|volunteer army]] is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work "for free" and are given regular pay.

===19th century===
During this time, America experienced the [[Great Awakening]]. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities {{citation needed|reason=no citation|date=September 2015}}. In 1851, the first [[YMCA]] in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first [[YWCA]]. During the [[American Civil War]], women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the "Angel of the Battlefield" [[Clara Barton]] and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.  Barton founded the [[American Red Cross]] in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the [[Johnstown Flood]] in 1889.

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Kennedy greeting Peace Corps volunteers, 1961.jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] greets volunteers on 28 August 1961]]

The [[Salvation Army]] is one of the oldest and largest organizations working for disadvantaged people. Though it is a [[charity organization]], it has organized a number of volunteering programs since its inception.&lt;ref name="ISBN" /&gt;
Prior to the 19th century, few formal charitable organizations existed to assist people in need.

In the first few decades of the 20th century, several volunteer organizations were founded, including the [[Rotary International]], [[Kiwanis International]], [[Association of Junior Leagues International]], and [[Lions Clubs International]].

[[The Great Depression]] saw one of the first large-scale, nationwide efforts to coordinate volunteering for a specific need. During World War II, thousands of volunteer offices supervised the volunteers who helped with the many needs of the military and the [[home front]], including collecting supplies, entertaining soldiers on leave, and caring for the injured.&lt;ref name="ISBN" /&gt;

After [[World War II]], people shifted the focus of their altruistic passions to other areas, including helping the poor and volunteering overseas. A major development was the [[Peace Corps]] in the United States in 1960. When President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] declared a ''War on Poverty'' in 1964, volunteer opportunities started to expand and continued into the next few decades. The process for finding volunteer work became more formalized, with more volunteer centers forming and new ways to find work appearing on the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref name="ISBN"&gt;{{ISBN|1-86287-376-3}}, Volunteers and Volunteering, The Federation Press&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (in 2012), about 64.5 million Americans, or 26.5 percent of the adult population, gave 7.9 billion hours of volunteer service worth $175 billion.  This calculates at about 125–150 hours per year or 3 hours per week at a rate of $22 per hour. Volunteer hours in the UK are similar; the data for other countries is unavailable.

In 1960, after the so called revolutionary war in Cuba ended, Ernesto Che Guevara created the concept of volunteering work. It was created with the intention that workers across the country volunteer a few hours of work on their work centers.

==Types==

=== Volunteering as utilized by service learning programs ===
Many schools on all education levels offer [[service-learning]] programs, which allow students to serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit.&lt;ref name="MedEdH"&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Medical Education at Harvard
| accessdate = 2014-07-29
| url = http://ecommons.med.harvard.edu/ec_vqp.asp?name_GUID=%7B90C81275-4814-4921-BCC6-16F403715FEC%7D
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,"...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service-learning in higher education because we see it as a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'"&lt;ref name="Eyler"&gt;{{Citation

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, "Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs."&lt;ref name="MedEdH" /&gt; Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds by the fact that it "...fosters student development by capturing student interest..."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|1–2,8}} While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown.&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xv-xvii}} Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs,&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xvi}} According to Eyler and Giles,"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xvi}} They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: "Students like service-learning. When we sit down with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that [the students]believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

===Skills-based volunteering===
''Skills-based volunteering'' is leveraging the specialized skills and the talents of individuals to strengthen the infrastructure of nonprofits, helping them build and sustain their capacity to successfully achieve their missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalserviceresources.org/sbv|publisher=National Service Resources|title=Need of skills based volunteering for Non-Profit activities}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to traditional volunteering, where specific training is not required.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  The average hour of traditional volunteering is valued by the Independent Sector at between $18–20 an hour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-to-i.com/personal-development-through-volunteering&lt;/ref&gt; Skills-based volunteering is valued at $40–500 an hour, depending on the market value of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentsector.org|title=Skills based volunteering|publisher=Independent Sector|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2014&lt;!-- the link is to a site's home page, please link to the specific page that backs up the claim --&gt;}}

===Volunteering in developing countries===
{{Further information|International volunteering}}
[[File:Laura Bush with Ghana Peace Corps volunteers.jpg|thumb|[[Laura Bush]] poses with [[Peace Corps]] volunteers]]
An increasingly popular form of volunteering among young people, particularly [[gap year]] students and graduates, is to travel to communities in the [[developing world]] to work on projects with local organisations. Activities include teaching English, working in orphanages, conservation, assisting non-governmental organizations and medical work. International volunteering often aims to give participants valuable skills and knowledge in addition to benefits to the host community and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volunteering abroad|url=http://bma.org.uk/developing-your-career/career-progression/volunteering-abroad|website=BMA|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual volunteering===
{{Further information|Virtual volunteering}}
Also called ''e-volunteering'' or ''online volunteering'', virtual volunteering is a volunteer who completes tasks, in whole or in part, offsite from the organization being assisted. They use the Internet and a home, school, [[telecenter]] or work computer, or other Internet-connected device, such as a [[PDA]] or [[smartphone]]. Virtual volunteering is also known as cyber service, telementoring, and teletutoring, as well as various other names. Virtual volunteering is similar to [[telecommuting]], except that instead of online employees who are paid, these are online volunteers who are not paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en/index.html|publisher=UN Volunteers|accessdate=2012-04-30|title=Online Volunteering|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502044205/http://onlinevolunteering.org/en/index.html|archive-date=2 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serviceleader.org/virtual|title=Virtual Volunteering|accessdate=2012-04-30|publisher=Service Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micro-volunteering===
{{Further information|Micro-volunteering}}
Micro-volunteering is a task performed via an internet-connected device. An individual typically does this task in small, un-paid increments of time. Micro-volunteering is distinct from "virtual volunteering" in that it typically does not require the individual volunteer to go through an application process, screening process, or training period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofit.about.com/od/volunteers/a/microvol.htm| title=Micro-Volunteering via Mobile Phones - Using Spare Time to Micro-Volunteer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-volunteer.org.uk/helpfromhome/micro-volunteering-changing-the-world-in-just-your-pyjamas/ |title=Micro Volunteering - Changing The World In Just Your Pyjamas! |publisher=I-volunteer.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental volunteering===
{{Further information|Environmental volunteering}}

Environmental volunteering refers to the volunteers who contribute towards environmental management or conservation. Volunteers conduct a range of activities including environmental monitoring, ecological restoration such as re-vegetation and weed removal, protecting endangered animals, and educating others about the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatvol|title=Environmental Volunteer Work|publisher=PeaceCorps|accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteering in an emergency===
[[File:FEMA - 15322 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-05-2005 in Texas.jpg|thumb|Volunteers assist survivors at the Houston Astrodome following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in September 2005.]]
Volunteering often plays a pivotal role in the recovery effort following natural disasters, such as tsunamis, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and earthquakes. For example, the 1995 [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake]] in Japan was a watershed moment, bringing in many first-time [[wikipedia:Great_Hanshin_earthquake#Volunteerism|volunteers for earthquake response]]. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] attracted a large number of volunteers worldwide, deployed by [[non-governmental organization]]s, government agencies, and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/usslav/#summary/|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=USGS Tsunami 2004 Summary|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119233314/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/usslav/#summary/|archive-date=19 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0504/excerpt2.html|publisher=National Geographic|title=Emergency Volunteering Coverage in NatGeo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 hurricane Sandy emergency, [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers, formed a ''laterally organized rapid-response team'' that provided much needed help during and after the storm, from food to shelter to reconstruction.  It is an example of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] at work, pooling resources and assistance and leveraging social media.

===Volunteering in schools===

Resource poor schools around the world rely on government support or on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries, whenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.net/news/back-to-school-poll-results.page|title=The Economy's Impact on Back to School|publisher=Great Schools|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many opportunities available in school systems for volunteers. Yet, there are not many requirements in order to volunteer in a school system. Whether one is a high school or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) graduate or college student, most schools require just voluntary and selfless effort.&lt;ref name="School Mental Health Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smhp.psych.ucla.edu/pdfdocs/volunteer/volunt.pdf|publisher=School Mental Health Project|title=Volunteer teaching effort can help students to learn better in schools|accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like the benefits of any type of volunteering there are great rewards for the volunteer, student, and school. In addition to intangible rewards, volunteers can add relevant experience to their resumes. Volunteers who travel to assist may learn foreign culture and language.

Volunteering in schools can be an additional teaching guide for the students and help to fill the gap of local teachers. Cultural and language exchange during teaching and other school activities can be the most essential learning experience for both students and volunteers.&lt;ref name="School Mental Health Project"/&gt;

===Corporate volunteering===
{{Further information|Volunteer grant}}
Benefacto, a volunteering brokerage, describe corporate volunteering as "Companies giving their employees an allowance of paid time off annually, which they use to volunteer at a charity of their choice."&lt;ref&gt;http://benefacto.org/what-is-corporate-volunteering/&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the companies at the [[Fortune 500]] allow their employees to volunteer during work hours. These formalized Employee Volunteering Programs (EVPs), also called Employer Supported Volunteering (ESV), are regarded as a part of the companies' sustainability efforts and their social responsibility activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcccc.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=document.showDocumentByID&amp;DocumentID=1308|title=Mapping Success in Employee Volunteering - The Drivers of Effectiveness for Employee Volunteering and Giving Programs and Fortune 500 Performance (2009)|publisher=Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship 2009|accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40% of Fortune 500 companies provide monetary [[donations]], also known as [[volunteer grant]]s, to nonprofits as a way to recognize employees who dedicate significant amounts of time to volunteering in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/dos-and-donts-for-volunteers/|title=Fortune 500's monetary donation programs for voluntary service|publisher=Qgiv.com|accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the information from [[VolunteerMatch]], a service that provides Employee Volunteering Program solutions, the key drivers for companies that produce and manage EVPs are building [[brand awareness]] and affinity, strengthening trust and loyalty among consumers, enhancing [[corporate image]] and reputation, improving [[employee retention]], increasing [[workforce productivity|employee productivity]] and loyalty, and providing an effective vehicle to reach strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volunteermatch.org/corporations/resources/businesscase.jsp|publisher=VolunteerMatch.org|title= How companies benefit from EVP|accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, David Cameron pledged to give all UK workers employed by companies with more 250 staff mandatory three days’ paid volunteering leave, which if implemented will generate an extra 360 million volunteering hours a year&lt;ref&gt;https://benefacto.org/three-days-paid-volunteering-leave-an-update-from-rob-wilsons-office/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Community volunteer work===
[[File:Volunteers installing windows at the Sumac Centre.jpg|thumb|Volunteers fit new windows at the [[Sumac Centre]] in [[Nottingham]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].]]
Community volunteering refers globally to those who work to improve their local community. This activity commonly occurs through not for profit organizations, local governments and churches; but also encompasses ad-hoc or informal groups such as recreational sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winfield|first1=Mark|title=The Essential Volunteer Handbook|publisher=FriesenPress|isbn=978-1-4602-1583-8|url=http://www.markwinfield.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits of community volunteer work ===
There are many proven personal benefits of community volunteerism. Working together with a group of people who have different ethnicity, backgrounds, and views reduces stereotypes. Community volunteerism has also been proven to improve student's academic success.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

According to ''Where's the Learning in Service Learning?'' by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, immersing oneself into service learning and serving others has many positive effects both academic and personal. Not only does surrounding oneself with new people and learning how to work together as a group help one improve teamwork and relational skills, it reduces stereotypes, increases appreciation of other cultures, and works to allow young people to find others that they relate to.

Eyler and Giles noted that at the beginning and end of a college semester that included three hours of community service a week, students reported a much higher regard for cultural differences. At the end of the semester those who had participated in service-learning were noted as saying that the most important things that they had learned were not to judge others, and to appreciate every type of person because everyone shares some similar key characteristics.

Community volunteer work has proven to be a powerful predictor in students' academic lives and college experience as a whole. Studies have shown that students who participate in community service as a part of their college course of study have a much higher correlation of completing their degree (Astin, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Matters in College: Four Critical Years Revisited|last=Astin|first=A.W.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1992|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How College Affects Students: Findings and Insights from Twenty Years of Research|last=Pascarella and Terenzini|first=E.T. and P.T.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1991|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition, college students who participate in community volunteer projects as a part of their college experience report finding a much greater relevance in their academic studies after completing community volunteer projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning|last=Eyler and Giles, Jr.|first=Janet and Dwight|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1999|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to University Health Services, studies have found that volunteering can positively impact a student’s overall mental and emotional health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/wellness/student-volunteering-could-have-health-benefits/|title=Student volunteering could have health benefits|website=www.uhs.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social volunteering or welfare volunteering===
In some European countries government organisations and non-government organisations provide auxiliary positions for a certain period in institutions like hospitals, schools, memorial sites and welfare institutions. The difference to other types of volunteering is that there are strict legal regulations, what organisation is allowed to engage volunteers and about the period a volunteer is allowed to work in a voluntary position. Due to that fact, the volunteer is getting a limited amount as a pocket money from the government. An organization having one of the biggest manpower in [[Europe]] is the German [[Federal volunteers service]] (Bundesfreiwilligendienst), that was founded in 2011, by having more than 35.000 federal volunteers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bundesfreiwilligendienst.de/fileadmin/de.bundesfreiwilligendienst/content.de/Service/Downloads/BFD_Flyer_engl_web_RZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A much older institution is the [[Voluntary social year]] (Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr) in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsj.at/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pro-fsj.de/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Volunteering at Major Sporting Events ===
Sochi Olympics 25,000 volunteers worked at the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Sochi Winter Olympics]]. They supported the organisers in more than 20 functional areas: meeting guests, assisting navigation, organising the opening and closing ceremonies, organising food outlets, etc. Volunteer applications were open to any nationals of Russia and other countries. The Sochi 2014 Organising Committee received about 200,000 applications, 8 applicants per place. Volunteers received training over the course of more than a year at 26 volunteer centres in 17 cities across Russia. The majority of participants were between 17 and 22 years old. At the same time, 3000 applications were submitted from people over 55 years old. Some of them worked as volunteers during the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]] in Moscow. It was the first experience with such a large-scale volunteer program in the contemporary Russia.

==== 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia ====
For the first time in its history, Russia will host the FIFA World Cup from June 14 till July 15, 2018. Moreover, it will be the first time the World Cup games will be played both in Europe and Asia. The games will be hosted by 12 stadiums in 11 Russian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ru.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/volunteers/|title=Чемпионат мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - Волонтерская программа Чемпионата мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|work=www.fifa.com|access-date=2018-06-14|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volunteer program of the 2018 FIFA World Cup has engaged thousands of people from Russia and other countries around the world.

The program included several stages: recruitment, selection and training of volunteers, organisation of their work during the championship. The recruitment of volunteers for the FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup via FIFA.com started on June 1, 2016 and closed on December 30, 2016. Some of the volunteers worked at the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]]: 1733 people assisted the organisers in Saint Petersburg, 1590 worked in Moscow, 1261 in Sochi, 1260 in Kazan, a total of 5844 participants.

The FIFA World Cup will be supported by 17,040 volunteers of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee.

Candidates living in Russia were selected by 15 volunteer centres in the host cities based in some of Russia's leading higher educational institutions: Synergy University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Russian State Social University, Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University, Saint Petersburg State University of Economics, Samara State University, Volga Region State Academy of Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism, Don State Technical University, Ogarev Mordovia State University, Volgograd State University, State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Samara State Aerospace University, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, and Ural Federal University.

Candidates from other countries were selected remotely.

Candidates had to be at least 18 years old, have a good knowledge of English, have a higher or vocational secondary education, and possess teamwork skills.

Volunteers were trained remotely, in volunteer centres and at World Cup venues.

Volunteers will be providing assistance in a variety of areas:

# Distributing accreditations;
# Selling and checking tickets;
# Assisting radio communications professionals;
# Organising leisure and entertainment activities for guests of the event;
# Organising food outlets;
# Providing interpretation services;
# Working with sponsors;
# Providing medical services and organising doping control procedures;
# Supporting mass media operations;
# Organising arrivals and departures of players and guests;
# Working with VIP guests;
# Assisting players and referees;
# Assisting players and guests with accommodation;
# Providing navigation assistance to guests;
# Assisting TV and radio broadcasting;
# Organising transportation;
# Managing volunteers;
# Organising operations of the stadium;
# Monitoring compliance with FIFA social and environmental requirements;
# Organising the opening and closing ceremonies of the championship.

Their work started ahead of the events: on May 10, 2017 for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and on May 10, 2018 for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

==== Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program: Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects ====
On October 20, 2017, the Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects “Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program” was launched. The competition has engaged about 1500 people: applicants to the 2018 FIFA World Cup volunteer program and future city volunteers.

The idea of the competition was that anyone could submit a project that would draw the attention of Russian cities residents to the FIFA World Cup in Russia and leave a legacy after the championship was over.

The project was expected to produce tangible (work of art, place of attraction for guests and residents in the city, open playground, graffiti, developed areas in city parks, films, etc.) or intangible (events, conferences, festivals, exhibitions) legacy.

26 projects qualified to the final and were supported by the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee and the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The jury included the General Director of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee Alexey Sorokin, Ambassador of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia Alexey Smertin and Advisor to the Head of the Federal Tourism Agency Svetlana Sergeeva.

Some of the projects were combined or further developed by the Local Organising Committee.

Among the projects were: Football Championship for Moms, Ramp Production out of Recycled Plastic, Your Championship Sticker Packs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ru.fifa.com/worldcup/news/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%8B-%D1%87%D0%BC-2018-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8B-2922854|title=Чемпионат мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - Новости - Победители конкурса «Наследие волонтерской программы ЧМ-2018» награждены в «Сколково» - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|work=www.fifa.com|access-date=2018-06-14|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political view==
{{Further information|Gift economy}}
Modern societies share a common value of people helping each other; not only do volunteer acts assist others, but they also benefit the volunteering individual on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picketnews.com/archiveDetail.asp?cID=3&amp;id=8327|publisher=Picket News&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having similar objectives, tension can arise between volunteers and state-provided services. In order to curtail this tension, most countries develop policies and enact legislation to clarify the roles and relationships among governmental stakeholders and their voluntary counterparts; this regulation identifies and allocates the necessary legal, social, administrative, and financial support of each party. This is particularly necessary when some voluntary activities are seen as a challenge to the authority of the state(e.g., on 29 January 2001, President Bush cautioned that volunteer groups should supplement—not replace—government agencies’ work).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policyalmanac.org/government/charity_and_volunteering.shtml Bush Announces Faith-Based Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteering that benefits the state but challenges paid counterparts angers labor unions that represent those who are paid for their volunteer work; this is particularly seen in combination departments, such as [[volunteer fire department]]s.

===Difficulties in cross-national aid===
{{see also|International volunteering}}
Difficulties in the cross-national aid model of volunteering can arise when it is applied across national borders. The presence of volunteers who are sent from one state to another can be viewed as a breach of [[sovereignty]] and showing a lack of respect towards the national government of the proposed recipients. Thus, motivations are important when states negotiate offers to send aid and when these proposals are accepted, particularly if donors may postpone assistance or stop it altogether. Three types of conditionality have evolved:
#'''Financial accountability''': Transparency in funding management to ensure that what is done by the volunteers is properly targeted
#'''Policy reform''': Governmental request that developing countries adopt certain social, economic, or environmental policies; often, the most controversial relate to the privatization of services traditionally offered by the state
#'''Development objectives''': Asking developing countries to adjust specific time-bound economic objectives

Some international volunteer organizations define their primary mission as being altruistic: to fight poverty and improve the living standards of people in the developing world, (e.g. [[Voluntary Services Overseas]] has almost 2,000 skilled professionals working as volunteers to pass on their expertise to local people so that the volunteers' skills remain long after they return home). When these organizations work in partnership with governments, the results can be impressive. However, when other organizations or individual First World governments support the work of volunteer groups, there can be questions as to whether the organizations' or governments' real motives are poverty alleviation. Instead, a focus on creating wealth for some of the poor or developing policies intended to benefit the donor states is sometimes reported.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN reference for Volunteering Visions, Publisher: The Federation Press, Edited by: [[Joy Noble]] and [[Fiona Johnston]], {{ISBN|1-86287-404-2}} {{ISBN|978-1862874046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many low-income countries’ economies suffer from industrialization without prosperity and investment without growth. One reason for this is that development assistance guides many Third World governments to pursue development policies that have been wasteful, ill-conceived, or unproductive; some of these policies have been so destructive that the economies could not have been sustained without outside support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDS_IBank_Servlet?pcont=details&amp;eid=000009265_3980429111119|title=Aid, taxation, and development: analytical perspectives on aid effectiveness in Sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=World Bank|date=1998-02-28|accessdate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, some offers of aid have distorted the general spirit of volunteering, treating local voluntary action as contributions in kind, i.e., existing conditions requiring the modification of local people’s behavior in order for them to earn the right to donors’ charity. This can be seen as patronizing and offensive to the recipients because the aid expressly serves the policy aims of the donors rather than the needs of the recipients.

==Moral resources, political capital and civil society==
[[File:Some help files iin a volunteers station in Shenzhen,China .jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some files for helping people in a volunteers station in [[Shenzhen]], [[People's Republic of China]]]]
Based on a case study in China, Xu and Ngai (2011) revealed that the developing grassroots volunteerism can be an enclave among various organizations and may be able to work toward the development of civil society in the developing countries. The researchers developed a "Moral Resources and Political Capital" approach to examine the contributions of volunteerism in promoting the civil society. Moral resource means the available morals could be chosen by NGOs. Political capital means the capital that will improve or enhance the NGOs’ status, possession or access in the existing political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y |last2=Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=247–269.|accessdate=17 April 2011 |url= http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Xu and Ngai (2011) distinguished two types of Moral Resources: Moral Resource-I and Moral Resource-II (ibid).
#Moral Resource I: Inspired by [[Immanuel Kant]]’s (1998 [1787]) argument of "What ought I to do," Moral Resource-I will encourage the NGOs’ confidence and then have the courage to act and conquer difficulties by way of answering and confirming the question of "What ought I to do."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I. (1998). Critique of pure reason ([[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]], Trans.). Raleigh, NC: Alex Catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Moral Resource II: given that Adorno (2000) recognizes that moral or immoral tropes are socially determined, Moral Resource-II refers to the morals that are well accepted by the given society.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. (2000). Problems of moral philosophy (T. Schroder, Ed. &amp; R. Livingstone, Trans.). Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the intellectual heritage of Blau and Duncan (1967), two types of political capital were identified:
#Political Capital-I refers to the political capital mainly ascribed to the status that the NGO inherited throughout history (e.g., the CYL).
#Political Capital-II refers to the Political Capital that the NGOs earned through their hard efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Blau, P. M., &amp; Duncan, O. D. (1967). The American occupational structure. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
Obviously, "Moral resource-I itself contains the self-determination that gives participants confidence in the ethical beliefs they have chosen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y |last2=Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |page=260 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost any organizations may have Moral Resource-I, while not all of them have the societal recognized Moral Resource-II. However, the voluntary service organizations predominantly occupy Moral Resource-II because a sense of moral superiority makes it possible that for parties with different values, goals and cultures to work together in promoting the promotion of volunteering. Thus the voluntary service organizations are likely to win the trust and support of the masses as well as the government more easily than will the organizations whose morals are not accepted by mainstream society. In other words, Moral Resource II helps the grassroots organizations with little Political Capital I to win Political Capital-II, which is a crucial factor for their survival and growth in developing countries such as China. Therefore, the voluntary service realm could be an enclave of the development of civil society in the developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y. |last2= Ngai |first2=N.

==Health benefits==
Volunteering has the ability to improve the quality of life and health including longevity of those who donate their time &lt;ref&gt;https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Post-AltruismHappinessHealth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and research has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.

==Mental health benefits==
Volunteering is known not only to be related to happiness &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228189802_Prosocial_Spending_and_Well-Being_Cross-Cultural_Evidence_for_a_Psychological_Universal&lt;/ref&gt; but also to increase happiness &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228189802_Prosocial_Spending_and_Well-Being_Cross-Cultural_Evidence_for_a_Psychological_Universal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5494996_Spending_Money_on_Others_Promotes_Happiness
&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, giving help was a more important benefit of better reported mental health than receiving help &lt;ref&gt;http://img2.timg.co.il/forums/1_89494618.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Studies have also shown that volunteering can cause a decrease in  loneliness for those volunteering as well as those for whom people volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drbarbaraedwards.com/why-helping-others-makes-us-happy/|title=Why Helping Others Makes Us Happy {{!}} Dr. Barbara Edwards|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, statistics on volunteering have historically been limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energizeinc.com/hot-topics/2006/june|title=Wouldn't It Be Nice to Really Know {{!}} Energize: Volunteer Management Resources for Directors of Volunteers|website=www.energizeinc.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the U.S. [[Current Population Survey (US)]] included a volunteering supplement which produced statistics on volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov/about/research_faqs.cfm|title=National Veteran Corps|website=www.volunteeringinamerica.gov|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In the 1960s, [[Ivan Illich]] offered an analysis of the role of American volunteers in Mexico in his speech entitled "To Hell With Good Intentions". His concerns, along with those of critics such as [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Edward Said]], revolve around the notion of [[altruism]] as an extension of Christian [[missionary]] [[ideology]]. In addition, he mentions the sense of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]/[[obligation]] as a factor, which drives the concept of [[noblesse oblige]]—first developed by the French [[aristocracy]] as a [[morality|moral]] [[duty]] derived from their wealth. Simply stated, these apprehensions propose the extension of power and authority over indigenous cultures around the world. Recent critiques of volunteering come from Westmier and Kahn (1996) and [[bell hooks]] (née Gloria Watkins) (2004). Also, [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415809153/ Georgeou (2012)] has critiqued the impact of [[neoliberalism]] on international aid volunteering.

The field of the [[medical tourism]] (referring to volunteers who travel overseas to deliver medical care) has recently attracted negative criticism when compared to the alternative notion of sustainable capacities, i.e., work done in the context of long-term, locally-run, and foreign-supported infrastructures.  A preponderance of this criticism appears largely in scientific and peer-reviewed literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bezruchka, S. (2000). Medical Tourism as Medical Harm to the Third World: Why? For Whom? ''[[Wilderness and Environmental Medicine]]'', 11, 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, M. (2006). Duffle Bag Medicine. ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', 295, 1491-1492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, A.D., &amp; Upshur, R.E.G. (2009). Global Health Ethics for Students. ''[[Developing World Bioethics]]'', 9, 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, media outlets with more general readerships have published such criticisms as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/think-looking-after-turtles-in-costa-rica-for-three-weeks-is-good-for-your-cv-think-again-66148#comment_1125331|title=Think looking after turtles in Costa Rica for three weeks is good for your CV?
