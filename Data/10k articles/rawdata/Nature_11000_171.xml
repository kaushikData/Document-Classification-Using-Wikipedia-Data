The '''180th meridian''' or '''antimeridian'''&lt;ref&gt;The word ''antimeridian'' can also mean the meridian opposite to any given meridian. E.g. [[20th meridian west|20° west]] is the antimeridian of [[160th meridian east|160° east]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 180° both east and west of the [[Prime meridian#International prime meridian|Prime Meridian]], with which it forms a [[great circle]] dividing the earth into the [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] and [[Eastern Hemisphere]]s. It is common to both east [[longitude]] and west longitude. It mostly passes through the open waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]], but passes across land in [[Russia]], [[Fiji]] and [[Antarctica]].  This meridian is used as the basis for the [[International Date Line]], but the latter deviates from it to maintain date consistency within the territories of Russia, USA, Kiribati, Fiji and New Zealand.

Starting at the [[North Pole]] and heading south to the [[South Pole]], the 180th meridian passes through:

The meridian also passes between (but not particularly close to):
*the [[Gilbert Islands]] and the [[Phoenix Islands]] of [[Kiribati]]
*[[North Island]] and the [[Kermadec Islands]] of [[New Zealand]]
*the [[Bounty Islands]] and the [[Chatham Islands]], also of New Zealand

The only place where roads cross this meridian, and where there are buildings very close to it, is in Fiji.

==Software representation problems==
Many geographic software libraries or data formats project the world to a rectangle; very often this rectangle is split exactly at the 180th meridian. This often makes it non-trivial to do simple tasks (like representing an area, or a line) over the 180th meridian. Some examples:

* The [[GeoJSON]] specification strongly suggests splitting geometries so that neither of their parts cross the antimeridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.9|title=RFC 7946 - The GeoJSON Format|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[OpenStreetMap]], areas (like the boundary of Russia) are split at the 180th meridian.

The '''Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System''' ('''ATLAS'''; Observatory codes [[IAU code#T05|T05]] and [[IAU code#T08|T08]]) is a robotic [[astronomical survey]] and early-warning system for detecting smaller [[near-Earth object]]s a few weeks to days before they [[Impact event|impact Earth]]. Funded by [[NASA]], and developed and operated by the [[University of Hawaii]]'s [[Institute for Astronomy]], the system's current two 0.5-meter telescopes are located at [[Haleakala Observatory|Haleakala]] (ATLAS-HKO) and [[Mauna Loa Observatory|Mauna Loa]] (ATLAS-MLO) observatories, on two of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and 160&amp;nbsp;km apart. Each of the two telescope surveys one quarter of the whole observable sky four times per clear night, for a four-fold coverage of the observable sky every two clear nights.&lt;ref name=ArXib2018&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Tonry ''et al''. |title= ATLAS: A High-Cadence All-Sky Survey System|journal= Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|volume= 130|issue= 988|pages= 064505| date = 28 March 2018 |arxiv= 1802.00879|bibcode= 2018PASP..130f4505T|doi= 10.1088/1538-3873/aabadf}} Accessed 2018-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; ATLAS began observations in 2015 and its two-telescope version is fully operational since 2017.

One of the best-known recorded impacts in modern times is the 1908 [[Tunguska event]], which leveled several thousand square kilometers of forest in a very sparsely populated part of [[Siberia]], Russia, and which over a more populous region would have caused catastrophic damage. The 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] event is the only known impact in historical times to have resulted in a large number of injuries, with the possible exception of the poorly documented [[1490 Ch'ing-yang event]] in China. The approximately 20 meter Chelyabinsk meteor is the largest recorded object to have impacted a continent of the Earth since the Tunguska event. 

Future impacts are bound to occur, with much higher odds for smaller regionally damaging asteroids than for larger globally damaging ones,  and [[physicist]] [[Stephen Hawking]],

Thanks largely to [[Spaceguard]] surveillance, the inventory of the [[Near Earth Objects]] with diameters above 1 kilometer is for instance now 97% complete, while the estimated completeness for 140 meter objects is around one third and improving. Any impact by one of these known asteroids would be [[Asteroid impact prediction|predicted]] decades in advance. Smaller but still regionally dangerous impacting asteroids can by contrast only be detected when they come very close to the Earth. This in most cases only happens during their final approach, and those impacts therefore typically cannot be predicted earlier than a few weeks in advance. According to expert testimony in the [[United States Congress]] in 2013, [[NASA]] would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched.&lt;ref name="US-Congress-20130410"&gt;{{cite web |author=U.S.Congress |title=Threats From Space: a Review of U.S. Government Efforts to Track and mitigate Asteroids and Meteors (Part I and Part II) – Hearing Before the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology House of Representatives One Hundred Thirteenth Congress First Session |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-113hhrg80552/pdf/CHRG-113hhrg80552.pdf |date=19 March 2013 |page=147 |work=[[United States Congress]] |accessdate=26 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==

The ''Last Alert'' part of the system name refers to the fact that ATLAS will find smaller asteroids years too late for potential deflection, but would provide the days or weeks of warning needed to evacuate and otherwise prepare a target area. According to ATLAS project lead John Tonry, "that's enough time to evacuate the area of people, take measures to protect buildings and other infrastructure, and be alert to a tsunami danger generated by ocean impacts".&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news | author = Clark, Stuart | title = Asteroids and how to deflect them | date = 20 June 2017 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2013/feb/18/asteroids-how-deflect-dangerous | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the limited damage and injuries caused by the 17-m [[Chelyabinsk meteor|Chelyabinsk meteor impact]] were from window glass broken by its [[shock wave]],&lt;ref name="Canada7968297"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/news/Meteor+explodes+over+Russia+Ural+Mountains+injured+shock+wave+blasts+windows/7968297/story.html |title=Meteor explodes over Russia's Ural Mountains; 1,100 injured as shock wave blasts out windows |date=15 February 2013 |first1=Jim |last1=Heintz |first2=Vladimir |last2=Isachenkov |agency=The Associated Press |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513022402/http://www.canada.com/news/Meteor%2Bexplodes%2Bover%2BRussia%2BUral%2BMountains%2Binjured%2Bshock%2Bwave%2Bblasts%2Bwindows/7968297/story.html |archivedate=2013-05-13 |deadurl=yes |quote=[[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Emergency Situations Ministry]] spokesman Vladimir Purgin said many of the injured were cut as they flocked to windows to see what caused the intense flash of light, which was momentarily brighter than the sun. |access-date=2017-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and with advance warning those losses could have been much reduced by actions as simple as propping all windows open before the impact and staying away from them.

The ATLAS project was developed at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa|University of Hawaii]] with US$5 million funding from [[NASA]],&lt;ref name=Astronomy&gt;{{cite news | author = University of Hawaii at Manoa's Institute for Astronomy | title = ATLAS: The Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System | date = 18 February 2013 | url = http://www.astronomy.com/News-Observing/News/2013/02/ATLAS%20-%20The%20Asteroid%20Terrestrial-Impact%20Last%20Alert%20System.aspx | publisher = Astronomy Magazine | accessdate = 2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its first element was deployed in 2015. The first telescope became fully operational at the end of 2015, and the second one in March 2017. Replacement of the initially substandard [[Schmidt corrector plate]]s of both telescopes in June 2017 brought their image quality close to its nominal 2 pixels (3.8") width and improved their sensitivity by one [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]].&lt;ref name=Schmidt&gt;{{cite news | author = Henry Weiland | title = New Schmidt Correctors Installed! | date = 18 February 2013 | url = http://blog.fallingstar.com/index.php/2017/06/20/new-schmidt-correctors-installed/ |accessdate = 2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, the project obtained US$3.8 million of additional NASA funding to install two telescopes in the Southern hemisphere, one of which will be hosted by the  [[South African Astronomical Observatory]].&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05969-2?utm_source=twt_nnc&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=naturenews&amp;sf195541225=1 ''Project that spots city-killing asteroids expands to Southern Hemisphere''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAAO"&gt;[https://www.saao.ac.za/press-release/saao-to-contribute-to-the-global-effort-to-detect-near-earth-objects/ "SAAO to contribute to the global effort to detect Near Earth Objects."]&lt;/ref&gt; This geographical expansion of ATLAS  will provide visibility of the far Southern sky, more continuous coverage, better resilience to bad weather, and additional information on the asteroid orbit from the [[parallax]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fallingstar.com/how_atlas_works.php Atlas: How it works]. ''Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System''.&lt;/ref&gt; The full ATLAS concept consists of eight telescopes, spread over the globe for full-sky and 24h/24h coverage.

As long as their [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] is not too close to the Sun, and for the current Hawaii-based system not too far into the Southern hemisphere, the automated system provides a one-week warning for a {{Convert|45|m|ft|-1}} diameter asteroid, and a three-week warning for a {{Convert|120|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} one.&lt;ref name=Astronomy/&gt; By comparison, the February 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor|Chelyabinsk meteor impact]] was from an object estimated at {{Convert|17|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} diameter. Its radiant happened to be very close to the Sun and it therefore was in the blind spot of any ATLAS-like system, but a similar object arriving from a dark direction would be detected by ATLAS a few days in advance.

As a by-product of its main design goal, ATLAS can identify any moderately bright  variable or moving object in the night sky. It therefore also looks for [[variable star]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1804.02132|title = A First Catalog of Variable Stars Measured by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)|last1 = Heinze|first1 = A.

== Design and operation ==

The full ATLAS concept consists of eight 50-centimeter diameter f/2 [[Wright camera|Wright]]-[[Schmidt corrector plate|Schmidt telescopes]], spread over the globe for full-sky and 24h/24h coverage, and each fitted with a 110 Megapixel CCD array camera. The current system consists of two such telescopes operating on [[Haleakala]] and [[Mauna Loa]] in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], ATLAS1 and ATLAS2.&lt;ref name="ATLAS Telescope 2 Installed on Mauna Loa"&gt;ATLAS Telescope 2 Installed on Mauna Loa, 
Ari Heinze [http://blog.fallingstar.com/index.php/2017/02/06/atlas-telescope-2-installed-on-mauna-loa/] Retrieved April 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A major feature of these telescopes is their large 7.4° field of view - about 15 times the diameter of the full moon. This system can image the whole night sky visible from Hawaii with about 1000 separate telescope pointings. At 30 seconds per exposure plus 5 seconds for readout, each ATLAS telescope can therefore scan the whole visible sky a little over once each night, with a [[median]] completeness limit at [[apparent magnitude]] 19. Since the mission of the telescope is to identify moving objects, each telescope actually observes one quarter of the sky four times in a night at approximately 15-minute intervals, as needed to link multiple observations of an asteroid into a preliminary orbit and predict its approximate position on subsequent nights. Apparent magnitude 19 is astronomer-speak for "respectably but not extremely faint", and it is the equivalent to the light of a match flame in New York viewed from San Francisco. ATLAS therefore scans the visible sky in much less depth, but much more quickly, than larger surveying telescope arrays such as University of Hawaii's [[Pan-STARRS]]. Pan-STARRS goes approximately 100 times deeper, but needs over two weeks instead of half a night to scan the whole sky just once.&lt;ref name=Astronomy/&gt;

NASA's Near Earth Observation Program initially provided a US$5 million grant, with $3.5 million covering the first three years of design, construction and software development, and the balance of the grant to fund the systems operation for two years following its entry into full operational service in late 2015.&lt;ref name="Nā Kilo Hōkū-2013.#46"&gt;Oliver, Chris.

'''''Brian's Hunt''''' is a 2003 [[young adult novel]] by [[Gary Paulsen]].  It is the fifth and final book in the award-winning ''[[Hatchet (novel)|Hatchet]]'' series, which deals with Brian Robeson, a boy who learns wilderness survival when he is stranded after a plane wreck.

==Plot summary==
Brian, who is now sixteen years old, is [[canoe]]ing through the [[Canada|Canadian]] wilderness. He realizes that the woods are now his home and he will never be happy in modern society with its [[noise]], pollution, and fake people. He now spends his time in the wild hunting, fishing, and [[home schooling]] himself. While Brian does not miss human contact, he finds his thoughts frequently turning to Kay-gwa-daush (also known as Susan), the teenage daughter of the [[Cree]] family who rescued him at the end of ''[[Brian's Winter]]''. Though he has only seen her photograph, her family has described her as an adventurous, self-reliant young woman, and Brian wonders if she might be a kindred spirit.

While canoeing, Brian finds a seriously wounded [[Malamute]] dog, which he nurses back to health. The dog is clearly domesticated, and Brian begins to worry that whatever maimed the dog may have done the same to her owners. He remembers his Cree friends (The Smallhorns) and decides to go check on them.

When Brian reaches their cabin, he finds that it was a [[bear]] that had killed the parents and apparently chased Susan into hiding. Brian returns her to her home and buries the family while she radios for help.  The authorities arrive to take Susan to relatives in [[Winnipeg]]. Brian, along with the dog, stays behind in order to hunt down and kill the bear, knowing very well that the hunt could cost him his life.

Brian, using skills he had learned in past books like ''[[Hatchet (book)|Hatchet]]'' and ''[[Brian's Winter]]'', searches for the bear that killed his friends. But soon, the hunter becomes the hunted. Brian finds bear tracks on an island and begins to follow them. He later realizes that he was walking in a circle. The bear is actually hunting Brian. The next day, instead of moving on, he waits for the bear, and after a hard-fought battle with the bear, Brian is triumphant. Kay-gwa-daush (Susan) returns to her aunt by a plane.

'''Cabled observatories''' are seabed [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] research platforms connected to the surface by [[Submarine communications cable|undersea cables]].  Such cables supply both power and telecommunications to [[Scientific instrument|instruments]].&lt;ref name=L3&gt;[http://www2.l-3com.com/maripro/business_areas/ocean_observatory.htm/ Vendor description (L3)]&lt;/ref&gt;  By removing the limitations of undersea power sources and sonar or RF communications, cabled observatories allow persistent study of underwater phenomena.&lt;ref name=whoi&gt;[http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=24396/ [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute|WHOI]] page]&lt;/ref&gt;  A single cable can support multiple observation sites via individual "drops;"&lt;ref name=oceanworks&gt;[http://www.oceanworks.com/cabledObservatorySystems.php/ Vendor description (Oceanworks)]&lt;/ref&gt; multiple or branching cables may then provide data in 2D or 3D.

The extent of coverage is limited by the high cost of laying dedicated undersea cable.  Initial experiments used abandoned communications cables;&lt;ref name=whoi&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; efforts are in progress to extend observations at lower cost by accessing more such cables.

Despite their advantages, cabled observatories can (and do) relay compromised data to scientists, particularly when located in remote parts of the ocean. Factors such as instrumental malfunction and biofouling are often responsible for this. Systematic improvements, to lessen the impacts of such factors, are currently being studied by groups such as [[Ocean Networks Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeffries, Marlene A.; Mihaly, Steven F.; Jenkyns, Reyna; Biffard, Ben R.|first=|date=|title=Detecting and Correcting Biases in Long-Term Ocean Observatory Time Series: Case Study on Current Directions Estimated From Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler Data|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/mts/mtsj/2016/00000050/00000003/art00016|journal=Marine Technology Society Journal|volume=50.3 (2016)|pages=109-113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13155">'''Carbon nanotube springs''' are springs made of [[carbon nanotube]]s (CNTs). They are an alternate form of high density, lightweight, reversible  energy storage based on the elastic deformations of CNTs. Many previous studies on the mechanical properties of CNTs have revealed that they possess high stiffness, strength and flexibility. The [[Young's modulus]] of CNTs is 1 TPa and they have the ability to sustain reversible tensile strains of 6%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elastic strain of freely suspended single-wall carbon nanotube ropes|journal= Applied Physics Letters|volume=74|pages=3803–3805|year=1992|url=http://cohesion.rice.edu/naturalsciences/smalley/emplibrary/apl74-3803.pdf|doi=10.1063/1.124185|bibcode=1999ApPhL..74.3803W|last1=Walters|first1=D. A.|last2=Ericson|first2=L. M.|last3=Casavant|first3=M. J.|last4=Liu|first4=J.|last5=Colbert|first5=D. T.|last6=Smith|first6=K. A.|last7=Smalley|first7=R. E.|issue=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mechanical springs based on these structures are likely to surpass the current energy storage capabilities of existing steel springs and provide a viable alternative to electrochemical batteries. The obtainable energy density is predicted to be highest under tensile loading, with an energy density in the springs themselves about 2500 times greater than the energy density that can be reached in steel springs, and 10 times greater than the energy density of lithium-ion batteries.

The process of elastic energy storage in a CNT involves deforming it under an applied load. On removal of the applied load the energy released from the CNT can be used to perform mechanical work. A CNT has the ability to deform reversibly and a spring made from it can undergo repeated charge-discharge cycles without fatigue.

A CNT spring can store elastic strain energy with a density several orders of magnitude higher than conventional springs made of steel. Strain energy density in a material is proportional to the product of its Young's modulus and the square of the applied strain.

When [[Carbon nanotube#Multi-walled|multi-walled nanotubes]] (MWCNTs) are loaded, the majority of the applied load is borne by the outer shell. Owing to this limited load transfer between the different layers of MWCNTs, [[single walled nanotube]]s (SWCNTs) are more useful structural materials for springs.

==Energy storage in CNT springs==
Springs for energy storage can be made of SWCNTs or MWCNTs arranged in dense bundles of long, aligned tubes called 'forests' of CNTs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Storing elastic energy in carbon nanotubes |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ajohnh/mechanosyn/publications/files/032_hill_09_tensile.pdf |doi=10.1088/0960-1317/19/9/094015 |journal=Micromechanics and Microengineering |volume=20 |pages=104012–104019 |year=2010 |last1=Hill |first1=F A |last2=Havel |first2=T F |last3=Hart |first3=A J |last4=Livermore |first4=C |issue=9 |bibcode=2009JMiMi..19i4015H }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; that are grown by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). The 'forests' can grow to heights of up to 6mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Characterizing the failure processes that limit the storage of energy in carbon nanotube springs under tension |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~ajohnh/mechanosyn/publications/files/046_hill_10_springs2.pdf |doi=10.1088/0960-1317/20/10/104012 |journal=Micromechanics and Microengineering |volume=19 |pages=94015–94020 |year=2009 |last1=Hill |first1=F A |last2=Havel |first2=T F |last3=Hart |first3=A J |last4=Livermore |first4=C |issue=10 |bibcode=2010JMiMi..20j4012H }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A deformed CNT requires a support structure to carry the load of the spring prior to discharge. A mechanical spring must be coupled to external mechanisms to build a power source that is functionally useful. On its own a spring stores potential energy when an external force is applied to it but releases the energy in a single rapid burst once the force is removed. An effective power source needs to store energy over a period of time, release the energy only when needed and discharge the energy at a desired power level. A CNT based portable power source should have a basic architecture made of four main components: a CNT spring, a supporting structure for the spring, a generator-motor combination, and a coupling mechanism between the spring and the generator.

For CNTs arranged in groups/bundles called 'forests' as described earlier, efficient packing and good alignment in necessary between the tubes to achieve a high energy density. Good load transfer and effective attachment techniques are required so that the shells can be loaded to near their elastic limit.

Choosing the appropriate deformation mode consisting of any amongst axial tension, axial compression, torsion or bending or a combination of any of them. A criterion for choosing a deformation mode is not only the highest energy density but also the proper integration of the deformed spring with the rest of the power dissipation mechanism.

A support structure is required to hold the CNT spring in the fully loaded configuration prior to its release . The design of the support structure will depend on the scale of the spring, the deformation mode the CNT is being subjected to and the architecture of the rest of the system. The material selected for the structure should have high strength because the added mass and volume of the support contribute to reducing the energy density of the entire system.

==Energy storage calculations==

===Axial tension===

Analysis is performed on CNTs subject to tensile loads. A hollow cylindrical structure of CNT of length L, diameter d and mean radius r is considered. The tube has thickness n.h, where n is the number of layers in the CNT and h=0.34&amp;nbsp;nm is the thickness of one shell. The Young's modulus of the material of the CNT is E. In case of SWCNTs, n=1 and n&gt;1 in case of MWCNTs. The cylinder has inner and outer radii of

&lt;math&gt; r_i = r - \frac{nh}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; r_o = r + \frac{nh}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The shell's cross-sectional area is

&lt;math&gt; A = \pi(r_o^2 - r_i^2) &lt;/math&gt;

and the total enclosed area is

&lt;math&gt; A_t = \pi r_o^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

The strain energy that can be stored in the bar under axial compression to a strain of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\,&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;U =\frac{1}{2} \iiint (\sigma_x\,\epsilon_x\,&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;math&gt;\, dx\, dy\, dz =\frac{1}{2}E\epsilon^2\ AL &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}E\epsilon^2\pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2) L &lt;/math&gt;

The strain energy density is simply the ratio of the strain energy and the enclosed volume. Therefore, in order for the strain energy density to be high the value of &lt;math&gt;A/A_t&lt;/math&gt; should be large. So, a spring in axial tension should consist of either SWCNTs with small diameters or uniformly loaded MWCNTs with densely packed shells to maximize &lt;math&gt;A/A_t&lt;/math&gt;.

The CNTs are arranged in groupings, generally bundles. The strain energy density must be reduced by a fill factor k to account for the spacing between the individual CNTs.

Consider the cross-section of a bundle of closely packed SWCNTs of radius r, arranged into a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant of 2r+h. Ideal packing is assumed with a spacing of h=0.34&amp;nbsp;nm which is taken equal to the graphitic spacing. When the CNTs are arranged in a bundle the best packing fraction is produced when they are packed in a hexagonal closed packed structure.

Consider a cross section of one bundle. A hexagonal shape will be observed. The hexagonal shape with an area of &lt;math&gt; A_h&lt;/math&gt; is taken to be the repeating geometrical unit in the bundle. Calculations can be performed to show that fill factor k = 91%. In reality, there may not be ideal packing within a bundle, as the actual fraction k may be lower than the value calculated.

The expression of strain energy shows that it is advantageous to apply a high tensile strain to the springs to maximize energy storage since strain energy is proportional to square of the strain.

===Axial compression===

Analysis is performed on CNTs subject to compressive loads. The CNT is assumed to be a hollow cylindrical beam of length L, Young's modulus E, and thickness n.h, where n is the number of layers and h=0.34&amp;nbsp;nm is the thickness of one shell(taken equal to the separation between [[graphene]] sheets in [[graphite]]). The continuous tube has a mean radius r and diameter d. The cylinder has inner and outer radii of

&lt;math&gt; r_i = r - \frac{nh}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt; r_o = r + \frac{nh}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The shell's cross-sectional area is

&lt;math&gt; A = \pi(r_o^2 - r_i^2) &lt;/math&gt;

and the total enclosed area is

&lt;math&gt; A_t = \pi r_o^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

The strain energy that can be stored in the bar under axial compression to a strain of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\,&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;U =\frac{1}{2} \iiint (\sigma_x\,\epsilon_x\,&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;math&gt;\, dx\, dy\, dz =\frac{1}{2}E\epsilon^2\ AL &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}E\epsilon^2\pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2) L &lt;/math&gt;

The strain energy density is just the strain energy divided by the enclosed volume.
High energy densities are achieved with a high &lt;math&gt;A/A_t&lt;/math&gt; ratio. Therefore, in order for CNT springs to achieve a high energy density either SWCNTs with small diameters or MWCNTs with densely packed shells should be used.

==Support structure==

The purpose of using a support structure is to be able to store energy before it is released for use. The support structure should be strong enough to support the applied load (used to compress the CNTs) without reaching failure itself. Another point of consideration is that the energy density of the combined spring and supporting structure is always lower than the energy density of the spring alone.

==Energy density comparison==

A CNT spring made of bundles of densely packed 1&amp;nbsp;nm diameter SWCNTs stretched to a 10% strain is predicted to have an energy density of 3.4{{e|6}} kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The energy density of CNT springs loaded in tension is higher than the energy density of CNT springs loaded in compression.&lt;ref name=th&gt;Hill, F.A. [http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/44887 ''Energy Storage in Carbon Nanotube Super-Springs''], MIT Thesis (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the current maximum energy density of a carbon-steel watch spring is reported to be between 1080 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Madou|first=M.|title=Fundamentals of Microfabrication|year=2002|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=0-8493-0826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3000 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alangesoehne.com/en/watches/lange_31_movement.php?ID=cc332d1a2ea3b999fd38407 Advertised specifications for A. Lange &amp; Soehne's 31-day watch]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. alangesoehne.com&lt;/ref&gt; Calculations show that when a support structure made of single crystal silicon carbide is used the energy density of CNT springs reduces to 1{{e|6}} kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Even after considering a support structure and other energy extraction hardware associated with a CNT spring energy harvesting device, its energy density is much greater than mechanical springs and is in approximately the same range as that of lithium-ion batteries. The energy density is much lower than the energy density of any hydrocarbon used in combustion processes.

==Failure processes that limit energy storage==

A large number of CNTs are needed to store a significant amount of energy that can be used for macroscopic processes. In order to achieve such a large amount of energy storage the CNT springs must maintain high stiffness and elasticity. It is in practice quite difficult to have such high stiffness and elastic strains in yarns or fibers made up of assemblies of CNTs as they seldom maintain mechanical properties of an individual SWCNT. This behavior occurs due to atomic defects and imperfect organisation.

Elastic loading is the preferred loading mechanism for reversible energy storage, experiments have been performed that indicate that loading within the fibers deviates from purely elastic behavior.

Only a portion of the CNTs contribute to the load bearing at a given strain. The unequal amount of slack within each CNT due to the presence of atomic defects and tangling causes different CNTs to fracture at different strains.

When MWCNTs are loaded in tension it is difficult to grasp their inner shells. Tensile tests of MWCNTs attached to [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM) tips at both ends show that fracture occurs at the outer shell in a way such that majority loading occurs at the outer shell and little load transfer occurs to the inner shells. This causes the stiffness and strength of MWCNTs to be lower than they would be if the shells were loaded equally.

The '''Cascade Mountains leeward forests''' are a [[temperate coniferous forest]] [[ecoregion]] of [[North America]], as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) categorization system.

==Setting==
This is a band of mountain habitat running north-south along the leeward side of the [[Cascade Mountains]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States]], with the [[Okanagan Highland]] to the south on the US-Canada border and the [[Chilcotin Ranges]] to the north.&lt;ref name=wwf&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0507|name=Cascade Mountains leeward forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a varied mountain landscape of rugged, snowy peaks, glaciers and alpine meadows. In the southern ranges the temperature varies from {{convert|15|C}} in summer to {{convert|-3.5|C|sigfig=2}} in winter with the northern ranges 2–3&amp;nbsp;°C (4–5&amp;nbsp;°F) cooler.

==Flora==
Higher elevation [[subalpine]] slopes are home to Engelmann spruce (''[[Picea engelmannii]]''), subalpine fir (''[[Abies lasiocarpa]]'') and [[lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'') while lower [[montane forest]]s consist of lodgepole pine, quaking aspen (''[[Populus tremuloides]]''), white spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]'') and [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]].

==Fauna==
Wildlife of the mountains includes [[bighorn sheep]] (''Ovis canadensis''), [[mountain goat]] (''Oreamnos americanus''), [[grizzly bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') and [[American black bear|black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[black-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''), [[coyote]] (''Canis latrans'') and [[North American cougar|cougar]] (''Puma concolor couguar'')&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt; with smaller mammals such as the [[northern flying squirrel]]. The birds include [[spotted owl]], [[dusky grouse]] (''Dendragapus obscurus'') and a number of birds of prey. The [[Fraser River]] is particularly important for salmon and also acts as a barrier to the movement of wildlife within the region.

==Threats and preservation==
Most of this forest is still intact although threatened by logging, mining and other human intervention. Large blocks of [[intact forest]] include [[North Cascades National Park]] in Washington and the following areas of British Columbia; [[Big Creek Provincial Park]] and [[Spruce Lake Protected Area]], the [[Stein Valley Nlaka'pamux Heritage Park]], [[E. C. Manning Provincial Park]], [[Ts'il?os Provincial Park]], [[Cathedral Provincial Park and Protected Area]], [[Skagit Valley Provincial Park]], [[Marble Range Provincial Park]], [[Cascade Recreation Area]] and [[Edge Hills Provincial Park]] near [[Fraser Canyon]].

'''''Chamaecyparis obtusa''''' ('''Japanese cypress''', '''hinoki cypress'''&lt;ref name=BSBI07&gt;{{cite web|title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |archive-date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2014-10-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''hinoki'''; {{lang-ja|檜}} or {{lang|ja|桧}} ''{{transl|ja|hinoki}}'') is a species of [[cypress]] native to central [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=farjon&gt;{{cite book|author = Farjon, A.|year = 2005|title = Monograph of Cupressaceae and Sciadopitys|publisher = Royal Botanic Gardens|location = Kew|isbn = 1-84246-068-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforthc&gt;{{cite book|author = Rushforth, K.|year = 1987|title = Conifers|publisher = Helm|isbn = 0-7470-2801-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a slow-growing [[tree]] which grows to 35 m tall with a trunk up to 1 m in diameter. The bark is dark red-brown. The [[leaf|leaves]] are scale-like, 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm long, blunt tipped (obtuse), green above, and green below with a white stomatal band at the base of each scale-leaf. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose, 8–12&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, with 8–12 scales arranged in opposite pairs. The related ''[[Chamaecyparis pisifera]]'' (sawara cypress) can be readily distinguished in its having pointed tips to the leaves and smaller cones.&lt;ref name=farjon/&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforthc/&gt;

== Spreading and uses ==
[[Image:Chamaecyparis obtusa2.jpg|left|thumb|Foliage; underside showing white stomatal lines]]
The plant is widespread in Japan. A similar cypress found on [[Taiwan]] is treated by different botanists as either a variety of this species (as ''Chamaecyparis obtusa'' var. ''formosana'') or as a separate species ''[[Chamaecyparis taiwanensis]]''; it differs in having smaller cones (6–9&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) with smaller scales, and leaves with a more acute apex.&lt;ref name=farjon/&gt;&lt;ref name=rushforthc/&gt;

It is grown for its very high quality timber in Japan, where it is used as a material for building [[palace]]s, [[temple]]s, shrines, traditional ''[[noh]]'' theatres, baths, [[table tennis]] blades and [[Masu (Japanese)|masu]].  The wood is lemon-scented, light pinkish-brown, with a rich, straight grain, and is highly rot-resistant.

For example, [[Horyuji]] Temple and [[Osaka Castle]] are built from hinoki wood. The hinoki grown in [[Kiso River|Kiso]], used for building [[Ise Shrine]], are called 御神木 ''go-shin-boku'' "divine tree".

It is also a popular ornamental tree in parks and gardens, both in Japan and elsewhere in [[temperate]] climates, including western Europe and parts of North America. A large number of [[cultivar]]s have been selected for garden planting, including dwarf forms, forms with yellow leaves, and forms with congested foliage. It is also often grown as [[bonsai]].

Hinoki wood is used as a traditional Japanese stick incense for its light, earthy aroma.

Hinoki (and [[sugi]]) pollen is a major cause of [[hay fever in Japan]].{{Clear left}}

==Cultivars==
Over 200 [[cultivar]]s have been selected, varying in size from trees as large as the wild species, down to very slow-growing dwarf plants under {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} high.

[[File:Biome_map_13.svg|thumb|right|250px|Extent of deserts and xeric shrublands]]
'''Deserts and xeric shrublands''', also referred to as "desert scrub," or "desert scrublands," are a [[biome]] characterized by receiving only a small amount of moisture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/xeric Merriam-Webster.com] Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition of xeric&lt;/ref&gt;  usually defined as less than 250&amp;nbsp;mm of annual precipitation. They form the second-largest terrestrial biome (after [[Taiga]]), covering 19% of [[Earth]]'s land surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockwood|first=M.|title=Managing Protected Areas: A Global Guide|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Biodiversity'':  Deserts and xeric shrublands may have a very diverse and rich flora. Reptile fauna may also be very diverse with pronounced local [[endemism]] in some regions.

''Minimum resources'':  Many species track seasonally variable and patchy resources and require large natural landscapes to persist. Available water sources and [[riparian habitat]]s are critical for the persistence of many species.

''Poor soils'':  Because biomass productivity is low, the litter layer is almost nonexistent and the organic content of surface soil layers is very low. Also, evaporation tends to concentrate salts at the soil surface.

''Sensitivity to disturbance'':  As the desert is highly sensitive to grazing, soil disturbance, burning, plowing, and other cover alteration; restoration potential can be very low and regeneration very slow. The introduction of exotic species may be a serious problem.

==Desertification==
{{Main article|Desertification}}
The conversion of productive [[drylands]] to desert conditions, known as [[desertification]], can occur from a variety of causes. One is human intervention, including intensive agricultural tillage or overgrazing&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Overgrazing "Overgrazing"]. ''Encyclopedia of Earth''. Sidney Draggan, topic ed.; Cutler J. Cleveland, ed., National council for Science and the Environment, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; in areas that cannot support such exploitation. Climatic shifts such as [[global warming]] or the [[Milankovitch cycle]] (which drives [[Glacial period|glacials]] and [[interglacial]]s) also affect the pattern of deserts on Earth.

A '''dry punch''' is [[meteorology|meteorological]] slang for a [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]] or [[Mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] process. A dry punch at the surface results in a [[dry line]] bulge. A dry punch aloft above an area of warm, moist (buoyant) air at low levels often increases the potential for severe [[thunderstorm]]s.

[[File:Ritten (61).JPG|thumb|Pyramids in Autumn, as seen from Nicholas chapel]]
The '''[[Hoodoo (geology)|earth pyramids]]''' in [[South Tyrol]] are a special natural phenomenon that comes about in particular terrain, usually after a landslide or an unhinging of the earth.

The main cause of the formation of earth pyramids is the continuous alternation of periods of torrential rain and
drought. These phenomena, in particularly friable terrain, over the years, increasingly erode the ground and form such earth pyramids. Usually the pyramids are formed in terrain very well sheltered from wind so that they cannot be damaged by it.

Moreover, the life of the earth pyramids is strongly dependent on the climate which reigns during the time in which it is shaped by the rock that covers it.

There are several earth pyramids that can be safely visited. Among the most famous and admired the
following are the most outstanding:
* the [[earth pyramids of Ritten]], a [[plateau]] above [[Bolzano]], which are divided into three distinct groups near the villages Klobenstein, Oberbozen, and Unterinn;
* the [[earth pyramids of Platten]] near [[Percha]] in the [[Puster Valley]].

Other, less famous, earth pyramids are:
* in [[Terenten]], [[Puster Valley]];
* in [[Mölten]];
* in [[Jenesien]] near Bolzano;
* in the hinterland of [[Merano]]: in [[Tirol, South Tyrol|Tirol]], [[Kuens]], and [[Riffian, South Tyrol|Riffian]];
* in [[Karneid]] and Steinegg, one of its hamlets.
* in Neustift in the Rigger valley.
* in [[Segonzano]] in the Cembra valley in the adjoinig province Trentino (not South Tyrol any more).

A variety of [[symbol]]s or iconographic conventions are used to represent '''[[:wikt:Earth|Earth]]''', either in the sense of [[Earth|planet Earth]], or the [[world|inhabited world]]. Representations of the [[globe]] of Earth, either with an indication of the shape of the [[continents]] or with a representation of [[longitude|meridians]] and [[Latitude|parallels]] remains a common pictographic convention to express the notion of "worldwide, global". The modern [[astronomical symbol]] for Earth as a [[planet]] uses either a stylized [[globus cruciger]] ({{resize|150%|♁}}) or a circle with a cross (representing the equator and one meridian; ({{resize|150%|🜨}}).&lt;ref name=penny-cyclopaedia&gt;{{cite book| title = The Penny cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge | volume = 22 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rJhOFg1yiqUC&amp;pg=PA197| publisher = C.

==History==

[[File:Diagrammatic T-O world map - 12th c.jpg|thumb|12th-century T-and-O representation of the world.]]

The earliest type of symbols are [[allegory|allegories]], personifications or deifications, mostly in the form of an [[Earth goddess]] (in the case of [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian mythology]] a god, [[Geb]]).

&lt;div&gt;Before the recognition of the [[spherical Earth|spherical shape]] of the Earth in the [[Hellenistic period]], the main attribute of the Earth was its being ''flat''. The [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] for "earth, land" depicts a stretch of flat alluvial land with grains of sand ([[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner]] N16  &lt;hiero&gt;N16&lt;/hiero&gt;). Similarly, the Sumerian [[cuneiform|cuneiform sign]] for "earth" [[KI (cuneiform)|KI]] ({{resize|150%|𒆠}} U+121A0) originates as a picture of a "threshing floor". &lt;/div&gt;

The [[Earth (classical element)|classical element]] "Earth" is represented by the trigram of three broken lines in the [[I Ching]] ({{resize|150%|☷}} U+2637). The Western (early modern) [[alchemical symbol]] is a downward-pointing triangle bisected by a horizontal line.
Other symbols for the earth in alchemy or mysticism include the square and the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi, Jolande, ''Complex/Archetype/Symbol In The Psychology Of C G Jung'', Routledge (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=p8FdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=P146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 146],  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=p8FdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q=earth&amp;f=false 169].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]], the [[globe]], a representation of the spherical Earth, became the main symbol representing the concept.
The globe depicted the "universe" (pictured as the [[celestial sphere]]) as well as the Earth.
The [[globus cruciger]] is the globe surmounted by a [[Christian cross]], held by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Emperors]] on the one hand to represent the [[Christendom|Christian]] [[ecumene]], on the other hand the [[Akakia]] represented the mortal nature of all men.
In the medieval period, the [[Early world maps|known world]] was also represented by the [[T and O map|T-and-O]] figure, representing an extremely simplified [[world map]] of the three classical continents of the [[Old World]], viz. ''[[Western Asia|Asia]], [[Continental Europe|Europe]]'' and ''[[Ancient Libya|Africa]]''.

[[File:Alexandros mosaic Hagia Sophia.JPG|thumb|upright|Byzantine Emperor [[Alexander (Byzantine emperor)|Alexander]], holding the ''akakia'' in his left hand (on the righthand side of the image). Mosaic from the [[Hagia Sophia]].]]
Unicode  has introduced a four characters representing the "globe" in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]] block:
*EARTH GLOBE EUROPE-AFRICA  U+1F30D {{resize|&amp;#x1F30D;}}
*EARTH GLOBE AMERICAS  U+1F30E {{resize|&amp;#x1F30E;}}

'''Ecotechnology''' - not to be confused with [[ecotechnics]] - is an [[applied science]] that seeks to fulfill [[human]] needs while causing minimal ecological disrupution, by harnessing and manipulating natural forces to leverage their beneficial effects. Ecotechnology integrates two fields of study: the '[[ecology]] of technics' and the 'technics of ecology,' requiring an understanding of the structures and processes of [[ecosystems]] and societies. All [[sustainable engineering]] that can reduce damage to ecosystems, adopt ecology as a fundamental basis, and ensure conservation of [[biodiversity]] and sustainable development may be considered as forms of ecotechnology.

Ecotechnology emphasizes approaching a problem from a [[Holism|holistic]] point of view. For example, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of rivers should not only consider one single area. Rather, the whole [[Drainage basin|catchment area]], which includes the upstream, middle stream and downstream sections, should be considered.

Construction can reduce its impact on nature by consulting experts on the environment.

Sustainable development requires the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies which are both efficient and adapted to local conditions. Ecotechnology allows improvement in economic performance while minimizing harm to the environment by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Max|title=Eco-Friendly IT Solutions that Minimise Environmental Damage and Save Natural Resources|url=https://magora-systems.com/eco-friendly-it-solutions/|publisher=Magora|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increasing the efficiency in the selection and use of materials and energy sources,
* control of impacts on ecosystems,
* development and permanent improvement of cleaner processes and products,
* eco-marketing,
* introducing environmental management systems in the production and services sectors, and
* development of activities for increasing awareness of the need for environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development by the general public.

During ''Ecotechnics '95 - International Symposium on Ecological Engineering'' in [[Östersund]], [[Sweden]], the participants agreed on the definition: "Ecotechnics is defined as the method of designing future societies within ecological frames."

The '''Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas''' ('''ECPA''') was announced by U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] at the [[Summit of the Americas]] in April 2009. The ECPA is conceived as a flexible mechanism to accelerate [[sustainable energy]] in the [[Americas]]. ECPA is built upon seven pillars, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy poverty, cleaner and more efficient use of fossil fuels, infrastructure, sustainable land use and forestry, and adaptation.

A number of collaborative initiatives form the core foundation of the ECPA. These include the following:

Envoys Program: aims at enabling the sharing of [[best practices]] and expertise in research, development, design and implementation of [[clean energy]] programs. Other activities include:

Lighting the Americas: Seeks to provide [[electricity]] to the 34 million people in Latin America who currently are without access.

U.S. Trade and Development Agency’s (USTDA) Clean Energy Exchange Program of the Americas: Brings nearly 50 [[Latin America]]n and [[Caribbean]] energy officials and project sponsors to the [[United States]] on a series of reverse [[trade mission]]s.

Low Carbon Communities of the Americas projects:

Caribbean Renewable Energy Strategy: Aims to enable countries to implement actions and strategies geared towards increasing the sustainability of their [[energy supply|energy supplies]] while reducing [[carbon emissions]] from the energy sector through the development and use of [[renewable energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] systems.

Dominica Wind Project: Seeks to prove the viability of small, distributed [[wind]] [[generation]] as an alternative to traditional, [[megawatt]]-class utility-scale [[turbine]]s.

Costa Rican Energy Efficiency Training Center:'' The center will train and certify professionals in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] technology and [[auditing]] procedures, and also help expand the technical knowledge and capabilities of the [[Central America]]n region on efficiency services and programs

Colombia Biomass Initiative: The objective is to develop a technological plan for use of [[agroindustry|agro-industrial]] [[Crop residue|residue]] [[biomass]] to produce energy.

Energy Innovation Center: Promotes and advances clean energy projects through mobilization of funding, knowledge dissemination and technical expertise.

Chile Renewable Energy Center: The long-term goal for the center is to serve as a tool and resource for the region.

==Seven Pillars==
'''Energy Efficiency:''' Promote best policy practices through assistance in developing building codes and other standards in the industrial and residential sectors, as well as training for energy audits.

'''Renewable Energy:''' Accelerate clean energy deployment via project support, policy dialogues, scientific collaboration, and the clean energy technology network.

'''Cleaner and More Efficient Use of Fossil Fuels:''' Promote clean energy technologies to reduce both conventional pollution and the carbon footprint of fossil fuels, as well as best practices on land use management.

'''Energy Infrastructure:''' Foster modernized, integrated, and more resilient energy infrastructure, particularly electrical grids and gas pipelines.

'''Energy Poverty:''' Target urban and rural energy poverty with strategies to promote sustainable urban development and improve access to modern clean energy services and appropriate technologies in rural areas that can improve public health and reduce fuel wood use that benefits forest management.

'''Regional energy integration:'''Promote regional energy coordination, cooperation, or harmonization (where feasible) and interconnection between and among countries in the Americas, in order to foster complementarity for the sustainable development of the Region.

'''Energy research and innovation:'''Encourage technological development of innovative systems that make renewable energy widely affordable and available, while fostering applied research based on country-specific needs.

==Electrical power==
Egypt is classified as having a “high power system size (24,700 MW installed generation capacity in 2010 with more than 40 grid-connected plants).”  As of 2010, 99% of the Egyptian population has access to electricity.&lt;ref name="Power Market Structure" /&gt;

===History===
When electricity was first introduced in Egypt in 1893, the generation and distribution of electricity was practiced exclusively by private companies.  In 1962, the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity were nationalized under three authorities (the Electricity Production Authority, the Electricity Distribution Authority, and the Electricity Projects Implementation Authority) leaving the government as the sole owner and operator of all electrical companies.&lt;ref name="MOEE Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of Electricity in Egypt|url=http://www.moee.gov.eg/english_new/history2.aspx|website=Arab Republic of Egypt Ministry of Electricity and Energy|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egypt ERA Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity in Egypt|url=http://egyptera.org/en/curr_egy.aspx|website=Egyptian Electric Utility And Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three authorities were replaced in 1965 by the public Egyptian Corporation for Electricity which remained active until 1976 when it was converted into the Egypt Electricity Authority as decreed by electricity sector Law no. 12.&lt;ref name="Egypt ERA Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laws&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity Legislation|url=http://egyptera.org/en/kwaneen_lwaye7.aspx|website=Egyptian Electric Utility And Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 the Egypt Electricity Authority supervised the establishment of seven geographically divided electricity distribution companies.&lt;ref name="MOEE Timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Egypt ERA Timeline" /&gt; An additional electrical power distribution authority was established in 1983 as a means of supervising distribution companies which had become independent of the Egypt Electricity Authority.&lt;ref name="MOEE Timeline"/&gt;

Between 1996 and 2000 a series of laws and presidential decrees were passed to reorganize and regulate the growing electrical industry.

*1996: Electricity sector Law no. 100 was issued, opening up the industry by allowing for the construction, operation, and maintenance of electric generation stations by both local and foreign investors.&lt;ref name="Egypt ERA Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laws /&gt;
*1997: The Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency was established under presidential decree no. 326 to regulate, supervise, and monitor the relation between the associated electric utility parties.&lt;ref name="Egypt ERA Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Decree&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishment Decree|url=http://egyptera.org/en/const_act.aspx|website=Egyptian Electric Utility And Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1998: Electricity sector Law no. 18 was issued declaring that all generation stations and the high voltage network were to be affiliate to the distribution companies which, in turn, were to be affiliate to the Egyptian Electricity Authority rather than the business sector.&lt;ref name="Egypt ERA Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laws /&gt; 
*2000: presidential decree no. 339 and electricity sector Law no. 164 were issued.  Presidential decree no. 339 reorganized the Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency while electricity sector Law no. 164 enacted the conversion of The Egyptian Electricity Authority to a contribution company called the Egyptian Electric Holding Company (EEHC).&lt;ref name="Egypt ERA Timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laws /&gt;&lt;ref name=Decree /&gt;

Between 2000 and 2001, the EEHC implemented a division in the organization of Egypt’s electrical management framework.  Generation (production) activity was separated from distribution activity along with the separation of control and transmission between ultra-high-voltage and high-voltage networks.&lt;ref name="Egypt ERA Timeline" /&gt; This division rearranged the industry to consist of 13 companies: one company for electricity transmission, one company for hydroelectric power production, four companies for thermal power production, and seven companies for electricity distribution.  In 2002 the Delta Company for electricity distribution divided into North Delta and South Delta increasing the number of companies to 14. In 2004 the Cairo company for electricity distribution divided into North Cairo and South Cairo in addition to the Delta company for electricity production dividing into three companies: East Delta, Middle Delta and West Delta.&lt;ref name="MOEE Timeline" /&gt;

Currently there are 16 companies affiliated with the EEHC that make up the Egyptian electric utility system:&lt;ref name="Annual Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian electricity holding company annual reports|url=http://www.moee.gov.eg/english_new/EEHC_Rep/2011-2012.pdf|website=Arab Republic of Egypt Ministry of Electricity and Energy|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Distribution companies: North Cairo, South Cairo, Alexandria, Canal, North Delta, South Delta, El- Behera, Middle Egypt, and Upper Egypt Electricity Distribution Companies
*Production companies: The production companies are made up of Cairo, East Delta, Middle Delta, West Delta, Upper Egypt, and Hydro Plants Electricity Production Companies
*Transmission company:  Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company

====Regional coordination====
A US$239&amp;nbsp;million electricity network link with [[Jordan]] was completed in 1998. In late 2002 Egypt announced that it would coordinate a regional energy distribution center to coordinate energy distribution among the nations of the region, including Egypt, Jordan, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Morocco]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

====System issues====
Since the early 2000s, power outage rates and durations as well as distribution system losses have trended downwards indicating that distribution companies have improved their overall customer service quality over the past decade; however, Egypt has seen a great weakening in its supply security.  The power system’s generation reserve capacity declined from 20% in the early 2000s to 10% by the 2010s.  The Egyptian power system is now significantly less able to avoid power shortages during annual peak demand periods, which are typically the afternoons on the hottest days of the year.&lt;ref name="Power Market Structure"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vagliasindi|first1=Maria|last2=Besant-Jones|first2=John|title=Power Market Structure: Revisiting Policy Options|date=March 28, 2013|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|pages=161, 168|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/03/22/000445729_20130322120523/Rendered/PDF/761790PUB0EPI00LIC00pubdate03014013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weakening of Egypt’s supply security has caused widespread social issues in the 2010s.  To deal with the extremely high demand for electricity, rolling blackouts and power cuts were implemented throughout the summer of 2012 causing great tension between the government and the people of Egypt.  Angry residents from many villages protested the rolling blackouts by threatening to not pay their electricity bills and to sue their electricity provider.  A campaign entitled “We Will Not Pay” was organized to encourage people to not pay their bills until the electrical service was stable once again.  Residents from the Bardeen village in Zagazig also protested the unstable supply of electricity by blocking the Belbeis-Zagazig road.  The government released statements encouraging people to ration their electricity consumption and announced that work was being done to generate an additional 1800 MW of energy.  Minister of Petroleum Abdullah Ghorab reiterated the importance of conserving electricity to avoid a state implemented policy of [[Rolling blackout|load shedding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Youm|first1=Al-Masry|title=Rolling blackouts policy sparks anger across Egypt|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/rolling-blackouts-policy-sparks-anger-across-egypt|website=Egypt Independent|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crude oil==
[[File:Oil_refinery_at_lake_Mariout.jpg|thumb|280px|Oil refining in Alexandria]]
Egypt is an important non-[[OPEC]] energy producer.  It has the sixth largest proved oil reserves in Africa. Over half of these reserves are offshore reserves. Although Egypt is not a member of OPEC, it is a member  of the [[Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries]].&lt;ref name=wec76&gt;WEC, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial quantities of oil were first found in 1908, and more petroleum was found in the late 1930s along the [[Gulf of Suez]]. Later, large oil fields were discovered in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the Gulf of Suez, the Western Desert, and the Eastern Desert. The [[Abu Rudeis]] and [[Ra's Sudr]] oil fields in the Sinai, captured by [[Israel]] in 1967, were returned to Egyptian control in November 1975, and the remaining Sinai oil fields reverted to Egyptian control by the end of April 1982. {{as of|2005}}, Egypt's proven oil reserves were estimated at {{convert|3.7|Goilbbl}}, of which {{convert|2.9|Goilbbl}} was crude oil and {{convert|0.8|Goilbbl}} were [[natural gas liquids]].&lt;ref name=wec76/&gt;  Oil production in 2005 was {{convert|696000|oilbbl/d}}, (down from {{convert|922000|oilbbl/d}} in 1996), of which crude oil accounted for {{convert|554000|oilbbl/d}}.&lt;ref name=wec76/&gt;

Approximately 50% of Egypt's oil production comes from the Gulf of Suez, with the Western Desert, Eastern Desert, and the Sinai Peninsula as country's three other primary producing areas. Domestic consumption was estimated at {{convert|564000|oilbbl/d}} in 2004. Net oil exports in that same year were estimated at {{convert|134000|oilbbl/d}}. The [[Suez Canal]] and the {{convert|322|km|mi|adj=on}} [[Sumed pipeline]] from the Gulf of Suez to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] are two routes for oil from the [[Persian Gulf]], which makes Egypt a strategic point of interest in world energy markets. Although the [[Suez Canal Authority]] (SCA) has deepened the canal so that it can accommodate the largest bulk freight carriers, the canal was deepened a further {{convert|20|m|ft}} in 2006 to accommodate [[very large crude carrier]]s (VLCCs).

{{as of|2005}}, Egypt operates nine refineries that are capable of processing crude oil at an estimated rate of {{convert|726250|oilbbl/d}}. The largest refinery is the El-Nasr facility located at Suez. It is able to process {{convert|146300|oilbbl/d}}. The National oil company is the [[Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation]].

Egypt is estimated to hold 12,446 mmbbl initial recoverable liquid reserves. After decades of production, it is estimated that the country has approximately 1,888.9 mmbbl recoverable oil remaining, as of January 2011. These figures indicate that 83% of Egypt’s recoverable oil reserves have been depleted.&lt;ref&gt;http://crudeoilpeak.info/23-of-egypt%E2%80%99s-oil-is-gone-20-years-after-its-peak&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://egyptoil-gas.com/features/liquid-production-a-look-at-the-past-present-and-future-of-egypts-liquid-reserves/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural gas==
[[File:Egypt natural gas fields and select infrastructure (43123546105).png|thumb|upright=1.3|Natural gas fields in Egypt]]
Major discoveries in the 1990s have given natural gas increasing importance as an energy source. {{As of|2005}}, the country's reserves of natural gas are estimated at {{convert|66|Tcuft}}, which are the third largest in Africa.&lt;ref name=wec176&gt;WEC, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;  Probable reserves have been placed at or more than {{convert|120|Tcuft}}. Since the early 1990s, significant deposits of natural gas have been found in the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]], in the [[Nile Delta]] and offshore from the Nile Delta. Domestic consumption of natural gas has also risen as a result of [[thermal power]] plants converting from oil to natural gas. Egypt's production of natural gas was estimated at {{convert|2000|Gcuft}} in 2013, of which almost {{convert|1900|Gcuft}} was domestically consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt: international energy data and analysis|url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=EGY|publisher=US Energy Information Administration|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural gas is exported by the [[Arab Gas Pipeline]] to the [[Middle East]] and in the future potentially to [[Europe]]. When completed, it will have a total length of {{convert|1200|km|mi|-1}}.&lt;ref name="ya-libnan"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[BP]] and [[Eni]], the Italian oil and gas company, together with [[Gas Natural Fenosa]] of Spain, built major liquefied natural gas facilities in Egypt for the export market, but the plants were largely idled as domestic gas consumption has soared.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/07/business/international/bp-signs-12-billion-deal-to-develop-natural-gas-in-egypt.html?_r=0 "BP Signs 12 Billion Deal to Develop Natural Gas in Egypt"]. 
''The New York Times'' 7 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, [[BP]] signed a $12 billion deal to develop natural gas in Egypt intended for sale in the domestic market starting in 2017.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; BP said it would develop a large quantity of offshore gas, equivalent to about one-quarter of Egypt's output, and bring it onshore for domestic consumers. Gas from the project, called West Nile Delta, was expected to begin flowing in 2017. BP said that additional exploration might double the amount of gas available. 

In September 2015, [[Eni]] announced the discovery of the [[Zohr Field|Zohr gas field]], largest in the Mediterranean. The field was estimated at around 30 trillion cubic feet (850×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; m³) of total gas in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eni.com/en_IT/media/press-releases/2015/08/Eni_discovers_supergiant_gas_field_in_Egyptian_offshore_the_largest_ever_found_in_Mediterranean_Sea.shtml|title=Eni discovers a supergiant gas field in the Egyptian offshore, the largest ever found in the Mediterranean Sea|publisher=[[Eni]] (press release)|date=30 August 2015|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/08/30/world/europe/ap-eu-italy-eni-gas-field.html?_r=0|title=Italy's Eni Finds 'Supergiant' Natural Gas Field Off Egypt|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 August 2015|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/30/eni-discovers-largest-known-mediterranean-gas-field|title=Eni discovers largest known gas field in Mediterranean |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=30 August 2015|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shale oil==
The Safaga-Quseir area of the [[Eastern Desert]] is estimated to have reserves equivalent about {{convert|4.5|Moilbbl}} of in-place [[shale oil]] and the Abu Tartour area of the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] is estimated to have about {{convert|1.2|Moilbbl}} of in-place shale oil.

==Oil shale==
[[Oil shale]] resources were discovered in the Safaga-Quseir area of the [[Eastern Desert]] in the 1940s. The oil shale in the Red Sea area could be extracted by [[Underground mining (soft rock)|underground mining]].  In the Abu Tartour are, oil shale could be mined as byproduct whilst mining for [[phosphate]]s. Oil shale in Egypt is foreseen as a potential fuel for the power generation.&lt;ref name=wec107&gt;WEC, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear power==
Egypt has been considering the use of nuclear energy for decades: in  1964, a 150 MWe and in 1974 a 600 MWe, nuclear power stations were proposed. The Nuclear Power Plants Authority (NPPA) was established in 1976, and in 1983 the El Dabaa site on the Mediterranean coast was selected.&lt;ref name="Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries|url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Others/Emerging-Nuclear-Energy-Countries/|website=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Egypt's nuclear plans, however, were shelved after the [[Chernobyl accident]]. In 2006, Egypt announced it would revive its civilian nuclear power programme, and build a 1,000 MW [[El Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power station at El Dabaa]]. Its estimated cost at the time was US$1.5bn, and the plans were to do the construction with the help of foreign investors.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;

==Renewable energy==
The current energy strategy in Egypt (adopted by the Supreme Council of Energy in February 2008) is to increase renewable energy generation up to 20% of the total mix by 2020.&lt;ref name="Clean Energy Development in Egypt" /&gt;

===Hydropower===
[[File:Aswan Dam.jpg|thumb|Power plant of the Aswan High Dam, with the dam itself in the background]]
The majority of Egypt’s electricity supply is generated from thermal and hydropower stations.&lt;ref name="Clean Energy Development in Egypt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Razavi|first1=Hossein|title=Clean Energy Development in Egypt|date=2012|url=http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Policy-Documents/Cata%20Energie%20Anglais.pdf|publisher=African Development Bank (AfDB) Group|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The four main hydroelectric generating stations currently operating in Egypt are the [[Aswan Low Dam#Power Plants|Aswan Low Dam]], the [[Esna Dam]], the [[Aswan Dam#Electricity production|Aswan High Dam]], and the [[Naga Hamady Barrages]]. The [[Assiut Barrage#The Planned New_Dam|Asyut Barrage hydropower plant]] is scheduled to be commissioned and added as a fifth station in 2016.&lt;ref name="Egypt's Energy Outlook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gawdat|first1=Bahgat|title=Egypt’s Energy Outlook: Opportunities and Challenges|journal=Mediterranean Quarterly|date=2013|volume=24|pages=12–37|doi=10.1215/10474552-1895367|url=http://mq.dukejournals.org/content/24/1/12.full.pdf+html|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all hydroelectric generation in Egypt comes from the Aswan High Dam.  The Aswan High Dam has a theoretical generating capacity of 2.1GW; however, the dam is rarely able to operate at full design capacity due to low water levels.  An ongoing refurbishment program is being enacted to not only increase the generating capacity of the dam to 2.4GW, but also extend the operational life of the turbines by about 40 years.&lt;ref name="Clean Energy Development in Egypt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Renewable energy sources"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ibrahim|first1=A|title=Renewable energy sources in the Egyptian electricity market: A review|journal=Renewable &amp; Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=2012|volume=16|issue=1|pages=216–230|url=http://bl3fb4ht9x.search.serialssolutions.com/?genre=article&amp;issn=13640321&amp;title=Renewable%20&amp;%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Reviews&amp;volume=16&amp;issue=1&amp;date=20120101&amp;atitle=Renewable%20energy%20sources%20in%20the%20Egyptian%20electricity%20market%3A%20A%20review.&amp;spage=216&amp;pages=216-230&amp;sid=EBSCO:Academic%20Search%20Complete&amp;au=Ibrahim,%20A.|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Egypt produced 156.6 TWh gross, of which 12.9 TWh came from hydroelectric generation.  The per capita consumption of electricity at the end of 2012 was 1910 kWh/yr, while Egypt’s hydropower potential in 2012 was about 3,664 MW.&lt;ref name="Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clean Energy Development in Egypt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Renewable energy sources" /&gt;  As of 2009-2013, hydropower made up about 12% of Egypt’s total installed power generation capacity – a small decline from 2006-2007 when hydropower made up about 12.8%.&lt;ref name="Clean Energy Development in Egypt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Egypt's Energy Outlook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Renewable energy sources" /&gt;  The percentage of hydropower energy is steadily declining due to all major conventional hydropower sites already having been developed with a limited potential for further increase in generating capacity.  Outside of the Aswan High Dam, the other hydropower sites are considered very modest and most new generation plants being built in Egypt are based on fossil fuels.&lt;ref name="Clean Energy Development in Egypt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Renewable energy sources" /&gt;  

Even with the addition of the Asyut Barrage hydropower plant in 2016, hydropower development in Egypt is still lagging as the existing and developed hydropower plants are no longer being constructed at a rate that can support the increasing electricity consumption in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Egypt's Energy Outlook"/&gt; The population of Egypt has increased by 14.3% in the five year period from 2004 to 2009 (OECD/World Bank). Every six months there are 1 million more Egyptians. Energy production grew by 36% between 2004 and 2009.&lt;ref name=IEA20116&gt;IEA Key World Energy Statistics [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2011/key_world_energy_stats.pdf 2011], [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf 2010], [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2009/key2009.pdf 2009], [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/key2006.pdf 2006] [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] October, crude oil p.11, coal p. 13 gas p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The only remaining significant hydropower site that is currently undeveloped is the [[Qattara Depression]]. Several schemes have been proposed through the years to implement a [[Qattara Depression Project]]. None of which have been executed due to prohibitive capital costs and technical difficulties. Depending on the generating scheme chosen the Qattara Depression could potentially generate anywhere from 670MW to 6800MW.

===Solar===
Egypt has a high solar availability. The total capacity of installed [[photovoltaic system]]s is about 4.5 MWp. They are used in remote areas for water pumping, desalination, rural clinics, telecommunications, rural village electrification, etc.&lt;ref name=wec404&gt;WEC, pp.403–404&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed large scale solar power project [[Desertec]] involves also Egypt. 

The country in some areas receives over 4,000 hours of sunshine per year which is among the highest quantities registered in the world. Due to the sharp population growth and a series of blackouts during the summer caused by shortage supply, Egyptian demand of solar energy is increasing. However, only 1% of the electricity is produced by solar energy. The main part of the solar energy available in the country derives from small/scale projects. The only big projects, up to 10MW, are constituted by hybrid solar/diesel solutions which are developed by the Emirati company, Masdar and [[Benban Solar Park]] which is the biggest solar installation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Egypt, Regulatory Challenges Overshadow Solar Energy Potential|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/egypt/economy/challenges-over-solar-energy/|website=Fanack.com|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Solar Park Shines a Light on Egypt’s Energy Potential|url=http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/news_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/news+and+events/news/cm-stories/benban-solar-park-egypt|website=[[International Finance Corporation]]|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind===
[[File:Wind turbine at Zaafarana by Hatem Moushir 5.JPG|thumb|Wind farm at Zaafarana]]
Egypt has a high potential for wind energy, especially in the Red Sea coast area. As of 2006, 230 MW of wind energy was installed, with additional 320 MW to be installed by 2009.&lt;ref name=wec499&gt;WEC, pp.409–499&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 430 MW of wind power were installed{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}.  Because the potential for hydroelectricity is largely utilized, the Supreme Council of Energy’s goal of increasing renewable energy to 20% by 2020 is expected to be reached predominantly through the development of wind power as solar remains too costly.  Wind power is expected to reach 12% (a power capacity of about 7200 MW) of total electricity output with hydro (100 MW of CSP power) and solar (1 MW of PV power) making up the remaining 8%.&lt;ref name="Clean Energy Development in Egypt"/&gt;

Dark areas denote periods where the polarity matches today's normal polarity; light areas denote periods where that polarity is reversed.]]

A '''geomagnetic reversal''' is a change in a planet's [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field]] such that the positions of [[magnetic north]] and [[magnetic south]] are interchanged (not to be confused with [[north pole|geographic north]] and [[south pole|geographic south]]). The [[Earth]]'s field has alternated between periods of ''normal'' polarity, in which the predominant direction of the field was the same as the present direction, and ''reverse'' polarity, in which it was the opposite. These periods are called ''[[chron]]s''.

There have been 183 reversals over the last 83 million years. The latest, the [[Brunhes–Matuyama reversal]], occurred 780,000 years ago, and may have happened very quickly, within a human lifetime.&lt;ref name="quick"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, researchers reported a reversal lasting only 200 years.&lt;ref name="ES-20180821" /&gt;

A brief complete reversal, known as the [[Laschamp event]], occurred only 41,000 years ago during the [[last glacial period]]. That reversal lasted only about 440 years with the actual change of polarity lasting around 250 years. During this change the strength of the magnetic field weakened to 5% of its present strength.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121016084936.htm |title=Ice age polarity reversal was global event: Extremely brief reversal of geomagnetic field, climate variability, and super volcano |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012-10-16 |website=Sciencedaily.com |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |access-date=2013-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brief disruptions that do not result in reversal are called [[geomagnetic excursion]]s.

==History==
In the early 20th century, geologists first noticed that some volcanic rocks were magnetized opposite to the direction of the local Earth's field. The first estimate of the timing of magnetic reversals was made by [[Motonori Matuyama]] in the 1920s; he observed that rocks with reversed fields were all of early [[Pleistocene]] age or older. At the time, the Earth's polarity was poorly understood, and the possibility of reversal aroused little interest.&lt;ref name=Cox1973&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Allan|authorlink=Allan V. Cox|title=Plate tectonics and geomagnetic reversal|publisher=W. H. Freeman|date=1973|location=San Francisco, California|pages=138–145, 222–228|isbn=0-7167-0258-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glen&gt;{{cite book|last=Glen|first=William|title=The Road to Jaramillo: Critical Years of the Revolution in Earth Science|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|date=1982|isbn=0-8047-1119-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three decades later, when Earth's magnetic field was better understood, theories were advanced suggesting that the Earth's field might have reversed in the remote past. Most paleomagnetic research in the late 1950s included an examination of the wandering of the poles and [[continental drift]]. Although it was discovered that some rocks would reverse their magnetic field while cooling, it became apparent that most magnetized volcanic rocks preserved traces of the Earth's magnetic field at the time the rocks had cooled. In the absence of reliable methods for obtaining absolute ages for rocks, it was thought that reversals occurred approximately every million years.&lt;ref name=Cox1973 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Glen/&gt;

The next major advance in understanding reversals came when techniques for [[radiometric dating]] were developed in the 1950s. [[Allan V. Cox|Allan Cox]] and [[Richard Doell]], at the [[United States Geological Survey]], wanted to know whether reversals occurred at regular intervals, and invited the geochronologist [[Brent Dalrymple]] to join their group. They produced the first magnetic-polarity time scale in 1959. As they accumulated data, they continued to refine this scale in competition with Don Tarling and [[Ian McDougall (geologist)|Ian McDougall]] at the [[Australian National University]]. A group led by [[Neil D. Opdyke|Neil Opdyke]] at the [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory|Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory]] showed that the same pattern of reversals was recorded in sediments from deep-sea cores.&lt;ref name=Glen/&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s information about variations in the Earth's magnetic field was gathered largely by means of research vessels. But the complex routes of ocean cruises rendered the association of navigational data with [[magnetometer]] readings difficult. Only when data were plotted on a map did it become apparent that remarkably regular and continuous magnetic stripes appeared on the ocean floors.&lt;ref name=Cox1973 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Glen/&gt;

In 1963, [[Frederick Vine]] and [[Drummond Matthews]] provided a simple explanation by combining the [[seafloor spreading]] theory of [[Harry Hammond Hess|Harry Hess]] with the known time scale of reversals: new sea floor is magnetized in the direction of the then-current field. Thus, sea floor spreading from a central ridge will produce pairs of magnetic stripes parallel to the ridge.&lt;ref name=vine1963&gt;{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Anomalies over Oceanic Ridges|journal= Nature|date=1963|first=Frederick J.|last=Vine|author2=Drummond H. Matthews|volume=199|issue=4897|pages=947–949|doi= 10.1038/199947a0|bibcode=1963Natur.199..947V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian [[Lawrence Morley|L. W. Morley]] independently proposed a similar explanation in January 1963, but his work was rejected by the scientific journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'', and remained unpublished until 1967, when it appeared in the literary magazine ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]''.&lt;ref name= Cox1973/&gt; The [[Morley–Vine–Matthews hypothesis]] was the first key scientific test of the seafloor spreading theory of continental drift.&lt;ref name=Glen/&gt;

Beginning in 1966, Lamont–Doherty Geological Observatory scientists found that the magnetic profiles across the [[Pacific-Antarctic Ridge]] were symmetrical and matched the pattern in the north Atlantic's [[Reykjanes Ridge|Reykjanes ridge]]. The same magnetic anomalies were found over most of the world's oceans, which permitted estimates for when most of the oceanic crust had developed.&lt;ref name=Cox1973 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Glen/&gt;

==Observing past fields==
[[File:Geomagnetic polarity 0-169 Ma.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Geomagnetic polarity since the middle [[Jurassic]].  Dark areas denote periods where the polarity matches today's polarity, while light areas denote periods where that polarity is reversed.  The ''Cretaceous Normal'' superchron is visible as the broad, uninterrupted black band near the middle of the image.]]
Past field reversals can be and have been recorded in the "frozen" [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] (or, more accurately, [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]]) minerals of consolidated sedimentary deposits or cooled [[Volcano|volcanic]] flows on land.

The past record of geomagnetic reversals was first noticed by observing the magnetic stripe "anomalies" on the [[Oceanic crust|ocean floor]]. [[Lawrence Morley|Lawrence W. Morley]], [[Fred Vine|Frederick John Vine]] and [[Drummond Matthews|Drummond Hoyle Matthews]] made the connection to seafloor spreading in the [[Morley-Vine-Matthews hypothesis]]&lt;ref name= vine1963/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morley|first=Lawrence W.|author2=A. Larochelle|date=1964|title=Paleomagnetism as a means of dating geological events|series=Special|journal=Geochronology in Canada|publisher=Royal Society of Canada|volume=Publication 8|pages=39–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; which soon led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonics]]. The relatively constant rate at which the [[Seafloor spreading|sea floor]] spreads results in substrate "stripes" from which past magnetic field polarity can be inferred from data gathered from towing a [[magnetometer]] along the sea floor.

Because no existing unsubducted sea floor (or [[ophiolites|sea floor thrust onto continental plates]]) is more than about {{mya|180|million years}} ([[Ma (unit)|Ma]]) old, other methods are necessary for detecting older reversals. Most [[sedimentary rock]]s incorporate tiny amounts of iron rich [[mineral]]s, whose orientation is influenced by the ambient magnetic field at the time at which they formed. These rocks can preserve a record of the field if it is not later erased by [[Diagenesis|chemical, physical or biological change]].

Because the magnetic field is global, similar patterns of magnetic variations at different sites may be used to correlate age in different locations. In the past four decades much paleomagnetic data about seafloor ages (up to ~{{mya|250| Ma}}) has been collected and is useful in estimating the age of geologic sections. Not an independent dating method, it depends on "absolute" age dating methods like radioisotopic systems to derive numeric ages. It has become especially useful to metamorphic and igneous geologists where [[index fossil]]s are seldom available.

==Geomagnetic polarity time scale==
{{further|Magnetostratigraphy}}

Through analysis of seafloor magnetic anomalies and dating of reversal sequences on land, paleomagnetists have been developing a ''Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale'' (GPTS). The current time scale contains 184 polarity intervals in the last 83{{nbsp}}million years (and therefore 183 reversals).&lt;ref name=Cande&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/94JB03098|last=Cande|first=S. C.|last2=Kent|first2=D. V.|title=Revised calibration of the geomagnetic polarity timescale for the late Cretaceous and Cenozoic|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=100|pages=6093–6095|date=1995|bibcode=1995JGR...100.6093C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deeptow.whoi.edu/gpts.html|title=Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale|publisher=[[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]|work=Ocean Bottom Magnetometry Laboratory|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing frequency over time===
The rate of reversals in the Earth's magnetic field has varied widely over time. {{mya|72|million years ago (Ma)}}, the field reversed 5 times in a million years. In a 4-million-year period centered on {{mya|54| Ma}}, there were 10 reversals; at around {{mya|42| Ma}}, 17 reversals took place in the span of 3{{nbsp}}million years. In a period of 3{{nbsp}}million years centering on {{mya|24| Ma}}, 13 reversals occurred. No fewer than 51 reversals occurred in a 12-million-year period, centering on {{mya|15}}. Two reversals occurred during a span of 50,000 years. These eras of frequent reversals have been counterbalanced by a few "superchrons" – long periods when no reversals took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2001-03-02|title=When the Compass Stopped Reversing Its Poles|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|volume=291|issue=5509|pages=1714–1715|url=|doi=10.1126/science.291.5509.1714 |last=Banerjee|first=Subir K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superchrons===
A ''superchron'' is a polarity interval lasting at least 10{{nbsp}}million years. There are two well-established superchrons, the [[Cretaceous Normal]]  and the Kiaman. A third candidate, the Moyero, is more controversial. The [[Jurassic Quiet Zone]] in ocean magnetic anomalies was once thought to represent a superchron, but is now attributed to other causes.

The ''Cretaceous Normal'' (also called the ''Cretaceous Superchron'' or C34) lasted for almost 40{{nbsp}}million years, from about {{mya|120|83}}, including stages of the [[Cretaceous]] period from the [[Aptian]] through the [[Santonian]]. The frequency of magnetic reversals steadily decreased prior to the period, reaching its low point (no reversals) during the period. Between the Cretaceous Normal and the present, the frequency has generally increased slowly.&lt;ref name=Merrill&gt;{{cite book|last=Merrill|first= Ronald T.|last2=McElhinny|first2=Michael W.|last3=McFadden|first3=Phillip L.|title=The magnetic field of the earth: paleomagnetism, the core, and the deep mantle|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|date=1998|isbn=978-0-12-491246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ordovician]] is suspected to have hosted another superchron, called the ''Moyero Reverse Superchron'', lasting more than 20{{nbsp}}million years (485 to 463{{nbsp}}million years ago). Thus far, this possible superchron has only been found in the Moyero river section north of the polar circle in Siberia.&lt;ref name=Pavlov&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pavlov|first=V.|last2=Gallet|first2=Y.|title=A third superchron during the Early Paleozoic|journal=Episodes|publisher=International Union of Geological Sciences|volume=28|issue=2|pages=78–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the best data from elsewhere in the world do not show evidence for this superchron.&lt;ref name=McElhinny&gt;{{cite book|last= McElhinny|first=Michael W.|last2=McFadden|first2=Phillip L.|title=Paleomagnetism: Continents and Oceans|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|date=2000|isbn=0-12-483355-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain regions of ocean floor, older than {{mya|160|Ma}}, have low-amplitude magnetic anomalies that are hard to interpret. They are found off the east coast of North America, the northwest coast of Africa, and the western Pacific. They were once thought to represent a superchron called the ''Jurassic Quiet Zone'', but magnetic anomalies are found on land during this period. The geomagnetic field is known to have low intensity between about {{mya|130|Ma}} and {{mya|170|Ma}}, and these sections of ocean floor are especially deep, causing the geomagnetic signal to be attenuated between the seabed and the surface.&lt;ref name=McElhinny/&gt;

===Statistical properties of reversals===
Several studies have analyzed the statistical properties of reversals in the hope of learning something about their underlying mechanism. The discriminating power of statistical tests is limited by the small number of polarity intervals. Nevertheless, some general features are well established. In particular, the pattern of reversals is random. There is no correlation between the lengths of polarity intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J. D.|last2=Cox|first2=A.|title=Spectral analysis of geomagnetic reversal time scales|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International|Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=45|pages=19–33|date=1976|bibcode = 1976GeoJ...45...19P |doi = 10.1111/j.1365-246X.1976.tb00311.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no preference for either normal or reversed polarity, and no statistical difference between the distributions of these polarities. This lack of bias is also a robust prediction of [[dynamo theory]].&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt; 

There is no ''rate'' of reversals, as they are statistically random. The randomness of the reversals is inconsistent with periodicity, but several authors have claimed to find periodicity.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{cite journal|last=Raup|first=D. M. |year=1985 |title=Magnetic reversals and mass extinctions|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume= 314|pages=341–343|doi=10.1038/314341a0|bibcode = 1985Natur.314..341R }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these results are probably artifacts of an analysis using sliding windows to attempt to determine reversal rates.&lt;ref name="Lutz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lutz|first=T. M.|title=The magnetic reversal record is not periodic|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=317|pages=404–407|date=1985|doi=10.1038/317404a0|bibcode = 1985Natur.317..404L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most statistical models of reversals have analyzed them in terms of a [[Poisson process]] or other kinds of [[renewal process]]. A Poisson process would have, on average, a constant reversal rate, so it is common to use a non-stationary Poisson process. However, compared to a Poisson process, there is a reduced probability of reversal for tens of thousands of years after a reversal. This could be due to an inhibition in the underlying mechanism, or it could just mean that some shorter polarity intervals have been missed.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt; A random reversal pattern with inhibition can be represented by a [[gamma process]]. In 2006, a team of physicists at the [[University of Calabria]] found that the reversals also conform to a [[Lévy distribution]], which describes [[stochastic process]]es with long-ranging correlations between events in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2006/mar/21/geomagnetic-flip-may-not-be-random-after-all |title=Geomagnetic flip may not be random after all|work=physicsworld.com|date=March 21, 2006|last=Dumé|first=Belle|accessdate=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carbone|first= V.|last2=Sorriso-Valvo|first2=L.|last3=Vecchio|first3=A.|last4=Lepreti|first4=F.|last5=Veltri|first5=P.|last6=Harabaglia|first6=P.|last7=Guerra| first7 = I.|title=Clustering of Polarity Reversals of the Geomagnetic Field|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=96|issue= 12|page=128501|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.128501|bibcode=2006PhRvL..96l8501C|arxiv = physics/0603086|pmid=16605965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data are also consistent with a deterministic, but chaotic, process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaffin|first=S.|title=Analysis of scaling in the geomagnetic polarity reversal record|journal=[[Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors]]|volume=57|pages=284–289|date=1989|bibcode = 1989PEPI...57..284G |doi = 10.1016/0031-9201(89)90117-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character of transitions==

===Duration===
Most estimates for the duration of a polarity transition are between 1,000 and 10,000 years,&lt;ref name="Merrill"/&gt; but some estimates are as quick as a human lifetime.&lt;ref name="quick" /&gt;
Studies of 15-million-year-old lava flows on [[Steens Mountain]], Oregon, indicate that the Earth's magnetic field is capable of shifting at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|title=New evidence for extraordinarily rapid change of the geomagnetic field during a reversal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v374/n6524/abs/374687a0.html|journal=Nature|date=20 April 1995| doi= 10.1038/374687a0|last1=Coe|first1=R.

===Magnetic field===
The magnetic field will not vanish completely, but many poles might form chaotically in different places during reversal, until it stabilizes again.&lt;ref name="NASA_inconstant"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2003/29dec_magneticfield/|title=Earth's Inconstant Magnetic Field |accessdate=25 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glatzmaier&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.ucsc.edu/~glatz/geodynamo.html|title=The Geodynamo|last1=Glatzmaier|first1=Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnetic field of the Earth, and of other planets that have magnetic fields, is generated by [[dynamo theory|dynamo action]] in which [[convection]] of molten iron in the planetary core generates electric currents which in turn give rise to magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=Merrill/&gt; In [[Computational physics|simulations]] of planetary dynamos, reversals often emerge spontaneously from the underlying dynamics. For example, Gary Glatzmaier and collaborator Paul Roberts of [[UCLA]] ran a numerical model of the coupling between electromagnetism and fluid dynamics in the Earth's interior. Their simulation reproduced key features of the magnetic field over more than 40,000 years of simulated time and the computer-generated field reversed itself.&lt;ref name=selfconsistent&gt;{{cite news|last=Glatzmaier|first=Gary A.|last2=Roberts|first2=Paul H.|title=A three dimensional self-consistent computer simulation of a geomagnetic field reversal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=377|pages=203–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc.edu/science/glatzmaier.html|title= When North goes South|last1=Glatzmaier|first1=Gary|last2=Roberts|first2=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global field reversals at irregular intervals have also been observed in the laboratory [[liquid]] [[metal]] experiment "VKS2".&lt;ref name=VKSreversals&gt;{{cite news|last=Berhanu|first=M.|last2=Monchaux|first2=R.|last3=Fauve|first3=S.|last4=Mordant|first4=N.|last5=Petrelis|first5=F.|last6=Chiffaudel|first6=A.|last7=Daviaud|first7=F.|last8=Dubrulle|first8=B.|last9=Marie|first9=L.|last10=Ravelet|first10=F.|last11=Bourgoin|first11=M.|last12=Odier|first12=P.|last13=Pinton|first13=J.-F.|last14=Volk|first14=R.|title=Magnetic field reversals in an experimental turbulent dynamo|journal=[[Europhysics Letters|EPL]]|volume=77|page=59001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some simulations, this leads to an instability in which the magnetic field spontaneously flips over into the opposite orientation. This scenario is supported by observations of the [[solar magnetic field]], which undergoes spontaneous [[Solar cycle|reversals]] every 9–12 years. However, with the Sun it is observed that the solar magnetic intensity greatly increases during a reversal, whereas reversals on Earth seem to occur during periods of low field strength.&lt;ref name=Coe&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1098/rsta.2000.0578|last=Coe|first=Robert S.|last2=Hongré|first2=Lionel|last3=Glatzmaier|first3=Gary A.|title=An Examination of Simulated Geomagnetic Reversals from a Palaeomagnetic Perspective|journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences]]|volume=358|pages=1141–1170|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothesized triggers===
Some scientists, such as [[Richard A. Muller]], think that geomagnetic reversals are not spontaneous processes but rather are triggered by external events that directly disrupt the flow in the Earth's core. Proposals include [[impact events]]&lt;ref name= muller86&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|last2=Morris|first2=Donald E.|title=Geomagnetic reversals from impacts on the Earth|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=13|issue=11|pages=1177–1180|date=1986|doi=10.1029/GL013i011p01177|bibcode=1986GeoRL..13.1177M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muller2002&gt;{{cite journal|title=Avalanches at the core-mantle boundary|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|date=2002|first=Richard A.|page=1935|last=Muller|volume=29|issue=19|doi=10.1029/2002GL015938|bibcode=2002GeoRL..29.1935M}}&lt;/ref&gt; or internal events such as the arrival of continental slabs carried down into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] by the action of [[plate tectonics]] at [[Subduction|subduction zones]] or the initiation of new [[mantle plume]]s from the [[core-mantle boundary]].&lt;ref name=McFadden&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0031-9201(86)90118-4|last=McFadden|first=P.

Because the magnetic field is stable in either the present North-South orientation or a reversed orientation, they propose that when the field recovers from such a disruption it spontaneously chooses one state or the other, such that half the recoveries become reversals. However, the proposed mechanism does not appear to work in a quantitative model, and the evidence from [[stratigraphy]] for a correlation between reversals and impact events is weak. There is no evidence for a reversal connected with the impact event that caused the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merrill|first=R. T.|author2=McFadden, P. L.|title=Paleomagnetism and the Nature of the Geodynamo|journal=Science|date=20 April 1990|volume=248|issue=4953|pages=345–350|doi=10.1126/science.248.4953.345|bibcode = 1990Sci...248..345M|pmid=17784488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on biosphere==
Shortly after the first geomagnetic polarity time scales were produced, scientists began exploring the possibility that reversals could be linked to extinctions. Most such proposals rest on the assumption that the Earth's magnetic field would be much weaker during reversals. Possibly the first such hypothesis was that high energy particles trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] could be liberated and bombard the Earth.&lt;ref name=Glassmeier2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glassmeier|first=Karl-Heinz|author2=Vogt, Joachim|title=Magnetic Polarity Transitions and Biospheric Effects|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=29 May 2010|volume=155|issue=1–4|pages=387–410|doi=10.1007/s11214-010-9659-6|bibcode = 2010SSRv..155..387G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uffen|first=Robert J.|title=Influence of the Earth's Core on the Origin and Evolution of Life|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=13 April 1963|volume=198|issue=4876|pages=143–144|doi=10.1038/198143b0|bibcode = 1963Natur.198..143U }}&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed calculations confirm that if the Earth's dipole field disappeared entirely (leaving the quadrupole and higher components), most of the atmosphere would become accessible to high energy particles, but would act as a barrier to them, and cosmic ray collisions would produce secondary radiation of [[beryllium-10]] or [[chlorine-36]]. An increase of beryllium-10 was noted in a 2012 German study showing a peak of beryllium-10 in Greenland ice cores during a brief complete reversal 41,000 years ago which led to the magnetic field strength dropping to an estimated 5% of normal during the reversal.&lt;ref name="sciencedaily.com"/&gt; There is evidence that this occurs both during [[Geomagnetic secular variation|secular variation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McHargue|first=L.R|author2=Donahue, D |author3=Damon, P.E |author4=Sonett, C.P |author5=Biddulph, D |author6=Burr, G |title=Geomagnetic modulation of the late Pleistocene cosmic-ray flux as determined by 10Be from Blake Outer Ridge marine sediments|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|date=1 October 2000|volume=172|issue=1–4|pages=555–561|doi=10.1016/S0168-583X(00)00092-6|bibcode = 2000NIMPB.172..555M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumgartner|first=S.|title=Geomagnetic Modulation of the 36Cl Flux in the GRIP Ice Core, Greenland|journal=Science|date=27 February 1998|volume=279|issue=5355|pages=1330–1332|doi=10.1126/science.279.5355.1330|bibcode = 1998Sci...279.1330B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and during reversals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raisbeck|first=G.

Another hypothesis by McCormac and Evans assumes that the Earth's field disappears entirely during reversals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormac|first=Billy M.|author2=Evans, John E.|title=Consequences of Very Small Planetary Magnetic Moments|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=20 September 1969|volume=223|issue=5212|pages=1255–1255|doi=10.1038/2231255a0|bibcode = 1969Natur.223.1255M }}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the atmosphere of Mars may have been eroded away by the [[solar wind]] because it had no magnetic field to protect it. They predict that ions would be stripped away from Earth's atmosphere above 100&amp;nbsp;km. However, [[paleointensity]] measurements show that the magnetic field has not disappeared during reversals. Based on paleointensity data for the last 800,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guyodo |first=Yohan |last2=Valet |first2=Jean-Pierre |title=Global changes in intensity of the Earth's magnetic field during the past 800 kyr |journal=Nature |date=20 May 1999 |volume=399 |issue=6733 |pages=249–252 |doi=10.1038/20420 |bibcode = 1999Natur.399..249G }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[magnetopause]] is still estimated to have been at about 3 Earth radii during the [[Brunhes-Matuyama reversal]].&lt;ref name=Glassmeier2010/&gt; Even if the internal magnetic field did disappear, the [[solar wind]] can induce a magnetic field in the Earth's [[ionosphere]] sufficient to shield the surface from energetic particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=G.

Hypotheses have also advanced toward linking reversals to [[mass extinctions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raup|first=David M.|title=Magnetic reversals and mass extinctions|journal=Nature|date=28 March 1985|volume=314|issue=6009|pages=341–343|doi=10.1038/314341a0|bibcode = 1985Natur.314..341R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many such arguments were based on an apparent periodicity in the rate of reversals, but more careful analyses show that the reversal record is not periodic.&lt;ref name="Lutz" /&gt;
It may be, however, that the ends of superchrons have caused vigorous convection leading to widespread volcanism, and that the subsequent airborne ash caused extinctions.&lt;ref name="mantleplumes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Courtillot|first=V.|last2=Olson|first2=P.|title=Mantle plumes link magnetic superchrons to phanerozoic mass depletion events|journal=[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]]|date=2007|volume=260|pages=495–504|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.06.003|bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.260..495C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tests of correlations between extinctions and reversals are difficult for a number of reasons. Larger animals are too scarce in the fossil record for good statistics, so paleontologists have analyzed microfossil extinctions. Even microfossil data can be unreliable if there are hiatuses in the fossil record. It can appear that the extinction occurs at the end of a polarity interval when the rest of that polarity interval was simply eroded away.&lt;ref name=Merrill2010/&gt;  Statistical analysis shows no evidence for a correlation between reversals and extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plotnick|first=Roy E.|title=Relationship between biological extinctions and geomagnetic reversals|journal=Geology|date=1 January 1980|volume=8|issue=12|page=578|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1980)8&lt;578:RBBEAG&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1980Geo.....8..578P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glassmeier2010/&gt;

'''Gudenå''' or '''Gudenåen''' ({{IPA-da|ˈɡuːˀðn̩ˌɔːˀn̩|pron}}), is [[Denmark]]'s longest river and runs through the central parts of the [[Jutland]]ic peninsula. An anglicized version of the name often seen is 'The River Guden'.

Gudenåen has its [[spring (hydrology)|spring]] in Tinnet Krat, [[Vejle Municipality]] (between Nørre Snede and Tørring-Uldum) and flows a total of {{convert|176|km|mi}} to [[Randers Fjord]] in [[Randers]], on a northward course which takes it through the central parts of Jutland. On its way, the river traverses the relatively high lying region of [[Søhøjlandet]], through the lakes of [[Naldal Sø]], [[Vestbirk Sø]], [[Mossø]], [[Gudensø]], [[Rye Mølle Sø]], [[Birksø]], [[Julsø]], [[Borre Sø]], [[Brassø]], [[Silkeborg|Silkeborg Langsø]] and [[Sminge Sø]] before it empties in Randers Fjord; a long [[inlet]] of the [[Kattegat]] sea. It is fed by numerous streams and wetlands along the way.

Gudneåen came into existence some 15,000 years ago, at the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation|last Ice Age]], when melting ice and glacial streams carved out its bed. The river shelters many species of animals and parts of its run, is to be protected under the regulations of [[Natura 2000]].

The '''International Energy Centre''' (IEC) is a collaborative initiative established by three of Australia's leading universities ([[University of Western Australia]], [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] and [[University of Queensland]]), and foundation industry member Glencore Xstrata. IEC's vision is to create an established centre of excellence in thought leadership, postgraduate education and innovation management to support the transition to a sustainable low carbon world.

The Centre formed in 2011 with foundation sponsorship funding from [[Xstrata Coal]], a subsidiary of [[Xstrata]],&lt;ref name="XC"&gt;[http://sustainability.xstratacoal.com/Documents/SD_Report_2011_LR_CASE-STUDY.pdf Xstrata Sustainability Report], Xstrata Coal joined forces with three Australian universities.&lt;/ref&gt;(now Glencore Xstrata). The business model is based on the experience of the formation of the [[International Water Centre]], a joint venture between [[University of Western Australia]], [[University of Queensland]] (two of the three universities in the IEC) plus [[Griffith University]] and [[Monash University]].  Recently Glencore awarded scholarships to six Master of Energy Studies students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eco-business.com/press-releases/glencorexstrata-awards-six-scholarships-to-msc-energy-studies-students/ | title=GlencoreXstrata awards six scholarships to MSc Energy Studies students | work=Press Release | date=4 March 2014 | agency=Eco-Business | accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International health''', also called '''''geographic medicine''''', '''''[[international medicine]]''''', or '''''[[global health]]''''', is a field of [[health]] care, usually with a public health emphasis, dealing with health across regional or national boundaries. One subset of international medicine, [[travel medicine]], prepares travelers with immunizations, prophylactic medications, preventive techniques such as bednets and residual pesticides, in-transit care, and post-travel care for exotic illnesses. International health, however, more often refers to health personnel or organizations from one area or nation providing direct health care, or health sector development, in another area or nation. It is this sense of the term that is explained here. More recently, [[public health]] experts have become interested in global processes that impact on human health. [[Globalization and health]], for example, illustrates the complex and changing sociological environment within which the determinants of [[health]] and [[disease]] express themselves.

==International health governance==
The World Health Organization (WHO) is the international body primarily responsible for regulating and governing health-related policies and practices across nations. While the WHO uses various policies and treaties to address international health issues, many of their policies have no binding power and thus state compliance is often limited. As a result, a Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH) has recently been proposed as a global health treaty that would use stronger domestic accountability mechanisms (including incentives &amp; sanctions) in order to close national and global health inequities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhealthtreaty.org|title=FCGH - Framework  Convention for Global Health|website=www.globalhealthtreaty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars have addressed concerns regarding the FCGH, arguing that it would duplicate other global health governance efforts, lack feasibility, and have limited impact in regulating global health.&lt;ref&gt; S.J. Hoffman, J-A. Røttingen. 2013. "Dark Sides of the Proposed Framework Convention on Global Health's Many Virtues: A Systematic Review and Critical Analysis," Health &amp; Human Rights Journal 15(1): 117-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of NGOs==

Much work in international health is performed by [[non-governmental organizations]], or NGOs. Services provided by international health NGOs include direct health care, community potable water, vitamin supplementation, and mitigation of endemic and epidemic infectious diseases and malnutrition. Examples of NGOs dedicated to international health include:
* [[Pakistan Heart Foundation]]
* [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]]
* [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (''Doctors Without Borders'')
* The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]
* [[International Medical Corps]]
* [[Oxfam]]
* [[Partners in Health]]
* [[Project HOPE (USA)|Project HOPE]]
* [[Save the Children]]

==In harm's way==

These organizations often go in harm's way to provide services to people affected by natural disaster or conflict. For example, Médecins Sans Frontières has lost members in the [[Darfur]] area, and Care International's Iraq Director, [[Margaret Hassan]] (a long-time Iraq resident with dual Iraqi-British citizenship) was brutally murdered on the Internet by [[Al Qaeda]]-affiliated terrorists for the "crime" of providing services equitably among Iraqis. International Medical Corps was begun in response to the suffering of the Afghan people after the Soviet invasion of 1979, and is adept at providing services in dangerous places (see [[Attacks on humanitarian workers]]).

==The role of international health NGOs in international development==

Health-related NGOs also provide capacity development in areas of need; that is, helping nations develop sustainable domestic health solutions through training programs. An example of this type of aid is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080215182327/http://www.cirnetwork.org/content.cfm?id=5B&amp;newCommunity&amp;CFID=2167600&amp;CFTOKEN=29744944 Center for International Rehabilitation], which has provided rehabilitation training for Iraqi physical therapists, physicians, and rehabilitation clinic managers in Tuzla, Bosnia and Amman, Jordan. These trainees then care for amputees, spinal and head injury patients in their home country.

==NGOs vs. missionaries==

One important characteristic of NGO work is that, in the "pure" sense, they provide services based solely upon need, without political, ethnic, religious or other considerations. Thus, strictly speaking, religious [[missionary]] organizations that perform services as part of a proselytizing or evangelical campaign should be separated from the NGO category and simply be referred to as religious missionary organizations. Some religious relief organizations do provide services more as a duty or "charity", however, without requirements for the recipients to attend any preaching, prayer or other religious preconditions.ngo

==Harnessing the power of technology==

As NGO practice evolves parallel with technology, NGOs have developed more scientific and precise methods of assessment, planning and operations in humanitarian assistance and complex emergencies. One example is the [[Sphere Project]]'s  [https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181547/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response]. They have taken other new tools into the planning offices and field: in addition to the obligatory laptop computer, they typically rely heavily upon cellular and satellite communications, the Internet, and geographic information services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/IMToolbox/web/03_Map.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208124849/http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/IMToolBox/web/03_Map.html |archivedate=2008-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or GIS. These technological improvements allow them to better focus efforts in areas of need, respond to evolving crises, and predict future needs. Indeed, in a related effort, the [[United States Holocaust Museum]] teamed with [[Google Earth]] to establish baseline GIS photos of crisis-torn Darfur, updating them at intervals, and uploading them to the Internet for public access. Since Internet "surfers" can browse these images and see where once-present villages are later obliterated, this teamwork gave lie to the Sudanese claim that it was engaging in neither ethnic cleansing nor genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/googleearth/projects/darfur/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224130801/http://www.ushmm.org/googleearth/projects/darfur/ |archivedate=2007-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The U.S. Department of Defense==

In another teamwork effort, the [[S. Ward Casscells|Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)]] of the United States [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], as the DoD's senior medical officer, established the International Health Division[https://web.archive.org/web/20081224235922/http://fhp.osd.mil/intlhealth/] in late 2007 to help coordinate military health doctrine and practices in international development. The International Health Division places great emphasis upon working with NGOs to provide sustainable, culturally-appropriate development activities around the world. While critics maintain that DoD does not provide aid equitably and without regard to political influence, the Asian tsunami of December, 2004 (due to the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]) demonstrated that DoD was capable of working in a supporting role without regard to geopolitical gain. Indeed, the DoD was surprised at the unexpected degree of improvement in American prestige as a result of its role in Southeast Asia and months later, in the Pakistan earthquake. A similar event resulted in rapid mobilization of DoD resources in response to the [[2007 Peru earthquake]], Bangladeshi [[Typhoon]] Sidr&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/28/asia/AS-GEN-Bangladesh-Cyclone.php|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|publisher=|date=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tropical Storm]] Nero in the [[Dominican Republic]], all in the last half of 2007, with no reasonable expectation of material gain for America.

In 2005, then-Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] signed DoD Directive 3000.05, "Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction Operations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300005p.pdf|title=Directives Division|website=www.dtic.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document requires the DoD to assign Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction (SSTR) the same importance in planning and preparation as it gives to warfighting.

The rationale for SSTR is intuitive: stability promotes rule of law and economic development. These provide the base for essential services such as education, [[public health]] and [[sanitation]], law enforcement and fire suppression. Essential services, in turn, lead to increased stability and economic opportunity. Health in the general population, and in particular the labor force, is essential to productivity and consequent stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2007/pr11/en/|title=WHO - World Health Day 2007: International Health Security|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these relationships are not necessarily linear, and there is no inherent guarantee of equitable distribution of wealth in a developing society, full employment and hope for the future may be powerful disincentives to conflict. In this way, the DoD, through SSTR operations, expects to prevent some potential conflicts and criminal activities.

The International Health Division, charged with policy implications of DoDD 3000.05, is located within the Office of the ASD(HA), reporting through Force Health Protection &amp; Readiness. International Health develops DoD's policy on [[medical ethics]] and the practice of medicine in international health and development settings. International Health also identifies needs in developing nations and looks for [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs), intergovernmental organizations, and private voluntary organizations (PVOs) such as professional societies, that have the ability and expertise to address these problems. In this way, the NGOs develop helping relationships with the nations or regions they work in, fostering stability and sustainability.

Other DoD international health activities occurring on a regular basis include [[Civic action program|medical civic action projects]] (MEDCAPs), in which Army, Navy or Air Force medical assets provide direct care, sanitation, and other public health services to host nation (HN) locals. Such MEDCAPs are generally traced to the [[Vietnam war]], when medical units and medical personnel assigned to combat units would organize field medical care to Vietnamese, [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and others. There is a growing realization among the military that MEDCAP care may not be the best model, if the result is merely handing out antibiotics for upper respiratory infections and anti-inflammatories for aches and pains. However, projects such as de-worming, dentistry, prenatal education and care, and veterinary care, when performed in conjunction with HN health authorities and the local health infrastructure, have indisputable and long-lasting benefits to the recipients.

Similar to MEDCAPs, the military performs [[Civic action program|Medical Readiness Training Exercises]] (MEDRETEs), [[Joint Combined Exchange Training]] (JCET), and Humanitarian-Civic Action (HCA) exercises, all of which may have direct and indirect services as a feature of the training.

Finally, the military has unparalleled logistical and lift capabilities to respond to humanitarian assistance/disaster response(HADR) needs.

In conjunction with the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]] (USUHS), the  [http://www.cdham.org/ Center for Disaster and Humanitarian Medicine (CDHAM)] develops curriculum, teaches disaster and humanitarian assistance principles to graduate, medical, and post-doctoral students and publishes courses on incident command and other related topics. The handbook on military-NGO relations, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101110012445/http://fhp.osd.mil/intlhealth/pdfs/ngo_guidebook_S1.pdf "A Guide to Non-Governmental Organizations for the Military"] is available free on-line.

==The American College of Academic International Medicine==

Among more recent developments in the area, the formation of the [[American College of Academic International Medicine]] (ACAIM) provided a renewed impetus toward the consolidation and formalization of U.S. based coordination of [[Academic International Medicine]] (AIM) efforts across the multiple currently existing platforms [http://acaim.org//]. Since its inception, ACAIM galvanized the U.S. AIM community to action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijam-web.org/article.asp?issn=2455-5568;year=2016;volume=2;issue=2;spage=121;epage=126;aulast=Anderson|title=Mission statement for the American College of Academic International Medicine: Empowering individuals, nurturing wellness, promoting excellence, stimulating minds, striving for sustainability, and celebrating inclusion|publisher=MedKnow|date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the need for the formation of cross-disciplinary, bi-directional [[International Medical Programs]] (IMPs) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321386255_A_Comprehensive_Framework_for_International_Medical_Programs_A_2017_consensus_statement_from_the_American_College_of_Academic_International_Medicine|title=A Comprehensive Framework for International Medical Programs: A 2017 consensus statement from the American College of Academic International Medicine|date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that foster the sustainable development of AIM efforts while minimizing the deleterious effects of brain drain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijam-web.org/article.asp?issn=2455-5568;year=2016;volume=2;issue=1;spage=68;epage=77;aulast=Wernick|title=Brain drain in academic medicine: Dealing with personnel departures and loss of talent|publisher=MedKnow|date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another novel and unique aspect of [[ACAIM]]'s overall mission and postulate is the need for healthcare institutions, both academic and non-academic, to recognize faculty efforts dedicated to [[International Medical Program]] development as valid expressions of academic contribution that should be granted credit equivalence with U.S. based medical outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321386174_The_American_College_of_Academic_International_Medicine_2017_Consensus_Statement_on_International_Medical_Programs_Establishing_a_system_of_objective_valuation_and_quantitative_metrics_to_facilitate_t|title=The American College of Academic International Medicine 2017 Consensus Statement on International Medical Programs: Establishing a system of objective valuation and quantitative metrics to facilitate the recognition and incorporation of academic international medical efforts into existing promotion and tenure paradigms|date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within such proposed framework, faculty members would receive [[academic RVU]] based credit for international work, with academic tracks formally recognizing [[International Medical Program]] contributions as equivalent to any other academic or educational work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321386174_The_American_College_of_Academic_International_Medicine_2017_Consensus_Statement_on_International_Medical_Programs_Establishing_a_system_of_objective_valuation_and_quantitative_metrics_to_facilitate_t|title=The American College of Academic International Medicine 2017 Consensus Statement on International Medical Programs: Establishing a system of objective valuation and quantitative metrics to facilitate the recognition and incorporation of academic international medical efforts into existing promotion and tenure paradigms|date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirlian photography''' is a collection of photographic techniques used to capture the phenomenon of electrical [[corona discharge|coronal discharges]]. It is named after [[Semyon Davidovich Kirlian|Semyon Kirlian]], who, in 1939, accidentally discovered that if an object on a [[photographic plate]] is connected to a high-voltage source, an image is produced on the photographic plate.&lt;ref name="McCarron-Benson"&gt;Julie McCarron-Benson in ''Skeptical - a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7316-5794-2}}, p11&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirlian photography has been the subject of mainstream scientific research, [[parapsychology]] research and art. To a large extent, It has been used in alternative medicine research.&lt;ref name="Stenger"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |title=Bioenergetic Fields |author=Stenger, Victor J. |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |date=1999 |volume=3 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202347/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1889, Czech B. Navratil coined the word "electrography". Seven years later in 1896, a French experimenter, [[:pt:Hippolyte Baraduc|H. Baraduc]], created electrographs of hands and leaves.

In 1898, Polish engineer Jakub Jodko-Narkiewicz&lt;ref name=Ciesielska&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ciesielska|first=Izabela L.|title=Images of Corona Discharges as a Source of Information About the Influence of Textiles on Humans|journal=AUTEX Research Journal |date=March 2009 |volume=9|issue=1|url=http://www.autexrj.com/cms/zalaczone_pliki/6.pdf|accessdate=26 August 2012|location=Lodz, Poland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Alternatively transliterated ''Narkevich-Yodko''. It is spelled Narkevich-Todko in some sources; In Russian: Наркевич-Йодко. Some sources state that he was Polish, rendering his name Jacob Jodko-Narkiewicz&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated electrography at the fifth exhibition of the Russian Technical Society.
[[File:A Kirlian Photography, male 1989.jpg|120px|thumb|A Kirlian Photography, male fingertip 1989]] [[File:A Kirlian Photography, female 1989.jpg|120px|thumb|A Kirlian Photography, female fingertip 1989]]

In 1939, two Czechs, S. Pratt and J. Schlemmer published photographs showing a glow around leaves. The same year, Russian electrical engineer [[Semyon Kirlian]] and his wife Valentina developed Kirlian photography after observing a patient in Krasnodar hospital who was receiving medical treatment from a high-frequency electrical generator. They had noticed that when the electrodes were brought near the patient's skin, there was a glow similar to that of a [[neon lamp|neon discharge tube]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirlian, S. D. (1949) Method for Receiving Photographic Pictures of Different Types of Objects, Patent, N106401 USSR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kirlians conducted experiments in which photographic film was placed on top of a conducting plate, and another conductor was attached to a hand, a leaf or other plant material. The conductors were energized by a high-frequency high-voltage power source, producing photographic images typically showing a silhouette of the object surrounded by an aura of light.

In 1958, the Kirlians reported the results of their experiments for the first time. Their work was virtually unknown until 1970, when two Americans, Lynn Schroeder and Sheila Ostrander, published a book, ''Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain''. High-voltage electrophotography soon became known to the general public as Kirlian photography. Although little interest was generated among western scientists, Russians held a conference on the subject in 1972 at [[Kazakh State University]].&lt;ref name=MMM&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Myth and Magic|date=1994|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-85435-731-X|volume=11|page=1481|editor=Richard Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirlian photography was used in the former Eastern Bloc in the 1970s. The corona discharge glow at the surface of an object subjected to a high-voltage electrical field was referred to as a "Kirlian aura" in Russia and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Antonov, A., Yuskesselieva, L. (1985) Selective High Frequency Discharge (Kirlian effect), Acta Hydrophysica, Berlin, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juravlev, A. E. (1966) Living Luminescence and Kirlian effect, Academy of Science in USSR.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Belarusian scientist Victor Adamenko wrote a dissertation titled ''Research of the structure of High-frequency electric discharge (Kirlian effect) images''.&lt;ref&gt;Adamenko, V. G. (1972) Objects Moved at a Distance by Means of a Controlled Bioelectric Field, In Abstracts, International Congress of Psychology, Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulin, E. T. (1980) Bioelectrical Effects, Science and Technology, Minsk.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific study of what the researchers called the Kirlian effect was conducted by Victor Inyushin at Kazakh State University.&lt;ref&gt;Petrosyan, V., I., et al.

Early in the 1970s, [[Thelma Moss]] and Kendall Johnson at the Center for Health Sciences at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] conducted extensive research&lt;ref name=MMM/&gt; into Kirlian photography. Moss led an independent and unsupported [[parapsychology]] laboratory&lt;ref name="Moss1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thelma Moss|title=The body electric: a personal journey into the mysteries of parapsychological research, bioenergy, and Kirlian photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hocQAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Kirlian|date=December 1979|publisher=J.

Kirlian photography is a technique for creating [[contact print]] photographs using [[high voltage]]. The process entails placing [[Sheet film|sheet photographic film]] on top of a metal discharge plate. The object to be photographed is then placed directly on top of the film. High voltage is momentarily applied to the object, thus creating an exposure. The [[corona discharge]] between the object and the plate due to high-voltage is captured by the film. The developed film results in a Kirlian photograph of the object.

Color photographic film is calibrated to produce faithful colors when exposed to normal light. Corona discharges can interact with minute variations in the different layers of dye used in the film, resulting in a wide variety of colors depending on the local intensity of the discharge.&lt;ref name="Boyers"/&gt; Film and digital imaging techniques also record light produced by [[photon]]s emitted during corona discharge (see [[corona discharge#Mechanism of corona discharge|Mechanism of corona discharge]]).

Photographs of inanimate objects such as a coins, keys and leaves can be made more effectively by [[ground (electricity)|grounding]] the object to the earth, a cold water pipe or to the opposite (polarity) side of the high-voltage source. Grounding the object creates a stronger corona discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iovine|first=John|title=Kirlian Photography, Part Deux|journal=Poptronics |date=June 2000 |issue=16|page=20|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirlian photography does not require the use of a camera or a lens because it is a contact print process. It is possible to use a transparent electrode in place of the high-voltage discharge plate, allowing one to capture the resulting corona discharge with a standard photo or video camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iovine|first=John|title=Kirlian Photography: Part 1|journal=Poptronics |date=May 2000 |issue=15|page=15|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual artists such as Robert Buelteman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographer Robert Buelteman Shocks Flowers With 80,000 Volts Of Electricity|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/artist-robert-buelteman_n_1694747.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=22 August 2012|date=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ted Hiebert,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blennerhassett|first=Patrick|title=Electrifying photography|accessdate=|newspaper=Victoria News|date=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dick Lane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Puente|first=Veronica|title=Photographer Dick Lane gets really charged up about his work|accessdate=|newspaper=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|date=9 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used Kirlian photography to produce artistic images of a variety of subjects. Photographer Mark D. Roberts, who has worked with Kirlian imagery for over 40 years, published a portfolio of plant images entitled "Vita Occulta Plantarum" or "The Secret Life of Plants," first exhibited in 2012 at the Bakken Museum in Minneapolis, and currently being marketed to botanical gardens and galleries across the United States. Additionally, he has experimented with techniques of coloring by hand as well as digitally.

==Research==
Kirlian photography has been a subject of scientific research, [[parapsychology]] research and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims.&lt;ref name="Stenger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skrabanek"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t84n357177326234/ |title=Paranormal Health Claims |author=Skrabanek, P. |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |date=1988 |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=303–309 |doi=10.1007/bf01961267 |pmid=2834214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===
Results of scientific experiments published in 1976 involving Kirlian photography of living tissue (human finger tips) showed that most of the variations in corona discharge streamer length, density, curvature and color can be accounted for by the moisture content on the surface of and within the living tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pehek|first=John O.|author2=Kyler, Harry J. |author3=Faust, David L. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Image Modulatic Corona Discharge Photography|journal=Science|date=15 October 1976|volume=194|issue=4262|pages=263–270|doi=10.1126/science.968480|bibcode=1976Sci...194..263P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists outside of the US have also conducted scientific research.
[[File:MDR Dusty Miller.jpg|thumb|Kirlian photograph of a dusty miller leaf by Mark D Roberts]]
Konstantin Korotkov developed a technique similar to Kirlian photography called "gas discharge visualization" (GDV).&lt;ref&gt;Korotkov K.G., Krizhanovsky E.V. et al. (2004) The Dynamic of the Gas Discharge around Drops of Liquids. In book: Measuring Energy Fields: State of the Science, Backbone Publ.Co., Fair Lawn, USA, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korotkov K., Korotkin D. (2001) Concentration Dependence of Gas Discharge around Drops of Inorganic Electrolytes, Journal of Applied Physics, 89, 9, pp. 4732–4737.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korotkov K. G., Kaariainen P. (1998) GDV Applied for the Study of a Physical Stress in Sportsmens, Journal of Pathophysiology, Vol. 5., p. 53, Saint Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt; Korotkov's GDV camera system consists of hardware and software to directly record, process and interpret GDV images with a computer. Korotkov's web site promotes his device and research in a medical context.&lt;ref&gt;Katorgin, V. S., Meizerov, E. E. (2000) Actual Questions GDV in Medical Activity, Congress Traditional Medicine, Federal Scientific Clinical and Experimental Center of Traditional Methods of Treatment and Diagnosis, Ministry of Health, pp&amp;nbsp;452–456, Elista, Moscow, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; Izabela Ciesielska at the Institute of Architecture of Textiles in Poland used Korotkov's GDV camera to evaluate the effects of human contact with various textiles on biological factors such as heart rate and blood pressure, as well as corona discharge images. The experiments captured corona discharge images of subjects' fingertips while the subjects wore sleeves of various natural and synthetic materials on their forearms. The results failed to establish a relationship between human contact with the textiles and the corona discharge images and were considered inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Ciesielska/&gt;

===Parapsychology research===
Around the 1970s, interest in paranormal research peaked. In 1968, [[Thelma Moss]], a psychology professor, headed the [[UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute]] (NPI), which was later renamed the Semel Institute. The NPI had a laboratory dedicated to parapsychology research and staffed mostly with volunteers. The lab was unfunded, unsanctioned and eventually shut down by the university. Toward the end of her tenure at UCLA, Moss became interested in Kirlian photography, a technique that supposedly measured the "auras" of a living being. According to Kerry Gaynor, one of her former research assistants, "many felt Kirlian photography's effects were just a natural occurrence."&lt;ref name=Greene/&gt;

Paranormal claims of Kirlian photography have not been observed or replicated in experiment by the [[scientific community]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Barry. (1981). ''Kirlian Photography''. In [[George O. Abell]], Barry Singer. ''Science and the Paranormal''. pp. 196-208. {{ISBN|978-0862450373}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Arleen J; Bickell, William S. (1986). ''A Study of the Kirlian Effect''. Skeptical Inquirer 10: 244-257.&lt;/ref&gt; The physiologist [[Gordon Stein]] has written that Kirlian photography is a [[hoax]] that has "nothing to do with health, vitality, or mood of a subject photographed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1993). ''Encyclopedia of Hoaxes''. Gale Group. p. 183. {{ISBN|0-8103-8414-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims===
Kirlian believed that images created by Kirlian photography might depict a conjectural energy field, or [[aura (paranormal)|aura]], thought, by some, to surround living things. Kirlian and his wife were convinced that their images showed a life force or energy field that reflected the physical and emotional states of their living subjects. They thought that these images could be used to diagnose illnesses. In 1961, they published their first article on the subject in the Russian Journal of Scientific and Applied Photography.&lt;ref name=Pilkington&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/feb/05/research.highereducation1|first=Mark|last=Pilkington|title=Bodies of light|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 February 2004|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirlian's claims were embraced by energy treatments practitioners.&lt;ref name=JSmith&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Jonathan C.|title=Pseudoscience and Extraordinary Claims of the Paranormal: A Critical Thinker's Toolkit|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=978-1-4051-8122-8|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Torn leaf experiment====

A typical demonstration used as evidence for the existence of these energy fields involved taking Kirlian photographs of a picked leaf at set intervals. The gradual withering of the leaf was thought to correspond with a decline in the strength of the aura. In some experiments, if a section of a leaf was torn away after the first photograph, a faint image of the missing section sometimes remains when a second photograph was taken. However, if the imaging surface is cleaned of contaminants and residual moisture before the second image is taken, then no image of the missing section will appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kirlian photography |work=An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural |publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation |url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Kirlian%20photography.html |accessdate=2008-10-14}}, derived from:&lt;br/&gt;*{{cite book |title=An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural |first=James |last=Randi |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |date=1997 |isbn=0-312-15119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The living aura theory is at least partially repudiated by demonstrating that leaf moisture content has a pronounced effect on the electric discharge coronas; more moisture creates larger corona discharges.&lt;ref name="Boyers"/&gt; As the leaf dehydrates, the coronas will naturally decrease in variability and intensity. As a result, the changing water content of the leaf can affect the so-called Kirlian aura. Kirlian's experiments did not provide evidence for an energy field other than the electric fields produced by chemical processes and the streaming process of coronal discharges.&lt;ref name=Boyers/&gt;

The coronal discharges identified as Kirlian auras are the result of [[stochastic]] [[electricity|electric]] [[ionization]] processes and are greatly affected by many factors, including the voltage and frequency of the stimulus, the pressure with which a person or object touches the imaging surface, the local humidity around the object being imaged, how well grounded the person or object is, and other local factors affecting the conductivity of the person or object being imaged. Oils, sweat, bacteria, and other [[ionization|ionizing]] contaminants found on living tissues can also affect the resulting images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Opalinski, John|title=Kirlian‐type images and the transport of thin‐film materials in high‐voltage corona discharges|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=50|issue=1|pages=498–504|date=Jan 1979|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.325641|doi=10.1063/1.325641|bibcode=1979JAP....50..498O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indian-skeptic.org/html/is_v02/2-9-9.htm The Kirlian Technique: Controlling the Wild Cards]. The Kirlian effect not only is explainable by natural processes; it also varies according to at least six physical parameters. Arleen J. Watkins and Williams S. Bickel, The Skeptical Inquirer 13:172-184, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SkepticDict&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ, USA|isbn=978-0-471-27242-7|page=446|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qi====
Scientists such as Beverly Rubik have explored the idea of a human biofield using Kirlian photography research, attempting to explain the Chinese discipline of [[Qigong]]. Qigong teaches that there is a vitalistic energy called [[qi]] (or chi) that permeates all living things. The idea of qi as its own sort of field, not simply a creature's electromagnetic field, has been mostly disregarded by the scientific community.{{citation needed|reason=Which scientists?

Kirlian photography has appeared as a fictional element in numerous books, films, television series, and media productions, including the 1975 film ''The Kirlian Force'', re-released under the more sensational title ''[[Psychic Killer]]''. Kirlian photographs have been used as visual components in various media, such as the sleeve of [[George Harrison]]'s 1973 album ''[[Living in the Material World]]'', which features Kirlian photographs of his hand holding a Hindu medallion on the front sleeve and American coins on the back, shot at Thelma Moss's UCLA parapsychology laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, G.

'''Lautite''' is a rare [[mineral]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lautite]&lt;/ref&gt; belonging to the class of [[sulfide]]s and [[sulfosalt minerals|sulfosalts]] with the general formula CuAsS. It is [[orthorhombic]] and is known to form up to 2.3&amp;nbsp;cm long prismatic or flat crystals. It is also found as grains or masses.

First identified by [[Friedrich August Frenzel]] in 1880 in the Rudolphschacht mine near [[Lauta (Marienberg)|Lauta]] in Saxony, it was named after its [[type locality (geology)|type locality]].&lt;ref&gt;Frenzel, A. (1880). XIX. Mineralogisches. Zeitschrift für Kristallographie, Mineralogie und Petrographie, 3(6), 504-516.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lautite is formed in veins under [[hydrothermal]] conditions at medium temperatures. Depending on the locality it is found accompanied by [[arsenic]], [[tennantite]], [[proustite]], [[chalcopyrite]], [[galenite]], and [[baryte]] (in the type locality); by [[kutinaite]] and [[paxite]] (in [[Nieder-Beerbach]]); or by asenic, [[bismut]], tennantite, [[loellingite]], [[rammelsbergite]], proustite, and [[quartz]] (in [[Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines]]).

Aside from the type locality, the mineral is found in other places in the [[Ore Mountains]], in [[Sankt Andreasberg]] in the [[Harz]] mountains, Nieder-Beerbach in the [[Odenwald]], [[Hausach]], [[Schenkenzell]], and [[Titisee-Neustadt]] in the [[Black Forest]], [[Flatschach]] in [[Austria]], [[Isérables]] in [[Switzerland]], [[Cochrane District|Cochrane]] in [[Canada]], [[Luqu]] and [[Zoigê]] in [[PR China|China]], [[Sirohi (Distrikt)|Sirohi]] in [[India]], [[Takab]] in [[Iran]], [[Kombat]] in [[Namibia]] and [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]] in [[Arizona]], US.

[[File:Book of Leinster, folio 53.jpg|thumb|Folio 53 from the [[Book of Leinster]]. Lebor Gabála Érenn is recorded in more than a dozen medieval manuscripts and the Book of Leinster is just one of the primary sources of text.
Image: Dublin, TCD, MS 1339 (olim MS H 2.18)]]

'''''Lebor Gabála Érenn''''' (''"The Book of the Taking of Ireland"'') is a collection of poems and [[prose]] narratives that purports to be a history of Ireland and the Irish from the creation of the world to the [[Middle Ages]]. There are a number of versions, the earliest of which was compiled by an anonymous writer in the 11th century. It synthesized narratives that had been developing over the foregoing centuries. The ''Lebor Gabála'' tells of Ireland being settled (or 'taken') six times by six groups of people: the people of [[Cessair]], the people of [[Partholón]], the people of [[Nemed]], the [[Fir Bolg]], the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], and the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]]. The first four groups are wiped out or forced to abandon the island, the fifth group represent Ireland's pagan gods,{{sfn|Koch|2006|pp=1693-1695}} while the final group represent the Irish people (the [[Gaels]]).

Today, most scholars regard the ''Lebor Gabála'' as primarily myth rather than history.{{sfn|Carey|1994|pp=1–4}} It appears to be mostly based on medieval Christian pseudo-histories,{{sfn|Carey|1994|pp=1-4}}{{sfn|Koch|2006|p=1132}} but it also incorporates some of [[Irish mythology|Ireland's native pagan mythology]].{{sfn|Koch|2006|p=1132}} Scholars believe the goal of its writers was to provide an epic history for Ireland that could compare to that of the [[Israelites]] or the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and which reconciled native myth with the Christian view of history.{{sfn|Carey|1994|pp=1–4, 24}}{{sfn|Koch|2006|p=1130}} It is suggested, for example, that there are six 'takings' to match the "[[Six Ages of the World]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Marie-Louise| last = Sjoestedt| authorlink = Marie-Louise Sjoestedt| year =  1949 | title = Celtic Gods and Heroes |publisher = Dover Publications, 2000| page =3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebor Gabála Érenn is also considered a "''highly influential Middle Irish prose-and-verse treatise'' [...] ''written in order to bridge the chasm between Christian world-chronology and the prehistory of Ireland''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Mark  |last = Williams | title = Ireland's Immortals: A History of the Gods of Irish Myth | publisher = Princetown University Press| year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lebor Gabála'' is usually known in English as '''''The Book of Invasions''''' or ''The Book of Conquests'', and in [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] as ''Leabhar Gabhála Éireann'' or ''Leabhar Gabhála na hÉireann''.

==Origins==
Purporting to be a history of Ireland and the Irish, the purpose of ''Lebor Gabála Érenn'' (hereinafter abbreviated as ''LGE'') was three-fold:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
firstly to unite the population by obliterating the memory of previous and different ethnic groups, secondly to weaken the influence of pre-Christian pagan religions by converting their gods into mere mortals, and thirdly to manufacture pedigrees into which the various dynastic groups could conveniently be fitted [http://homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/irhismys/milesians.htm]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been described as an attempt to provide the Irish with a written history comparable to that which the [[Israelites]] provided for themselves in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfn|Macalister|1938|loc = pp.xxvi-xxvii: "If we cut the interpolated sections out, we find ourselves left with a ''History of the Gaedil'', based upon the history of the Children of Israel as it is set forth in the Old Testament."}} Drawing upon the pagan myths of [[Gaelic Ireland]] but reinterpreting them in the light of Judeo-Christian theology and historiography, it describes how the island was settled six times by six groups of people. Biblical paradigms provided the mythologers with ready-made stories which could be adapted to their purpose. Thus we find the ancestors of the Irish enslaved in a foreign land, or fleeing into exile, or wandering in the wilderness, or sighting the "Promised Land" from afar.

[[File:City of God Manuscript.jpg|thumb|The authors of Lebor Gabála Érenn were heavily influenced by other religious texts like [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo's]] 5th century book, [[City of God (book)|City of God]].]]
Four Christian works in particular seem to have had a significant bearing on the formation of LGE:

*[[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine's]] ''De Civitate Dei'', [[City of God (book)|The City of God]], (413–426 AD)
*[[Orosius]]'s ''Historiae adversum paganos'', "Histories," (417)
*[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius's]] ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon]]'', translated into Latin by [[Jerome|St Jerome]] as the ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Temporum liber]]'' (379)
*[[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'' ("Etymologies"), or ''[[Origines]]'' ("Origins") (early 7th century)

The pre-Christian elements, however, were never entirely effaced. One of the poems in LGE, for instance, recounts how goddesses from among the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] took husbands from the Gaeil when they 'invaded' and 'colonised' Ireland. Furthermore, the pattern of successive invasions which LGE preserves is reminiscent of [[Timagenes]] of Alexandria's account of the origins of the [[Gauls]] of continental Europe. Cited by the 4th-century historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], Timagenes (1st century BC) describes how the ancestors of the Gauls were driven from their native lands in eastern Europe by a succession of wars and floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Ammianus | last = Marcellinus| url = http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_15_book15.htm#C9 | title = Res Gestae| at = 15:9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous fragments of Ireland's mythological history are scattered throughout the 7th and 8th centuries. In his ''Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Ancient Irish History'', [[Eugene O'Curry]], Professor of Irish History and Archaeology at the Catholic University of Ireland, discusses various genres of historical tales mentioned in the manuscripts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Tochomladh'' was an Immigration or arrival of a Colony; and under this name the coming of the several colonies of ''Parthalon'' of ''Nemedh'', of the Firbolgs, the ''Tuatha Dé Danann'', the Milesians, etc., into Erinn, are all described in separate tales. It is probably from the original records of these ancient stories that the early part of the various Books of Invasions has been compiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Eugene | last = O'Curry | work = Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Ancient Irish History | publisher = James Duffy, Dublin | year = 1861| title = Lecture XIII | pages =  294-295 | url = https://archive.org/stream/lecturesonmanus00ocugoog#page/n325/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The earliest extant account of the purported history of Ireland is to be found in the ''Historia Brittonum'' or "History of the Britons," which was once thought to have been written by the Welsh priest [[Nennius]] in 829–830.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Dumville|first1=David|title=Some aspects of the chronology of the Historia Brittonum|journal=Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies|date=1974|volume=25|issue=4|pages=439–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text gives two separate accounts of early Irish history. The first consists of a series of successive colonisations from [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] by the pre-Gaelic peoples of Ireland, all of which found their way into LGE. The second recounts the origins of the Gaeil themselves, and tells how they in turn came to be the masters of the country and 'ancestors' of all the Irish.

These two stories continued to be enriched and elaborated upon by Irish historian-poets throughout the 9th century. In the 10th and 11th centuries, several long historical poems were written that were later incorporated into the scheme of LGE. Most of the poems on which the 11th-12th century version of LGE was based were written by the following four poets:

*[[Eochaidh Ua Floinn]] (936–1004) from [[Armagh]] – Poems 30, 41, 53, 65, 98, 109, 111
*[[Flann Mainistrech]] mac Echthigrin (died 1056), lector and historian of [[Monasterboice]] Abbey – Poems ?42, 56, 67, ?82
*[[Tanaide]] (died ''c.'' 1075) – Poems 47, 54, 86
*[[Gilla Cómáin mac Gilla Samthainde]] (''fl.'' 1072) – Poems 13, 96, 115

It was late in the 11th century that a single anonymous scholar appears to have brought together these and numerous other poems and fitted them into an elaborate prose framework – partly of his own composition and partly drawn from older, no longer extant sources (i.e. the ''tochomlaidh'' referred to above by O'Curry), paraphrasing and enlarging the verse. The result was the earliest version of LGE. It was written in Middle Irish, a form of Irish Gaelic used between 900 and 1200.

==Textual variants and sources==
From the beginning, LGE proved to be an enormously popular and influential document, quickly acquiring canonical status. Older texts were altered to bring their narratives into closer accord with its version of history, and numerous new poems were written and inserted into it. Within a century of its compilation there existed a plethora of copies and revisions, with as many as 136 poems between them. Five recensions of LGE are now extant, surviving in more than a dozen medieval manuscripts:

*'''First Redaction (R¹):''' preserved in ''[[The Book of Leinster]]'' (c. 1150) and ''The Book of Fermoy'' (1373).
*'''Míniugud (Min):''' this recension is closely related to the Second Redaction. It is probably older than the surviving MSS of that redaction, though not older than the now lost exemplar on which those MSS were based. The surviving sources are suffixed to copies of the Second Redaction.
*'''Second Redaction (R²):''' survives in no less than seven separate texts, the best known of which is ''[[Great Book of Lecan|The Great Book of Lecan]]'' (1418).
*'''Third Redaction (R³):''' preserved in both ''[[Book of Ballymote|The Book of Ballymote]]'' (1391) and ''The Great Book of Lecan''.
*'''O'Clery's Redaction (K):''' written in 1631 by [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]], a Franciscan scribe and one of the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]]. Unlike the earlier versions of LGE, this redaction is in [[History of the Irish language|Early Modern Irish]] but was admitted as an independent redaction by [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|Macalister]] because there are indications that the author had access to sources which are no longer extant and which were not used by the compilers of the other four redactions. The work was compiled in the convent of Lisgool, near [[Enniskillen]]. O'Clery was assisted by Gillapatrick O'Luinin and Peregrine O'Clery (Michael O Clery's third cousin once removed, and one of the Four Masters).

The following table summarises the extant manuscripts that contain versions of LGE. Most of the abbreviations used are taken from R. A. S. Macalister's critical edition of the work (see references for details):

* '''K''' is contained in several paper manuscripts, but '''K¹''', the "authoritative autograph", takes precedence.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harv|O'Donovan|1849|pp=xxiii–xxiv}} the manuscript K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the Royal Irish Academy is actually a fair copy of Mícheál Ó Cléirigh's autograph made by his fellow-master Peregrine O'Clery. The author's original manuscript was probably sent to [[Leuven|Louvain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern criticism==
For many centuries LGE was accepted without question as an accurate and reliable account of the history of Ireland. As late as the 17th century, [[Geoffrey Keating]] drew on it while writing his history of Ireland, ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'', and it was also used extensively by the authors of the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]''.  Recently, however, the work has been subjected to greater critical scrutiny. One contemporary scholar has placed it in "the tradition of historical fabrication or ''pseudohistory''";&lt;ref&gt;John Carey, in an introduction to the 1993 edition of R. A. Stewart Macalister's English translation; Francis John Byrne, in his ''Irish Kings and High-Kings'' (pp. 9–10) refers to the work as "a fantastic compound of genuine racial memories, exotic Latin learning and world history derived from Orosius and Isidore of Seville, euhemerised Celtic mythology, dynastic propaganda, folklore, and pure fiction".&lt;/ref&gt; another has written of its "generally spurious character" and has drawn attention to its many "fictions", while acknowledging that it "embodies some popular traditions.{{sfn|O'Rahilly|1946|p =264 }} The Irish archaeologist [[R. A. Stewart Macalister]], who translated the work into English, was particularly dismissive of it: "There is not a single element of genuine historical detail, in the strict sense of the word, anywhere in the whole compilation".{{sfn|Macalister|1939|p=252}}  Macalister later softened his opinion.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

While most scholars view the work as primarily myth rather than history, some have argued that it is loosely based on real events. In the 1940s, [[T. F. O'Rahilly]] created a [[O'Rahilly's historical model|model of Irish prehistory]] based on his analysis of LGE and the early Irish language. He suggested that there were four waves of Celtic migrations or invasions: that of the [[Cruthin|Cruthin or Pritani]] (c. 700–500 BC), the [[Builg]] or [[Érainn]] (c. 500 BC), the [[Laigin]], [[Fir Domnann|Domnainn]] and Gálioin (c. 300 BC), and the Gaels (c. 100 BC). He argues that some of the 'invasions' depicted in LGE are based on these, but that others were invented by the writers. He also argues that many of Ireland's 'pre-Gaelic' peoples continued to flourish for centuries after 100 BC.{{sfn|O'Rahilly|1946|loc = p.264; pp. 154 ff}}

In ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948), British poet and mythologist [[Robert Graves]] argued that myths brought to Ireland centuries before the introduction of writing were preserved and transmitted accurately by word of mouth before being written down in the Christian Era. Taking issue with Macalister, with whom he corresponded on this and other matters, he declared some of LGE's traditions "archaeologically plausible".{{sfn|Graves|1948|loc=p.48 &amp; p.100}} ''The White Goddess'' itself has been the subject of much criticism by archeologists and historians.

LGE was translated into French in 1884. The first complete English translation was made by [[R. A. Stewart Macalister]] between 1937 and 1942. It was accompanied by an [[apparatus criticus]], Macalister's own notes and an introduction, in which he made clear his own view that LGE was a conflation of two originally independent works: a ''History of the Gaedil'', modelled after the history of the Israelites as set forth in the Old Testament, and an account of several pre-Gaelic settlements of Ireland (to the historicity of which Macalister gave very little credence). The latter was then inserted into the middle of the other work, interrupting it at a crucial point of the narrative. Macalister theorised that the quasi-Biblical text had been a scholarly Latin work entitled ''Liber Occupationis Hiberniae'' ("The Book of the Taking of Ireland"), thus explaining why the Middle Irish title of LGE refers to only one "taking", while the text recounts more than half a dozen.

==Contents==
There now follows a brief outline of the text of ''LGE''. The work can be divided into ten "books":

===Genesis===
A retelling of the familiar Judeo-Christian story of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], the fall of Man and the early history of the world. In addition to [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]], the author draws upon several recondite works for many of his details (e.g. the Syriac ''[[Cave of Treasures]]''), as well as the four Christian works mentioned earlier (i.e. ''The City of God'', etc.).

===Early history of the Gaels===
[[File:Torre de Hércules, La Coruña, España, 2015-09-24, DD 11.jpg|thumb|[[Tower of Hercules]] ([[A Coruña]], [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]]) rebuilt 2nd and 18th centuries: according to the ''Lebor Gabála Érenn'', [[Breogán]] was the father of Ith, the leader of an expedition to Ireland from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; from Breogán's Tower Ith first saw Ireland, 900 kilometres north]]

This chapter explains, and is based on, the belief that all mankind is descended from [[Adam]] through the [[sons of Noah]]. It tells us how Noah's son [[Japheth]] is the forebear of all Europeans (see [[Japhetites]]), how Japheth's son [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]] is the forebear of the Gaels and [[Scythians]], and how [[Fénius Farsaid]] is the forebear of the Gaels. Fénius, a prince of [[Scythia]], is described as one of 72 chieftains who built the [[Tower of Babel]]. His son Nel weds [[Scota]], daughter of an Egyptian [[pharaoh]], and they have a son named [[Goídel Glas]]. Goídel crafts the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic (Gaelic) language]] from the original 72 languages that arose after the [[confusion of tongues]]. Goídel's offspring, the Goidels (Gaels), leave Egypt at the same time as the [[Israelites]] ([[the Exodus]]){{sfn|Macalister|1939|pp=33-39; 61-65}} and settle in Scythia. After some time they leave Scythia and spend 440 years wandering the Earth, undergoing a series of trials and tribulations akin to those of the Israelites, who spent 40 years wandering in the wilderness. After many years at sea, they settle in the [[Maeotian Swamp|Maeotian marshes]], then sail via [[Crete]] and [[Sicily]] and conquer [[Iberia]]. There, Goídel's descendant [[Breogán]] founds a city called Brigantia, and builds a tower from the top of which his son Íth glimpses Ireland.

It appears that this chapter was meant to give the Gaels a genealogy which links them to key Biblical figures and conforms to Judeo-Christian beliefs.{{sfn|Koch|2006|p=1130}}{{sfn|Carey|1994|p=3}} It links them to events from the Old Testament and likens them to the Israelites.{{sfn|Koch|2006|p=1133}} The claim of Scythian origins seems to be based on the similarity of the names ''[[Scoti]]'' and ''Scythae''.{{sfn|Carey|1994|p=12}} Other medieval pseudo-historians did likewise with other nations. For example, in his earlier ''History of the Goths'', [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] concludes that the [[Goths]] and [[Getae|Gets]] are related due to their similar names, and says that they (along with the Scythians) descend from Magog.{{sfn|Carey|1994|p=13}} The claim of Iberian origins may be based on three things: the similarity of the names ''Iberia'' and ''[[Hibernia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. Infobase Publishing, 2014. p.332&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore describing Iberia as the "mother[land] of the races",{{sfn|Carey|1994|p=12}} and [[Orosius]] describing Ireland as lying "between Iberia and Britain".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.historyireland.com/pre-history-archaeology/did-the-irish-come-from-spain/ | title = Did the Irish Come from Spain?| work = [[History Ireland]]|volume = 9| issue=3 | year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that the Gaels settled in the Maeotian marshes seems to have been taken from the ''Book of the History of the Franks'',{{sfn|Carey|1994|p=15}} and their travels to Crete and Sicily may have been based on the tale of [[Aeneas]].{{sfn|Carey|1994|p=16}}  Brigantia refers to [[A Coruña|Corunna]] in [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] (which was then known as Brigantium)&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', "A Coruña".&lt;/ref&gt; and Breogán's tower is likely based on the [[Tower of Hercules]], which was built at Corunna by the Romans.

===Cessair===
[[File:Bantry Bay near Foilakilly - geograph.org.uk - 1229006.jpg|thumb|Bantry Bay, where Cessair and her followers are said to have landed]]
According to LGE, the first people to arrive in Ireland are led by [[Cessair]], daughter of Bith, son of [[Noah]]. They are told to go to the western edge of the world to escape the [[Genesis flood narrative|oncoming Flood]]. They set out in three ships but when they land in Ireland, forty days before the Flood, two of the ships are lost. The only survivors are Cessair, forty-nine other women, and three men: [[Fintan mac Bóchra]], Bith and Ladra. The women are split evenly among the men. Each also takes one as his wife: Fintán takes Cessair, Bith takes Barrfhind and Ladra takes Alba. However, Bith and Ladra soon die and Ladra is the first man buried in Ireland. When the Flood comes, Fintán is the only one to survive. He becomes a salmon and later an eagle and a hawk, living for 5,500 years after the Flood, whence he becomes a man again and recounts Ireland's history.

In an earlier version of the tale, the first woman in Ireland is [[Banba]].{{sfn|Koch|2006|p=165}} Banba, [[Fódla]] and [[Ériu]] were [[Triple deity|a trio]] of land goddesses and their husbands were [[Mac Cuill]] (son of hazel), [[Mac Cecht]] (son of the plough) and [[Mac Gréine]] (son of the Sun). It is likely that Cessair, the three men and their three wives are a Christianized replacement for them.{{sfn|Carey|1994|p=21}}&lt;ref name=monaghan85&gt;Monaghan, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Fintán/Mac Cuill may also be linked to the [[Salmon of Knowledge]], which gains all the world's knowledge after eating nine hazelnuts that fall into [[Connla's Well|a well]]. The women who accompany Cessair appear by their names to represent the world's ancestral mothers; they included Alba (ancestor of the Britons), Espa (Spanish), German (Germans), Gothiam (Goths), Traige (Thracians), and so forth. Thus "their arrival can be read as creating a microcosm of the whole world's population in Ireland". Several other companions echo the names of ancient Irish goddesses.&lt;ref name=monaghan85/&gt;

===Partholón===
Ireland is then uninhabited for 300 years, until a second group of people arrive. They are led by [[Partholón]], who is descended from Noah through Magog. They sail to Ireland via Gothia, [[Anatolia]], Greece, Sicily and Iberia. They include Partholón’s wife [[Dealgnaid|Delgnat]], their four chieftain sons, and others. When they arrive, there is only one open plain, three lakes and nine rivers. They clear four more plains and a further seven [[lake-burst|lakes burst from the ground]]. Named figures are credited with introducing cattle husbandry, ploughing, cooking, dwellings, trade, and dividing the island in four. They battle and defeat the mysterious [[Fomorians]], who are led by [[Cichol Gricenchos]]. Eventually, Partholón and his people (now 5,000 men and 4,000 women) die of plague in a single week. Only one man, [[Tuan mac Cairill]], survives. Like Fintán, he lives for centuries in a number of forms, so that he can recount Irish history. This chapter also includes the tale of Delgnat committing adultery with a servant.

''Partholón'' comes from ''Bartholomaeus'' (Bartholomew) and he is likely an invention of the Christian writers, possibly being borrowed from a character of that name in the Christian pseudo-histories of Saint [[Jerome]] and Isidore.{{sfn|Carey|1994|p=9}}&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p.376&lt;/ref&gt; The Fomorians have been interpreted as a group of deities who represent the harmful or destructive powers of nature; personifications of chaos, darkness, death, blight and drought.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2009|pp= 80, 89, 91}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Smyth| first =  Daragh | title = A Guide to Irish Mythology| publisher = Irish Academic Press| year = 1996 | page =74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nemed===
[[File:Myths and legends; the Celtic race (1910) (14760452906).jpg|thumb|upright|"Tuan watches Nemed", illustration by [[J. C. Leyendecker]] in T. W. Rolleston's ''Myths &amp; Legends of the Celtic Race'', 1911]]
Ireland is then uninhabited for 30 years, until a third group of people arrive. They are led by [[Nemed]], who is also descended from Noah through Magog.

They set out from the [[Caspian Sea]] in 44 ships but, after a year and a half of sailing, the only ship to reach Ireland is Nemed's. On board are his wife, his four chieftain sons, and others. During their time in Ireland, the Nemedians clear twelve plains and build two royal forts, and four lakes burst from the ground. They win four battles against the Fomorians. 

After Nemed and many others die of plague, the Nemedians are oppressed by the Fomorians [[Conand (mythology)|Conand]] and Morc. Each [[Samhain]], they must give two thirds of their children, their corn and their milk to the Fomorians. This [[tribute]] that the Nemedians are forced to pay may be "a dim memory of sacrifice offered at the beginning of winter, when the powers of darkness and blight are in the ascendant".{{sfn|MacCulloch|2009|p=80}} Eventually, they rise up against the Fomorians and attack the Tower of Conand with 60,000 warriors (30,000 on sea and 30,000 on land), defeating Conand. Morc then attacks, and almost all of the Nemedians are killed in a tidal wave. Only one ship of thirty men escapes. Some of them go "into the north of the world", some go to Britain and become the ancestors of all [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]], and some go south to Greece.

===Fir Bolg===
Those who went to Greece were enslaved by the Greeks and made to carry bags of clay. After 230 years, they sail back to Ireland. They are known as the [[Fir Bolg]] (men of bags), and contain two sub-groups known as the [[Fir Domnann]] and Fir Gálioin. Led by their five chieftains, they divide Ireland into [[Provinces of Ireland|five provinces]]: Gann takes North Munster, Sengann takes South Munster, Genann takes Connacht, Rudraige takes Ulster and Slanga takes Leinster. A succession of nine [[High King of Ireland|High Kings]] rule over Ireland for the next 37 years.

[[File:Newgrange - geograph.org.uk - 14526.jpg|thumb|In Lebor Gabála Érenn, the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] are closely associated with the ancient passage graves of [[Brú na Bóinne]] such as [[Newgrange]]]]

===Tuatha Dé Danann===
Those who went into the north of the world are the supernaturally-gifted [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] (or Tuath Dé), who represent the main pagan gods of Ireland. They come to Ireland in dark clouds and land on [[Sliabh an Iarainn]] in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cockburn MacAndrew|first=Henry|title=Ireland before the Conquest| journal=The Highland Monthly | volume = 3|publisher="Northern Chronicle" Office|date=1892|url= | pages=433–444}}&lt;/ref&gt; They fight the Fir Bolg for the ownership of Ireland in the [[Cath Maige Tuired|First Battle of Mag Tuired]] (Moytura). The Tuath Dé are victorious. They offer the Fir Bolg a province of Ireland, and they choose Connacht. [[Nuada Airgetlám|Nuada]], king of the Tuath Dé, loses his hand or arm in the battle and is thus no longer fit to be their king. He is replaced by [[Bres]] (a half-Fomorian), who becomes High King of Ireland. However, Bres mistreats the Tuath Dé and neglects his kingly duties. This may reflect the occasional supremacy of the powers of blight (the Fomorians) over the powers of growth (the Tuath Dé).{{sfn|MacCulloch|2009|p=89}} After seven years, [[Dian Cecht]] the physician and [[Credne]] the metalsmith replace Nuada's hand/arm with a working silver one, and he re-takes the kingship. The Tuath Dé then fight the Fomorians in the Second Battle of Moytura. [[Balor]] the Fomorian kills Nuada, but Balor's (half-Fomorian) grandson [[Lugh]] kills him and becomes king. The Tuatha Dé enjoy 150 years of unbroken rule.

===Milesians===
[[File:Myths and legends; the Celtic race (1910) (14760459036).jpg|thumb|upright|"The Coming of the Sons of Miled", illustration by [[J. C. Leyendecker]] in T. W. Rolleston's ''Myths &amp; Legends of the Celtic Race'', 1911]]
The tale of the Gaels is now resumed. Íth, who has spied Ireland from the top of Breogán's Tower, sails to the island with a group of men. He is welcomed by its three kings: Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht and Mac Gréine of the Tuath Dé. However, he is killed by unnamed attackers and his men return to Iberia. The Gaels set sail with a great force to avenge his death and take Ireland. They are referred to here as the Sons of [[Míl Espáine]] (or [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]]). The name ''Míl Espáine'' comes from the Latin ''Miles Hispaniae'' ("soldier of [[Hispania]]") and is likely an invention of the Christian writers.{{sfn|Carey|1994|p=9}}&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p.331&lt;/ref&gt; After they land, they fight against the combined forces of the Tuath Dé and Fomorians. On their way to [[Hill of Tara|Tara]], they are met on three mountains by the aforementioned Banba, Fódla and Ériu – the wives of Ireland's three kings. Each goddess asks that the Gaels name the land after her. One of the Gaels, [[Amergin Glúingel|Amergin]], promises that it shall be so. At Tara, they meet the three kings, who defend their claim to the joint kingship of the land. They ask that there be a three-day truce, during which the Gaels must stay a distance of nine waves from land. The Gaels agree, but once their ships are nine waves from Ireland, the Tuath Dé conjure up a great wind that prevents them sailing back to land. However, Amergin calms the wind by reciting a verse. The surviving ships return to land and the two groups agree to divide Ireland between them. The Gaels take the world above, while the Tuath Dé take the world below (i.e. the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]]) and enter the [[Aos Sí|sídhe]].

===Roll of the pagan kings of Ireland===
{{See also|List of High Kings of Ireland}}

Modelled on the Biblical ''[[Books of Kings]]'', this book recounts the deeds of various kings of Ireland, most of them legendary or semi-legendary, from the time of Éber and Érimón to the early 5th century of the Christian era.

===Roll of the Christian kings of Ireland===
A continuation of the previous book. This book is the most accurate part of ''LGE'', being concerned with historical kings of Ireland whose deeds and dates are preserved in contemporary written records.

♦ [[Abby Sunderland]] attempted but did not complete an easterly circumnavigation in 2010.

''Since the Jesse Martin voyage, records claimed for the youngest person to circumnavigate the world are not recognized by the [[World Sailing Speed Record Council]], nor by any other formal council. Therefore, the strict route requirements of the WSSRC are not being followed for this list, and it is deemed sufficient for the sailors to cross all longitudes and the equator, before crossing their own path again.''&lt;!-- Note that WSSRC have themselves written in a letter to Jessica Watson that her planned route was OK for them, since no record would be recognized anyway. This was written in her book. After her voyage, WSSRC have not criticized her for the route, only the media did. But media had no routeing requirement, at least not before the voyage. --&gt;

'''Mare Orientale''' ("eastern sea" in [[Latin]]) is a [[lunar mare]]. It is located on the western border of the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] and [[far side of the Moon|far side]] of the [[Moon]],{{sfn|Head|1991}} and is difficult to see from an Earthbound perspective. Images from spacecraft have revealed it to be one of the most striking large scale lunar features, resembling a target ring [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]].

==Geology==
During the 1960s, rectified images of Mare Orientale by [[Gerard Kuiper]] at the [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]] gave rise to the notion of it being an [[impact crater]].{{sfn|Beals|Tanner|1975|p=299-306}}{{sfn|Hartmann|Kuiper|1962|pp=51-66}} The structure, with the flat plain of the mare in the center, is about {{convert|900|km|mi}} across and was formed by the impact of an asteroid-sized object,&lt;ref name=lunarorbiter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/orbiter/lunar_orbiter/impact_basin/ |title=Lunar Orbiter: Impact Basin Geology |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute |first=Walter S. |last=Kiefer |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stardate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stardate.org/radio/program/2008-06-17 |title=Mare Orientale |work=StarDate.org |publisher=McDonald Observatory |first=Damond |last=Benningfield |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and travelling at {{convert|15|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="theconvo20161103"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://theconversation.com/study-sheds-light-on-violent-asteroid-crash-that-caused-mysterious-crater-rings-on-the-moon-68093 |title=Study sheds light on violent asteroid crash that caused mysterious 'crater rings' on the moon |work=The Conversation |first=Susanne |last=Schwenzer |date=3 November 2016 |accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson20161028"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Formation of the Orientale lunar multiring basin |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |first1=Brandon C. |last1=Johnson |first2=David M. |last2=Blair |first3=Gareth S. |last3=Collins |first4=H. Jay |last4=Melosh |first5=Andrew M. |last5=Freed |display-authors=etal |volume=354 |issue=6311 |pages=441–444 |date=28 October 2016 |doi=10.1126/science.aag0518 |pmid=27789836|bibcode=2016Sci...354..441J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with most other lunar basins, Mare Orientale is less flooded by mare [[basalt]]s, so that much of the basin structure is visible. The basalt in the central portion of the Orientale basin is probably less than {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} in thickness which is much less than mare basins on the earth-facing side of the moon.&lt;ref name=lunarorbiter /&gt; The collision caused ripples in the lunar crust, resulting in the three concentric circular features. The innermost rings of this vast, multi-ringed crater are the inner and outer [[Montes Rook]], and the outermost ring are the [[Montes Cordillera]], {{convert|930|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter. Outward from here, ejecta extend some {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the foot of the mountains and form a rough surface with hummocks and with features radially aligned towards the center.&lt;ref name=lunarorbiter /&gt;

The [[Apollo program]] did not sample rocks from Mare Orientale so its precise age is not known. However, it is the Moon's most recent impact basin, probably rather younger than the [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium Basin]], which is about 3.85 billion years old.&lt;ref name=lunarorbiter /&gt; The surrounding basin material is of the [[Lower Imbrian]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] with the mare material being of the [[Upper Imbrian]] epoch.&lt;ref name=rasc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rasc.ca/sites/default/files/IWLOP2013c.pdf |title=The Isabel Williamson Lunar Observing Program |publisher=Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |date=March 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705092307/http://www.rasc.ca/sites/default/files/IWLOP2013c.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located at the [[Antipodal point|antipode]] of Mare Orientale is [[Mare Marginis]].

A [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]] (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Orientale from Doppler tracking of the five [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] spacecraft in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.161.3842.680 |title=Mascons: Lunar Mass Concentrations |year=1968 |author=P. M. Muller, W. L. Sjogren |journal=Science |volume=161 | issue = 3842  |pages=680–684 |pmid=17801458|bibcode=1968Sci...161..680M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mascon was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as [[Lunar Prospector]] and [[Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory|GRAIL]].

==Discovery and name==
Mare Orientale is difficult to observe from Earth, as it lies at the extreme western edge of the near side. All that can be seen are the rough mountain ranges—the Montes Rook and the Montes Cordillera—and some glimpses of the dark mare material beyond them.{{sfn|Consolmagno|Davis|2011}} However, the Moon's [[libration]] means that on rare occasions Mare Orientale is turned slightly more toward the Earth, and becomes a little more discernible.{{sfn|Baum|Whitaker|2007|p=129}}

Although various astronomers had observed hints of the mare, it was first fully described by the German [[astronomer]] [[Julius Heinrich Franz|Julius Franz]] in his 1906 book ''Der Mond'' ("The Moon"). Franz also gave the mare its name. At the time, it was located on what by convention was considered the eastern side of the Moon, hence Franz named it the "Eastern Sea".{{sfn|Baum|Whitaker|2007|p=132}} It is on the eastern side of the Moon as viewed from Earth, the western side as viewed by an astronaut walking on the Moon. In 1961, however, the [[International Astronomical Union]] adopted the astronautic convention for East and West on the Moon and this limb became the western edge.{{sfn|Baum|Whitaker|2007|p=129}}

The first detailed study of the Mare Orientale was by [[Hugh Percy Wilkins]], who called it "Lunar Mare X".{{sfn|Baum|Whitaker|2007|p=133}} Franz's discoveries were not well known,{{sfn|Baum|Whitaker|2007|p=133}} and in the 1976 edition of his book ''Guide to the Moon'', [[Patrick Moore]] claims that he and Wilkins discovered and named Mare Orientale in 1946. However, Moore credits Franz as discoverer in his ''2009 Yearbook of Astronomy'' (p.&amp;nbsp;133-135).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">The '''Nordic Network for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies (NIES)''' is a research network for environmental studies based primarily in the humanities. By organizing regular conferences, symposia and workshops, NIES aims to create opportunities for researchers in the [[Nordic countries]] who address environmental questions to exchange ideas and develop their work in various interdisciplinary contexts. Fields represented by members of the network include [[Ecocriticism]], [[Environmental history]], [[Environmental philosophy]], [[Science and Technology Studies]], [[Art history]], [[Media studies]], [[Ecological economics]], [[Human Geography]], [[Cultural studies]], [[Anthropology]], [[Archeology]], [[Sustainability Studies]], [[Education for Sustainability]] and [[Landscape Studies]].

NIES is responsible for organizing and editing the research series '''''Studies in the Environmental Humanities (SEH)''''' published by [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]].

Formed in 2007, NIES was originally a cooperation among small academic groups in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Today, it includes more than 100 researchers from all the [[Nordic countries]].  The network actively sponsors a wide range of educational initiatives, research projects and public outreach activities and is a key partner in pan-European and other international initiatives to build capacity and foster theoretical advancement in the Environmental Humanities. Since January 2011, the network's primary anchoring institution is Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall, Sweden. National anchoring institutions include University of Turku, University of Oslo, University of Iceland, Uppsala University and University of Southern Denmark. The network's current phase of operations (2011–2015) is supported by NordForsk.

The '''Offshore Industry Liaison Committee''' (OILC) was a [[trade union]] set up in the [[United Kingdom]] in response to the deaths of 167 workers on the [[Piper Alpha]] platform on July 6, 1988. Their deaths would be followed by the death of another worker on the [[Ocean Odyssey]] [[Oil platform|oil rig]] on September 22, 1988.

The OILC is now a branch of the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT]] the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers having agreed to merge from April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmt.org.uk/templates/internal.asp?nodeid=105008&amp;int1stparentnodeid=89732 RMT Press Release April 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830122402/http://www.rmt.org.uk/Templates/Internal.asp?NodeID=105008&amp;int1stParentNodeID=89732 |date=2010-08-30 }} Accessed 18 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plennie Lawrence Wingo''' (January 24, 1895 &amp;ndash; October 2, 1993) walked backwards from [[Santa Monica, California]] to [[Istanbul, Turkey]] (about 13,000&amp;nbsp;km/8,000 miles) from April 15, 1931 to October 24, 1932 at the age of 36. He remains the Guinness record holder for "greatest extent of reverse pedestrianism".

==Biography==

Plennie L. Wingo owned a small diner in [[Abilene, Texas]], but it closed with the onset of the Great Depression and Wingo was out of work like much of America in 1931. At the time, "stunts" were commonplace such as [[flagpole sitting]], or Bill Williams who pushed a peanut up [[Pikes Peak]] with his nose. Wingo overheard some children say everything had been done, there was nothing left to do, to which Wingo spontaneously responded no one had ever walked around the world backwards. The idea stuck with him, and he thought the stunt could be a way to make some money. He bought a pair of reverse-looking mirrored glasses and trained with a local doctor and on April 15, 1931, facing west, set out east.&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt; 

Wingo had little money and depended on the kindness of strangers and the selling of signed postcards for twenty-five cents to anyone who stopped and asked him what he was doing walking backwards (he would return 18 months later with $4 to his name). He was often stopped by police but carried copies of local newspaper articles describing his stunt. In New York City, he agreed to walk around the top ledge of a 12-story building in return for money, but he was robbed by a partner. Wingo eventually found the thief, beat him up, and ended up in jail but the judge let him go on learning of the circumstances. Wingo walked to Boston where he took working passage on a ship to Germany under a cruel chief steward who worked Wingo mercilessly. From there he walked through Germany south to Turkey where he was told by authorities that he had to leave the country for his own safety. A wealthy Italian paid for his return to Santa Monica, California where he then walked backwards to Abilene. He wore-out 13 pairs of shoes on the trip.&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt;

Although Wingo often made local newspapers on his journey, his fame quickly faded. Years later, he documented his voyage in the book ''Around the World Backwards''. It was published in 1966 with a small publisher that did not sell many copies, but re-released it in 1982 under a new publisher and cover.&lt;ref&gt;Wingo, Plennie L. ''Around the world backwards'' Eakin Press, 1982. {{ISBN|978-0-89015-363-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1976 at the age of 81, he walked across the width of California, selling postcards for a dollar.&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt; In preparation Wingo managed to "talk his way" onto the ''[[Johnny Carson Show]]'' (July 20, 1976) which paid him $342 for the appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.weeklystandard.com/thomas-vinciguerra/the-man-who-walked-backward-review-the-retropedestrian |title=The Retropedestrian |work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |author=Thomas Vinciguerra |date=September 23, 2018 |accessdate=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A biography of Wingo was published in 2018 by Ben Montgomery, titled ''The Man Who Walked Backward: An American Dreamer's Search for Meaning in the Great Depression''.&lt;ref name=montgomery&gt;{{cite book |title=The Man Who Walked Backward: An American Dreamer's Search for Meaning in the Great Depression |publisher= Little, Brown Spark |author=Ben Montgomery |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remains the Guinness record holder for "greatest extent of reverse pedestrianism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUaHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT158 |title=Guinness World Records 2015 |publisher=Guinness World Records |author= |year=2015 |page=155 |accessdate=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at home age 98 and is buried in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]].&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt;

===Early years===
In 1922, two former [[Tufts University School of Engineering]] roommates Laurence K. Marshall and [[Vannevar Bush]], along with scientist Charles G. Smith, founded the American Appliance Company in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Raytheon Australia. [http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=12 History.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830113341/http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=12 |date=2007-08-30 }} ''Raytheon Marketing Material''.&lt;/ref&gt; Its focus, which was originally on new [[refrigeration]] technology, soon shifted to [[electronics]]. The company's first product was a gaseous ([[helium]]) [[rectifier]] that was based on Charles Smith's earlier [[Astronomy|astronomical]] research of the star [[Zeta Puppis]].&lt;ref name="ordeal"&gt;Otto J. Scott, The Creative Ordeal, (New York, Atheneum, 1974),16–32&lt;/ref&gt; The electron tube was christened with the name ''Raytheon'' ("light of/from the gods"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raytheon.com/ourcompany/history/early/ Raytheon Company: The Early Days]. Raytheon.com. September 30, 2007. Retrieved on 2012-02-04. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415102900/http://www.raytheon.com/ourcompany/history/early/ |date=April 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and was used in a [[battery eliminator]], a type of [[Receiver (radio)|radio-receiver]] [[power supply]] that plugged into the [[power grid]] in place of large [[battery (electricity)|batteries]]. This made it possible to convert household [[alternating current]] to [[direct current]] for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive, short-lived batteries.

In 1925, the company changed its name to Raytheon Manufacturing Company and began marketing its rectifier, under the Raytheon brand name, with commercial success. In 1928 Raytheon merged with Q.R.S. Company, an American manufacturer of electron tubes and switches, to form the successor of the same name, Raytheon Manufacturing Company.{{cn|date=March 2017}}  By the 1930s, it had already grown to become one of the world's largest vacuum tube manufacturing companies.{{cn|date=March 2017}} In 1933 it diversified by acquiring Acme-Delta Company, a producer of [[transformer]]s, power equipment, and electronic [[auto parts]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===During World War II===
Early in [[World War II]], [[physicist]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] invented the [[magnetron]], a specialized [[microwave]]-generating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft. American companies were then sought by the US government to perfect and [[mass-produce]] the magnetron for ground-based, airborne, and shipborne radar systems, and, with support from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[Radiation Laboratory]] (recently formed to investigate [[microwave radar]]), Raytheon received a contract to build the devices. Within a few months of being awarded the contract, Raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture [[magnetron]] tubes for use in radar sets and then complete [[radar system]]s. At war's end in 1945 the company was responsible for about 80 percent of all magnetrons manufactured. During the war Raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems, particularly for submarine detection. Raytheon ranked 71st among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] &amp; [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619&lt;/ref&gt;

Raytheon's research on the magnetron tube revealed the potential of microwaves to cook food. In 1945, Raytheon's [[Percy Spencer]] invented the [[microwave oven]] by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food. In 1947, the company demonstrated the Radarange microwave oven for commercial use.

===After World War II===
In 1945, the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the Submarine Signal Company (founded in 1901), a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment. With its broadened capabilities, Raytheon developed the first [[guidance system]] for a missile that could intercept a flying target. In 1948, Raytheon began to manufacture [[guided missile]]s. In 1950, its [[SAM-N-2 Lark|Lark]] missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight. Raytheon then received military contracts to develop the air-to-air [[AIM-7 Sparrow|Sparrow]] and ground-to-air [[MIM-23 Hawk|Hawk]] missiles—projects that received impetus from the [[Korean War]]. In later decades, it remained a major producer of missiles, among them the [[Patriot antimissile missile]] and the air-to-air [[Phoenix missile]]. 
In 1959, Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Apelco Applied Electronics, which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear, as well as less-expensive Japanese suppliers of products such as marine/weather band radios and [[radio direction finder|direction-finding gear]]. In the same year, it changed its name to '''Raytheon Company'''.

During the post-war years, Raytheon also made generally low- to medium-powered radio and television [[transmitter]]s and related equipment for the commercial market, but the high-powered market was solidly in the hands of larger, better financed competitors such as [[Continental Electronics]], [[General Electric]] and [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]].

In the 1950s, Raytheon began manufacturing [[transistor]]s, including the [[CK722]], priced and marketed to hobbyists.

In 1961, the British electronics company [[A.C. Cossor]] merged with Raytheon, following its sale by [[Philips]]. The new Company's name was Raytheon Cossor. The Cossor side of the organisation is still current in the Raytheon group {{as of|2010}}.

In 1965, it acquired [[Amana Refrigeration]], Inc., a manufacturer of [[refrigerators]] and [[air conditioners]]. Using the Amana brand name and its distribution channels, Raytheon began selling the first countertop household [[microwave oven]] in 1967 and became a dominant manufacturer in the microwave oven business.

In 1966, the company entered the educational [[publisher|publishing]] business with the acquisition of [[D.C. Heath and Company]], marketing an influential physics textbook developed by the [[Physical Science Study Committee]].

===1980s===
In 1980, Raytheon acquired [[Beechcraft|Beech Aircraft Corporation]], a leading manufacturer of general aviation aircraft founded in 1932 by [[Walter H. Beech]]. In 1993 the company expanded its aircraft activities by adding the Hawker line of business jets by acquiring Corporate Jets Inc., the business jet product line of [[British Aerospace]] (now [[BAE Systems]]). These two entities were merged in 1994 to become the Raytheon Aircraft Company. In the first quarter of 2007 Raytheon sold its aircraft operations, which subsequently operated as [[Hawker Beechcraft]], and since 2014 have been units of [[Textron Aviation]]. The product line of Raytheon's aircraft subsidiary included [[business jet]]s such as the [[Hawker 800XP]] and [[Hawker 4000]], the [[Hawker 400|Beechjet 400A]], and the [[Beechcraft Premier|Premier I]]; the popular [[Beechcraft Super King Air|King Air]] series of twin turboprops; and piston-engine aircraft such as the [[Beechcraft Bonanza|Bonanza]]. Its special-mission aircraft included the single-turboprop [[T-6A Texan II]], which the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States Navy]] had chosen as their primary [[training aircraft]].

===1990s===
In 1991, during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Raytheon's [[Patriot missile]] received great international exposure, resulting in a substantial increase in sales for the company outside the United States. In an effort to establish leadership in the defense electronics business, Raytheon purchased in quick succession Dallas-based [[E-Systems]] (1995), [[Chrysler Corporation]]'s defense electronics and aircraft-modification businesses, which had previously acquired companies such as Electrospace systems (1996) (portions of these businesses were later sold to [[L-3 Communications]]), and the defense unit of [[Texas Instruments]]—[[Texas Instruments DSEG|Defense Systems &amp; Electronics Group]] (1997). Also in 1997, Raytheon acquired the aerospace and defense business of [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] from [[Hughes Electronics Corporation]]—a subsidiary of [[General Motors]], which included a number of product lines previously purchased by Hughes Electronics including the former [[General Dynamics]] [[missile]] business (Pomona facility), the defense portion of [[Delco Electronics]] (Delco Systems Operations), and [[Magnavox Electronic Systems]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Raytheon also divested itself of several nondefense businesses in the 1990s, including [[Amana Refrigeration]] and [[Seismograph Service Ltd]] (sold to [[Schlumberger]]-[[Geco-Prakla]]). On October 12, 1999 Raytheon exited the [[personal rapid transit]] (PRT) business as it terminated its [[PRT 2000]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/PRT/PRT2000_Concept.html PRT 2000 System Concept], "Design and Commercialization of the PRT 2000 Personal Rapid Transit System" by S.

'''Raytheon SixSigma'''

Raytheon Six Sigma is the company's disciplined, knowledge-based approach designed to increase productivity, grow the business, enhance customer satisfaction and build a customer culture that embraces all of these goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://raytheon.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1636|title=Raytheon News Release Archive|last=Communications|first=Raytheon Corporate|website=Raytheon News Release Archive|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Burnham brought Six Sigma to Raytheon from AlliedSignal in 1998. This internal service provides six steps that guide projects to completion, the six steps being: visualize, commit, prioritize, characterize, improve, and achieve. Raytheon mentions in its annual reports the benefits it has enjoyed through SixSigma. It has gained USD $3.8 billion in financial benefit and has set a common language and culture across the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isixsigma.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/raytheon-six-sigma/|title=Raytheon Six Sigma|website=www.isixsigma.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Government relationship===
As the vast majority of Raytheon's revenues have been obtained from defense contracts, there has been a tight relationship of cooperation between itself and the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] and other U.S. government departments and agencies (e.g. in the Fiscal Year 2007 the [[National Science Foundation]] awarded Raytheon $152 million in grants, more than to any other institution and organization in the country,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dellweb.bfa.nsf.gov/Top50Inst2/default.asp NSF Award Summary: Top 50 Institutions FY 2007]. Dellweb.bfa.nsf.gov. Retrieved on 2012-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt; for managing NSF [[South Pole Station]]). This, along with heavy lobbying, has led to perennial charges of influence peddling. Raytheon, for instance, contributed nearly a million dollars to various defense-related political campaigns in the presidential election year of 2004, spending much more than that on lobbying expenses.&lt;ref name="Spring 2004 The Politics of Contracting."&gt;[http://www.pogo.org/ Project on Government Oversight.] Spring 2004 The Politics of Contracting. [http://www.pogo.org/p/contracts/c/co-030612-raytheon.html Raytheon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906222118/http://pogo.org/p/contracts/c/co-030612-raytheon.html |date=2007-09-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; And there are many tight ties between the company and all levels of government.

===Case of illegally obtaining classified information in a bidding process===
In March 1990, Raytheon pleaded guilty to one felony count of illegally obtaining classified [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] budget and planning documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District [[Judge]] Albert V. Bryan, Jr. imposed a [[US dollar|$]]10,000 criminal fine for one [[felony]] count of "conveyance without authority" and $900,000 in civil penalties and damages. The documents allegedly gave Raytheon an unfair advantage against its competitors in bidding for weapons contracts. Although the plea only involved 1983 Air Force documents, [[United States Attorney]] Henry Hudson said Raytheon also illegally obtained a wide range of secret [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] documents.

===Disputed claims of the Patriot missile===
During the 1991 [[Gulf War]], Raytheon received widespread publicity in the United States in connection with its manufacture of the Patriot missile ([[MIM-104 Patriot]]). The Patriot missile is an [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missile]] that was upgraded to have some capability against [[ballistic missile]]s. The Patriot had allegedly intercepted [[Scud]] missiles launched by [[Iraq]] in its defense against the U.S.-led invasion. When President [[George H. W. Bush]] traveled to Raytheon's Patriot manufacturing plant in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], during the [[Gulf War]], he declared, the "Patriot is 41 for 42: 42 Scuds engaged, 41 intercepted!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:"The Patriot missile system was not the spectacular success in the Persian Gulf War that the American public was led to believe. There is little evidence to prove that the Patriot hit more than a few Scud missiles launched by Iraq during the Gulf War, and there are some doubts about even these engagements. The public and the [[United States Congress]] were misled by definitive statements of success issued by administration and Raytheon representatives during and after the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Contract disputes===
In October 1994, Raytheon paid $4 million to settle a U.S. government claim that it inflated a defense contract for antimissile radar.&lt;ref name="Raytheon v White"&gt;United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit RAYTHEON COMPANY (doing business as Raytheon Systems Company), Appellant, v. Thomas E. White, SECRETARY OF THE ARMY, Appellee. [http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/01opinions/01-1350.html 01-1350]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[PAVE PAWS]] (Precision Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased Array Warning System) system was designed to detect incoming submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The government claimed in a federal lawsuit that Raytheon inflated a contract to upgrade two of four PAVE PAWS sites by proposing to hire higher-skilled employees than were necessary for the job.&lt;ref name="Raytheon v White"/&gt;

Just one year earlier, on October 14, 1993, Raytheon paid $3.7 million to settle allegations that it misled the [[United States Department of Defense]] by overstating the labor costs involved in manufacturing Patriot missiles.&lt;ref name="Raytheon v White"/&gt; "The recovery of this money is yet another warning to contractors that the Truth in Negotiations Act's information disclosure requirements will be strictly and sternly enforced," Frank Hunger, assistant [[Attorney General|attorney general]], said in a statement.&lt;ref name="Raytheon v White"/&gt;

===Brazilian SIVAM project===
Allegations of [[bribery]] were made against Raytheon in 1995 in connection with its efforts to win a 1.4 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] [[dollar]] [[radar]] contract from [[Brazil]] for the [[SIVAM]] project. SIVAM, the acronym for "System for Vigilance over the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]," was a complex radar [[surveillance]] system for use in monitoring the [[Amazon rainforest]], allegedly to curb the trafficking of [[illegal drugs|narcotics]] and to curb [[illegal logging]] or burning of the forest. Brazilian police wiretapped a telephone conversation between a special advisor to the [[Brazilian President]] [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], and Raytheon's operative in Brazil, Jose Afonso Assumpcão. According to transcripts published in the Brazilian national weekly ''Isto É'', when Assumpcão told Gomes dos Santos that Brazilian Senator Gilberto Miranda might block the Raytheon contract, Gomes dos Santos responded, "Damn, did you already pay this guy?". Gomes dos Santos and Brazil's aviation minister resigned because of allegations that this conversation suggested that bribes were paid. Nonetheless, Raytheon ultimately was awarded the contract after [[lobbying]] by the administration of U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]].

===AGES lawsuit===
In 1996, a corporation called AGES Group filed a lawsuit against Raytheon in a [[United States district court|federal court]] in [[Alabama]] over a $450 million contract to service [[C-12 Huron]] and [[Beechcraft King Air|U-21]] military aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Gregg | last=Krupa | url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_theme=current&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=BGBK&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200EADDDA99ECF46BD%20)&amp;p_nbid=E78P5EAYMTA4NjA1NzI3NC44ODQ4NDY6MTo2OmJvc3Rvbg&amp;
|title=Raytheon Unit Settles Industrial-Spying Allegations | publisher=Boston Globe | date=1999-05-13 | accessdate=2006-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Herald]] reported that AGES alleged that the security firm [[Wackenhut|Wackenhut Corporation]], hired by Raytheon, used video and audio [[surveillance]] to [[espionage|spy]] on a consulting firm hired by AGES to help it prepare its bid. AGES also alleged that stolen confidential pricing documents were turned over to Raytheon. Both Raytheon and AGES had been vying for the contract, which Raytheon had held for decades but AGES won in 1996. On May 12, 1999, [[Reuters]] reported that Raytheon would pay $3 million to AGES Group and purchase $13 million worth of AGES aircraft parts to settle the AGES lawsuit. The settlement was exceptional in that the parties agreed that [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] would be entered against Raytheon, legally establishing the validity of AGES' allegations.

===Securities litigation===
In October 1999, Raytheon was the subject of a number of securities [[class action]] lawsuits alleging it had issued a series of materially false and misleading statements including overstating the company's 1997 and 1998 revenues, concealing cost overruns and inflating its financial results. The suits were brought in response to a massive drop in value of Raytheon's common stock as traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. On Tuesday, October 12, 1999, Raytheon shares traded at about 45% below their level on October 11, 1999. The plunge in stock prices was triggered by a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' report that Raytheon was over cost or behind schedule on more than a dozen fixed-price defense contracts. This crash represented a loss of about $8 billion in market value in a single day. On May 13, 2004 Raytheon reported that it had reached a preliminary agreement to pay $410 million in cash and securities to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging it misled investors by not disclosing difficulties on various Pentagon and construction projects five years before.

===Swanson's Unwritten Rules of Management===
On April 24, 2006 in a statement released by Raytheon, CEO Swanson admitted to [[plagiarism]] in claiming authorship for his booklet, "Swanson's Unwritten Rules of Management," after a report by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Silent Guardian testing on prisoners===
In August 2010, Raytheon announced that it had partnered with a jail in [[Castaic, California|Castaic]], [[California]] to use prisoners as test subjects for the new non-lethal Silent Guardian [[active denial system]] that "[...] penetrates about a 64th of an inch under your skin. That's about where your pain receptacles are. So it's what it would feel like if you just opened up the doors of a blast furnace."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Zapping Inmates To Control Them: Harmless Or Torture? |work= [[NPR]] | date=10 September 2010|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129630188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvesting personal data from social networking websites===
In 2010 Raytheon developed an "extreme-scale analytics" system named Rapid Information Overlay Technology (RIOT), which allows the user to track people's movements and even predict their behaviour by mining data from social networking sites including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Gowalla]], and [[Foursquare]]. Raytheon claims that it has not sold this software to any clients, but has shared it with US government and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=Ryan|title=Software that tracks people on social media created by defence firm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/10/software-tracks-social-media-defence|newspaper=Guardian|date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company spokesperson told PC magazine in 2013 that "Raytheon, as a leader in cybersecurity, offers advanced capabilities to government customers.

===Production of depleted uranium weapons===

Raytheon has patented a number of weapon designs which allow for the use of [[depleted uranium]]. For instance there is the patent "Missile warhead design"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5939662|title=Missile warhead design|publisher=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1997) which suggests the use of tungsten but adds that "In addition, other ballast sizes and other materials such as lead or depleted uranium may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention". There is also the patent "Guided kinetic penetrator"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.fr/patents/US7795567|title=Guided kinetic penetrator|publisher=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005) which patents "9. The projectile guidance system of claim 1, wherein the kinetic penetrator body comprises at least one of tungsten, carbide steel, and depleted uranium". The patent "Improved missile warhead design"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.fr/patents/WO1999035461A2|title=Improved missile warhead design|publisher=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1998) which patents "2. The invention of Claim 1 wherein the ballast mechanism (16) includes tungsten, lead and/or depleted uranium material(s)", the "Cluster explosively-formed penetrator warheads" patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.fr/patents/US8434411|title=Cluster explosively-formed penetrator warheads|publisher=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011) which patents "The spherically-shaped explosive device of claim 1, wherein each of the plurality of liners comprises a material selected from a group consisting of copper, molybdenum, tungsten, aluminum, tantalum, depleted uranium, lead, tin, cadmium, cobalt, magnesium, titanium, zinc, zirconium, beryllium, nickel, silver, and combinations thereof", and the "[[Dense Inert Metal Explosive|Low-collateral damage directed fragmentation]] munition" patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.fr/patents/US9243876|title=Low-collateral damage directed fragmentation munition|publisher=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2014) which uses a tungsten or uranium ring ("The ring 44 may be made of tungsten or depleted uranium, to give non-limiting examples") to direct the energy of the weapon.&lt;ref&gt;A quick online search using a service such as Google Patents will show more examples of Raytheon patents which include the use of uranium.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental record==
Two lawsuits were filed against a Raytheon Company plant in St. Petersburg, Florida, due to concern with health risks, property values, and contamination in April 2008.&lt;ref name="tampabay.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/article463739.ece |title=Is Raytheon site poisoning St. Petersburg neighborhood? |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2008-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423175203/http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/article463739.ece |archivedate=2008-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raytheon was given until the end of the month to independently test whether or not the groundwater that originated from its area was contaminated. According to the [[Florida Department of Environmental Protection]] (DEP), the groundwater contained [[carcinogenic]] contaminants, including [[trichloroethylene]], [[1,4-dioxane]], and [[vinyl chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.injuryboard.com/national-news/Raytheon39s-Florida-Neighbors-Sue-Over-Contamination.aspx?googleid=238336 |title=Raytheon's Florida Neighbors Sue Over Water Contamination |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2008-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510082742/http://www.injuryboard.com/national-news/Raytheon39s-Florida-Neighbors-Sue-Over-Contamination.aspx?googleid=238336 |archivedate=2008-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DEP also reported that the clouds contained other toxins, such as lead and [[toluene]].&lt;ref name="tampabay.com"/&gt;

In 1995, Raytheon acquired Dallas-based E-Systems, including a site in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. In November 1991, prior to Raytheon's acquisition, contamination had been discovered at the E-Systems site. Soil and groundwater had been contaminated with the volatile organic compounds [[trichloroethylene]] and [[1,4-Dioxane]]. In 2005, groundwater monitoring indicated polluted groundwater was moving into areas outside the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dep.state.fl.us/southwest/Raytheon/pages/Site_Summary.htm |title=Raytheon Site Summary |publisher=Florida Department of Environmental Protection |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015174454/http://www.dep.state.fl.us/southwest/Raytheon/pages/Site_Summary.htm |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to DEP documentation, Raytheon has tested wells on its site since 1996 but had not delivered a final report; therefore, it was given a deadline on May 31, 2008 to investigate its groundwater.&lt;ref name="tampabay.com"/&gt; Contamination in the area has not affected anyone's drinking water supply or health, yet due to negative local media coverage lawsuits are being filed with claims against Raytheon citing decreases in property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dep.state.fl.us/southwest/Raytheon/pages/FAQ.htm |title=Florida DEP |publisher=Florida Department of Environmental Protection |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015035358/http://www.dep.state.fl.us/southwest/Raytheon/pages/FAQ.htm |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case, Raytheon was ordered by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to treat groundwater at the Tucson Plant (acquired during the merger with Hughes) in Arizona since Raytheon used and disposed metals, [[chlorinated solvent]]s, and other substances at the plant since 1951.&lt;ref name="Environmental Protection Agency"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/2dd7f669225439b78525735900400c31/71b1922ba7a0e61c8525731700688dd7!OpenDocument
 |title= Environmental Protection Agency |date=July 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA further required the installation and operation of an oxidation process system to treat the solvents and make the water safe to drink.&lt;ref name="Environmental Protection Agency"/&gt;

On 9 August 2006, The Stream Contact Centre in Derry, Northern Ireland, which had a contract with Raytheon at the time, was [[Raytheon 9|attacked by protesters]]. They destroyed the computers, documents, and mainframe of the office, and proceeded to occupy it for eight hours prior to their arrest.

The activists were charged with criminal damage and affray. The trial of six of the accused began May 19, 2008, in the Laganside Courts in Belfast. Colm Bryce, Gary Donnelly, Kieran Gallagher, Michael Gallagher, Sean Heaton, Jimmy Kelly,  Paddy McDaid and Eamonn O'Donnell were acquitted of all charges on 11 June, with Eamonn McCann found guilty of the theft of two computer discs.[7]

'''''The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits''''' (sometimes shortened to ''Worms'') is an 1881 book by [[Charles Darwin]] on [[earthworms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the action of Worms, with observations on their Habits''|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=January 1882|pages=179–202|volume=153|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092526755;view=1up;seq=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his last scientific book, and was published shortly before his death (see [[Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms]]). Exploring earthworm behaviour and ecology, it continued the theme common throughout his work that gradual changes over long periods of time can lead to large and sometimes surprising consequences. It was the first significant work on soil [[bioturbation]], although that term was not used by Darwin (it first appeared in the soil and geomorphic literature one hundred years later).

==Paper "On the Formation of Mould"==
After returning from the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey expedition]] in October 1836, Darwin was intensively occupied with further establishing his reputation as an innovative geologist, as well as finding suitable experts to describe his [[natural history]] collections and arranging for publication of their work as the multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]''. Near the outset of the voyage he had planned a book on geology, and during it extracts from his letters on geology had been privately published by his tutor [[John Stevens Henslow]]. Darwin now published papers on "proofs of recent elevation on the coast of Chili", "deposits containing extinct Mammalia" and "coral formations". He also rewrote his journal to incorporate observations from his notebooks as the book now called ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', and began brain-storming in his notebooks about [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref name=vw&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin’s health suffered from the pressure of work, and on 20 September 1837 having been urged by his doctors "knock off all work" he visited his home in [[Shrewsbury]] then went on to stay with his relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, home of his uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah Wedgwood]]. Uncle Jos pointed out an area of ground where [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[cinders]] spread years previously had vanished into the soil, forming layers under a top layer of [[loam]]. Jos suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, but apparently thought that this would be of little interest to his nephew, who was working on continental scale geological problems.&lt;ref name=dm233&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, Charles did find it interesting and throughout his life he sustained an interest in this "unsung creature which, in its untold millions, transformed the land as the [[coral]] polyps did the tropical sea".&lt;!-- Add citation --&gt;

He returned to London on October 21st, and prepared a paper on worms forming mould.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|2006|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR158.1–76&amp;pageseq=22 12 verso–13 recto]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper on the role of earthworms in [[Pedogenesis|soil formation]] was read out by Darwin at the [[Geological Society of London]] on 1 November 1837.&lt;ref name=ew38&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an uncommonly mundane subject for the society, and his peers may have hoped to hear of something more grandiose, even seeing this paper as highlighting Darwin's growing idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=dm233/&gt; The leading geologist [[William Buckland]] subsequently recommended Darwin's paper for publication, praising it as "a new &amp; important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence on the surface of the Earth—in fact a new Geological Power", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.&lt;ref name=Letter404&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 404 – Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838 |accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper appeared in the ''Proceedings of the Geological Society of London'' in 1838,&lt;ref name=ew38/&gt; and was published with a [[woodcut]] illustration in the ''Transactions of the Geological Society'' in 1840.&lt;ref name=ew40&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewed work on earthworms==
From his brain-storming about transmutation towards the end of 1838, Darwin conceived of his theory of [[natural selection]] "by which to work", as his "prime hobby". His main work on the ''Beagle'' collections continued, and in 1842 he published the first of three volumes on geology, ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]''. He then allowed himself to write out the first "pencil sketch" of his theory. Subsequently, in September 1842, the family moved to rural [[Down House]] where he had space for experimental plant and animal breeding, and surroundings to observe nature.&lt;ref name=vw/&gt; In December of that year he had a quantity of broken chalk spread over a part of a long established pasture field near the house, "for the sake of observing at some future period to what depth it would become buried."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1881|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1357&amp;pageseq=154 139]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 he was having disagreements with [[St George Mivart]] about ''[[The Descent of Man]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Darwin cut communication with Mivart {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and went the less controversial direction of the lowly worm. His network of [[correspondence of Charles Darwin|correspondents]] and fans responded to his interest and "earthworm anecdotes began surfacing in his mountain of mail". He had been interested in earthworms "since his first fishing days at The Mount and flirting days at Maer". Still, other work constrained him. Broken off from ''Descent'', he had to finish his next work ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stonehenge 1877.JPG|left|thumb|His research included a railway trip to [[Stonehenge]]]]
By 1876, with his [[Bernard Darwin|first grandson]] on the way, he felt his writing life was nearly over, with so much unfinished. He wanted to write on earthworms "before joining them", but also had two more plant books in mind, and a revision of ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' to work on. He also began an [[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|autobiographical work]] intended for his family's eyes only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 622}}&lt;/ref&gt; After turning away a request to support a controversial book on contraception (''[[Fruits of Philosophy]]'') – Darwin was opposed to it – he got back to work on flowers and worms. As with much of his geological and [[evolution]]ary work, worms were a case of [[gradualism|gradual]], barely noticeable changes accumulating over time into large effects. He even went on a two-hour excursion to [[Stonehenge]] to see how its monoliths had been buried by earthworm castings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was occupied by worms at [[Downe]] in 1880, his work coming first. He had help from the family, even receiving soil samples from [[Abinger]]'s Roman ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 643}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told Vladimir Kovalevsky (his Russian translator) of slow progress with his new book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earthworm klitellum copulation beentree.jpg|thumb|Earthworms mate in daylight, but are generally [[nocturnal]] above ground.]]
Darwin calculated that there were 53,767 earthworms recycling away per acre. He carried out experiments indoors, where they worked the earth inside pots in a worm-littered room. He experimented with stimuli at night: strong light would send them into their burrows ("like a rabbit" said Darwin's grandson Bernard), but heat and sound had no effect. Their food preferences were also tested, raw carrots being their favourite.&lt;ref name="Moore1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darwin restored2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A photograph of Darwin around the time the book was published.]]
Darwin was fascinated by their [[ethology|behaviour]], from enjoying "the pleasure of eating" (based on their eagerness for certain foods) to their [[mating|sexual passions]], "strong enough to overcome... their dread of light", even to their social feelings ("crawling over each other's bodies").&lt;ref name="Moore1991a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[foraging]] was especially intriguing: they dragged leaves into their burrows, pulling them in the most efficient way, by their pointed end. On these semi-intelligent creatures Darwin wrote that they obtained a "notion, however rude, of the shape of an object", perhaps by feeling it out. Worms, "five or six feet" below the ground ploughed farmers fields. Darwin felt we "ought to be grateful" to these little recyclers, which he compared to "a man... born blind and deaf". He was wondering how long it would be until he would be consumed by worms himself{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. It would surely be his last major work; he told German translator [[Julius Victor Carus|Victor Carus]] "I have little strength &amp; feel very old".&lt;ref name="Moore1991" /&gt;

By 1881 he was unable to summon the strength for revisions and handed ''Worms'' on to [[Francis Darwin|Frank]]. His [[illness of Charles Darwin|health]] gave him troubles; he complained to his long-time friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] that he looked forward to "Down graveyard as the sweetest place on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the book he had been anticipating for decades, he hurried his publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] to hasten publication of ''Worms'' even at the risk of not making a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a dinner with [[Edward Aveling]] (soon the son-in-law of [[Karl Marx]]) and other [[atheist]]s, he was asked how he had turned to such an "insignificant" subject as worms, to which he replied "I have been studying their habits for forty years." As with his [[Charles Darwin's views on religion|religious views]], the old naturalist did not see things the same way as Aveling. In Darwin's view, the "insignificant" was the foundation of much greater phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Darwin. Earthworm, Fig. 4B.JPG|thumb|A casting from the Nilgiri Mountains in South India]]
Worms are found in many places, from the forest floor to mountains, and in many locations around the world. Though they are considered terrestrial animals, they are really semi-aquatic, like other [[annelid]]s; they die quickly in air but survive for months in water. Though inactive during the day, they sometimes come out of their burrows at night. They are eaten by [[thrush (bird)|thrush]]es and other birds in large numbers because they lie close to the surface. They have well developed muscular, nervous, circulatory and digestive systems, the latter being quite unique. Though eyeless, they respond to the intensity and duration of light. They also slowly respond to temperature. They have no hearing, but are sensitive to vibrations. Their sense of smell is feeble, but they are able to find their preferred foods. [[Omnivorous]] animals, they swallow much earth and extract food from it. Worms live chiefly on half decayed [[leaf|leaves]], partially digested by a [[Pancreatic juice|pancreatic solution]] before ingestion. This extra-stomachal digestion is not unlike that which Darwin had previously described as occurring in [[Insectivorous Plants (book)|''Insectivorous Plants'']]. The structure and physiology of the [[Oligochaeta#Internal anatomy|calciferous glands]] of earthworms are described. Many hypotheses had been advanced for their function; Darwin believed them to be primarily for [[excretion]] and secondarily a [[digestion]] aid.

Thin leaves are seized with the mouth, while thick ones are dragged by creating a vacuum. Leaves and stones are used to plug up the burrow. This may deter predators, keep out water and/or keep out chilled air (the latter is Darwin's preferred function). Leaves are dragged in mostly by the tips, which is the easiest way of doing it, but when the base is narrower the worms change behaviour. They drag [[pine needle]] clusters in by the base. [[Petiole (botany)|Petiole]]s are used to plug up burrows, and for food. Worms drag experimental triangles of paper by the apex most of the time, and do not rely on [[trial and error]]. Worms excavate burrows by consuming material or, preferably, pushing it away. They mainly consume [[soil]] for nutrients. They are found down to six or more feet, especially in extreme conditions. Burrows are lined, which serve several functions, and terminate in a chamber lined with stones or seeds. Worms are found all over the planet, some on isolated islands; how they got there is a mystery. Darwin draws on correspondence with people from around the world such as [[Fritz Müller]] in Brazil.

[[File:Darwin, Earthworm, Fig.  7.JPG|thumb|Figure from the book showing a sunken stone from Stonehenge]]
The amount of earth brought to the surface by worms can be estimated by the rate at which objects on the surface are buried and by weighing the earth brought up in a given time. Information from farmers on marl, cinders etc. sinking into the ground allowed Darwin to make calculations. He conducted a 29-year experiment on chalk at a field near his house. Objects of all sorts "work themselves downards" as farmers say. Large stones sink because worms fill up any hollows with castings, then eject them beyond the perimeter and the ground around them starts to rise. He visited [[Stonehenge]] and found some outer stones partly buried, the turf sloping up to meet them (see figure 7). Darwin weighed castings and had friends do so in other countries. He also weighed castings per unit area per year, then worked out how thick a layer castings would make, compared with rates of sinking. Additionally, he worked out casting weight per worm per year.

[[File:Darwins Wurmstein im Gras, Naturhistorisches Museum Wien.jpg|thumb|Darwin's experiments included measuring the speed with which stones slowly settle into the earth.]]
Worms have preserved many ancient objects under the ground. Darwin describes an ancient [[Roman villa]] in [[Abinger]], Surrey. Worms have penetrated the concrete walls and even mortar. Similar subsidence occurred at [[Beaulieu Abbey]], Hampshire, with worms penetrating gaps between the tiles. His sons [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] and [[Horace Darwin|Horace]] visited [[Chedworth Roman Villa]] in Gloucestershire, while William reported on [[Brading Roman Villa]], Isle of Wight. Darwin goes into some detail on the well preserved ruins of [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester Roman Town]], Hampshire, with the help of the Rev. J. G. Joyce. Finally he discusses the case of the [[Viroconium Cornoviorum|Viroconium]] Roman town ruins at [[Wroxeter]], Shropshire, with the help of Dr. H. Johnson, who made observations including depth of vegetable mould. He concludes that both worms and other causes, such as dust deposition and washing down of soil, have buried such ruins.

[[Denudation]] (removal of matter to a lower level) is caused mainly by air and water movement. [[Humic acid]]s generated by worms disintegrate rock; their burrowing behaviour speeds this up. But as the soil layer thickens, this process is slowed down. Worms swallow hard objects (e.g. stones) to aid digestion, which causes attrition to such objects. This has geological significance, especially for the smaller particles which otherwise are eroded very slowly.

Rain causes castings to move down an incline; Darwin worked out the weight moving a certain distance in a given time. Some also roll down, and collect in drains etc., or get blown. There is a greater effect on casting movement in the tropics, because of increased rain. The finest earth is washed away. Ledges on hillsides, formerly believed to be caused by grazing mammals, are partly due to casting accumulations. High winds, especially gales, are almost as effective as the slope/rain in moving castings. Crowns and furrows of formerly ploughed lands slowly vanish when under [[pasture]], due to worms, but more slowly when there is no incline. Fine earth is washed down from slopes, making a shallow layer. Dissolving of chalk supplies new earth.

Darwin writes in the conclusion that worms "have played a more important part in the history of the world than most persons would at first suppose."&lt;ref&gt;p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; They are important for many reasons, including their role in decomposition of rocks, gradual denudation of the land, preservation of archaeological remains, and improving soil conditions for plant growth. Despite their rudimentary sense organs, they show complex, flexible behaviour.

==Reception==
[[File:Man is But a Worm.jpg|thumb|"Man is but a worm" caricature published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' at the end of 1881 ]]
''Worms'' became available in October 1881 and sold thousands of copies in its first few weeks, despite Darwin's comment to Carus that it was "a small book of little moment".&lt;ref name="Moore1991a" /&gt; Darwin received a "laughable" number of letters containing questions, observations and ideas, even "idiotic" ones. A week's holiday with [[Emma Darwin|Emma]] in [[Cambridge]] was to follow. Darwin [[Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms#Death|died]] the next year on 19 April 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tongareva triple junction''', also called the '''Pacific-Farallon-Phoenix triple junction''', was a geologic [[triple junction]] in the southwestern [[Pacific Basin]] where three [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] met: the [[Pacific Plate]], the [[Farallon Plate]], and the [[Phoenix Plate]]. It existed throughout the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period and consisted of three [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. A volcanic episode from 125 to 120 million years ago created an [[oceanic plateau]] east of [[Samoa]] called the [[Manihiki Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/30/1/67 Mid-Cretaceous tectonic evolution of the Tongareva triple junction in the southwestern Pacific Basin] 1 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tulsi''' or '''Tulasi''' (''[[Ocimum tenuiflorum]]'') or '''Holy Basil''' is a sacred plant in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] belief. Hindus regard it as an earthly manifestation of the goddess Tulsi; she is regarded as a great worshipper of the god [[Vishnu]]. The offering of its leaves is mandatory in ritualistic worship of [[Vishnu]] and his forms like [[Krishna]] and [[Vithoba]].

Many Hindus have tulsi plants growing in front of or near their home, often in special pots or a special masonry structure known as ''Tulsi Vrindavan'' as this is related to their culture. Traditionally, Tulsi is planted in the center of the central courtyard of Hindu houses.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|pp=17–18}}  The plant is cultivated for religious and medicinal purposes, and for its essential oil. It has many health benefits as well.

==Names==
In Hindu mythology, Tulsi ("matchless") is known as ''Vaishnavi'' ("belonging to Vishnu"), ''Vishnu Vallabha'' ("beloved of Vishnu"),{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=14}} ''Haripriya'' ("beloved of Vishnu"), ''Vishnu Tulsi''. The Tulsi with green leaves is called ''[[Shri]]-Tulsi'' ("fortunate Tulsi");  Shri is also a synonym for Lakshmi, Vishnu's principal consort. This variety is also known as ''Rama-Tulsi'' ("bright Tulsi"); [[Rama]] is also one of the principal [[avatars]] of Vishnu. The Tulsi with dark green or purple leaves and purple stem is called ''Shyama-Tulsi'' ("dark Tulsi") or ''Krishna-Tulsi'' ("dark Tulsi"); [[Krishna]] is also a prominent avatar of Vishnu. This variety is considered especially sacred to Krishna, as its purple color is similar to Krishna's dark complexion.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=14}}&lt;ref name=Chatterjee&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chatterjee |first=Gautam |title=Sacred Hindu Symbols |publisher=Abhinav Publications |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=978-81-7017-397-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ0XQHEkuIcC&amp;pg=RA1-PA93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- One argument mooted is that goddess Laksmi is also identical with Tulsi and hence it is also known as Lakshmi Priya; Tulsi is also identified with the wives of other incarnations of Shrey, Arpit, Anikt, gaurav, Vishnu, such as Rama and Krishna. --&gt;

==Legend==
[[File:ಮನೆ ಅಂಗಳ ತುಳಸಿ ಕಟ್ಟೆ.JPG|thumb|An altar with ''tulsi'' plant for daily worship in a courtyard in India]]
The ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'' regards [[Tulsi]] as an manifestation of [[Lakshmi]], the goddess of wealth and principal [[Queen consort|consort]] of [[Vishnu]]. [[King Vrishadhvaja|Once upon a time, King Vrishadhvaja]]—a devotee of the god [[Shiva]]—banned worship of all other deities except for that of his patron god. An agitated sun god [[Surya]] cursed him that he would be abandoned by Lakshmi will. Upset, Shiva pursued Surya, who fled, finally seeking shelter with Vishnu. Vishnu said to the deities that years had passed on earth. Vrishadhvaja and also his heir-son were dead and his grandchildren—[[Dharmadhvaja]] and [[Kushadhvaja]]—were now worshiping Lakshmi to gain her favor. Lakshmi rewarded their efforts by being born as their daughters Tulsi (literally "matchless") and [[Vedavati|(Tulsi]] to Dharmadhvaja and [[Vedavati]] to Kushadhvaja, respectively).  In time, Tulsi gave up all her royal comfort and went to [[Badrinath]] to perform penance to gain Vishnu as her husband. The god [[Brahma]] was pleased with her penance but told her that she would have to marry the demon [[Shankhachuda]] before she could marry Vishnu. [[Sudama]], a part-incarnation of [[Krishna]] (an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]) was born on earth as the demon (Shankhachuda) due to a curse. Shankhachuda, who also pleased [[Brahma]] with his penance, was granted the [[Vishnu-Kavacha]] (armour of Vishnu) and blessed that as long as his wife's [[chastity]] was retained and Vishnu-Kavacha was on his body, no one could slay him. Shankhachuda and Tulsi were soon married. Shankhachuda was filled with pride and terrorized the beings of the universe. To rescue the universe, Shiva challenged Shankhachuda to war, while Vishnu went to Tulsi to break her chastity. Vishnu assumed the form of Shankhachuda and compelled Tulsi to have coitus. With her chastity broken, Shankhachuda was killed and Sudama was freed of his curse. In the middle of their lovemaking, Tulsi recognized the impersonator. Vishnu appeared in his true form and urged Tulsi to abandon her earthly body and return to his celestial abode as Lakshmi, his wife. Tulsi's mortal remains decayed and became the [[Gandaki River]], while her hair transformed into the sacred Tulsi plant.&lt;ref&gt;Mani pp. 797–8&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Deshpande|2005|p=203}}

A variant of the legend replaces [[Shankhachuda]] with [[Jalandhara]] and the name ''Tulsi'' with [[Vrinda]] (a synonym of the Tulsi plant). It concentrates on the tale of [[Vishnu]] destroying [[Vrinda]]'s [[chastity]] to lead to the death of [[Jalandhara]] by [[Shiva]]. In this legend, Tulsi is distinct from Lakshmi. The legend ends with Vrinda cursing Vishnu to become a stone, turning him the [[Shaligram]] stone (which are found only in the Kali Gandaki River of [[Nepal]]) and Vishnu transforming Vrinda into the Tulsi plant. In a variant, Vrinda immolated herself in her husband's funeral pyre (see [[sati (practice)|sati]]) but Vishnu ensured that she got incarnated in the form of tulsi plant on the earth. In both versions, she gain the status of a goddess named Tulsi, while his earthly form is the Tulsi plant.{{Sfn| Littleton|Corporation|2005|pp=1125–6}}{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=11}}
&lt;!-- could not verify: they indulged in intense love making and as a result the stones found in the Gandaki River are stated to represent the [[sperm]] of the deity Vishnu. And hence the stone found here is called Shaligram and deeply worshipped as a symbol of Vishnu. However, in both versions of the legend the status of goddess Tulsi, Vishnu's loved one is called by different names such as "Tulsidev, dev or deva". Hindus, also recognizing her loyalty to her husband Jalandhara, call her as "tulsi mata" in the same way as Ganga is called as "Ganga mata" and cow is known "Gomata".{{Sfn|Littleton|Corporation|2005|pp=1124–36}} --&gt;

A [[Vaishnava]] legend relates Tulsi to the [[Samudra Manthana]], the churning of the cosmic ocean by the gods and [[asuras]] (demons). At the end of the churning, [[Dhanvantari]] rose from the ocean with [[Amrita]] (the elixir of immortality). Vishnu procured it for the gods, when the demons tried to steal it. Vishnu shed happy tears, the first of which fell in [[Amrita]] and formed Tulsi.{{Sfn|Deshpande|2005|p=203}}

==Worship==
{{double image|right|Tulsidevi01.jpg|175||170|Left: An idol of Goddess Tulsi. Right: A Tulsi-vrindavan in a courtyard in India}}
While tree worship is not uncommon in Hinduism, the Tulsi plant is regarded as the holiest of all plants.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=8}} The Tulsi plant is regarded as a threshold point between heaven and earth. A traditional prayer tells that the creator-god [[Brahma]] resides in its branches, all Hindu pilgrimage centres reside in its roots, the Ganges flows through its roots, all deities in its stem and its leaves and the Hindu scriptures – the [[Vedas]] in the upper part of its branches.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|pp=7, 9}}{{Sfn| Littleton|Corporation|2005|pp=1125–6}} It is considered as household god particularly referred as a "Women's deity". It is called as "the central sectarian symbol of Hinduism" and Vaishavas consider it as "the manifestation of god in the vegetable kingdom".{{Sfn|Simoons |1998|pp=11–18}}{{Sfn|Deshpande|2005|p=203}}

The Tulsi plant is grown in or near almost every Hindu house, especially by [[Brahmins]] and Vaishnavas. A house with a Tulsi plant is sometimes considered a place of pilgrimage.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=17}} Sacred places where they are grown are also known as Vrindavan (grove of Tulsi). Vrindavan is a raised cuboid stone or brick structure often in middle of the house's courtyard or in front of the house.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|pp=18–20}} 

A person who waters and cares for the Tulsi daily is believed to gain [[moksha]] (salvation) and the divine grace of Vishnu, even if he does not worship it. Traditionally, the daily worship and care of the plant is the responsibility of the women of the household. The plant is regarded as a "women's deity" and a "symbol of ideal wifehood and motherhood". Though daily worship is prescribed, Tuesdays and Fridays are considered especially sacred for Tulsi worship. Rituals involve watering the plant, cleaning the area near the plant with water and cow dung (considered sacred) and making offerings of food, flowers, incense, Ganges water etc. [[Rangoli]] (decorative designs) of deities and saints are drawn near its foot. Devotees pray to Tulsi and [[pradakshina|circumbulate]] it,chanting [[mantra]]s. The Tulsi plant is often worshipped twice in a day: in the morning and in the evening, when a lamp or candle is lit near the plant.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=20}}

In the 19th century, some families in [[Bengal]] regarded the plant as their guardian or [[Kuladevata|family deity]]. In a [[British India]]n census, [[North-Western Provinces]] recorded themselves as Tulsi worshippers and not belonging to Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=8}}{{Sfn| Littleton|Corporation|2005|pp=1125–6}}

;
;Festivals
A ceremony known as [[Tulsi Vivah]] is performed by the Hindus between [[Prabodhini Ekadashi]] (eleventh lunar day of the waxing moon of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]) to [[Kartik Poornima]] (full moon in Kartika), usually on the eleventh or the twelfth lunar day. It is the ceremonial wedding of the Tulsi plant to Vishnu, in the form of his image, Shaligram or a Krishna or Rama image. Both the bride and the groom are ritually worshipped and then married as per traditional [[Hindu wedding]] rituals. It marks the end of the four-month ''[[Chaturmas]]'' period, which corresponds to the monsoon and is considered inauspicious for weddings and other rituals, so the day inaugurates the annual marriage season in [[India]].&lt;ref name=Flood2003&gt;{{Cite book |last=Flood |first=Gavin D. |title=The Blackwell companion to Hinduism |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2001 |page=331 |isbn=978-0-631-21535-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qSfneQ0YYY8C&amp;pg=PA331}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=22}}

In Orissa, on the first day of the Hindu month [[Vaishakha]] (April - May), a small vessel with hole at the bottom is filled with water and suspended over the Tulsi plant with a steady stream of water, for the entire month. In this period, when a hot summer reigns, one who offers cool water to Tulsi or an umbrella to shelter it from the intense heat is believed to be cleansed of all sin. The stream of water also conveys wishes for a good monsoon.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|pp=20–2}}

On 25 December, [[Tulsi Pujan Diwas]] is celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/on-tulsi-pujan-diwas-here-is-why-the-plant-is-significant_1838312.html|title=On Tulsi Pujan Diwas, here is why the plant is significant|date=2015-12-25|work=Zee News|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In worship of other deities==
[[File:Japa mala (prayer beads) of Tulasi wood with 108 beads - 20040101-01.jpg|thumb|275px|Set of Japa mala, made from [[Tulasi]] wood, with head bead in foreground.]]

Tulsi is especially sacred in the worship of Vishnu and his forms [[Krishna]] and [[Vithoba]] and other related Vaishnava deities.{{Sfn|Simoons |1998|pp=11–18}}{{Sfn|Deshpande|2005|p=203}} Garlands made of 10000 tulsi leaves, water mixed with tulsi, food items sprinkled with Tulsi are offered in veneration to Vishnu or Krishna.

Vaishnavas traditionally use ''japa malas'' (a string of [[Hindu prayer beads]]) made from Tulsi stems or roots called ''Tulsi malas'', which are an important symbol of the initiation. ''Tulsi malas'' are considered to be auspicious for the wearer, and believed to connect him with Vishnu or Krishna and confer the protection of the deity. They are worn as a necklace or garland or held in the hand and used as a rosary. Tulsi's great connection with Vaishnavas is communicated with the fact that Vaishnavas are known as "those who bear the tulsi round the neck".{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|pp=14–6}} Some pilgrims carry tulsi plants in their hands throughout their pilgrimage to [[Dwarka]], the legendary capital of Krishna and one of the seven most sacred Hindu cities.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=14}}

There are conflicting accounts about Tulsi leaves being used in the worship of the god [[Shiva]], a rival sect ([[Shaiva]]) god to the Vaishnava Vishnu. While [[Bael]] leaves are often offered to Shiva, some authors note that Tulsi may also be offered to him. Tulsi worship is sometimes regarded the worship of Shiva, conveying the deity's omnipresence. Shiva's aniconic symbol – the [[linga]] – is sometimes prescribed to have made from the black soil from the roots of the Tulsi plant. However, Tulsi is taboo in worship of the [[Devi]] – the Hindu Divine Mother as the pungent aroma of the Tulsi plant angers her.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=17}} It is also important for the worship of [[Hanuman]].&lt;ref name=Chatterjee/&gt; In [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], the Tulsi plant represents all local deities and rituals to propitiate them are offered in front of the plant. The [[Nair|Nayars]] of [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]] offer Tulsi plants to pacify evil spirits.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=16}}

==Importance in Hinduism==
[[File:Ocimum tenuiflorum2.jpg|thumb|Tulsi plant]]
Every part of the Tulsi plant is revered and considered sacred. Even the soil around the plant is holy. The ''[[Padma Purana]]'' declares a person who is cremated with Tulsi twigs in his funeral pyre gains [[moksha]] and a place in Vishnu's abode [[Vaikuntha]]. If a Tulsi stick is used to burn a lamp for Vishnu, it is like offering the gods lakhs of lamps. If one makes a paste of dried Tulsi wood (from a plant that died naturally) and smears it over his body and worships Vishnu, it is worth several ordinary pujas and lakhs of Godan (donation of cows).&lt;ref&gt;Mani p. 798&lt;/ref&gt; Water mixed with the Tulsi leaves is given to the dying to raise their departing souls to heaven.{{Sfn|Deshpande|2005|p=203}}

Just as Tulsi respect is rewarding, her contempt attracts the wrath of Vishnu. Precautions are taken to avoid this. It is taboo to urinate, excrete or throw waste water near the plant. Uprooting and cutting branches of the plant is prohibited.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|pp=22–3}} When the plant withers, the dry plant is immersed in a water body with due religious rites as is the custom for broken divine images, which are unworthy for worship.{{Sfn|Deshpande|2005|p=203}} Though Tulsi leaves are necessary for Hindu worship, there are strict rules for it.  A prayer of forgiveness may also be offered to Tulsi before the act.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|pp=22–3}}

The word ''Tulsi'' is used in many place names and family names.{{Sfn|Simoons|1998|p=8}}

[[File:Linde von linn.jpg|thumb|250px|A veteran tree (a "vet")]]
A '''veteran tree''' or '''legacy tree''' is a tree which, because of its great age, size or condition, is of exceptional cultural, landscape or [[nature conservation]] value. 

==Definition==
Veteran trees vary in age depending upon their species and location, but may be several hundred years old.  Smaller and shorter-lived tree species (such as [[orchard]] trees) may begin to develop some veteran features when only a few decades old.  Size is usually used to define veteran trees.  This may be size alone: for example, a [[Diameter at breast height|girth]] of over {{Convert|3|m|ftin|0}} at {{Convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} may be used as a test;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} alternatively, different girths may be set for species of different sizes, and the presence of veteran tree features may also be considered.&lt;ref name=FEP&gt;''Higher Level Stewardship: Part B, Farm Environment Plan Features Manual'', Second Edition, pp 121&amp;ndash;124.  Natural England, October 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84754-079-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veteran trees often have features of particularly high nature conservation value, such as dead limbs, hollows, rot-holes, water pools, seepages, [[woodpecker]] holes, splits, loose bark, limbs reaching the ground, and [[epiphytic]] plants and lichens.&lt;ref name=FEP/&gt;  Few of these features are found on younger trees, and they provide [[habitat]]s for very many species of animals and fungi, some of which are rare. Such features are sometimes removed or damaged by pruning or other [[aboriculture|arboricultural]] practices.

Many of the oldest trees are pollards, as [[pollarding]] removes the weight and windage of the upper trunk and so reduces the chances of major damage, and it also maintains the tree in a vigorous state.

Veteran trees occur in many situations, occasionally in dense [[woodland]], but more commonly as [[hedgerow tree]]s, on [[village green]]s, and in ancient [[park]]s and other [[wood pasture]].

==United Kingdom==
Veteran trees are more frequent in [[Great Britain]] than in many other parts of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meetings with Remarkable Trees|year=1996|ISBN=0-297-83255-7}} (made into a radio and television series of the same name)&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom in recent years, these trees are being recorded by the [[Ancient Tree Hunt (UK)|Ancient Tree Hunt]] so that a national database can be created.  Volunteer groups such as the [https://wdvta.org.uk Wokingham District Veteran Tree Association], the Dorset Greenwood Tree Project and the Ashford Veteran Tree Initiative are crucial to the success of this scheme.

Although some initiatives have strict rules on how to measure girth and use [[Global Positioning System|GPS devices]] to document the location of such trees accurately, other schemes rely on members of the public to report large trees.  The public have been encouraged to hug big trees in their area to get a measure for their size and report their findings to [[Natural England]] or another Veteran Tree organization.  19th-century maps are also being used to find old trees in places such as [[Cambridgeshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/7286235.stm BBC NEWS | England | Cambridgeshire | Maps boosting ancient tree search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
{{Multiple issues|{{tone|section|date=July 2018}} {{advert|section|date=July 2018}} {{sources|section|date=July 2018}}|section=yes}}

In Australia some of the oldest veteran trees are connected with social, cultural and legal practices of the Aboriginal peoples.

However even the more recent European history of settlement has produced historical linkages through individual trees that have survived. 

Existing prominent trees were very often used as markers, survey points indicating boundaries of both private and government land tenure. Some of Australia’s most famous trees hold an exalted position because they were marked (''blazed'') by 19th-century explorers.

Australia does not have the history of the commons and parklands that help explain these landscape forms elsewhere. The new settlers did however bring with them an appreciation of the value of trees for fuel, fodder and raw material for building; many of them also showed an appreciation of the amenity value of trees, planting large spreading shade trees on their properties and within their new founded towns and cities.

Many of the veteran trees identified today are living reminders of the previous patterns of settlement, reflecting the economic, cultural and social organization influencing the lives of those living on the land. They often display the physical scars of traumatic events both man made and natural, those scars can often make relatively young trees appear much older than they actually are - such trees can be described as having been veteranised.

There is legislation (in the form of national, state and local laws) which recognizes the importance of protecting the environment but there are many gaps in the limited protection afforded veteran trees, particularly in the face of ever increasing pressures of urban development.

The Veteran Tree Group Australia, a volunteer organisation, is applying the successful model from the [[Ancient Tree Forum]] in the UK starting the process of documenting veteran trees in Australia, and along the way providing best practice advice to anyone wanting to understand more about these significant elements of our environment.

== Italy ==
[[File:Castagno_dei_Cento_Cavalli.jpg|thumb|''[[Hundred Horse Chestnut]]'', the oldest [[Chestnut]] tree in the world ([[Sicily]])]]
In Italy, general features required in order to identify an ''Albero Monumentale'' (literally ''monumental tree'') are defined by national law number 10 of 14 January 2013 ''Norme per lo sviluppo degli spazi verdi urbani'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gazzetta Ufficiale|GU]] Serie Generale n.27 del 1-2-2013, [http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2013-02-01&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=13G00031&amp;elenco30giorni=true www.gazzettaufficiale.it]&lt;/ref&gt; which also requires Italian municipalities (''[[comuni]]'') to take a census of their veteran trees. Defining local standards, census details, and law enforcement aspects such as fines or subsidies related to veteran trees is a matter transferred to the [[Italian Regions|regions]], which usually implement specific ''[[Law of Italy#Legislative power|leggi regionali]]'' ('regional laws').&lt;ref&gt;''Alberi Monumentali'', Regione Liguria, [http://www.agriligurianet.it/it/vetrina/boschi-e-foreste/alberi-monumentali.html www.agriligurianet.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silvicuture and veterans==

[[Silviculture]] originally was [[Forestry#Early modern forestry development|developed to provide timber]] from [[forest]]s run as [[plantation]]s. But now [[Forestry#Forestry today|forestry expands]] to consider non-economic values and ecological values. As a result, these other values are also considered in silvicultural systems that may lead to veteran trees being supported where they exist or created where they have not previously been so considered. The [[Shelterwood cutting#Shelterwood with reserves|Shelterwood with reserves method]] is a form of Shelterwood cutting that may do this.&lt;ref&gt;Silviculture Concepts and Applications, Ralph D. Nyland 2002 pg. Ch 14 Shelterwood and seed-tree methods&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, Milov was appointed adviser to the Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation and in May 2002, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Energy of Russia in [[Mikhail Kasyanov|Kasyanov's]] government. He resigned in October 2002.&lt;ref name=russiahouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=salzburg/&gt;

In December 2008, Milov co-founded the opposition movement "[[Solidarnost]]". He was one of the leaders of the organization until May 2010. In February 2010, Milov was elected a leader of the social movement "Democratic Choice". He resigned on December 20, 2015 after a series of internal disagreements. Since 2016, Milov has been actively participating in [[Alexei Navalny presidential campaign, 2018|Alexei Navalny's presidential campaign]]. Milov was mentioned as one of the co-authors of Navalny's platform that was published on December 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://2018.navalny.com/platform Программа Алексея Навального]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''War Finance Corporation''' was a [[government corporation]] in the [[United States]] created to give financial support to industries essential for [[World War I]], and to banking institutions that aided such industries. It continued to give support to various efforts during the [[interwar period]]. The corporation was created by a Congressional act of April 5, 1918, and abolished on July 1, 1939.

Since government borrowing to pay for the war had attracted a majority of private capital, little capital was available for corporations to borrow; the War Finance Corporation was designed to make such capital available. After the [[armistice]] in late 1918, the Corporation assisted in the transition to peacetime by financing railroads under government control, and making loans to American exporters and agricultural cooperative marketing associations. The Corporation established agricultural loan agencies in farming areas, and cooperated with several livestock loan companies. [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]], a wealthy and ambitious [[financial District, Manhattan|Wall Street]] financier (who also became [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve chairman]] and owner of the ''[[Washington Post]]''), was its managing director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Eustace Clarence Mullins|title=Study of The Federal Reserve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PozrAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=mullins%20les%20secrets%20de%20la%20r%C3%A9serve%20f%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale&amp;pg=PT14#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Two%20billion%20dollars%20worth%22|year=2013|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-62793-114-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whispering-gallery waves''', or '''whispering-gallery modes''', are a type of wave that can travel around a concave surface. Originally discovered for [[sound]] [[wave]]s in the [[whispering gallery]] of [[St Paul’s Cathedral]], they can exist for [[light]] and for other waves, with important applications in [[nondestructive testing]], [[laser|lasing]], [[laser cooling|cooling]] and [[sensor|sensing]], as well as in [[astronomy]].

==Introduction==

[[Image:WGMVisualized.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Snapshot of an acoustic whispering-gallery mode calculated at a frequency of 69 Hz in an enclosed cylinder of air of the same diameter (33.7 m)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Oliver B.|date=2012|title=Gallery of whispers|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-7058/25/02/36/pdf|journal=Physics World|volume=25|issue=2|pages=31|doi=10.1088/2058-7058/25/02/36|via=IOP Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the whispering gallery in St Paul’s Cathedral. Red and blue represent higher and lower air pressures, respectively, and the distortions in the grid lines show the displacements. In the case of the waves travelling one way round the gallery, the air particles move in elliptical trajectories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kino-ap.eng.hokudai.ac.jp/WG.html|title=Watching whispering-gallery waves|last=Oliver|first=Wright B.|last2=Matsuda|first2=Oliver|date=|website=Laboratory of Applied Solid State Physics, [[Hokkaido University]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
 
Whispering-gallery waves were first explained for the case of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] circa 1878&lt;ref&gt;[Lord Rayleigh, Theory of Sound, vol. II, 1st edition, (London, MacMillan), 1878.]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Lord Rayleigh]], who revised a previous misconception&lt;ref&gt;[J. Tyndall, The Science of Sound (New York, Philosophical Library), 1867, p. 20.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[G. B. Airy, On Sound and Atmospheric Vibrations, with the Mathematical Elements of Music (London, MacMillan), 1871, p. 145.]&lt;/ref&gt; that [[whispering|whispers]] could be heard across the dome but not at any intermediate position. He explained the phenomenon of travelling whispers with a series of specularly reflected [[sound]] rays making up [[chord (geometry)|chords]] of the circular gallery. Clinging to the walls the sound should decay in intensity only as the inverse of the distance — rather than the [[inverse-square law|inverse square]] as in the case of a point source of sound radiating in all directions. This accounts for the whispers being audible all round the gallery.
 
Rayleigh developed wave theories for St Paul’s in 1910&lt;ref&gt;[Lord Rayleigh, Phil. Mag. 20, 1001,1910.]&lt;/ref&gt;  and 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[Lord Rayleigh, Phil. Mag. 27, 100, 1914.]&lt;/ref&gt; Fitting sound waves inside a cavity involves the physics of [[resonance]] based on wave [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]]; the sound can exist only at certain pitches as in the case of [[organ pipe]]s. The sound forms patterns called [[normal modes|modes]], as shown in the diagram.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
Many other monuments have been shown&lt;ref&gt;[C. V. Raman, Proc. Indian Ass. Cult. Sci. 7, 159, 1921-1922]&lt;/ref&gt; to exhibit whispering-gallery waves, such as the [[Gol Gumbaz]] in Bijapur and the [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing.

In the strict definition of whispering-gallery waves, they cannot exist when the guiding surface becomes straight.&lt;ref&gt;[L. M. Brekhovskikh, Sov. Phys. Acoust. 13, 462, 1968]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically this corresponds to the limit of an infinite radius of curvature. Whispering-gallery waves are guided by the effect of the wall curvature.

Optical whispering-gallery mode can be implemented in making high precision optical sensors. For example, they can be used in the form of hollow bottle microresonators for detecting of a separate nanoparticle in air or water medium by mode splitting phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chenari|first=Zeinab|last2=Latifi|first2=Hamid|last3=Peysokhan|first3=Mostafa|date=2016-03-04|title=Nanoparticle detection by mode splitting in hollow bottle microresonators|url=https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Nanophotonics/volume-10/issue-1/016009/Nanoparticle-detection-by-mode-splitting-in-hollow-bottle-microresonators/10.1117/1.JNP.10.016009.short?SSO=1|journal=Journal of Nanophotonics|volume=10|issue=1|pages=016009|doi=10.1117/1.jnp.10.016009|issn=1934-2608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustic waves==

Whispering-gallery waves for sound exist in a wide variety of systems. Examples  include the vibrations of the whole [[Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;[Quantitative Seismology, K. Aki and P. G. Richards (University Science Books), 2009, Ch. 8]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[stars]].&lt;ref&gt;[D. R. Reese et al., A&amp;A 506, 189, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Such acoustic whispering-gallery waves can be used in [[nondestructive testing]] in the form of waves that creep around holes filled with liquid,&lt;ref&gt;[P. B. Nagy, M. Blodgett and M. Golis, NDT&amp;E International 27, 131, 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt; for example. They have also been detected in solid cylinders&lt;ref&gt;[D. Clorennec, D. Royer and H. Walaszek, Ultrasonics 40, 783, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt; and spheres,&lt;ref&gt;[S. Ishikawa et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 83, 4649, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; with applications in [[sensor|sensing]], and visualized in motion on microscopic discs .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[T. Tachizaki et al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 165434, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whispering gallery waves are more efficiently guided in spheres than in cylinders because the effects of acoustic [[diffraction]] (lateral wave spreading) are then completely compensated.&lt;ref&gt;[S. Ishikawa et al., Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 40, 3623, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electromagnetic waves==

The tip of an angle-cut [[optical fiber]], visible on the right, excites the modes in the red region of the optical spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/tb/techbriefs/physical-sciences/3160|title=Delaying Trains of Short Light Pulses in WGM Resonators|last=|first=|date=1 September 2018|work=Tech Briefs Media Group|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Whispering-gallery waves exist for light waves.&lt;ref&gt;[G. Mie, Annalen der Physik 25, 377, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[P. Debye, Annalen der Physik 30, 57, 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[A. N. Oraevsky, Quantum Electron. 32, 377, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; They have been produced in microscopic glass spheres or toruses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vahala|first1=K. J. |year=2003 |title=Optical microcavities |journal=Nature |volume=424|pages=839 |doi=10.1038/nature01939|bibcode=2003Natur.424..839V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[A. Chirasera et al., Laser &amp; Photon. Rev. 4, 457, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, with applications in [[laser|lasing]],&lt;ref&gt;[Y. P. Rakovich and J. F. Donegan, Laser &amp; Photon. Rev. 4, 179, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[cavity opto-mechanics|optomechanical]] [[laser cooling|cooling]],&lt;ref&gt;[T. J. Kippenberg and K. J. Vahala, Science 321, 1172, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[frequency comb]] generation&lt;ref&gt;[P. Del'Haye et al., Nature 450, 1214, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sensor|sensing]].&lt;ref&gt;[S. Arnold et al,  Opt. Lett. 28, 272, 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; The light waves are almost perfectly guided round by optical [[total internal reflection]], leading to [[Q factor]]s in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; being achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[I. S. Grudinin, V. S. Ilchenko and L. Maleki, Phys. Rev. A 74, 063806, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is far greater than the best values, about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, that can be similarly obtained in acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;[K. Yamanaka et al., IEEE Trans. Ultrason., Ferroelectr. and Freq. Control 53, 793, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Optical modes in a whispering gallery resonator are inherently lossy due to a mechanism similar to [[quantum tunneling]]. As a result, light inside a whispering gallery mode experiences a degree of radiation loss even in theoretically ideal conditions. Such a loss channel has been known from research on [[waveguide (optics)|optical waveguide]] theory and is dubbed tunneling ray attenuation&lt;ref&gt;[C. Pask, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 68, 110, 1978.]&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of [[optical fiber|fiber optics]]. The Q factor is proportional to the decay time of the waves, which in turn is inversely proportional to both the surface scattering rate and the wave absorption in the medium making up the gallery. &amp;nbsp;Whispering-gallery waves for light have been investigated in [[chaos theory|chaotic galleries]],&lt;ref&gt;[C. Gmachl et al., Science 280, 1556, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Y. Baryshnikov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 133902, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; whose cross-sections deviate from a circle. And such waves have been used in [[quantum information]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;[A. Tanaka et al., Optics Exp., 19, 2278, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whispering-gallery waves have also been demonstrated for other [[electromagnetic wave]]s such as [[radio wave]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[K. G. Budden and H. G. Martin, Proc. Roy. Soc. London 265, 554, 1962.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[microwave]]s, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stanwix|first1=P.

Golovchenko, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 788, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other systems==

Whispering-gallery waves have been seen in the form of [[matter wave]]s for [[neutron]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[V. V. Nesvizhevsky, A. Y. Voronin, R. Cubitt and K. V. Protasov, Nature Phys. 6, 114, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; and electrons,&lt;ref&gt;[G. Reecht, H. Bulou, F. Scheurer, V. Speisser, B. Carrière, F. Mathevet, G. Schull, Phys Rev. Lett. 110, 056802, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; and they have been proposed as an explanation for vibrations of a single [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;[O. Dragun and H. Uberall, Phys. Lett. 94B, 24, 1980.]&lt;/ref&gt; Whispering gallery waves have also been observed in the vibrations of soap films as well as in the vibrations of thin plates &lt;ref&gt;[https://doi.org/10.1119/1.18913 E. Arcos et al, Am. J. Phys. 66(7) July 1998, p.601]&lt;/ref&gt; Analogies of whispering-gallery waves also exist for [[gravitational wave]]s at the [[event horizon]] of [[black hole]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A hybrid of waves of light and [[electron]]s known as [[surface plasmon]]s has been demonstrated in the form of whispering-gallery waves,&lt;ref&gt;[B. Min et al., Nature 457, 455, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; and likewise for [[exciton]]-[[polariton]]s in [[semiconductor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[L. Sun et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 156403, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Galleries simultaneously containing both acoustic and optical whispering-gallery waves have also been made,&lt;ref&gt;[M. Tomes and T. Carmon, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 113601, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; exhibiting very strong mode coupling and coherent effects.&lt;ref&gt;[J. Kim, M. Kuzyk, K. Han, H. Wang, G. Bahl, Nature Physics, doi:10.1038/nphys3236, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrid solid-fluid-optical whispering-gallery structures have been observed as well.&lt;ref&gt;[G. Bahl, K. H. Kim, W. Lee, J. Liu, X. Fan, T. Carmon, Nature Communications, 4:1994, doi:10.1038/ncomms2994, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''wind power industry''' is involved with the design, manufacture, construction, and maintenance of [[wind turbines]].  The modern [[wind power]] industry began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers.  The industry is currently undergoing a period of rapid globalization and consolidation.

== Overview ==
The wind power industry is the industry involved with the design, manufacture, construction, and maintenance of wind turbines. Although the wind power industry is small compared to those of the conventional power generation technologies (hydro, coal, natural gas, and nuclear), it is growing at a much faster rate (25% per year, from 2002 to 2007).&lt;ref name="gwec"&gt;[http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=28 Global Wind Energy Council News]&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern wind power industry began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers Kuriant, [[Vestas]], [[NEG Micon|Nordtank]], and [[Siemens|Bonus]]. Initially, most of these early turbines were installed in western Denmark. California, USA experienced a wind power boom from 1982 to 1986 when thousands of Danish and American wind turbines were installed in massive arrays. India got involved in wind power in the mid-1980s as well, while Germany and Spain gradually developed domestic wind power industries starting in the early 1990s.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

The wind power industry is currently undergoing a period of rapid globalization and consolidation, with much of the recent wind farm development occurring outside the older established markets. Several large companies with market capitalizations greater than the entire wind power industry itself ([[General Electric]], [[Siemens]], [[BP]]) are now making large investments in wind power. To meet a global wind turbine supply shortage, start-up wind turbine manufacturers are still appearing and ramping up the production of their new wind turbine models as quickly as possible.

[[List of wind turbine manufacturers|Wind turbine manufacturers]] design, test, manufacture, and assist with the operation and maintenance of wind turbines. Important choices facing them include turbine design (generator type, gearbox vs. gear-less, materials) and how much control to maintain over component supplies (internal vs. external). They must be concerned with maintaining their extensive fleets of operating turbines while at the same time developing newer and ever-larger models. The largest wind turbine manufacturers are based in Denmark, Germany, Spain, India, and USA.

[[Wind farm developers]] develop and sometimes own and operate wind farms. This involves purchasing or leasing land, installing meteorological equipment to quantify the wind resource, and securing transmission, power sales, turbine supply, construction, and financing agreements.  Some small wind farm developers, lacking the "muscle" and financing necessary to secure major turbine supply contracts, will develop a project in order to "flip" it and sell to larger developers such as [[wind power managing owners]].

[[Wind farm construction companies]] construct and sometimes assist with the [[operation and maintenance]] of wind farms.

[[Wind farm Operation and Maintenance companies]] (also called Wind O&amp;M contractors, or simply Wind Operators).  This rapidly growing industry segment assists with the [[operation and maintenance]] of wind farms, under contract with (other) companies which own those wind farms. O&amp;M Contracts typically focus on the maintenance of the turbines, towers, and blades; with responsibility for the generation of electricity (conversion of mechanical energy to electricity), but they usually are not responsible for the actual transmission of this electricity to the grid through electrical substations which are located at or near the wind farms.  Note: some of these companies are also [[Wind power managing owners]] (see below), at certain wind farms where these companies are not contractors, because the same company owns and operates those wind farms directly.

[[Wind farm finance companies]] sell loans and other financial products to wind farm developers and wind turbine manufacturers. Most of these companies are large banks with experience in providing financing to other large industrial projects.

[[Wind power consulting companies]] offer consulting services to the wind power industry, including wind turbine design and certification, technical Due Diligence (or acting as the "[[Owner's engineer]]"), wind resource maps, [[wind resource assessment]]s, wind power forecasting, and wind turbine power performance testing. Most of these companies maintain financial independence (no ownership stake) from wind farm projects in order to guarantee unbiased service to their clients.

[[Wind power research organizations]] provide research and development to the wind power industry. They are usually part of government agencies or universities and conduct research on aspects of wind power that are currently cost-prohibitive for the private industry to invest in.

[[Wind power managing owners]] are responsible for the [[operation and maintenance]] and administration of wind farms which they develop or acquire.  All or part of these responsibilities may be subcontracted to third parties.  Wind power managing owners, along with other financing parties and equity partners, typically sell the electricity generated from wind farms to [[public utilities]] under long-term [[Power Purchase Agreement]]s (PPAs) where they receive a fixed price for the electricity.
