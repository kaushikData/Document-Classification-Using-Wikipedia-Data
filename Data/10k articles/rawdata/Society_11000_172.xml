      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1907">'''Al-Mansur al-Husayn''' (1669&amp;ndash;1720) was an [[Imam]] over parts of [[Yemen]], who ruled in rivalry with other competitors in 1716&amp;ndash;1720. He belonged to the [[Qasimid]] family who dominated the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[imamate]] of Yemen in 1597&amp;ndash;1962.

Al-Husayn bin al-Qasim was a grandson of the imam [[al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad]] I (d. 1644). He took advantage of popular discontent with the current imam [[al-Mahdi Muhammad]]. He claimed the [[imamate]] in the strong fortification [[Shaharah District|Shaharah]] in 1716, taking the name al-Mansur. A large part of the country quickly fell away from the unpopular al-Mahdi Muhammad. The old imam released his nephew al-Qasim from prison and sent him to deal with the pretender. However, al-Mansur al-Husayn defeated his opponent at [[As Sudah]]. Al-Qasim soon defected from his uncle, acknowledged al-Mansur al-Husayn, and besieged the old imam. Al-Mahdi Muhammad had to give up and sue for a truce. Al-Mansur al-Husayn began to strike coins in his own name. However, already in the same year 1716 a-Qasim turned against the new imam, and proclaimed himself with the name [[al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim]]. He controlled [[San'a]] and the seaports, while al-Mansur al-Husayn merely held Shaharah and some surrounding territories. Blocked from the sources of revenue, he led a meagre existence until he died in 1720.&lt;ref&gt;R. Serjeant &amp; R. Lewcock, ''San'a'; an Arabian Islamic City''. London 1983, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ammonite''''' is [[Nicola Griffith]]'s first novel, published in 1992 ({{ISBN|978-0-345-37891-0}}). It won both the [[Lambda Literary Award]] for [[LGBT]] (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) fiction, and the [[James Tiptree, Jr. Award]] for [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] that explores or expands our understanding of [[gender]].

==Plot summary==
''Ammonite'' is the story of Marghe Taishan, an [[anthropologist]] and employee of a government agency, the Settlement and Education Councils (SEC). She is sent as an SEC representative to the planet Jeep (Grenchstom's Planet - "Jeep" being the pronunciation of the abbreviation "GP"). Centuries in the past, Jeep was colonized by people from Earth, but contact was lost with the colony, and now the planet is a target for recolonization by the sinister Durallium Company (mostly referred to as "Company"). Some years prior to the beginning of the story, Company sent an expedition of technical and security personnel (the latter called "Mirrors" for the mirrored helmets on their combat armor) to the planet; a short time later, all of the men and many of the women in the expedition died from a [[virus]], also known as Jeep, which was endemic to the planet. As a result, the planet was placed under quarantine, and none of the surviving members of the expedition have been allowed to leave. One of the mysteries of the planet is that there is a "native" population, entirely female and apparently descended from the original colony.

Marge is sent to Jeep not only to study the native cultures, but also to test a potential vaccine for the Jeep virus. She makes a journey across Jeep, living with several of its indigenous cultures. Shortly after the start of her journey, she is captured and enslaved by the nomadic Echraidhe, one of whose members, Uaithne, believes herself to be the Death Spirit, the chosen representative of the goddess of death destined to bring about an [[apocalypse]]. Escaping the Echraidhe and almost dying in the extreme winter, she reaches the quieter village of Ollfoss, where she joins a family and stops taking the vaccine, accepting the virus into her body and truly learning what it is like to be a native (including how the natives are able to conceive children). She learns the mystic discipline of "deepsearch", and eventually becomes a "viajera", or traveling wise woman. Afterward, she is forced to the center of a conflict between the Mirrors and the Echraidhe under the leadership of Uaithne. Marghe stops the conflict, but shortly thereafter Company, believing the vaccine to have been a failure, destroys the space station orbiting Jeep, apparently isolating the people there. However, Marghe and the Mirrors believe that the Company will probably return one day, a return they must prepare for.

Adaptation to life on Jeep appears to be a greater theme of Griffith's novel, as not only Marghe, but other Company personnel, also eventually are forced to settle on Jeep and adapt to the cultures that its prior colonists have created, in order to adjust to the planetary environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3664">The '''Ariaal''' are northern [[Kenya]]n [[pastoralism|pastoralist]]s.  
They claim descent from cattle-owning [[Samburu people|Samburu]] who captured significant herds of camels and learned how to manage them from their eastern neighbours, the [[Rendille people|Rendille]]. This led them to adopt the Rendille culture, language, and other Rendille practices, such as monogamy. Before Kenya independence, the separation between the cattle and camel economies was vividly reflected in the division between an Ariaal elder’s senior wife, whose family would be reared as Ariaal, and his junior wives who lived with his cattle as Samburu. In effect, such elders continued to straddle the boundary between monogamous camel-owning Ariaal and polygynous cattle-owning Samburu, speaking both languages and participating in both cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Paul, 1973, ''Nomads in Alliance: Symbiosis and Growth among the Rendille and Samburu of Kenya'', Oxford University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics and behavior==
An article in the New York Times (Nov. 2, 2014) reports on research for which the evolution of the societal patterns of the Ariaal people into two subgroups (nomadic herders vs. settled growers) seems to provide a rather unusual intersection for the study of genetics and behavior. The researcher, Dan T. A. Eisenberg, a University of Washington anthropologist, is reported to be studying genetic variation of a [[Dopamine]] type 4 receptor (DRD4 7R) and finding correlated differences between the genetic variation and the chosen lifestyle of a given Ariaal subgroup. Eisenberg's research builds on a growing number of studies connecting the status of an individual's dopamine receptors and an [[ADHD]] diagnosis, and is presented in this article in the context of the [[Epidemiology of attention deficit hyperactive disorder|proliferation]] of ADHD diagnoses in Western society, as one key new body of research exploring whether ADHD is [[Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Controversies|more functional than is recognized]], a distinctive but functional (i.e., not pathological) phenomenon that has significant evolutionary roots in terms of having predisposed survival at a time when a hunter's instinct was aided by a certain restlessness.  The research into the Ariaal subgroup differences seems to have suggestive implications supportive of a nonpathologizing view that what "ADHD" signifies is an individual's suitedness to a different kind of environment (and degree and type of activity) than the one the individual finds him/herself in.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/opinion/sunday/a-natural-fix-for-adhd.html?comments&amp;_r=0#permid=13225329&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ==Genetic evidence for origins==

{{Armenians}}
'''Armenians in Poland''' have an important and historical presence going back to the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenica.org/cgi-bin/armenica.cgi?=1=1=172=31==1=3=A The First Large Emigration of the Armenians - History of Armenia]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Polish census of 2011, there are 3,623 self-identifying Armenians in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/LUD_raport_z_wynikow_NSP2011.pdf 2011 Census]. [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)]]. 2012. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
About the beginning of the Armenian presence in Poland, Adolf Nowaczyński, a Polish writer, gives us the following sketch of the [[Armenians]] of [[Poland]]:
[[Image:Lwów - Katedra Ormiańska 01.JPG|thumb|220px|left|The [[Armenian Cathedral in Lviv]]]]
[[File:Armenian document (1578).jpg|thumb|220px|left| Armenian document written in Lviv, 1578]]

Long before the fall of the (Armenian) [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Cilicia]] in 1375, the Armenians appeared in Poland, having been invited here by David Igorevich, the Prince of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].

"The first dismemberment of their country brought about a great emigration. The Armenian emigrants, taking with them a handful of native soil in a piece of cloth, were scattered in southern Russia, into the [[Caucasus]], in the land of the Cossacks, while 50,000 from among them came to Poland. From then on, new streams of Armenian emigration periodically proceeded from the banks of the Pontus towards the hospitable country of the [[Sarmatism|Sarmatians]], and it must be said that these guests, coming from such a distance, proved themselves really 'the salt of the earth,' an exceedingly useful and desirable element. They settled mostly in the cities, and in many places they became the nucleus of the [[Poland|Polish]] bourgeois class. The city of [[Lwów]] (Lviv), the most patriotic center of Poland, then the theater of so many historic turmoils, owes its luster in large degree to Armenian immigrants. [[Kamieniec-Podolski]] (Kamianets-Podilskyi), that crown of Polish old fortresses, received its fame from the Armenians who settled there. In [[Bukovina|Bukowina]] and in all Galicia, the Armenian element plays a role of the first order in political and social life, in industry and in intellectual movement. Finally, in Poland proper and its capital, [[Warsaw]], the descendants of those who once were the great nation on the [[Arax]], rendered themselves illustrious in all careers. In the battles of [[battle of Grunwald|Grunwald]] and [[battle of Varna|Varna]], the forebears of the Alexandrovics, the Augustinovics, the Agopsovics and Apakanovics took part. Also from their ranks came forth later renowned Poles, such as the Malowski, Missasowicz, Piramowicz, Pernatowicz, Jachowicz, Mrozianowski, Grigorowicz, Barowicz, Teodorowicz, etc.

Through successive immigrations, the Armenians of Poland gradually formed a colony, comprising 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;Krzysztof Stopka, ''Ormianie w Polsce dawnej i dzisiejszej'', Cracow 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They were welcomed by the Kings of Poland and were granted not only religious liberty, but also political privileges. [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir III]] (1333‑1370) gave to the Armenians of Kamieniec Podolski in 1344 and those of Lwów in 1356 the right of setting up a national council, exclusively Armenian, known as the "Voit." This council, composed of twelve judges, administered Armenian affairs in full independence. All acts and official deliberations were conducted in the [[Armenian language]] and in accordance with the laws of that nation. The Armenians of Lwów had built a wooden church in 1183; in 1363 it was replaced by a stone edifice which became the seat of the Armenian prelates of Poland and [[Moldavia]].

In 1516 King [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I]] authorized the installation in the wealthy and aristocratic center of Lwów an Armenian tribunal called the Ermeni tora in [[Armeno-Kipchak]] (Datastan in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]). The peaceful life of the colony was troubled in the 1626. An abbot named [[Mikołaj Torosowicz]] was ordained a bishop in 1626 by Melchisedek, a former coadjutor-Katholikos of [[Etchmiadzin]] who supported restoring unity with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Despite the ensuing rift between the majority of the Armenian community and the few followers of Torosowicz the Armenian community finally reentered into communion with the [[Holy See]] forming the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] which retained a separate hierarchy and used the Armenian Rite.[http://historicus.umk.pl/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=56]

A part of the Lwów émigrés, numbering some 10,000, who had settled in ''Moldavia'', moved from there during the [[Great Turkish War|Turko-Polish war in 1671]], to Bukowina and [[Transylvania]]. In Bukowina, they lived in the city of [[Suceava]] and vicinity. In Transylvania they founded two new cities, Erszebetvaros (Elisabethstadt, [[Dumbrăveni]]) and Szamos-ujvar (Armenierstadt, [[Gherla]]), which, as a special favor, were declared free cities by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]], Emperor of Austria (1711‑1740).

Armenian origin of many Polish families could be easily traced before [[World War II]]. They would intermarry among themselves; if they'd go on religious pilgrimages, they'd prefer visiting the [[Armenian Cathedral in Lviv|Armenian cathedral of Lwów]], built under the inspiration of the churches of Ani. The last Armenian Archbishop in Poland [[Józef Teodorowicz]], as the head of the community was a member of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] Senate, together with Latin and [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek]] colleagues.

== Polish-Armenians in the 20th century ==
[[File:Khatchkar in Krakow, 9 Kopernika street,Poland.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|[[Khachkar]] in [[Cracow]], [[Poland]].]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, there were about 6,000 Armenians in Poland living mostly in [[Eastern Galicia]] (today [[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]]), with centers in [[Lwów]] (Lviv), [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanisławów]] (Ivano-Frankivsk), [[Brzeżany]] (Berezhany), [[Kuty]], [[Łysiec, Silesian Voivodeship|Łysiec]] (Lysets), [[Horodenka]], [[Tlumach|Tłumacz]] (Tlumach) and [[Sniatyn|Śniatyn]] (Sniatyn). Polish-Armenians were an integral part of the movement to restore [[Second Polish Republic|Poland's independence]] during [[World War I]].

After suffering heavy losses along with the rest of Poland's population in [[World War II]], the Polish Armenian community suffered a second loss. The regions of [[Poland]] where Armenians were concentrated such as [[Eastern Galicia]] were annexed into the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the agreements reached at the [[Yalta conference]]. As a result, the Polish Armenian community became dispersed all over Poland. Many of them were resettled in cities in northern and western Poland such as [[Kraków]], [[Gliwice]], [[Opole]], [[Wrocław]], [[Poznań]], [[Gdańsk]], and [[Warsaw]].

To combat this dispersion they began to form Armenian Cultural Associations. Additionally the [[Catholic Church]] opened two [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] parishes with one in [[Gdańsk]] and the other in [[Gliwice]], while [[Roman Catholic]] churches in other cities such as St. Giles in [[Kraków]] would from time to time also hold [[Armenian Rite]] services for the local Armenian community.

A number of cultural and artifacts of Armenian culture can still be found with Poland's present day borders, particularly in the vicinity of [[Zamość]] and [[Rzeszów]]. Additionally a number of [[Khachkars]] have been erected in front of several churches in [[Wrocław]], [[Kraków]], and [[Elbląg]] as memorials to commemorate victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. It is unknown whether the Polish-Armenians were specific targets of [[Nazi Germany]] during World War II, though the Armenians were not [[scapegoat]]ed by the Nazis unlike Jews, [[Romani people]] and other minorities during the Nazi occupation of Poland. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== Armenians today ==
[[Image:Gliwice St. Trinitatis.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Rite Catholic Church]] of the Holy Trinity in [[Gliwice]], built in 1836-38.]]
Most Armenians living in [[Poland]] today origins are from the post-Soviet emigration rather than the older Armenian community. After the [[Soviet Union]]'s collapse thousands of Armenians came to Poland to look for the opportunity to better their life. It is estimated that  between 40,000-80,000 Armenians came to Poland in 1990s, (many of them returned to Armenia or went further West, but up to 10,000 stayed in Poland), with only about 3,000-8,000 from the so-called 'old emigration'.

The ''Foundation of Culture and Heritage of Polish Armenians'' was established by the Ordinary of the Armenian-Catholic rite in Poland, Cardinal [[Józef Glemp]], the [[Primate of Poland]], on April 7, 2006 to care for the books, paintings, religious remnants which were saved from perishing when carried away from Armenian churches situated in the Eastern former parts of Poland captured by the Soviets during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dziedzictwo.ormianie.pl/ Website of the Foundation of Culture and Heritage of Polish Armenians]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Rite Catholic Church]] which had been historically centered in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] as well as in the [[Kresy|pre-1939 Polish borderlands in the east]], now has three parishes; one in [[Gdańsk]], one in [[Warsaw]] and the other in [[Gliwice]].

There are also now schools in [[Poland]] that have recently opened or added on courses that teach Armenian language and culture either on a regular or supplementary basis in [[Warsaw]] and [[Kraków]].

'''Be''' ({{IPA-xx|ʔɑŋ˧ɓe˧|native pronunciation:}}), also known as '''Ong Be''', '''Bê''', or ''Vo Limgao'' ({{zh|c=臨高|p=Lín'gāo}}), is a language spoken by 600,000 people, 100,000 of them monolingual, on the north-central coast of Hainan Island, including the suburbs of the provincial capital [[Haikou]]. According to Ethnologue, it is taught in primary schools.

==Names==
Be speakers refer to themselves as ''ʔaŋ˧vo˧'', with ''ʔaŋ˧'' being the prefix for persons and ''vo˧'' meaning 'village' (Liang 1997:1). Liang (1997) notes that it is similar to the autonym ''ŋaːu˩fɔːn˩'' (from ''ŋaːu˩'' 'person' and ''fɔːn˩'' 'village'), by which Gelong 仡隆 ([[Cun language]]) speakers refer to themselves.

==Classification==
Be is a [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai language]], but its precise relationship to other branches within the Kra-Dai family has yet not been conclusively determined. Hansell (1988)&lt;ref name="Hansell1988"&gt;Hansell, Mark. 1988. The Relation of Be to Tai: Evidence from Tones and Initials. In ''Comparative Kadai: Linguistic studies beyond Tai''. Edited by Jerold A. Edmondson and David B. Solnit. Summer Institute of Linguistics and The University of Texas at Arlington Publications in Linguistics No. 86: 239-288.&lt;/ref&gt; considers Be to be a [[sister group|sister]] of the [[Tai languages|Tai]] branch based on shared vocabulary, and proposes a ''Be–Tai'' grouping.

Based on toponymic evidence from place names with the prefix ''dya''- (调 diao), [[Jinfang Li]] considers Be to have originated from the [[Leizhou]] peninsula of [[Guangdong]] province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wxy.gxun.edu.cn/info/1224/2008.htm 李锦芳教授：“濒危语言吉兆话研究”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Weera Ostapirat (1998),&lt;ref name="Ostapirat1998"&gt;Ostapirat, W. (1998). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23756759 A Mainland Bê Language? / 大陆的Bê语言？]. ''Journal of Chinese Linguistics'', 26(2), 338-344&lt;/ref&gt; analyzing data from Zhang (1992)&lt;ref name="Zhang1992"&gt;Zhang Zhenxing [张振兴]. 1992. "Guangdongsheng Wuchuan fangyan jilve" [广东省吴川方言记略]. In ''Fangyan'' [方言] 1992(3).&lt;/ref&gt;, notes that Be and [[Jizhao language|Jizhao]] share many lexical similarities and sound correspondences, and that [[Jizhao language|Jizhao]] may be a remnant Be-related language on the Chinese mainland.

==Dialects==
Be consists of the Lincheng 临城 (Western) and Qiongshan 琼山 (Eastern) dialects (Liang 1997). Liang (1997:32) documents the following varieties of Be.
*[[Lingao County]] (including Lincheng 临城镇 and Xinying 新盈镇 towns)
*Bailian 白莲, [[Chengmai County]]
*Longtan Township 龙塘镇, [[Qiongshan District]]

Be of Chengmai is intermediate between the Lincheng and Qiongshan dialects, and has features of both (Liang 1997).

Chen (2018) contains extensive comparative lexical data for the Be dialects of Changliu (長流), Yongxing (永興), Longtang (龍塘), Qiaotou (橋頭), Huangtong (皇桐), and Xinying (新盈). The Qiaotou, Huangtong, and Xinying dialects are unintelligible with the Changliu, Yongxing, Longtang, and Shishan (石山) dialects. Chen (2018) also reconstructs Proto-Ong-Be on the basis of this comparative lexical data.

===Classification===
Chen (2018: 82) classifies the Ong-Be dialects into two groups, which are mutually unintelligible with each other.
;Western Ong-Be
*Qiaotou 橋頭
*Huangtong 皇桐
*Maniao 馬裊
*Lincheng 臨城
*Jialai 加來
*Meiliang 美良
*Xinying 新盈

;Eastern Ong-Be
*Longtang 龍塘
*Longqiao 龍橋
*Longquan 龍泉 (formerly Shizilu 十字路)
*Yongxing 永興
*Shishan 石山
*Changliu 長流
*Laocheng 老城

==History==
Liang (1997:16) considers Be to have migrated to Hainan from the [[Leizhou Peninsula]] of [[Guangdong]] about 2,500 years ago during the [[Warring States Period]], but not over 3,000 years ago. Liang &amp; Zhang (1996:21-25)&lt;ref name="Liang1996"&gt;Liang Min 梁敏 &amp; Zhang Junru 张均如. 1996. ''Dongtai yuzu gailun'' 侗台语族概论 / ''An introduction to the Kam–Tai languages''. Beijing: China Social Sciences Academy Press 中国社会科学出版社. {{ISBN|9787500416814}}&lt;/ref&gt; also believe that Be had migrated from the Leizhou Peninsula to northern Hainan about 2,500 years ago during the [[Warring States period]].

'''Blackwater''' is a form of [[pollution]] produced in [[coal preparation plant|coal preparation]].&lt;ref name=def&gt;{{cite web|title=Modelling and Control of Blackwater Treatment in Coal Preparation|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01496398108058319#.UvKtBvl_vJE|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Control of blackwater in coal preparation plant recycle and discharge.

After the recovery of the coal particles from this slurry, the remaining water is black, contains very fine particles of coal.  This blackwater cannot be [[industrial wastewater treatment|processed in a water treatment plant]].&lt;ref&gt;Shiao-Hung Chiang and James T.

==Disasters==
Impoundments for storage of blackwater and other coal-related wastes have a troubled history with often severe environmental consequences.

In February 1972, three dams holding a mixture of coal slurry in [[Logan County, West Virginia]] failed in succession:  {{convert|130000000|USgal|m3}} of [[toxic]] water were released in the [[Buffalo Creek Flood]].  As discussed in the book [[The Buffalo Creek Flood: An Act of Man]], out of a population of 5,000 people, 125 people were killed, 1,121 were injured, and over 4,000 were left homeless. The flood caused 50 million dollars in damages. Despite evidence of negligence, the [[Pittston Coal Company]], which owned the compromised dam, called the event an "[[Act of God]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Environmental Justice Case Study: Buffalo Creek Disaster | url=http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/Jones/buffalo.html#Problem | accessdate=October 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, a {{convert|900|ft|m|sing=on}} high, {{convert|2000|ft|m|sing=on}} long valley fill in [[Lyburn, West Virginia]] failed and slid into a sediment pond at the toe of the fill, generating a large wave of water and sediment that destroyed several cars and houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Massey Valley Fill Disaster, Lyburn, WV | url=http://www.ohvec.org/galleries/mountaintop_removal/006/index.html | date=2002-07-19 | accessdate=April 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Aberfan Disaster]]
*[[Martin County sludge spill]]
*[[Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill]]

==Future technologies==
The ultimate solution to the blackwater problem is to process coal without the use of water.  Such dry-separation technologies are under development.&lt;ref&gt;D. Woodruff and L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''Bon chic, bon genre''' ({{Langnf||French|"Good style, good class"}}) is an expression used in France to refer to a [[subculture]] of stylish members of the Paris [[upper class]]. They are typically well-educated, well-connected, and descended from "[[old money]]" families, preferably with some aristocratic ancestry. The style combines certain fashionable tastes with the appearance of social respectability. The expression is sometimes shortened to "BCBG"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adeleye|first=Gabriel G.|title=World dictionary of foreign expressions: a resource for readers and writers|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=9780865164239|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the fashion company [[BCBG Max Azria]] was named in reference to the subculture). 

Parallels are often seen between this subculture and similar upper-class social groups in the United States ("[[preppy]]") and the United Kingdom ("[[Sloane Ranger]]s").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes, Alexandra and Keith Reader|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary French Culture|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203003305|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with those groups, BCBG drew mainstream attention during the 1980s. Thierry Mantoux published a handbook for BCBG style (''BCBG - Le Guide du bon chic bon genre'') in the 1980s, a French equivalent to ''[[The Official Preppy Handbook]]'' and ''The Sloane Ranger Handbook'', both published earlier in the decade. 

The BCBG social group is not to be confused with the "[[Bobos in Paradise|bobo]]" Paris fashion subculture (short for "bohemian bourgeois").

==Fashion==
The style of BCBG tends towards the conservative and classic, to "de-emphasize 'sexiness' and 'flashy' signs of wealth", and is influenced by "Anglo-Saxon" styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raissiguier|first=Catherine|title=Becoming Women, Becoming Workers: Identity Formation in a French Vocational School|year=1994|publisher=SUNY|isbn=9781438416762|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some brands trendy with the BCBG group include [[Gucci]], [[Max Mara]], [[Le Bon Marché]], and [[Chanel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallon|first=Stephen|title=Paris|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781742203980|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The BCBG social group is associated with certain residential areas in Paris and Versailles. BCBG are often identified with the "NAP" area formed by the triangle between [[Neuilly-Auteuil-Passy]], from the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]] to the [[Bois de Boulogne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes, Alexandra and Keith Reader|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary French Culture|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203003305|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] closer to the centre of Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexiou|first=Joseph|title=Paris for Dummies|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118038741|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th]] and [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissements]] for shopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallon|first=Stephen|title=Paris|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781742203980|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bongo''' (Bungu), also known as ''Dor'', is a [[Central Sudanic language]] spoken by the [[Bongo people (South Sudan)|Bongo people]] in sparsely populated areas of [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr al Ghazal]] in South Sudan. 

== Tone ==
Bongo is [[Tonal languages|tonal language]] that has the high (á), mid (ā), low (à) and falling (â) tones.

All falling tones occur on either long vowels or on vowel clusters or [[Semivowel|glides]]. When the tonal fall is not due to a preceding high tone, it can be indicated by a high tine followed by a low tone

|}

==Numerals==
Bongo has a [[quinary]]-[[vigesimal]] numeral system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/ Bongo at Numeral Systems of the World's Languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421165028/http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/ |date=2014-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
The first ethnologists to work with the Bongo language were [[John Petherick]], who published Bongo word lists in his 1861 work, ''Egypt, the Soudan, and Central Africa''; [[Theodor von Heuglin]], who also published Bongo word lists in ''Reise in das Gebiet des Weissen Nil, &amp;c. 1862-1864'' in 1869; and [[Georg August Schweinfurth]], who contributed sentences and vocabularies in his ''Linguistische Ergebnisse, Einer Reise Nach Centralafrika'' in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bongo.'' Evans-Pritchard, E. E. Sudan Notes and Records (1929): 1-62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] published additional Bongo word lists in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;''The non-Dinka peoples of the Amadi and Rumbek Districts.'' Evans-Pritchard, E. E.. Sudan Notes and Records (1937): 156-158&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent scholarship has been done by Eileen Kilpatrick, who published a phonology of Bongo in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''Bongo Phonology.'' Eileen Kilpatrick. Occasional Papers in the Study of Sudanese Languages 4 (1985): 1-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Amateur Television Club''' ('''BATC''') is the world's largest television technology club; it has members in the UK and all around the world and is a [[non-profit]] making club run by an elected [[committee]] of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s for the benefit of its members. Membership is open to all who are interested in [[television]], [[amateur]] or [[professional]], indeed the club has many members who work for major broadcasting companies.

== CQ-TV ==
The clubs magazine, CQ-TV,&lt;ref&gt;CQ-TV published by the British Amateur Television Club, ISSN 1466-6790&lt;/ref&gt; is published four times a year and is sent free of charge to BATC members. It is A4 size and has up to 50 pages and it is now in its 6th decade of publication. Available in paper (part colour) or in cyber form in full colour, as a [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]. Articles cover the full range of television interests from [[High-definition television|HD]] to [[Slow-scan television|Slowscan]] and Studios to Transmitting. Educational and construction projects are a feature of most issues and a full archive of past issues of CQ-TV is available from the BATC.

== The BATC in today’s world ==
The objectives of the BATC are to encourage and co-ordinate the activities of amateurs involved in all aspects of television. The BATC liaises with the [[Radio Society of Great Britain|RSGB]] and other international [[Amateur television|ATV]] organisations and is represented at international policy making conferences. The club organises meetings devoted to ATV as well as attending numerous radio meetings around the UK. The BATC fully embraces the Internet, with two web sites and an RSS news feed. The club runs various ATV contests throughout the year for fixed and portable stations and, there is an International ATV contest, organised each year by a different member country of the [[International Amateur Radio Union|IARU]].

== The History of the BATC ==
The BATC was founded in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Wireless World, Pub. Iliffe, volume 57, August 1951, page 319&lt;/ref&gt; The first committee was formed and the publication of CQ-TV started, the world’s first magazine for amateur television transmission. In the early days of the club, members constructed their own cameras, televisions and transmitters. As early as 1954 members transmitted colour signals over a 13-mile path, establishing what is believed to be a record.&lt;ref&gt;Wireless World, Pub. Iliffe, volume 62, April 1956, page 153&lt;/ref&gt; The BATC were (and still are) instrumental in the development of the repeater network in the UK and the rest of the world. One of the major projects was the development of a repeater control system using a purpose designed microprocessor. The BATC is affiliated to the Radio Society of Great Britain and has frequent contact with other ATV organisations.

== The Future of the BATC ==
The Club is at the forefront of the new digital technologies with recent projects for digital transmission and reception and the professional SDI standards. Work is underway on using the new H264 digital encoder. This encoder has a number of modes and offers reduced bandwidth signals for the crowded amateur bands. A new BATC forum service has just been introduced and is live now on [https://forum.batc.org.uk '''Forum Link''']. It is thought that this will become the premier forum for news, help and exchange of TV information. From July 2008 the BATC has started a new video streaming service for the amateur television and radio hobbies.

== Television transmission ==
To send a television picture in colour across a radio link requires at least a camera, a transmitter, a receiver, a suitable antenna (aerial) and a monitor (TV). The camera provides the picture and the transmitter sends the picture. The transmitter must produce adequate power at microwave frequencies. The receiver must be sensitive at the frequency in use and decode the vision and sound signals. Things that can be added to these basic “blocks” are: multiple cameras, vision captions and effects. The expansion of a television system is almost boundless, a fully equipped ATV studio (and some amateurs do have these) can come later. In the UK all bands from 70&amp;nbsp;cm upwards are available for ATV. In the [[23 cm]] band and above the standard mode of transmission for ATV is frequency modulation of the vision carrier with a 6&amp;nbsp;MHz FM audio sub-carrier. The UK ATV calling and talkback frequency is 144.75&amp;nbsp;MHz FM. Listen or put out a “CQ ATV” call to make initial contact. A licence issued by your national authority is required to operate a television transmitting station, licence conditions will vary in different counties — in the UK this is administered by [[Ofcom#Licensing|OFCOM]].

== Membership ==
This is open to all who are interested in television, amateur or professional, anywhere in the world. An amateur radio [[call sign]] is not required for membership, indeed many members are interested in studio and video techniques. The BATC has just introduced an additional cyber membership category to allow instant delivery, low cost membership.

'''Cannabis in the Czech Republic''' is illegal for recreational use, but personal possession has been decriminalized since 1 January 2010 and medical cannabis has been legal since 1 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lidovky.cz/ve-zdravotnictvi-nabyva-ucinnosti-rada-zmen-lecba-konopim-legalni-104-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A130401_124139_ln_domov_hm Zdravotnictví prochází změnou.

==Decriminalization==
Possession of up to 15 grams of dry cannabis for personal use, or cultivation of up to five plants, is classed as a misdemeanor under laws enacted in 2010 (via a non incrimination decree, 467/2009 Coll.).&lt;ref name="kush"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drugnet/online/2010/69/article11 |title=New Czech penal code enters into force |last=Hughes |first=Brendan |date=March 2010 |website=Drugnet Europe |publisher=Drugnet Europe |access-date=23 January 2017 |quote=the new penal code criminalises the cultivation or possession of an illicit drug for personal use when the quantity is ‘greater than small’. However, the new code now establishes quantity limits via a binding governmental decree (No 467/2009 Coll.) (2). For example, it stipulates that a crime is committed on possession of more than 5g of cannabis resin (previously 10g), 15g of herbal cannabis or 1g of cocaine, and on cultivation of more than five marijuana plants.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On conviction, a fine of up to 15,000CZK is applicable, but fines are typically much lower.&lt;ref name="kush"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kushtourism.com/czech-republic-marijuana-information/ |title=Czech Republic Marijuana Information |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017 |website=Kush Tourism |publisher=Kush Tourism LLC |access-date=23 January 2017 |quote= If you have more than 15 grams of cannabis or are growing more than five plants, the maximum penalty is a custodial sentence of one year. However, simple possession charges rarely receive the maximum charge.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannabis is easy to obtain at concerts and in bars.{{cn|date=April 2017}} However, cannabis remains illegal, and possession of larger amounts can lead to a jail sentence of one year.&lt;ref name="kush"/&gt; Trafficking is treated as a major crime, with the maximum penalty set at 18 years.

==Medical cannabis==
A bill allowing cannabis to be legally available on prescription in pharmacies as a medicine was passed by the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Chamber of Deputies]] on 7 December 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Česky |url=http://www.psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=6&amp;t=590 |title=Snìmovní tisk 590 |publisher=Psp.cz |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 126 votes for legalisation and 7 against (27 abstained and 46 were absent from the vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Česky |url=http://www.psp.cz/sqw/hlasy.sqw?g=56985 |title=Hlasování Poslanecké snìmovny - 49/103 |publisher=Psp.cz |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Czech Senate]] passed the bill on 30 January 2013. From the total of 81 senators 67 voted for legalisation and 2 voted against (5 senators abstained and 7 were absent from the vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.cz/xqw/xervlet/pssenat/hlasy?G=13510&amp;O=9 |title=Senát PÈR: 4. schùze, 4. hlasování, 30.01.2013 |publisher=Senat.cz |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also stipulated that only imported cannabis would be allowed for sale in the first year "to ensure standards." After that, sales may expand to include registered, domestic production that is strictly monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carney |first=Sean |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/01/30/czech-parliament-backs-medical-marijuana-with-a-catch/ |title=Czech Parliament Backs Medical Marijuana, With a Catch - Emerging Europe Real Time - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies''' ('''CIHTS'''; {{Bo|t=ཝ་ཎ་མཐོ་སློབ|w=wa Na mtho slob}}), formerly called '''Central University for Tibetan Studies''' ('''CUTS'''), is a [[Deemed University]] founded in [[Sarnath]], [[Varanasi]], [[India]], in 1967, as an autonomous organisation under Union [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name=UGC&gt;{{cite web|title=Deemed Universities|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/inside/deemed%20universities/highertibetanstudies.html|work=Deemed Universities|publisher=UGC|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The CIHTS was founded by Pt. [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]] in consultation with [[Tenzin Gyatso]], the [[Dalai Lama|Dalai of Lama]], with the aim of educating Tibetan youths in exile and Himalayan border students as well as with the aim of retranslating into Sanskrit and translating into Hindi and other modern Indian languages lost Indo-Buddhist Sanskrit texts that now exist only in Tibetan.&lt;ref name=MoC&gt;{{cite book|author=Department of Culture, India |title=Indian culture : tradition &amp; continuity |year=2002|publisher=Department of Culture, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Government of India |location=New Delhi |isbn=9788187614081 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vptAAAAMAAJ&amp;q |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally it functioned as a special constituent wing of [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit University]], Varanasi. In the early 1970s the [[Government of India]] reviewed the progress of the institute and decided to accord it a status of an autonomous body under the Department of Culture, Ministry of Education, Government of India in 1977 with 100% financial support from the Indian government.

The institute steadily progressed and the Indian government declared it a [[Deemed University]] on 5 April 1988. Formerly headed by the like of Kyabje Zong Rinpoche, Samdong Rinpoche (former Prime Minister of the Central Tibetan Administrations), and [[Ngawang Samten]], also a former alumnus, the institute is headed by Lobsang Norbu Shastri.&lt;ref name="VC's Message"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cuts.ac.in/GuestSection/vc_desk.html | title=VC's Message | publisher=CUTS | date=2016 | accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted by faculty members, with the goal of achieving excellence in the fields of [[Tibetology]] and [[Buddhology]]. The university attracts a large number{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2016}} of students from many regions of the Himalayan family, with students coming from Kinnaur, Lahaul, Spiti, Ladakh, Monpas from Arunachal. Students from Nepal consist of students, from Sherpas, Lamas and many more from the bordering regions of Mustang and Dolpo. Other than these, students also come from Bhutan and Mongolia.

The university also offers courses in Tibetan medicine (Sowa Rigpa), Astrology and Fine Arts.

On 14 January 2009 the institute was officially declared as a university and the inauguration was made by the XIV Dalai Lama. Now the name of the university is Central University of Tibetan Studies.

The '''Children's Rights Movement''' is a historical and modern movement committed to the acknowledgment, expansion, and/or regression of the [[children's rights|rights of children]] around the world. It begun in the early part of the last century and has been an effort by government organizations, advocacy groups, academics, lawyers, lawmakers, and judges to construct a system of laws and policies that enhance and protect the lives of children.&lt;ref&gt;(Ranks, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; While the historical definition of [[child]] has varied, the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] asserts that "A child is any human being below the age of eighteen years, unless under the law applicable to the child, [[Age of majority|majority]] is attained earlier."&lt;ref&gt;(1989) [[s:UN Convention on the Rights of the Child|"Convention on the Rights of the Child"]], United Nations. Retrieved 2/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no definitions of other terms used to describe young people such as "[[adolescent]]s", "teenagers" or "[[youth]]" in international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrea.org/index.php?base_id=81 "Children and youth"], Human Rights Education Association. Retrieved 2/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that child labor had been effectively eradicated in parts of the world, the movement turned to other things, but it again stalled when [[World War II]] broke out and children and women began to enter the work force once more. With millions of adults at war, the children were needed to help keep the country running. In Europe, children served as couriers, intelligence collectors, and other underground resistance workers in opposition to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s regime.

==History==

===Natural rights===
[[File:Foundling Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Foundling Hospital]], founded in 1741 as a philanthropic endeavour to rescue orphans]]
The concept of children having particular rights is a relatively new one. Traditional attitudes towards children tended to consider them as mere extensions of the household and 'owned' by their parents and/or legal guardian, who exerted absolute parental control.

Views began to change during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when tradition was increasingly challenged and the value of individual autonomy and [[natural right]]s began to be asserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Rights - Historical Roots Of The Children's Rights Movement|url=http://family.jrank.org/pages/247/Children-s-Rights-Historical-Roots-Children-s-Rights-Movement.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Foundling Hospital]] in [[London]] was founded in 1741 as a children's home for the "education and maintenance of exposed and deserted young children". [[Thomas Spence]], an English political [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] wrote the first modern defence of the natural rights of children in ''The Rights of Infants'', published in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus-educational.com/PRspence.htm Thomas Spence], Spartacus.schoolnet, accessed 29 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social reform===
{{Further|Child labour}}
With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], children as young as six began to be employed in the [[factory|factories]] and [[coal mine]]s in often inhumane conditions with long hours and little pay. During the early 19th century this exploitation began to attract growing opposition. The terrible conditions of the poor urban children was exposed to liberal middle-class opinion, notably by the author [[Charles Dickens]] in his novel [[Oliver Twist]]. [[Social reform]]ers, such as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]],  began to mount a vigorous campaign against this practice.

[[Image:coaltub.png|left|frame|The use of [[child labour]] increased during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and became a rallying cry for social reformers.]]
Ameliorating [[legislation]] was achieved with a series of [[Factory Acts]] passed during the 19th century, where working hours for children were limited and they were no longer permitted to work during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Statutes at Large: Statutes of the United Kingdom, 1801–1806|year=1822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkmpYG4zItsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children younger than nine were not allowed to work and those between 9-16 were limited to 16 hours per day.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England]". Laura Del Col, West Virginia University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2507680 | pmid=20759953 | volume=2 | title=The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 | journal=Br Med J | pages=1871–2 | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2139.1871 | year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factories were also required to provide education to the apprentices in reading, writing and arithmetic for the first four years.

An influential social reformer was [[Mary Carpenter]], who campaigned on behalf of neglected children who had turned to [[juvenile delinquency]]. In 1851 she proposed the establishment of three types of schools; free day schools for the general population, industrial schools for those in need and reformatory schools for young offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Mary|title=Reformatory Schools: For the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes and for Juvenile Offenders|publisher=C.

In the United States, the Children's Rights Movement began with the [[orphan train]]. In the big cities, when a child's parents died or were extremely poor, the child frequently had to go to work to support himself and/or his family. Boys generally became [[factory]] or [[coal]] workers, and girls became [[prostitution|prostitutes]] or saloon girls, or else went to work in a [[sweat shop]]. All of these jobs paid only starvation wages.

In 1852, [[Massachusetts]] required children to attend school. In 1853, [[Charles Brace]] founded the ''[[Children's Aid Society]]'', which worked hard to take street children in. The following year, the children were placed on a train headed for the West, where they were adopted, and often given work. By 1929, the orphan train stopped running altogether, but its principles lived on.

[[Image:Abolish child slavery.jpg|thumb|[[Youth activism|Youth activists]] in the United States in the early 1900s.]]
The ''[[National Child Labor Committee]]'', an organization dedicated to the abolition of all child labor, was formed in the 1890s. It managed to pass one law, which was struck down by the Supreme Court two years later for violating a child's right to contract his work. In 1924, [[United States Congress|Congress]] attempted to pass a [[constitutional amendment]] that would authorize a national child labor law. This measure was blocked, and the bill was eventually dropped. It took the [[Great Depression]] to end child labor nationwide; adults had become so desperate for jobs that they would work for the same wage as children. In 1938, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] which, amongst other things, placed limits on many forms of child labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hakim|first=Joy|authorlink=|title=A History of Us: War, Peace and all that Jazz|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|location=New York|pages=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-19-509514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish educationalist [[Janusz Korczak]] wrote of the rights of children in his book ''How to Love a Child'' (Warsaw, 1919); a later book was entitled ''The Child's Right to Respect'' (Warsaw, 1929). In 1917, following the Russian Revolution, the Moscow branch of the organization [[Proletkult]] produced a Declaration of Children's Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mally|first=Lynn|authorlink = |editor=|others=|title =Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia|origyear=|month =|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft6m3nb4b2&amp;brand=ucpress|format=|accessdate=2007-09-21|edition =|series=|date=|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=|oclc=|doi=|id=|pages=180|chapter=|chapterurl=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft6m3nb4b2&amp;chunk.id=d0e8846&amp;toc.id=d0e8241&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;anchor.id=JD_Page_180#X|quote=The Moscow Proletkult even passed a "Declaration of Children's Rights," which guaranteed that children could pick their own form of education, their own religion, and could even leave their parents if they chose|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of the Child===
The first formal charter to set out the rights of children was drafted by British social reformer [[Eglantyne Jebb]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femindia.net/uploads/1/0/2/1/10215849/history_of_child_rights_and_child_labour-1.pdf|title=History of child rights and child labour|author=Rama Kant Rai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jebb founded [[Save the Children]] in 1919, one of the first charities aimed at the young, to help alleviate the starvation of children in Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] during the Allied [[blockade of Germany]] in [[World War I]] which continued after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]].&lt;ref&gt;Yates 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nehru sweets oratarians Nongpoh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]]  distributes sweets to children on [[Children's Day]] in India.]]
Her experiences there and later in [[RSFSR|Russia]], led her to believe that the rights of a child needed be especially protected and enforced, and her stipulations consisted of the following criteria:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#The child must be given the means requisite for its normal development, both materially and spiritually.
#The child that is hungry must be fed, the child that is sick must be nursed, the child that is backward must be helped, the delinquent child must be reclaimed, and the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succored.
#The child must be the first to receive relief in times of distress.
#The child must be put in a position to earn a livelihood, and must be protected against every form of exploitation.
#The child must be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted to the service of its fellow men.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This manifesto was adopted by the [[International Save the Children Union]] and endorsed by the [[League of Nations]] General Assembly in 1924 as the World Child Welfare Charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/United-Nations-International-Childrens-Emergency-Fund-UNICEF-Company-History.html UNICEF Company History]. Retrieved 2008-09-04&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, the first International Child Welfare Congress was held in Geneva, where the Declaration was widely discussed and supported by organisations and governments.

===Declaration of the Rights of the Child===
The [[International Save the Children Union|SCIU]] also pressed the newly formed United Nations in 1946 to adopt the World Child Welfare Charter. This was achieved in 1959, when the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted an expanded version as the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-1386(XIV) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=14 |resolution_number=1386 |title=Declaration of the Rights of the Child|date=20 November 1959|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main  provisions are:

*  protection rights: the right to be protected against maltreatment and neglect, the right to be protected from all forms of exploitation
*  provision rights: the right to food and to health care, the right to education, the right to benefit from social security
*  participation rights: the right to act in certain circumstances and the right to be involved in decision-making&lt;ref&gt;(Roose, R., &amp; Bouverne-De Bie, M., 2007 p.431)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the formation of the [[United Nations]] to the present day, the Children's Rights Movement has become global in focus. Children around the world still suffer from forced [[child labor]], [[Genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]], [[Military use of children|military service]], and [[sex trafficking]]. Several international organizations have rallied to the assistance of children. These include [[Save the Children]], [[Free the Children]], and the [[Children's Defense Fund]].

The [[Child Rights Information Network]], or CRIN, formed in 1983, is a group of 1,600 [[non-governmental organization]]s from around the world which advocate for the implementation of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. Organizations report on their countries' progress towards implementation, as do governments that have ratified the Convention. Every 5 years reporting to the [[United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child]] is required for governments.

==Children's rights by country==
{{see also|Children's Ombudsman}}
Many countries have created an institute of children's rights commissioner or [[Children's Ombudsman|ombudsman]], the first being Norway in 1981. Others include Finland, Sweden, and Ukraine, which was the first country worldwide to install a child in that post in 2005.

===Argentina===
In 2005, in order to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, national Law for the Integral Protection of Children and Adolescents was enacted. This not only allows for protective measures for children, but also created the groundwork for a juvenile justice system. This system allows for children to be integrated back into society and established tactics to protect children from abuse and exploitation.&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"&gt;(Honorable Poe Ted, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia is a participant to all significant treaties that impact on children’s rights. The rights and protection of children are governed by both Federal and state and territory law.&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"/&gt;

===Brazil===
Brazil is a founding member of the UN and a signatory of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by General Assembly resolution in 1948. The Universal Declaration of the Rights of the Child emphasizes that motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and that children born out of wedlock are allowed the same social protection. In 1990, Brazil approved the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and fully incorporated it onto Brazil’s positive law.&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"/&gt;

===China===
China has ratified many international documents with regard to children’s rights protection, including the 1989 Convention on Rights of the Child,&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"/&gt; the Optional Protocol to the Convention on Rights of Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography 2000,&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"/&gt; the Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention 1999,&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"/&gt; and The Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993.&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"/&gt;

===France===
France is in cooperation with all the major treaties dealing with children rights. It has in place several mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular, an ombudsman for children.&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"/&gt;

===Germany===
Germany is in agreement with the global conventions that protect the rights of the child. However, Germany prefers to interpret these according to the principles of European agreements, specifically the [[European Human Rights Convention]] and also in accordance with [[German Constitutional guarantees]].&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"/&gt;

===Greece===
Greece has various laws and a number of measures and services to promote and advance the rights of children. In 2002, the Greek Parliament adopted a new law on human trafficking; in 2003 the juvenile system was reformed; in 2006 an additional law was created to combat intra-family violence which states a prohibition of corporal punishment of children.&lt;ref name="Honorable Poe Ted, 2011"/&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Timeline of children's rights in the United States}}There is a long history of children's rights in the U.S.&lt;sup&gt;[[Children's rights movement#cite note-20|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Many children's rights advocates in the U.S. today advocate for a smaller agenda than their international peers. According to the U.S, for the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.  Groups predominately focus on [[Child abuse|child abuse and neglect]], child fatalities, foster care, youth [[aging out]] of foster care, preventing foster care placement, and [[adoption]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Children's rights movement#cite note-21|[21]]]&lt;/sup&gt; A longstanding movement promoting [[History of youth rights in the United States|youth rights in the United States]] has made substantial gains in the past. Refer to the  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/crc.pdf|title=Convention Rights of a Child|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Convention of the Rights of a Child.]

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Timeline of children's rights in the United Kingdom}}
The Children's Rights Movement assert that it is the case that children have rights which adults, states and government have a responsibility to uphold. The UK maintains a position that UNCRC is not legally enforceable and is hence 'aspirational' only - albeit a 2003 [[ECHR]] ruling states: "The human rights of children and the standards to which all governments must aspire in realizing these rights for all children are set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child." (Extract from Sahin v Germany, Grand Chamber judgment of the ECHR, July 8, 2003). 18 years after ratification, the four Children's Commissioners in the devolved administrations have united in calling for adoption of the Convention into domestic legislation, making children's rights legally enforceable..

==Convention on the Rights of the Child==
[[File:Vienna 2010-11-20 'Kinderrechte' Smart Mob 043 All those formally granted children's rights -- WHERE ARE THEY.jpg|thumb|Vienna, Austria; UN&amp;nbsp;Children's&amp;nbsp;Rights&amp;nbsp;day, 2010-11-20.]]
The [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] has 54 articles, each outlining a different right. They cover four different groupings of rights; survival, protection, development and participation.&lt;ref&gt;("Children's rights," 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Convention establishes a standard premise for the children's rights movement. It has been ratified by all but two countries; the United States and [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name=untreaty&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection.  ''[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Convention on the Rights of the Child]''.

October 2003, Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention is supplemented by the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] (against [[military use of children]]) and the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] (against [[sale of children]], [[child prostitution]] and [[child pornography]]).

==Children in power==
Presently, there are at least thirty countries that have some kind of non-adult structure of parliament, whether nationally or in cities, villages or schools. Many children's parliaments, especially in wealthier nations, are oriented more toward children's education in politics than toward the actual exercise of power in adult political systems.&lt;ref&gt;(Wall, J., &amp; Dar, A., 2011 p.597)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some children's parliaments do exercise a degree of political power. One of the first children's parliaments, set up in the 1990s in village schools in Rajasthan, India, involves children aged six to fourteen electing child representatives who have been able to make genuine differences for their communities. Some children's parliaments, such as in the city of Barra Mansa in Brazil, have extensive powers over children's issues and control parts of the government budget.&lt;ref&gt;(Wall, J., &amp; Dar, A., 2011 p.597,598)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also private institutions which are largely governed by children, for instance [[democratic schools]] (including [[Sudbury schools]]).

'''Chilean Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of Chilean descent or a [[Chile]]-born person who resides in [[Canada]]. According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]] there were 38,140 Canadians who claimed full or partial Chilean ancestry. The first major wave of Chilean arrival in Canada began in the second half of the twentieth century. This was also the first great wave of [[Latin America]]n immigrants in Canada and the third Latin American wave in that country (though the previous two were smaller).

== History ==
After the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état]] carried out by Army General [[Augusto Pinochet]] on September 11, 1973 in [[Chile]], which overthrew the elected government of [[Salvador Allende]] and established a military dictatorship, a significant number of Chileans emigrated to Canada in early 1974. This migration of refugees to Canada lasted until the nineties, when Pinochet's rule over Chile ended.

Although the Canadian government rejected these political refugees, the Canadian population in general had a greater acceptance of them. Church groups, such as the [[Canadian Council of Churches]], and spontaneously formed citizens' organizations, helped refugees in income and settlement of the country. Not all the population supported the newcomers, however. Small demonstrations were developed rejecting Chilean immigrants, labeling them [[Marxists]], and supporting the coup in Chile that broke with the Socialist government, replacing it with a neoliberal dictatorship.&lt;ref name = Diálochd&gt;[http://dialogos.ca/2007/07/chilean-refugees-in-canada-and-their-long-term-impact/ Diálogos: Chilean Refugees in Canada and their Long-Term Impact].

== Legacy ==
The most important consequence of the arrival of Chilean refugees to the country was the founding of organizations whose aim is to help to the country's growing Latin American community. According to studies, the Chileans who arrived in Canada after the coup in Chile brought with them political activism, which caused the formation of Chilean partnerships and associations which eventually became organizations for the Latino community in Canada. Examples of this include the Arauco cooperative housing in Toronto and various associations and publications in [[Alberta]], as well as the television news program ''Nosotros'' (We) and the radio program ''Hispanoamérica'' in [[Edmonton]]. In other cases, Chileans formed and worked on pan-Latin American organizations that have helped  political and economic refugees [[Hispanic people|Hispanics]] adjust to life in Canada, and may be considered essential in the formation of these associations.&lt;ref name = Diálochd/&gt;

In 2014, the city of Memphis ranked eleventh in violent crimes for major cities around the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 25 Most Dangerous Cities In The USA|url = http://www.citiesjournal.com/the-14-most-dangerous-cities-in-the-usa/11/|website = Cities Journal|accessdate = 2015-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Memphis led the nation in number of violent crimes. In 2001, 2005, and 2007, Memphis ranked second most dangerous in the nation among cities with a population over 500,000.  It also ranked as most dangerous in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/cit07pop.htm#25 |title=Morgan Quitno 2007 Crime Rankings |publisher=Morganquitno.com |accessdate=July 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105095719/http://www.morganquitno.com/cit07pop.htm#25 |archivedate=January 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 182 [[gangs in Memphis, Tennessee]] with 8,400 gang members in the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723114749/http://wknofm.org/post/think-gangs-are-only-memphis-poorest-neighborhoods-think-again |title=Think Gangs Are Only In Memphis' Poorest Neighborhoods?

== Crime dynamics ==
In 2004 [[violent crime]] in Memphis reached a record low for over a decade, that trend subsequently reversed. In 2005, Memphis was ranked the 4th most dangerous city with a population of 500,000 or higher in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#500,000+ |title=Morgan Quitno 2006 Crime Rankings |publisher=Morganquitno.com |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, Memphis held the top position of number of violent crimes in America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent statistics show a downward trend in crime in Memphis. Between 2006 and 2008, the crime rate fell by 16%. The first half of 2009 saw a reduction in serious crime of over 10% from the previous year.  

=== Increase ===

Crime in Memphis increased in 2005, and saw a dramatic rise in the first half of 2006. Nationally, cities follow similar trends, and crime numbers tend to be cyclical. Local experts and criminologists cite gang recruitment as one possible cause of the rise in crime in Memphis, and a reduction of 66% of federal funding to the [[Memphis Police Department]]. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of full-time officers in the Memphis Police Department fell by 23.2%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/csllea08.pdf  U.S. Department of Justice, Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, 2008, p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of 2006, robbery of businesses increased 52.5%, robbery of individuals increased 28.5%, and [[homicide]] increased 18% over the same period of 2005. The Memphis Police Department has responded with the initiation of Operation Blue C.R.U.S.H. (Crime Reduction Using Statistical History), which targets crime hotspots and repeat offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Memphis ended 2008 with 167 murders, a slight increase from the 164 reported in 2007.

Memphis ended 2005 with 154 murders (431 in whole TN), and 2006 ended with 160. 2007 saw 164 murders (397 in whole TN).

=== Decrease ===

Violent crimes dropped from 12,939 in 2008 to 12,047 the next year. Robbery dropped from 4,788 in 2008 to 4,137 in 2009. [[Aggravated assault]] dropped 53,870 in 2008 to 47,158 in 2009 ([[FBI]]'s [[Uniform Crime Reports|UCR]]).  

The Memphis Police Department's use of the FBI [[National Incident Based Reporting System]], which is a more detailed method of reporting crimes than what is used in many other major cities, has been cited as a reason for Memphis's frequent appearance on lists of most dangerous U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations, violent crime in Memphis decreased by 6.4% in 2014. Non-violent crimes decreased by 16.3%. Both of these were a much greater decrease than Tennessee's statewide averages of 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TBI: Memphis has strong decline in crime rate|url = http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/crime/tbi-memphis-has-strong-decline-in-crime-rate_34192617|accessdate = 2015-04-27|first = Jody|last = Callahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Culture of Sindh''' ({{lang-sd|'''سنڌ جي ثقافت'''}},{{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|سندھ کی ثقافت}}}}) has its roots in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. [[Sindh]] has been shaped by the largely desert region, the natural resources it had available, and continuous foreign influence. The [[Indus River|Indus or Sindhu River]] that passes through the land, and the [[Arabian Sea]] (that defines its borders) also supported the seafaring traditions among the local people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.pacific.net.sg/~makhdoom/culture.html Sindhi Culture And Customs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030702173523/http://home.pacific.net.sg/~makhdoom/culture.html |date=2003-07-02 }}. Retrieved on 9 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The local climate also reflects why the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] have the [[Sindhi language|language]], [[folklore]], [[tradition]]s, [[customs]] and lifestyle that are so different from the neighboring regions.&lt;ref&gt;Thakur, U (1959). Sindhi Culture. University of Bombay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jhulelal.com/culture.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Sindhi culture is also practiced by the [[Sindhi diaspora]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Sindh}}
The roots of Sindhi culture go back to the distant past. Archaeological research during 19th and 20th centuries showed the roots of social life, religion and culture of the people of the Sindh: their agricultural practices, traditional arts and crafts, customs and tradition and other parts of social life, going back to a mature [[Indus valley civilization|Indus Valley Civilization]] of the third millennium BC. Recent researches have traced the Indus valley civilization to even earlier ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Hasan Dani|Dani, A.H.]] and Zaman, W. (1975). Proceedings of the First Congress of Pakistan History &amp; Culture. University of Islamabad Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological discoveries===
[[Image:Mohenjodaro Sindh.jpeg|thumb|[[Mohenjo-daro|'''Mohen-Jo-Daro''']]]]
The excavations of [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohen-Jo-Daro]] have unfolded the city life of a [[civilization]] of people with values, a distinct identity and culture. Therefore, the first definition of the Sindhi culture emanates from that over the 7000-year-old [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. This is the pre-Aryan period, about 3,000 years BC., when the urban civilization in Sindh was at its peak. [[Image:Ranikot Fort 07a.jpg|thumb|left|'''[[Ranikot Fort]]''']] In Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]]'s book, ''Civilization of the Indus Valley and Beyond'', it is said that; "[[Civilization]], in a minimum sense of the term, is the art of living in towns, with all that the condition implies in respect of social skills and disciplines." When people speak of Sindhi civilization, they have to concern themselves, mainly with the material and concrete side of human habitation of which Sindhi culture is the only essence called the superstructure.{{Or|date=July 2009}} The present day Sindh, along with the Northern part of the Indus Valley Civilization (around 3000 to 2500 BC) is located on its urban civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhulelal.com/culture.html Sindhi Culture]. Retrieved on 9 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ranikot Fort]] is also a landmark of the Indus valley civilization. It is the world's largest fort, with walls extending to 20&amp;nbsp;km. It has been called a "second Wall of China"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}, and attracts many visitors.

== Literature ==
{{Main|Sindhi literature}}

===History===
Sindhi language is ancient and rich in literature. Its writers have contributed extensively in various forms of literature in both poetry and [[prose]]. [[Sindhi literature]] is very rich, and is one of the world's oldest literatures. The earliest reference to Sindhi literature is contained in the writings of [[Arab]] historians. It is established that Sindhi was the first eastern language into which the [[Quran]] was translated, in the 8th or 9th century. There is evidence of Sindhi poets reciting their verses before the Muslim [[Caliphs]] in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, A.M. (1983). Makli Hill: A Center of Islamic Culture in Sindh. ''First Syed Hussamuddin Rashdi Memorial Lecture''. Institute of Central and West Asian Studies, University of Karachi.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also recorded that treatises were written in Sindhi on [[astronomy]], [[medicine]] and history during the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Asani, A. (2003). At the Crossroads of Indic and Iranian Civilizations: Sindhi Literary Culture. In S.I. Pollock, ''Literary Cultures in History: Reconstructions from South Asia''. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sindhi sufi singers.jpg|thumb|Sindhi sufi singers]] --&gt;
Sindhi poetry is also prominent in Sindhi culture. Poetry of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]] and [[Sachal Sarmast]] is very famous throughout Sindh.

==Music==

[[File:Sindhi Musician.JPG|thumb|right|200px]]
{{Main|Sindhi music}}
Sindhi music has its own unique quality. It is performed in many different ways. [[Sufi music]] is performed at shrines, and other simple music is performed at [[studio]]s and gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf, M. (1975). Sindh Quarterly. Shah Abdul Latif Cultural Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sindhi sports Malakhiro.jpg|thumb|Sindhi sports ''Malakhiro'' in action]] --&gt;
There are many regional sports that are played in [[Sindh]]. [[Malakhra|Malakhiro]] is one of the famous sports of Sindh. Other sports include ''Wanjh wati'', ''Kodi Kodi'', ''Beelarhoo'', ''Thipai Rand'', ''Notinn'' and ''Biloor'',''cricket'',''football''.

== Cultural character ==
The ancient [[Indus valley civilization|Sindhi civilization]] was the place, where the aesthetic utilization of leisure was freely indulged. There has been evidence, that the excavations of sites dating back to 3000 BC (all over Sindh) is also true, around 1200 years ago when Jaina Dakshiniya Chihna (778 AD) described the distinguished features of Sindhis in this way: "Elegant, with a lovely, soft and slow gait, they are fond of the art of Gandharvas (that is, songs, music and dancing) and full affection towards their country."             :Nasir Kalwar

==Sindhi Cultural Day (Ekta Day)==
[[File:Sindh.cultural.day.jpg|thumb|Karachi:Teen Talwar wrapped in Ajrak in connection with Sindhi Cultural day]]{{Main article|Sindhi Cultural Day}}

[[Sindhis]] celebrate Sindh Cultural day worldwide every year on first Sunday of December, by wearing [[Ajrak]] &amp; [[Sindhi cap|Sindhi Topi]]. On that occasion, the musical programmes and rallies are held in many cities to mark the day with zeal.Major hallmarks of cities and towns are decorated with Sindhi Ajrak to highlight the cultural values of Sindh. The people across [[Sindh]] exchange gifts of Ajrak and Topi at various ceremonies.Even, the children and women are [[Sindhi dress|dressed]] up in Ajrak, assembling at the grand gathering, where famous Sindhi singers sing Sindhi songs, which depicts love and progress of Sindh. The musical performances of the artists compel the participants to dance on Sindhi tunes and ‘Jeay Sindh Jeay-Sindh Wara Jean’.
 
&lt;br&gt;All Political, social and religious organisations of Sindh, besides the Sindh culture department and administrations of various schools, colleges and universities, organize variety of events including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, drama and theatrics performances, tableau and literary sittings to mark this annual festivity. Sindhi culture, history and heritage are highlighted at the events.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Ekta (Unity) day is observed to display solidarity among the Sindhi-speaking masses, the event is celebrated not only in Karachi, but throughout Sindh. The province’s culture and unity day was celebrated for the first time on December 6, 2009 (as the Sindhi Topi Day) as a backlash to the comments of anchorman Dr [[Shahid Masood]] who had criticised President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] for wearing a Sindhi cap on his foreign tours. People across the [[Sindh]] province condemned Masood’s comments via SMS, which ultimately resulted in the announcement of celebrating the Sindhi Topi Day. Moreover, a prominent figure in Sindh, Ali Kazi, had started issuing a call for observing a unity day, and a large number of people responded to the call and started celebrating the culture and the unity days.Ever since, Sindhi media groups have started to celebrate the day as ‘Sindhi Cultural Day’ or 'Ekta day'.The Sindhi language TV channels including [[Kawish Television Network|KTN]], [[Sindh TV]], [[Awaz Television Network|Awaz TV]] and [[Mehran TV]] broadcast special programmes on the culture of Sindh, besides these media outlets separately arrange the mega musical events, which also attract large audience to celebrate the Culture Day every year. The Sindhi language TV channels and Political Parties of Sindh, first time celebrated Sindhi Cultural Day (Ekta Day), together on December 8, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sindhi Culture Day: All for one and one for all|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1009414/sindhi-culture-day-all-for-one-and-one-for-all/|accessdate=7 December 2016|agency=[[The Express Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edward Jenner Medal''' is awarded occasionally by the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] to individuals who have undertaken distinguished work in epidemiological research.

The award was founded in 1896 by the Epidemiological Society of London (1850–1907) to commemorate the centenary of Edward Jenner’s discovery of a means of smallpox vaccination. The Epidemiological Society became a founder member of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] in 1907.

The medal was designed in Bronze by [[Allan Wyon]]. It features Jenner’s face on one aspect and the symbol of the Epidemiological Society, the Earth, on the reverse. The medal was re-cast following the evolution of the Society into the Section of Epidemiology at the RSM in 1907.  Photographs of the medal may be found in ''The History of the Royal Society of Medicine''  published in 2001.

It was first awarded to Sir [[William Henry Power]] who was the then Medical Officer for London and had formulated the theory of aerial conveyance of smallpox and chaired the Royal Commission on [[Tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsm.ac.uk/academ/downloads/ep-public-history.pdf History of the section of Epidemiology &amp; Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
The '''Federation of Arab Emirates of the South''' ({{lang-ar|اتحاد إمارات الجنوب العربي}} ''Ittiḥād ʾImārāt al-Janūb al-ʿArabiyy'') was an organization of [[State (polity)|states]] within the [[British Empire|British]] [[Aden Protectorate]] in what would become [[South Yemen]].  The Federation of six states was inaugurated in the British [[Colony of Aden]] on 11 February 1959, and the Federation and Britain signed a “Treaty of Friendship and Protection,” which detailed plans for British financial and military assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cco.dodlive.mil/files/2012/09/case_study_10_teacher_edition.pdf|first=Scott|last=Smitson|title=The Road to Good Intentions: British Nation-building in Aden|work=Center for Complex Operations Case Study No. 10|pages=9|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It subsequently added nine states and, on 4 April 1962, became known as the [[Federation of South Arabia]].  This was joined by the [[Colony of Aden|Aden Colony]] on 18 January 1963.

[[File:GipsyCoverFirstVolumeFR.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Cover of ''Gipsy - L'étoile du Gitan'', the first volume of the French edition.]]
'''Gipsy''' (in some translations spelled as "''Gypsy''") is a French science fiction [[comic]] series drawn by Italian-Swiss artist [[Enrico Marini]] and written by [[Thierry Smolderen]]. The eponymous main character is a charismatic [[Romani people|Roma]] truck driver who works on a worldwide net of motorways as a [[freelance]] trader with his own large truck.

The series is drawn in a style that combines elements from the [[ligne claire]] school, American comics, and Japanese [[manga]], and was first published in 1992 by [[Dargaud]]. It has six volumes so far published as of 2010. It has also been translated from the original French to German, Dutch, Danish and English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zilverendolfijn.nl/zd/zd.pl?a=fc&amp;c=1&amp;kt=NL&amp;s=m&amp;k=GIPSY&amp;f=ss |title=Gipsy |accessdate=2007-02-22 |author=Zilveren Dolfijn |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rights have been sold in multiple other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groupe-dargaud.com/FRC/Detail.FRCatalogue.Series.cfm?Query_ID=1691 Gipsy] (database entry from the English website of [[Dargaud]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==

The series is set in a near future (roughly several decades into the 21st century) where [[ozone layer]] damage has forced all air travel to be abandoned (except for some airships), while the world is now spanned by an interconnected mega-[[motorway]] system called C3C. At the same time, [[global cooling]] has intensified, and large areas of the globe are covered in snow, inhospitable and difficult to cross, but also allowing land connections via the northern arctic.

This stylistic tool allows the series to imagine a [[globalized]] future world where it still takes weeks to travel from one point to another, and where private truckers and [[megacorporation]]s compete (and sometimes fight) over lucrative freight. It also allows the series individual books to be set pretty much anywhere in the world, often travelling through remote and dangerous areas. The comics have so far been set in the [[arctic]] from Alaska to Siberia, in Mongolia, fictional [[Middle East]]ern and [[Latin America]]n countries as well as in [[Germany]].

==Characters==

;Tsagoi
:Called 'the Gipsy' for his Roma heritage, Tsagoi is an impulsive, charming and normally very carefree person, with his personality and athletic physique ensuring that he does not lack for romantic attractions. While generally a simple man with simple interests (his sister Oblivia, his truck, his women - in that order), he can also be quite intelligent and resourceful. His personal past and Roma roots can make him deeply melancholic at times, which usually ends up with him singing sad Roma songs or playing the violin. A good fighter, he is especially handy with throwing knives.

;Oblivia
:The little sister of Tsagoi, being maybe ten years younger, she spent much of her early life together with her brother in slum orphanage in Eastern Europe, before her brother fled to become a truck driver. However, Tsagoi was both very protective and successful, and soon started sending her money and eventually had her transferred to a Swiss boarding school, though without ever managing to see her again. Reunited as a teenager with Tsagoi a decade later &amp;mdash; after Gipsy's money to pay for her school runs out through misfortune &amp;mdash; she states that she cannot remember anything of her youth, and is shocked by her brother's rough behaviour and the often violent encounters on their travels. Only later on does she start warming up to him and rediscover her own Roma heritage. Moving to [[Los Angeles]], she becomes a writer, describing her early life and exposing the activities of a major occultist-criminal organisation, the "White Wing", which serves as a loose thread tying the stories in the series together.

==English translations==

[[Heavy Metal Magazine|''Heavy Metal'' Magazine]] introduced the series to the English speaking audience in 1995. In some countries one of the stories has been censored by ripping out a page of thousands of copies of the November 1997 issue. The magazine offered readers replacement for a small fee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heavymetalmagazinefanpage.com/about.html Miscellaneous Facts at Heavy Metal Magazine Fan Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nantier Beall Minoustchine Publishing]] (NBM) published the first two stories of the graphic novel series in paperback album format:
*''The Gipsy Star'' (64 pages, {{ISBN|978-1-56163-268-8}}, 2000-September)
*''Gipsy: The Fires of Siberia'' (64 pages, {{ISBN|978-1-56163-326-5}}, 2002-July)

==Movie==

At one stage in 2000, the comic was set to become the base for a major live-action movie produced by [[Barry Levine]], with [[Demian Lichtenstein]] (of ''[[3000 Miles to Graceland]]'') to direct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics2film.com/Gipsy.shtml Reported by Comics2Film] (from Comics2film.com, 15 November 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this project apparently fell through in the early stages.

{{Internet}}
'''Internet slang''' ('''Internet shorthand''', '''cyber-slang''', '''netspeak''', or '''chatspeak''') refers to various kinds of [[slang]] used by different people on the [[Internet]]. An example of Internet slang is "&lt;code&gt;[[:wikt:LOL#English|LOL]]&lt;/code&gt;" meaning "laugh out loud". It is difficult to provide a standardized definition of Internet slang due to the constant changes made to its nature.&lt;ref name=Yin&gt;Yin Yan (2006) World Wide Web and the Formation of the Chinese and English "Internet Slang Union". Computer-Assisted Foreign Language Education. Vol. 1. {{ISSN|1001-5795}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be understood to be any type of [[slang]] that [[Internet]] users have popularized, and in many cases, have coined. Such terms often originate with the purpose of saving [[keystroke]]s or to compensate for small character limits. Many people use the same [[abbreviation]]s in [[text messaging|texting]] and [[instant messaging]], and [[social networking websites]]. [[Acronym]]s, [[Computer keyboard|keyboard symbols]] and [[abbreviation]]s are common types of Internet slang. New dialects of slang, such as [[leet]] or [[Lolcat|Lolspeak]], develop as [[ingroup]] [[internet meme]]s rather than time savers. Some people only use LOL for fun. Many people use this [[internet slang]] not only on the Internet but also face-to-face.

==Creation and evolution==

===Origins===
Internet slang originated in the early days of the Internet with some terms predating the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daw |first=David |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/248526/web_jargon_origins_revealed.html |title=Web Jargon Origins Revealed |publisher=Pcworld.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet slang is used in [[chat room]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[online game]]s, [[video game]]s and in the [[online community]]. Since 1979, users of communications networks like [[Usenet]] created their own [[shorthand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meggyn |url=http://theunderenlightened.com/trolling-for-slang-the-origins-of-internet-werdz/ |title=Trolling For Slang: The Origins of Internet Werdz |publisher=Theunderenlightened.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pop culture==
In Japanese, the term [[moe (slang)|moe]] has come into common use among slang users to mean something extremely cute and appealing.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Aside from the more frequent abbreviations, acronyms, and [[emoticon]]s, Internet slang also uses archaic words or the lesser-known meanings of mainstream terms.&lt;ref name= Yin /&gt; Regular words can also be altered into something with a similar pronunciation but altogether different meaning, or attributed new meanings altogether.&lt;ref name= Yin /&gt; Phonetic transcriptions of foreign words, such as the transformation of "impossible" into "&lt;code&gt;impossibru&lt;/code&gt;" in Japanese and then [the [[transliteration]] of that] back to [the character set used for] English, also occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In places where [[logograph]]ic languages are used, such as China, a visual Internet slang exists, giving characters dual meanings, one direct and one implied.&lt;ref name= Yin /&gt;

===Motivations===
The primary motivation for using a slang unique to the Internet is to ease [[communication]]. However, while Internet slang shortcuts save time for the writer, they take two times as long for the reader to understand, according to a study by the [[University of Tasmania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't be 404, know the tech slang|date=December 10, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7775013.stm|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, similar to the use of slang in traditional face-to-face speech or written language, slang on the Internet is often a way of indicating [[social group|group membership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=1997|title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language|edition= Second |location=Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet slang provides a channel which facilitates and constrains our ability to communicate in ways that are fundamentally different from those found in other semiotic situations. Many of the expectations and practices which we associate with spoken and written language are no longer applicable. The Internet itself is ideal for new slang to emerge because of the richness of the medium and the availability of information.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt; Slang is also thus motivated for the “creation and sustenance of online communities”.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt; These communities, in turn, play a role in solidarity or identification&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt;&lt;ref name= miao /&gt; or an exclusive or common cause.&lt;ref name=mud /&gt;

David Crystal distinguishes among five areas of the Internet where slang is used- [[World Wide Web|The Web itself]], [[email]], [[asynchronous communication|asynchronous chat]] (for example, [[mailing list]]s), [[synchronous communication|synchronous chat]] (for example, [[Internet Relay Chat]]), and [[virtual world]]s.&lt;ref name=Davidcrystal&gt;{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=2001|title= Language and the Internet|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-80212-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[computer|electronic]] character of the channel has a fundamental influence on the language of the medium. Options for communication are constrained by the nature of the hardware needed in order to gain Internet access. Thus, productive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be sent) is determined by the preassigned characters on a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], and receptive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be seen) is determined by the size and configuration of the screen. Additionally, both sender and receiver are constrained linguistically by the properties of the internet [[software]], [[computer hardware]], and [[networking hardware]] linking them. Electronic discourse refers to writing that is "very often reads as if it were being spoken – that is, as if the sender were writing talking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Davis, B.H. &amp; Brewer, J. P. |date=1997 |title=Electronic discourse: linguistic individuals in virtual space|location= Albany, NY|publisher= State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of slang==

Internet slang does not constitute a homogeneous language variety. Rather, it differs according to the user and type of Internet situation.&lt;ref name=hohenhaus&gt;Hohenhaus, Peter (2005). Elements of traditional and "reverse" purism in relation to computer-mediated communication. In Langer, Nils and Winifred V. Davies (eds.), Linguistic Purism in the Germanic Languages. Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 203-220.&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the language of Internet slang, there is still an element of [[linguistic prescriptivism|prescriptivism]], as seen in [[style guides]], for example ''Wired Style'',&lt;ref name=hale&gt;[Hale, C. and Scanlon, J (1999). Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age. New York: Broadway Books]&lt;/ref&gt; which are specifically aimed at usage on the Internet. Even so, few users consciously heed these prescriptive recommendations on CMC, but rather adapt their styles based on what they encounter online.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Naomi. (2000). ''Alphabet to Email.'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is difficult to produce a clear definition of Internet slang, the following types of slang may be observed. This list is not exhaustive.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class !! Description
|-
| Letter homophones || Included within this group are [[abbreviation]]s and [[acronym]]s. An abbreviation is a shortening of a word, for example "&lt;code&gt;CU&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;CYA&lt;/code&gt;" for "see you (see ya)". An acronym, on the other hand, is a subset of abbreviations and are formed from the initial components of a word. Examples of common acronyms include "&lt;code&gt;LOL&lt;/code&gt;" for "laugh out loud", "&lt;code&gt;BTW&lt;/code&gt;" for "by the way" and "&lt;code&gt;TFW&lt;/code&gt;" for "that feeling when". There are also combinations of both, like "&lt;code&gt;CUL8R&lt;/code&gt;" for "see you later".
|-
| Punctuation, capitalizations, and other symbols || Such features are commonly used for emphasis. Periods or exclamation marks may be used repeatedly for emphasis, such as "&lt;code&gt;........&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/code&gt;". Question marks and exclamation marks are often used together in strings such as "&lt;code&gt;?!?!?!?!&lt;/code&gt;" when one is angry while asking a question. Grammatical punctuation rules are also relaxed on the Internet. "E-mail" may simply be expressed as "&lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;", and apostrophes can be dropped so that "John's book" becomes "&lt;code&gt;johns book&lt;/code&gt;". Examples of capitalizations include "&lt;code&gt;STOP IT&lt;/code&gt;", which can convey a stronger emotion of annoyance as opposed to "stop it". Bold, underline and italics are also used to indicate stress.
|-
| Onomatopoeic and/or stylized spellings || [[Onomatopoeia|Onomatopoeic]] spellings have also become popularized on the Internet. One well-known example is "&lt;code&gt;hahaha&lt;/code&gt;" to indicate laughter. Onomatopoeic spellings are very language specific. For instance, in Spanish, laughter is spelled as "&lt;code&gt;jajaja&lt;/code&gt;" instead because J is pronounced like H in Spanish. In Thai it's 55555 because 5 in Thai is said Ha. In Korean, it is "&lt;code&gt;kekeke&lt;/code&gt;".
|-
| Keyboard-generated emoticons and smileys || [[Emoticon]]s are generally found in web forums, instant messengers, and online games. They are culture-specific and certain emoticons are only found in some languages but not in others. For example, the Japanese equivalent of emoticons, kaomoji (literally "face marks"), focus on the eyes instead of the mouth as in Western emoticons. They are also meant to be read right-side up, as in &lt;code&gt;^_^&lt;/code&gt; as opposed to sideways, &lt;code&gt;:3&lt;/code&gt;. More recently than face emoticons, other emoticon symbols such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;3&lt;/code&gt; (which is a sideways heart) have emerged. Compared to emoticons used in Western cultures such as the [[United States]], kaomoji play a very distinct social role in online discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Katsuno, Hirofumi and Christine R. Yano (2002), ''[[Asian Studies Review]]'' 26(2): 205-231&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Direct requests || These are found in chat engines such as [[Internet Relay Chat]] or online games, where personal identities may be concealed. As such, questions such as "&lt;code&gt;A/S/L?&lt;/code&gt;" which stands for "age, sex, location?" are commonly posed.&lt;ref name=Thurlow&gt;Thurlow, C. (2001), Language and the Internet, In R, Mesthrie &amp; R, Asher (Eds), The concise encyclopedia of sociolinguistics, London: Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Leet || [[Leet]]speak, or &lt;code&gt;1337&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1337 - what is it and how to be 1337|url=http://www.1337.net/|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative alphabet for the English language which uses various combinations of ASCII characters to replace Latinate letters. For example, Wikipedia may be expressed as "&lt;code&gt;\/\/1|&lt;1p3[)14&lt;/code&gt;". It originated from computer hacking, but its use has been extended to online gaming as well. Leet is far less common now than in the first decades of the internet.
|-
| Novel [[syntax|syntactic]] features || Unusual syntactic structures such as "[[I Can Has Cheezburger?]]" and "You are doing me a frighten" have been encouraged and spread by highly successful memes. Pluralization of "the internets" is another example, which has become common since it was used by [[George W. Bush]] during a televised event.
|-
| [[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] || Flaming refers to the use of rude or profane language in interactions between Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, N.S. (2003). Language of the Internet. In A. Farghali (Ed.), The Stanford handbook for language engineers (pp. 59—127). Stanford, California: CSLI&lt;/ref&gt; It can be caused by any subject of polarizing nature. For example, there is an ongoing debate among users of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[classic Mac OS]]/[[macOS]] as to which is "superior". Historically, the act of flaming has been described as an intrinsic quality of [[email]]s due to an absence of visual and auditory cues in [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC).&lt;ref&gt;Lea, Martin, Tim O’Shea, Pat Fung, and Russel Spears (1992), ‘Flaming’ in Computer-Mediated Communication. Contexts of Computer-Mediated Communication, ed. Martin Lea, 89-112. New York: Harvester Wheatsheaf.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| [[Padonkaffsky jargon]] || Olbanian language is a [[Russian language|Russian]] [[Cant (language)|cant]] language developed by [[padonki]] of [[Runet]]. The language entered mainstream culture and it has been suggested that Olbanian should be taught in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usrbc.org/resources/russiannews/event/1192 |title=Reuters |publisher=Usrbc.org |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems exist for other languages with non-Roman scripts such as Hebrew and Arabic.

==Views on Internet slang==

There have been ongoing debates about how the use of slang on the Internet influences language usage outside of technology. Even though the direct causal relationship between the Internet and language has yet to be proven by any scientific research,&lt;ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/internets-effect-on-language-debated |title=Internet’s Effect on Language Debated |publisher=Newjerseynewsroom.com |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422130830/http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/science-updates/internets-effect-on-language-debated |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet slang has invited split views on its influence on the standard of language use in non-computer-mediated communications.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptivists]] tend to have the widespread belief that the Internet has a negative influence on the future of language, and that it would lead to a degradation of standard.&lt;ref name=Davidcrystal /&gt; Some would even attribute any decline of standard formal English to the increase in usage of electronic communication.&lt;ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com  /&gt; It has also been suggested that the linguistic differences between Standard English and CMC can have implications for literacy education.&lt;ref&gt;Hawisher, Gale E. and Cynthia L. Selfe (eds). (2002). Global Literacies and the World-Wide Web. London/New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; This is illustrated by the widely reported example of a school essay submitted by a Scottish teenager, which contained many abbreviations and acronyms likened to [[SMS language]]. There was great condemnation of this style by the mass media as well as educationists, who expressed that this showed diminishing literacy or linguistic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2814235.stm |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; UK &amp;#124; Is txt mightier than the word? |publisher=Newsvote.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Linguistic description|descriptivists]] have counter-argued that the Internet allows better expressions of a language.&lt;ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com  /&gt; Rather than established linguistic conventions, linguistic choices sometimes reflect personal taste.&lt;ref name=baron&gt;Baron, Naomi S. (2002). Who sets email style: Prescriptivism, coping strategies, and democratizing communication access. The Information Society 18, 403-413&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that as opposed to intentionally flouting language conventions, Internet slang is a result of a lack of motivation to monitor speech online.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Naomi (2003) “Why Email Looks Like Speech: Proofreading Pedagogy and Public Face.” In New Media Language, ed. Jean Aitchison and Diana M. Lewis, 85–94. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Hale and Scanlon describe language in Emails as being derived from "writing the way people talk", and that there is no need to insist on 'Standard' English.&lt;ref name=hale /&gt; English users, in particular, have an extensive tradition of etiquette guides, instead of traditional prescriptive treatises, that offer pointers on linguistic appropriateness.&lt;ref name=baron /&gt; Using and spreading Internet slang also adds onto the cultural currency of a language.&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt; It is important to the speakers of the language due to the foundation it provides for identifying within a group, and also for defining a person’s individual linguistic and communicative competence.&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt; The result is a specialized subculture based on its use of slang.&lt;ref name="annemarie"&gt;Simon-Vandenbergen, Anne Marie (2008) Deciphering L33t5p34k: Internet Slang on Message Boards. Thesis paper. Ghent University Faculty of Arts and Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

In scholarly research, attention has, for example, been drawn to the effect of the use of Internet slang in [[ethnography]], and more importantly to how conversational relationships online change structurally because slang is used.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;Garcia, Angela Cora, Standlee, Alecea I., Beckhoff, Jennifer and Yan Cui. Ethnographic Approaches to the Internet and Computer-Mediated Communication. Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. Vol. 38 No. 1 pp 52–84&lt;/ref&gt;

In German, there is already considerable controversy regarding the use of [[anglicisms]] outside of CMC.&lt;ref&gt;Hohenhaus, Peter. (2002). Standardization, language change, resistance and the question of linguistic threat: 18th-century English and present-day German. In: Linn, Andrew R. and Nicola McLelland (eds.). Standardization - Studies from the Germanic languages. Amsterdam: Benjamins (= Current Issues in Linguistic Theory volume 235), 153-178&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is even more problematic within CMC, since the [[jargon]] of the medium is dominated by English terms.&lt;ref name=hohenhaus /&gt; An extreme example of an anti-anglicisms perspective can be observed from the chatroom rules of a Christian site,&lt;ref&gt;[https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/cilt/main] {{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which bans all anglicisms ("Das Verwenden von Anglizismen ist strengstens untersagt!" [Using anglicisms is strictly prohibited!]), and also translates even fundamental terms into German equivalents.&lt;ref name=hohenhaus /&gt;

===Journalism===
In April 2014, [[Gawker]]'s [[editor-in-chief]] Max Read instituted new writing style guidelines banning internet slang for his writing staff.&lt;ref name="Gawker bans 'Internet slang'"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Andrew|last1=Beaujon|url=http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/246113/gawker-bans-internet-slang/|title=Gawker bans ‘Internet slang’|work=[[Poynter Institute]]|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128120629/http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/246113/gawker-bans-internet-slang/|archivedate=28 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawker Rips Buzzfeed in Ban on ‘WTF,’ ‘Epic’ and Other Internet Slang From Its Website"&gt;{{cite news|first1=James |last1=Crugnale |url=http://www.thewrap.com/gawker-rips-buzzfeed-ban-internet-slang/|title=Gawker Rips Buzzfeed in Ban on ‘WTF,’ ‘Epic’ and Other Internet Slang From Its Website|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="‘Massive’ Attack: Gawker Goes After Whopping Word"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Matthew |last1=Kassel |url=http://observer.com/2014/04/massive-attack-gawker-goes-after-whopping-word/|title=‘Massive’ Attack: Gawker Goes After Whopping Word|work=[[The New York Observer]]|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawker Editor Bans 'Internet Slang,' Challenges Staff to 'Sound Like Regular Human Beings'"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Alex |last1=Weaver |url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2014/04/03/gawker-editor-bans-internet-slang/|title=Gawker Editor Bans 'Internet Slang,' Challenges Staff to 'Sound Like Regular Human Beings'|work=[[BostInno]]|date=3 April 2014|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A ban on internet slang?

==Use beyond computer-mediated communication==
Internet [[slang]] has crossed from being mediated by the computer into other non-physical domains.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Crystal, David (September 20, 2001). Language and the Internet. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80212-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, these domains are taken to refer to any domain of interaction where interlocutors need not be geographically proximate to one another, and where the Internet is not primarily used. Internet slang is now prevalent in telephony, mainly through short messages ([[SMS]]) communication. [[Abbreviation]]s and [[interjection]]s, especially, have been popularized in this medium, perhaps due to the limited character space for writing messages on mobile phones. Another possible reason for this spread is the convenience of transferring the existing mappings between expression and meaning into a similar space of interaction.&lt;ref name=new.bbc.co.uk&gt;"Don't be 404, know the tech slang". BBC. December 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Internet slang has also taken a place as part of everyday [[offline]] language, among those with digital access.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The nature and content of [[online]] conversation is brought forward to direct [[offline]] [[communication]] through the [[telephone]] and direct talking, as well as through [[Orthography|written language]], such as in writing notes or letters. In the case of interjections, such as numerically based and abbreviated Internet slang, are not pronounced as they are written physically or replaced by any actual action. Rather, they become [[Lexicalisation|lexicalized]] and spoken like non-slang words in a “stage direction” like fashion, where the actual action is not carried out but substituted with a verbal signal. The notions of flaming and [[troll (Internet)|trolling]] have also extended outside the computer, and are used in the same circumstances of deliberate or unintentional implicatures.&lt;ref name=bas /&gt;

The expansion of Internet slang has been furthered through codification and the promotion of digital literacy. The subsequently existing and growing popularity of such references among those online as well as offline has thus advanced Internet slang [[Digital literacy|literacy]] and globalized it.&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, Barry (2004) The glocal village: Internet and community. Arts and Science Review. University of Toronto. Issue 1, Series 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness and proficiency in manipulating Internet slang in both online and offline communication indicates digital literacy and teaching materials have even been developed to further this knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Singhal |first= M. |title=The Internet and foreign language education: Benefits and challenges |publisher=The Internet TESL Journal |year=1997 |url=http://iteslj.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A South Korean publisher, for example, has published a textbook that details the meaning and context of use for common Internet slang instances and is targeted at young children who will soon be using the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ashcroft, Brian (2010) Hey Korean Kids, Let’s Learn Leetspeak And Internet Slang. Published February 11th, 2010. Retrieved from [http://kotaku.com/5469239/hey-korean-kids-lets-learn-leetspeak-and-internet-slang]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Internet slang has been recommended as language teaching material in second language classrooms in order to raise communicative competence by imparting some of the cultural value attached to a language that is available only in slang.&lt;ref&gt;Quintana, M. (2004) Integration of Effective Internet Resources for Future Teachers of Bilingual Ed. National Association of African American Studies, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, well-known dictionaries such as the [[Oxford Dictionary of English|OED]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/category/word-trends-and-new-words/ |title=Oxford Dictionary official blog |publisher=Blog.oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Merriam-Webster]] have been updated with a significant and growing body of slang jargon. Besides common examples, lesser known slang and slang with a non-English etymology have also found a place in standardized linguistic references. Along with these instances, literature in user-contributed dictionaries such as [[Urban Dictionary]] has also been added to. Codification seems to be qualified through frequency of use, and novel creations are often not accepted by other users of slang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Brian |url=http://www.noslang.com/rejects/ |title=Rejects |publisher=Noslang.com |accessdate= 28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet slang today===
Although Internet slang began as a means of "opposition" to mainstream language, its popularity with today's globalized digitally literate population has shifted it into a part of everyday language, where it also leaves a profound impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Unbulleted list | {{cite web |last= Eller |first= Lara L. |year= 2005 |work= Thesis |title= Instant Message Communication and its Impact upon Written Language |publisher= [[West Virginia University]] |url=  http://www.wvu.edu/ }}
{{cite web |title= Alternate source  |website= WVU Scholar |url= http://wvuscholar.wvu.edu/ |subscription= yes }}
 | {{cite web |title= Alternate source  |website= University of Hong Kong |url= http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/3632984 |subscription= yes }} | {{cite web |format= pdf |title= Alternate source |website= Research Gate |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267419817_Instant_Message_Communication_and_its_Impact_upon_Written_Language }} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently used slang also have become conventionalised into memetic "unit[s] of cultural information".&lt;ref name=bas&gt;{{cite web |last=Flamand |first=E |year=2008 |title=The impossible task of dialog analysis in chatboxes |url=http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:D28k7Tswv5wJ:scholar.google.com/+internet+slang+meme&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These memes in turn are further spread through their use on the Internet, prominently through websites. The Internet as an "information superhighway" is also catalysed through slang.&lt;ref name="annemarie"/&gt; The evolution of slang has also created a 'slang union'&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt; as part of a unique, specialised subculture.&lt;ref name=annemarie /&gt; Such impacts are, however, limited and requires further discussion especially from the non-English world. This is because Internet slang is prevalent in languages more actively used on the [[Internet]], like [[English language|English]], which is the [[Internet]]’s [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20332763|title=Learn English online: How the internet is changing language}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/lingua-franca.html|title=English - the universal language on the Internet?|quote=English essentially is the universal language of the Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==
[[File:Grass Mud Horse Seal.svg|thumb|Chinese seal carving work. The character is a combination of three characters, which is done by Chinese [[netizen]]. This is a satire of [[Chinese Internet censorship]]. See [[Grass Mud Horse]].]]

The Internet has helped people from all over the world to become connected to one another, enabling "global" relationships to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wellman (2004). "The Glocal Village: Internet and Community." ''Ideas&amp;s'' Vol 1:1&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is important for the various types of slang used online to be recognizable for everyone. It is also important to do so because of how other languages are quickly catching up with English on the Internet, following the increase in Internet usage in predominantly non-English speaking countries. In fact, as of May 31, 2011, only approximately 27% of the online population is made up of English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm |title=Internet World Stats |publisher=Internet World Stats |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different cultures tend to have different motivations behind their choice of slang, on top of the difference in language used. For example, in [[Chinese Internet Slang|China]], because of the tough Internet regulations imposed, users tend to use certain slang to talk about issues deemed as sensitive to the government. These include using symbols to separate the characters of a word to avoid detection from manual or automated text pattern scanning and consequential [[censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhou Shuguang (2008). "Notes On The Net." ''Index on Censorship'' Vol 37:2&lt;/ref&gt; An outstanding example is the use of the term [[river crab (Internet slang)|&lt;code&gt;river crab&lt;/code&gt;]] to denote censorship. River crab (hexie) is pronounced the same as "harmony"—the official term used to justify political discipline and censorship. As such Chinese netizens reappropriate the official terms in a sarcastic way.&lt;ref&gt;Nordin, Astrid and Richaud, Lisa (2014), "Subverting official language and discourse in China? Type river rrab for harmony," ''China Information'' 28, 1 (March): 47–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abbreviations]] are popular across different cultures, including countries like [[Japan]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], etc., and are used according to the particular language the Internet users speak. Significantly, this same style of slang creation is also found in non-alphabetical languages&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt; as, for example, a form of "&lt;code&gt;e gao&lt;/code&gt;" or alternative political discourse.&lt;ref name=mud&gt;Meng Bingchun (2011) "From Steamed Bun to Grass Mud Horse: E Gao as alternative political discourse on the Chinese Internet." ''Global Media and Communication'' April 2011 vol. 7 no. 1 33–51&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in language often results in miscommunication, as seen in an [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] example, "&lt;code&gt;555&lt;/code&gt;", which sounds like "crying" in Chinese, and "laughing" in Thai.&lt;ref name=lovelovechina.com&gt;{{cite web |author=Crystal Tao |date=6 May 2010 |url=http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |title=Why Thai Laugh When Chinese Cry? |publisher=Lovelovechina.com |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420091421/http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example is between the English "&lt;code&gt;haha&lt;/code&gt;" and the Spanish "&lt;code&gt;jaja&lt;/code&gt;", where both are onomatopoeic expressions of laughter, but the difference in language also meant a different consonant for the same sound to be produced. For more examples of how other languages express "laughing out loud", see also: [[LOL]]

In terms of culture, in Chinese, the numerically based onomatopoeia "&lt;code&gt;770880&lt;/code&gt;" ({{Zh|c = |s = 亲亲你抱抱你|t = 親親你抱抱你|p = qīn qīn nǐ bào bào nǐ}}), which means to 'kiss and hug you', is used.&lt;ref name=lovelovechina.com /&gt; This is comparable to "&lt;code&gt;XOXO&lt;/code&gt;", which many Internet users use. In French, "&lt;code&gt;pkoi&lt;/code&gt;" is used in the place of pourquoi, which means 'why'. This is an example of a combination of onomatopoeia and shortening of the original word for convenience when writing online.

In conclusion, every different country has their own language background and cultural differences and hence, they tend to have their own rules and motivations for their own Internet slang. However, at present, there is still a lack of studies done by researchers on some differences between the countries.

On the whole, the popular use of Internet slang has resulted in a unique online and offline community as well as a couple sub-categories of "special internet slang which is different from other slang spread on the whole internet… similar to jargon … usually decided by the sharing community".&lt;ref name=miao&gt;Wei Miao Miao (2010) "Internet slang used by online Japanese anime fans." ''3PM Journal of Digital Researching and Publishing''. Session 2 2010 pp 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; It has also led to virtual communities marked by the specific slang they use&lt;ref name=miao /&gt; and led to a more homogenized yet diverse online culture.&lt;ref name=Yin /&gt;&lt;ref name=miao /&gt;

'''Kholmogory bone carving''' ({{lang-ru|Холмогорская резная кость}}) is a traditional handicraft practised in the villages of [[Kholmogorsky District]], [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]], in the north of Russia.

The craft of [[bone carving]] was developed in the town of [[Kholmogory]] in the 17th century. It has been first mentioned in connection with the fact that two Kholmogory carvers, brothers Yevdokim and Semyon Sheshenin, were invited to work in the [[Kremlin Armoury]], which performed orders for the tsar’s court. The handicraft reached its peak in the 18th century, under the reign of [[Peter the Great]]. [[Walrus ivory]], seal bones, and in rare cases even elephant and mammoth ivory were used. In the 18th century, carved boxes, bracelets, portraits, and other objects were very popular.

The famous 18th-century Russian sculptor, [[Fedot Shubin]], started his career at Kholmogory as a walrus ivory carver. In the second half of the 18th century, the most notable carvers in Kholmogory were [[Osip Dudin]] and [[Nikolay Vereshchagin]].

In the second half of the 19th century, the handicraft declined, and by the 1880s only several carvers were left. The local authorities made an attempt to save the handicraft, and in 1885 in the village of Lomonosovo, close to Kholmogory, a master class in bone carving opened. The class had to be closed in 1900 due to the lack of interest. The next attempt to revive the handicraft was made in 1934, when the Central Executive Committee of USSR adopted a special decree on measures to develop Kholmogory bone carving. In 1937, the carving objects got acclaim at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 World Fair]] in Paris. Whereas in 1930s and 1950s the main purpose of the handicraft was to serve the Soviet propaganda, and the objects were therefore carved in the [[Stalin Empire style]], from 1960s on the carvers rediscovered the techniques and motives of the 18th century carvers, and the modern Kholmogory bone carving became more individual.

Currently the carving is being performed at the Lomonosov Bone Carving Factory.&lt;ref name="GSE1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Холмогорская резная кость|url=http://bse.sci-lib.com/article119501.html|publisher=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In utero deaths==
Children of women who were pregnant during the pandemic ran the risk of lifelong effects. One in three of the more than 25 million who contracted the flu in the United States was a woman of childbearing age. A study of US census data from 1960 to 1980 found that the children born to this group of women had more physical ailments and a lower lifetime income than those born a few months earlier or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2014}}

When a person (traditionally the wife in many cultures) assumes the [[family name]] of his or her [[spouse]], that name replaces the person's birth [[surname]], which in the case of the wife is called the '''maiden name''' (birth name is also used as a gender-neutral or masculine substitute for maiden name), whereas a '''married name''' is a family name or surname adopted by a person upon marriage.

In some jurisdictions, [[Name change|changing one's name]] requires a legal procedure. Nevertheless, in some jurisdictions anyone who either marries or divorces may change his or her name. Due to increasing security and identification needs, even where it is legal, the common law method{{clarify|date=September 2018}} is now rarely accepted except at marriage (especially for women){{fact|date=September 2018}}. Traditionally, in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] [[Western world|West]] only women change their names on marriage, but in some instances men may change their last names upon marriage as well, including [[same-sex marriage|same-sex married couples]].&lt;ref name=taking&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-20-names-marriage_N.htm|title=More men taking wives' last names|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|date=20 March 2007|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, only eight states have an official name change for a man as part of their marriage process, and in others a man may petition a court or—where not prohibited—use the common law method (though government agencies sometimes do not recognize this procedure for men). Due to the widespread practice of women changing their names at marriage, they encounter little difficulty using the common law method at marriage in those jurisdictions that permit it.&lt;ref name="taking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="name change"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eznamechange.com/california-name-change-after-marriage|title=Archived copy|accessdate=6 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812154713/http://eznamechange.com/california-name-change-after-marriage/|archivedate=12 August 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the remainder of this article, birth name, family name, surname, married name and maiden name refer to [[patrilineal surname]]s unless explicitly described as referring to [[matrilineal surname]]s.

==Canada==
{{Main|Canadian name}}
In most of Canada, either partner may informally assume the spouse's surname after marriage, so long as it is not for the purposes of fraud. The same is true for people in [[Common-law marriage|common-law relationships]], in some provinces. This is not considered a legal name change in most provinces, excluding British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/legal-changes-of-name/legal-change-of-name-application#after_marriage|title=Legal Change of Name Application - Province of British Columbia|last=|first=|date=|website=www2.gov.bc.ca|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128121222/http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/legal-changes-of-name/legal-change-of-name-application#after_marriage|archive-date=2016-01-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For federal purposes, such as a Canadian [[passport]], Canadians may also assume their partner's surname if they are in a common-law relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppt.gc.ca/info/section1.aspx?lang=eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331150305/http://www.ppt.gc.ca/info/section1.aspx?lang=eng |archivedate=31 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the province of British Columbia, people have to undergo a legal name change if they want to use a combined surname after marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vs.gov.bc.ca/marriage/|title=Birth, Adoption, Death, Marriage &amp; Divorce - Province of British Columbia|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vs.gov.bc.ca|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010430005245/http://www.vs.gov.bc.ca/marriage/|archive-date=2001-04-30|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage certificate is considered proof of their new name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/individuals/119599.html ontario.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sin/apply/proof.shtml servicecanada.gc.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom in Québec was similar to the one [[Married and maiden names#France|in France]] until 1981. Women would traditionally go by their husband's surname in daily life, but their maiden name remained their legal name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1880/08/10/106232934.pdf Gleanings from the mails; Maiden names.

Retrieved 1 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the passage of a 1981 provincial law intended to promote gender equality, as outlined in the [[Québec Charter of Rights]], no change may be made to a person's name without the authorization of the registrar of civil status or the authorization of the court. Newlyweds who wish to change their names upon marriage must therefore go through the same procedure as those changing their names for other reasons. The registrar of civil status may authorize a name change if:

1) the name the person generally uses does not correspond to the name on their birth certificate,

2) the name is of foreign origin or too difficult to pronounce or write in its original form, or 

3) the name invites ridicule or has become infamous.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/ccq/20080314/whole.html Civil Code of Québec] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109002437/http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/ccq/20080314/whole.html|date=9 January 2009}}, 14 March 2008. Retrieved 3 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

This law does not make it legal for a woman to change her name immediately upon marriage, as marriage is not listed among the reasons for a name change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969 Québec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|date=2 January 2016}}, by Marianne White, ''CanWest News Service'', 8 August 2007.

This process is expedited for newly married persons in that their [[marriage certificate]], in combination with [[identity document|identification]] using their married name, is usually accepted as evidence of the change, due to the widespread custom, but the process still requires approaching every contact who uses the old name and asking them to use the new. Unless the statutes where the marriage occurred specify that a name change may occur at marriage (in which case the marriage certificate indicates the new name), the courts have officially recognized that such a change is a result of the [[common law]] right of a person (man, woman, and sometimes child) to change their name. However, men encounter more difficulties in changing their last names.&lt;ref name=lawsuit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070112/ap_on_re_us/take_my_wife_s_name|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114123109/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070112/ap_on_re_us/take_my_wife_s_name |title=Man files lawsuit to take wife's name|archivedate=2007-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were some early cases in the USA which held that under [[common law]], a woman was required to take her husband's name,&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, Una (1977).

The court ruled in her favor. This set forth many things. By common law, one may lawfully change their name and be "known and recognized" by that new name. Also, one may enter into any kinds of contracts in their new adopted name. Contracts include employment (see ''[[Coppage v. Kansas]]'' 236 U.S. 1), and one can be recognized legally in court in their new name. In 1967 in ''Erie Exchange v. Lane'', 246 Md. 55 (1967) the Maryland Court of Appeals held that a married woman can lawfully adopt an assumed name, even if it is not her birth name or the name of her lawful husband, without legal proceedings.&lt;ref name="justia1976"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://law.justia.com/cases/maryland/court-of-special-appeals/1976/511-september-term-1975-0.html | title=Hall v.

===Common options===
; Use husband's family name
In the past, a woman in England would assume her new husband's family name (or surname) after marriage; usually she was compelled to do so under [[coverture]] laws. This remains common practice today in the United Kingdom  and in other [[common law]] and Anglophone countries and countries. Examples are Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Gibraltar, Falkland Islands, Ireland, India, Philippines, the English-speaking provinces of Canada and the United States. In some communities in India, spouses and children take the father's first name or proper name{{clarify|date=September 2018}}. Often there are interesting variations of name adoption, including family name adoption. In Massachusetts, for instance, a [[Claudia Goldin|Harvard study]] in 2004 found that about 87% of college-educated women take their husbands' name on marriage, down from a peak before 1975 of over 90%, but up from about 80% in 1990. The same study found women with a college degree were "two to four times (depending on age) more likely to retain their surname" than those without a college degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/files/making_a_name_womens_surnames_at_marriage_and_beyond.pdf Making a Name: Women's Surnames at Marriage and Beyond] by Claudia Goldin and Maria Shim, Journal of Economic Perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lowlands of Scotland in the 16th century, married women did not change their surnames, but today it is the norm to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krossa|first=Sharon L.|url=http://medievalscotland.org/scotnames/lowland16/|title=Early 16th Century Scottish Lowland Names|publisher=Medievalscotland.org|date=|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, the children of these marriages are given their father's surname. Some families (mainly in the USA) have a custom of using the mother's maiden name as a [[middle name]] for one of the children—[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] received his middle name in this way&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Burns|last=Burns|first=James MacGregor|title='Roosevelt' (vol. 1)|year=1956|publisher=Easton Press|isbn=978-0-15-678870-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even as a first name. [[Spessard Holland]], a former Governor of [[Florida]] and former Senator, whose mother's maiden name was Virginia Spessard, received his first name in this way.
; Retain the birth name

Women who keep their own surname after marriage may do so for a number of reasons:

* Objection to the perceived inequality of this tradition.&lt;ref name=made&gt;[[Dale Spender|Spender, Dale]]. ''Man-Made Language'' (1980), pp 24-25 of 1985 2nd Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Being the last member of their family with that surname.
* To avoid the hassle of paperwork related to their change of name.
* Wishing to retain their identity
* Preferring their last name to their spouse's last name
* Fear of professional ramifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Gabrielle|title=Keeping Your Name After Marriage: 27 Women Talk About Why They Didn't Take Their Husband's Surnames|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/76483-keeping-your-name-after-marriage-27-women-talk-about-why-they-didnt-take-their-husbands-surnames|website=Bustle|accessdate=29 August 2015|ref=BustleMoss2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American suffragist and abolitionist [[Lucy Stone]] (1818–1893) made a national issue of a married woman's right to keep her own surname (as she herself did upon marriage) as part of her efforts for women's rights in the U.S. Women who choose not to use their husbands' surnames have been called "Lucy Stoners".&lt;ref name = Roiphe2004&gt;{{cite web|work=Slate|date=24 March 2004|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2004/03/the_maiden_name_debate.html|last=Roiphe|first=Katie|authorlink=Katie Roiphe|title=The Maiden Name Debate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials would not allow her to vote unless she added "Blackwell", her husband's last name, to her signature. This she refused to do, and so she was not able to vote. She did not challenge the action in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Andrea Moore. ''Lucy Stone: Speaking Out for Equality.'' pp. 203-03. New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-8135-1860-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lucy Stone League]], named after her, was founded in 1921 by [[Ruth Hale (feminist)|Ruth Hale]]; it was the first group to fight for women to be allowed to keep their maiden name after marriage&amp;mdash;and to use it legally.&lt;ref name=Ch15&gt;Stannard, Una (1977).

In ''People ex rel. Rago v. Lipsky'', 63 N.E.2d 642 (Ill. 1945), the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District did not allow a married woman to stay registered to vote under her birth name, due to "the long-established custom, policy and rule of the common law among English-speaking peoples whereby a woman's name is changed by marriage and her husband's surname becomes as a matter of law her surname."&lt;ref name="courtlistener1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1921365/stuart-v-board-of-elections/ |title=Stuart v.

In 1950, [[Jane Grant]] and 22 former members restarted the Lucy Stone League; its first meeting was on 22 Mar 1950 in New York City. Grant promptly won the [[Census Bureau]]'s agreement that a married woman could use her birth surname as her official or real name in the census.

In ''State ex rel. Krupa v. Green'', 177 N.E.2d 616 (Ohio 1961), the Ohio appellate court allowed a married woman to register to vote in her birth name which she had openly and solely used, and been well-known to use, before her marriage, and held that she could use that name as a candidate for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/59149575add7b049345cf336 |title=DAVIS v.

In 1972 in ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 266 Md. 440, 446, on the question of whether a wife could register to vote in her birth name rather than her husband's last name, the Maryland Court of Appeals held, "[A] married woman's surname does not become that of her husband where, as here, she evidences a clear intent to consistently and nonfraudulently use her birth given name subsequent to her marriage."&lt;ref name="justia1976"/&gt;

In the 1970s the Olympia Brown League was founded to help women's name rights in Milwaukee, in response to a court decision against women seeking to keep their maiden names upon marriage; [[Olympia Brown]] had kept hers upon her marriage in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;http://ilj.law.indiana.edu/articles/85/85_3_Kim.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the case with that court decision was ''Kruzel v. Podell'' (1975), in which the Supreme Court of Wisconsin decided that a woman upon marriage adopts the last name of her husband by customarily using that name after marriage, but also stated that no law required her to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1833004/davis-v-roos/ |title=Davis v.

In 1975 in ''Dunn v. Palermo'', the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that "in this jurisdiction a woman, upon marriage, has a freedom of choice. She may elect to retain her own surname or she may adopt the surname of her husband. The choice is hers. We hold that a person's legal name is that given at birth, or as ''voluntarily'' changed by either spouse at the time of marriage, or as changed by affirmative acts as provided under the Constitution and laws of the State of Tennessee. So long as a person's name remains constant and consistent, and unless and until changed in the prescribed manner, and absent any fraudulent or legally impermissible intent, the State has no legitimate concern."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://casetext.com/case/dunn-v-palermo?resultsNav=false | title=Dunn v.

The American laws and cases noted above do not include all the relevant American laws and cases regarding maiden names. Currently, American women do not have to change their names by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Name Rights|last=Gorence|first=Patricia|date=1976|website=scholarship.law|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2239&amp;context=mulr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Join both names (hyphenation)
{{main|Double-barrelled name}}
It is less common for women, especially in the USA and Canada, to add their spouse's name and their own birth name.&lt;ref name=taking /&gt; About 7% of American women [[hyphenate]] their name with their spouse's name upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYT Upshot Maiden Names|url=https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/view?survey=tpjh7dfv56ff2&amp;question=2|website=Google Consumer Surveys|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=29 August 2015|ref=NYTsurvey2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Name blending
Although less common than name joining, a growing trend is the [[Name blending|blending of two surnames]] upon marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Barnett, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/9664227/Couples-fuse-surnames-in-new-trend-I-now-pronounce-you-Mr-and-Mrs-Puffin.html Couples fuse surnames in new trend: ‘I now pronounce you Mr and Mrs Puffin’]", ''The Telegraph'' (9 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; This means adding ''parts'' of the two names. An example is [[Dawn O'Porter]].
; Birth name as middle name
Examples are [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/world/hillary-drops-her-maiden-name/2007/04/30/1177788007743.html Hillary Drops Her Maiden Name], ''The [[Brisbane Times]]'', 30 April 2007. Retrieved 31 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kim Kardashian West]].

===Children===
In the United States, some states or areas have laws that restrict what surname a child may have. For example, [[Tennessee]] allows a child to be given a surname that does not include that of the father only upon "the concurrent submission of a sworn application to that effect signed by both parents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.tn.us/tccy/tnchild/68/68-3-305.htm Tennessee State Code.

===Legal status of name changes at marriage===
In 2007, Michael Buday and Diana Bijon enlisted the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and filed a discrimination lawsuit against the state of [[California]]. According to the ACLU, the obstacles facing a husband who wishes to adopt his wife's last name violated the equal protection clause provided by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=277893 ABC News: ABC News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423155150/http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=277893 |date=23 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the lawsuit, only the states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Hawaii]], [[Iowa]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[North Dakota]] explicitly allowed a man to change his name through marriage with the same ease as a woman. As a result of the lawsuit, the Name Equality Act of 2007 was passed to allow either spouse to change their name, using their marriage license as the means of the change; the law took effect in 2009.&lt;ref name=lawsuit /&gt;&lt;ref name=NameEqualityAct&gt;{{cite web|title=The Name Equality  Act of 2007|url=https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/CDPH%20Document%20Library/CHSI-The-Name-Equality-Actof2007-4-2017.pdf|website=California Department of Public Health|accessdate=15 December 2017|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism and preserving one's personal name===

(Also see "Retain the birth name" above.)&lt;br /&gt;
 
The feminist [[Lucy Stone]] (1818–1893) made a national issue of a married woman's right to keep her own surname (as she herself did upon marriage) as part of her efforts for women's rights in the U.S. Because of her, women who choose not to use their husbands' surnames have been called "Lucy Stoners".&lt;ref name = Roiphe2004&gt;{{cite web|work=Slate|date=24 March 2004|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2004/03/the_maiden_name_debate.html|last=Roiphe|first=Katie|authorlink=Katie Roiphe|title=The Maiden Name Debate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The feminist [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] took her husband's surname as part of her own, signing herself Elizabeth Cady Stanton or E. Cady Stanton, but she refused to be addressed as Mrs. Henry B. Stanton. She wrote in 1847 that "the custom of calling women Mrs. John This and Mrs. Tom That and colored men [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]] and Zip [[List of ethnic slurs|Coon]], is founded on the principle that white men are lords of all."&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Elisabeth.

He is Cuffy Douglas or Cuffy Brooks, just whose Cuffy he may chance to be. The woman has no name. She is Mrs. Richard Roe or Mrs. John Doe, just whose Mrs. she may chance to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/wb/index.htm |title=The Woman's Bible Index |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/1860-elizabeth-cady-stanton-slaves-appeal |title=(1860) Elizabeth Cady Stanton, "A Slave's Appeal" &amp;#124; The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |publisher=The Black Past |date= |accessdate=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The feminist [[Jane Grant]], co-founder of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', wrote in 1943 of her efforts to keep her name despite her marriage, as well as other women's experiences with their maiden names regarding [[military]] service, passports, [[voting]], and [[Outline of business|business]]. 

More recently, the feminist [[Jill Filipovic]]'s opposition to name change for women who marry was published in ''The Guardian'' in 2013 as “Why should married women change their names? Let men change theirs”, and cited as recommended reading on the [[social construction of gender]] in ''Critical Encounters in Secondary English: Teaching Literacy Theory to Adolescents'' by Deborah Appleman (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/07/women-stop-changing-your-name-when-married |title=Why should married women change their names?

==France==
Since the 1789 Revolution, the law stipulates that "no one may use another name than that given on his birth certificate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/F77.xhtml |title=Une femme mariée est-elle obligée de remplacer son nom de jeune fille par le nom de son mari à la suite de son mariage ? - Service-public.fr |publisher=Vosdroits.service-public.fr |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121053723/http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/F77.xhtml |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 4 March 2002 to 4 December 2009, children given both parents' names had to have them separated by a double dash (ex: Dupont&lt;nowiki&gt;--&lt;/nowiki&gt;Clairemont). On 4 December 2009, the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]] ruled that a space can be used instead of the double dash. As a result, forms asking for the family name (''nom de famille'') do so on two lines ("''1ère partie'': ..... ", "''2e partie'': ....")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consulfrance-toronto.org/spip.php?article1731 |title=Déclaration de choix de nom - Consulat général de France à Toronto |publisher=Consulfrance-toronto.org |date= |accessdate=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
In [[Germany]], since 1977, a woman may adopt her husband's surname or a man may adopt his wife's surname. One of them may use a name combined from both surnames. The remaining single name is the "family name" (''Ehename''), which will be the surname of the children. If a man and woman both decide to keep and use their birth names after the wedding (no combined name), they have to declare one of those names the "family name". A combined name is not possible as a family name, but, since 2005, it has been possible to have a double name as a family name if one already had a double name, and the partner adopts that name. Double names then must be hyphenated.

In [[Austria]], since 1 April 2013, marriage does not automatically change a woman's name; therefore a name change can only take place upon legal application. Before that date, the default was for a married woman's name to be changed to that of her husband, unless she legally applied to opt out of this.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/embassy/london/practical-advice/consular-services/change-of-name.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
Since 2014, women in [[Turkey]] are allowed to keep their birth names alone for their whole life instead of using their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Married Women in Turkey may use their maiden name without husband's surname hereinafter|url=http://www.turkeylawconsulting.com/corporate-individuals-law/married-women-in-turkey-may-use-their-maiden-name-without-husbands-surname-hereinafter/|work=Birthname usage in Turkey|accessdate=24 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160327064700/http://www.turkeylawconsulting.com/corporate-individuals-law/married-women-in-turkey-may-use-their-maiden-name-without-husbands-surname-hereinafter/|archivedate=27 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the Turkish Code of Civil Law, Article 187, required a married woman to use her husband's surname; or else to use her birth name in front of her husband's name by giving a written application to the marriage officer or the civil registry office. In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that prohibiting married women from retaining only maiden names is a violation of their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/prohibiting-married-women-from-retaining-only-maiden-names-a-violation-top-court-60734|title=Prohibiting married women from retaining only maiden names a violation: Top court|last=|first=|date=8 January 2014|website=Hürriyet Daily News|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iran==
In the [[Judicial system of Iran]], until 1976, it was the man who had the right to choose the surname of his family, including his wife. However, since then, all people are allowed to choose their family names, and there has been no more imposition on behalf of the husband regarding his wife's change in surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Adopting the Spouse's Surname After Marriage in Iranian and American Legal Systems|issue=62|pages=77–94|url=http://familylawandjurisprudence.isuw.ac.ir/article_14401.html|date=2015-05-22|journal=فقه و حقوق خانواده (ندای صادق)|volume=20|access-date=2018-10-07|last1=فراهانی|first1=سید جواد|last2=میرشکاری|first2=عباس}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://familylawandjurisprudence.isuw.ac.ir/article_14401_c87ab577e6506dd5c8ec4f0c439ec4ed.pdf Adopting the Spouse's Surname After Marriage in Iranian and American Legal Systems] by Abbas Mirshekari and Javad Farahani, Biannual Journal of Family Law and Jurisprudence. (''article in Persian'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
Spouses keep their original surnames. According to the Italian Civil Code (article 143 bis), a woman who marries keeps her surname and has the option of adding her husband's surname after hers. Non-Italian citizens getting married in Italy will not have their surname changed in Italy. However, brides or grooms can request their surname change in their home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Name change by effect of a marriage in Italy|url=http://www.weddingintuscany.info/blog/2013/03/name-change-afterwedding-in-italy/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130413010149/http://www.weddingintuscany.info/blog/2013/03/name-change-afterwedding-in-italy/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 April 2013|work=wedding in Italy|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Netherlands==
In the [[Netherlands]], persons who have been married in the Netherlands or entered into a registered partnership will remain registered under their birth name. They are, however, permitted to use their partner's last name for social purposes or join both names. Upon marriage or registered partnership, one may also indicate how one would like to be addressed by registering one's choice at the Municipal Basis Administration (''Gemeentelijke Basis Administratie'') (although the birth name does not change). One may choose to be called by one's own name, one's partner's name, one's own name followed by one's partner's name (hyphenated), or one's partner's name followed by their own name (hyphenated). Both men and women may make this choice upon registering to get married or entering into a registered partnership. If the marriage or registered partnership ends, one may continue to use the ex-partner's last surname unless the ex-partner disagrees and requests the court to forbid the use of the ex-partner's surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/naamrecht/vraag-en-antwoord/wanneer-mag-ik-de-achternaam-van-mijn-partner-gebruiken.html |title=Wanneer mag ik de achternaam van mijn partner gebruiken? |publisher=Rijksoverheid.nl |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while name changes due to marriages performed in the Netherlands cannot be processed, it is certainly possible in the Netherlands to process name changes due to marriages performed outside the Netherlands, provided certain conditions are met: the marriage must be registered abroad, the application for name change abroad must be requested on the same date as the marriage date, the changed name must be recorded abroad on a certificate in accordance with the local rules of the foreign country, and the marriage and name change as well as proof of application as of the date of the marriage must be legalized/[[apostille convention|apostilled]] and provided to the Dutch consulate or Dutch municipality upon return to the Netherlands.

The reason is that international marriages are not necessarily governed by Dutch Law but by Private International Law which is codified in the Netherlands in the "Commoner's Law Book" (''Burgerlijke Wetboek'') Book No. 10, Private International Law, Title 2 - The Name, Article 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0030068/2015-12-05|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Burgerlijk Wetboek Boek 10 - BWBR0030068|website=wetten.overheid.nl|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the birth or adoption of a first child, married parents may choose the child's surname (mother's or father's but not both). If no choice is made, the child automatically bears the father's surname. Any further children will also go by this name. If the parents are not married, the children will automatically have their mother's name unless otherwise indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/publicaties-pb51/de-keuze-van-de-achternaam.html |title=De keuze van de achternaam |publisher=Rijksoverheid.nl |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511084410/https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/publicaties-pb51/de-keuze-van-de-achternaam.html |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
There is a widespread, though not universal, custom for a newly married wife to adopt the husband's family name. However, as Russia is not a common law country, any name change requires a formal procedure including an official application to the [[Civil registry|civil acts registrar]]. As the same registrar also records marriages, for the convenience sake it is often done during the marriage proceedings, as governed by the Federal Law #143-FZ "On Civil State Acts", and the couple's marriage certificate has an option of having one common family name, or both spouses going by their original surname. However, the law is entirely gender neutral, and the couple may adopt either of their surnames (a husband adopting his wife's family name is an uncommon but by no means unheard-of practice, which is generally accepted and carries little to no social stigma), or even a completely different one. The law also recognizes the couple's right to use the combined family name, and for the either of the spouses to reclaim their original surname in the case the marriage is dissolved.

==Spanish-speaking world==
Spouses keep their original surnames. Following [[Spanish naming customs]], a person's name consists of a [[given name]] (simple or composite) followed by two family names (surnames), the father's and the mother's (except in Argentina, where only the rich use this as symbol of status). Any children a couple have together take both first-surnames, so if "José Gómez Hevia" and "María Reyes García" had a child named "Andrés", the resulting name would be "Andrés Gómez Reyes". In [[Spain]], a 1995 reform in the law allows the parents to choose whether the father's or the mother's surname goes first, although this order must be the same for all their children. For instance, the name of the son of the couple in the example above could be settled whether "Andrés Gómez Reyes" or "Andrés Reyes Gómez".&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.juridicas.com/index.php?doc=http%3A//noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Privado/lrc.html ''Art. 55 Ley de Registro Civil'' - Civil Register Law] (article in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Spanish-American countries it is customary for women to unofficially add the husband's first surname after her own, for social purposes such as invitation letters or event announcements. The couple above may introduce themselves as José Gómez Hevia and María Reyes de Gómez.

==Philippines==
{{Main article|Filipino name#Maiden and married names}}
The Civil Code of the Philippines has options for a married woman on the surname to take upon marriage. A married woman can:
* keep her middle name (maternal surname) and add her husband's surname to the maiden name (e.g. ''Maria Isabella Flores Garcia-Dimaculangan''/''Ma. Isabella F. Garcia-Dimaculangan'')
* take the husband's surname and make her maiden name the middle name (''Maria Isabella Garcia Dimaculangan''/''Ma. Isabella G. Dimaculangan'') 
* take the husband's full name, but prefixed to indicate that she is his wife (e.g. ''Mrs.''/''Ms. Dimaculangan'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Civil Code of the Philippines|type=Republic Act|number=386|article=XIII: Use of Surnames|articletype=Title|date=June 18, 1949|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1949/06/18/republic-act-no-386/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman may have an option to keep her maiden name after marriage, as no Philippine law requires a woman to take her husband's surname at marriage.

The Civil Code also states that children as the result of the marriage will take the mother's middle name (maiden surname) and the father's surname. To illustrate this, the children of a married couple named ''Maria Josefa Lopez Mañego-Luansing'' and ''Juan Candido Luansing'' will take the middle name ''Mañego'' and the surname ''Luansing'', so, one daughter with a given name of ''Juliana'' will be named ''Juliana Mañego Luansing''.

Married women in professional circles (e.g. [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], [[Korina Sanchez-Roxas]], [[Vilma Santos-Recto]]) typically join their maiden and married surnames in both professional and legal use (e.g. ''Maria Isabella Flores Garcia-Dimaculangan''/''Ma. Isabella F. Garcia-Dimaculangan''). This allows them to be identified as married, and keep track of their professional achievements without having their names mean another person (e.g. ''Maria Isabella Flores Garcia''/''Ma. Isabella F. Garcia, as against ''Maria Isabella Garcia Dimaculangan''/''Ma. Isabella G. Dimaculangan)

An older scheme based on [[Spanish naming customs]] add the particle ''de'' between the maiden and married surnames (e.g. ''Maria Isabella Garcia de Dimaculangan'' or ''Ma. Isabella G. de Dimaculangan''), but the tradition is no longer common.

==Taiwan==
Taiwanese women generally keep their surnames after marriage while their children may inherit either the father's or the mother's. It is, however, legal to take the spouse’s surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws &amp; Regulations Database and The Republic of China|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=D0030011|website=law.moj.gov.tw|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some older women have the husband's surname added to theirs, as was common in the early to mid-[[20th century]].

==Thailand==
A Thai wife who adopted her husband's surname due to the old law requiring it, can also change back to her original surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaigeneralkonsulat.de/th/consular/namensfuehrung.html |script-title=th:การใช้ชื่อสกุลตามพระราชบัญญัติชื่อบุคคล (ฉบับที่ 3) พ.ศ. 2548 |author=Royal Thai Consulate-General, [[Frankfurt]] am Main |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=10 August 2011 |language=th |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126011248/http://www.thaigeneralkonsulat.de/th/consular/namensfuehrung.html |archivedate=26 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
[[Japan]]ese law does not recognize married couples who have different surnames as lawful husband and wife, which means that 96% of married Japanese women take their husband's surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koffler|first1=Jacob|title=Here Are Places Women Can’t Take Their Husband’s Name When They Get Married|url=http://time.com/3940094/maiden-married-names-countries/|website=Time|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=29 August 2015|ref=TimeMaritalLaws2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[Japanese Supreme Court]] upheld the name-change law, ruling that it was not unconstitutional, noting that women could use informally their maiden names, and stating that it was the parliamentarians who should decide on whether to pass new legislation on separate spousal names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35109455|title=Japanese women lose surname law case|last=|first=|date=16 December 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
Traditionally, a married woman keeps her name unchanged, without adopting her husband's surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tatlow|first1=Didi|title=For Chinese Women, a Surname Is Her Name|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/world/asia/china-women-surnames.html|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child would inherit his/her father's surname. This is still the norm in [[mainland China]], though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent's surname. It is also common for two children born to the same parents to take different surnames, one after the father and the other after the mother. It is also possible, though far less common, for a child to combine both parents' surnames.&lt;ref&gt;People's Daily. "Chinese surname shortage sparks rethink". 19 May 2007. Accessed 16 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Western influence, some areas of [[greater China]], such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have also adopted the tradition of women changing their last name, or prepending their husband’s to her own.

==Korea==
Traditionally, Korean women keep their family names after their marriage, but their children take the father's surname. In the premodern, patriarchal Korean society, people were extremely conscious of familial values and their own family identities. Korean women keep their surnames after marriage based on traditional reasoning that it is what they inherited from their parents and ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caprio|first=Mark E.|date=2017-02-10|title=Rationalizing Korea: The Rise of the Modern State, 1895–1945 by Kyung Moon Hwang (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/648344|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|language=en|volume=47|issue=4|pages=576–578|issn=1530-9169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genealogy==
Genealogists often also make note of all surnames used by a person during his or her lifetime (such as those acquired from birth parents, those assigned at birth when the father is unknown or not acknowledged, those acquired at marriage, and those acquired at a remarriage). For example, an illegitimate male child abandoned at birth in Italy or in other European countries will receive no surname from either of his birth parents but, instead, will be assigned a surname—often invented from one of the three kingdoms of nature, e.g., mineral ("Pietra"), vegetable ("Rosa") or animal ("Leoni"), or otherwise according to custom within a locality, such as "Esposito" (meaning "abandoned") or "Casa Grande" (referring to the "Domo Magna," e.g., the ''ospizio'' [hospital] where abandoned).&lt;ref&gt;See David I. Kertzer, ''Sacrificed for Honor: Italian Infant Abandonment and the Politics of Reproductive Control'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1993), at pp. 55-56, 113-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mandailing''' is a traditional cultural group in [[Southeast Asia]]. They are found mainly in the northern section of the island of [[Sumatra]] in [[Indonesia]]. They came under the influence of the [[Padri War|Kaum Padri]] who ruled the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of [[Tanah Datar]]. As a result, the Mandailing were influenced by Muslim culture and converted to Islam. There are also a group of Mandailing in [[Malaysia]], especially in the states of [[Selangor]] and [[Perak]]. They are closely related to the [[Angkola people|Angkola]].

== Etymology ==
The [[etymology]] of 'Mandailing' is said to be a coupounding of the words ''mande'', meaning 'mother', and ''hilang'', meaning 'lost'. Thus, the name is said to mean "lost mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edi Nasution|title=Tulila: muzik bujukan Mandailing|year=2007|publisher=Areca Books|isbn=98-342-8344-X|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mandailing society is patriarchal, employing family names, or ''[[Marga (Batak)|marga]]''. The well known [[Marga (Batak)|margas]] in Mandailing clan are: Lubis, Nasution, Siregar, Hasibuan, Harahap, Dalimunthe (originally from Munthe), Matondang, Rangkuti, Parinduri, Pulungan, Rambe, Daulae(y), Pohan, Batubara (not to be confused with the Batu Bara people from the east coast of Sumatra), Barus and Hutajulu.

== History ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het vlechten van matten en het stampen van rijst in Pakantan TMnr 10014535.jpg|thumb|Plating mats and pounding rice in Pakantan.]]
According to Tamboen's account (1952) the Mandailing, along with other sub-ethnic [[Batak]] groups are the descendants of one man by the name of [[Batak]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Masri Singarimbun|title=Kinship, Descent, and Alliance Among the Karo Batak|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-02692-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; who migrated to the south before the coming of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] colonisation of Sumatra. Dutch colonization in Sumatra caused the Mandailing to be typecast as a sub-category of the Batak, as a 'wedge policy' to classify the communities and create typologies. It instilled the division of the Islamic nations by a non-Muslim belt, called 'Bataklanden' (Bataklands).&lt;ref name=lubis&gt;Abdur-Razzaq Lubis. ''Mandailing-Batak-Malay: A People Defined and Divided''. In: 'From Palermo to Penang: A Journey into Political Anthropology', University of Fribourg, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mandailing were associated with the [[Toba Batak people]] instead of being recognized as a distinct ethnic minority. Consequently, the Mandailing people have been torn between two cultural and ethnic identities, namely Batak-Mandailing in [[Indonesia]] and Malay-Mandailing in [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name=lubis /&gt;

=== The Padri War ===
The [[Padri War]], which took place in [[West Sumatra]] and spread to the inland parts of [[East Sumatra]] between 1803 and 1845, caused an exodus of large groups of Mandailing from their homeland to [[Peninsular Malaysia|peninsular Malaya]]. Among them were groups led by [[Raja Asal]], the overlord of the Mandailings, and his nephew [[Raja Bilah]]. Together with [[Sutan Puasa]], they were embroiled in the [[Klang War]] from 1866 to 1873, also known as the Selangor War.&lt;ref name=mandailings&gt;Abdul-Razzaq Lubis and Khoo Salma Nasution. ''Raja Bilah and the Mandailings in Perak: 1875–1911''. Kuala Lumpur: Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (MBRAS), 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raja Asal and Raja Bilah fled to [[Perak]], where their followers settled in Lower Perk and the Kinta Valley. The British appointed Raja Bilah ''[[penghulu]]'' of Blanja while his son Raja Yacob became ''[[penghulu]]'' of [[Teronoh|Tronoh]], which generated large revenues after the opening of the Tronoh Mines, the largest tin producer in the world in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=mandailings /&gt;

== Region ==
Mandailing is the name of region Luat Mandailing, which is now almost in [[Mandailing Natal Regency]] in [[North Sumatra]]. The first group who came to this region were the Lubis and Nasution, later followed by the Siregar, Harahap and so forth. Nasution and Lubis are the biggest groups in Mandailing clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sangkhakala.kemdikbud.go.id/index.php/SBA/article/download/140/102 |title=The Remains Of Megalithic Tradition On Material Culture Of Mandailing People |author=Nenggih Susilowati|publisher=Balai Arkeologi Sumatera Utara, Berkala Arkeologi Sangkhakala, Vol. XV No. 1 |page=119 |date=2012 |accessdate=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other groups, such as Pulungan, Harahap, Matondang, Rangkuti, and others are the smaller groups of Luat Mandailing. Harahap and Siregar dwell almost in Luat Angkola, which now belongs to [[South Tapanuli Regency]], situated between Regency and North Tapanuli Regency.

== The Great Mandailing ==

The Mandailing people are also known as the great travellers as more and more of the Mandailings are migrating to the various regions in the country as well as around the world. Many of the Mandailings are playing the important roles of the nation. The Indonesian government considered the Mandailings as one of the main tribes in the country. Many Mandailings keep detailed family tree records as it has become the family tradition. It is reported that 98% of the Mandailing ethnic group are Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{id}}{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately more than one hundred thousand Mandailings In Malaysia nowadays. Many of the Mandailings in Malaysia are visiting their ancestors in Mandailing Regency in Indonesia as it has been a tradition to keep the brotherhood and strong bond of unity among the Mandailings.

The Mandailings are very rich in language where they have good or smooth sounds. Therefore, the Mandailings are well known as the smooth people.

The Mandailing classic of daun ubi tumbuk or mashed tapioca leaves, lush with bunga kantan, lemongrass and coconut milk flavour is the most famous food among the Mandailings.

They have a traditional ensemble of drums called [[music of Sumatra|Gordang Sambilan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Taiwan journal of Southeast Asian Studies, Volume 2, Issue 2|year=2005|publisher=國立曁南國際大學東南亞硏究中心|isbn=|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Clark &amp; Juliet Pietsch|title=Indonesia-Malaysia Relations: Cultural Heritage, Politics and Labour Migration|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=13-178-0888-6|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pa-O women selling vegetables, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|rt|260px|Pa'O women selling vegetables in an open-air market]]
The '''Pa'O''' ('''Pa-O''', '''Paoh''') ({{lang-my|ပအိုဝ်းလူမျိုး}}, {{IPA-my|pəo̰ lùmjóʊ|IPA}}, or {{my|paohတောင်သူ}}; {{Lang-shn|ပဢူဝ်း}}) is the seventh largest ethnic nationality in [[Republic of the Union of Myanmar|Burma]] with a population of approximately 2,000,000&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.stimson.org/programs/myanmar-map/#Pa-O |title= Interactive Myanmar map |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;2,600,000&lt;ref name=pno-23&gt;{{cite book | title= Pyidaungzu De-Ga Pa-Oh: Union of Pa-Oh (&lt;small&gt;{{my|ပြည်ထောင်စု ထဲက ပအိုဝ့်}}&lt;/small&gt; | page=23 | author=Pa-Oh National Organization | year=2010 | publisher=Pa-Oh National Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Pa'O settled in the [[Thaton]] region of present-day Myanmar around 1000 B.C.  Historically, the Pa'O wore colorful clothing until [[Anawratha|King Anawratha]] defeated the [[Mon people|Mon]] King, Makuta of Thaton. The Pa'O were enslaved and forced to wear indigo-dyed clothing to signify their  status.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==People==
The Pa'O people are the second largest ethnic group in the state of [[Shan State|Shan]]. They also reside in [[Kayin State]], [[Kayah State]], [[Mon State]], and the [[Bago Division]]. They are believed to be of [[Tibeto-Burman]] lineage, and share the language and culture of the [[Karen people]].  They compose two distinct groups: The Lowland Pa'O, based in [[Thaton]], and The Highland Pa'O, based in [[Taunggyi]]. It is believed that there are as many as twenty-four Pa'O subgroups.&lt;ref name=pno-23/&gt;
The Pa'O subgroups are Htee Ree, Jamzam,Jauk Pa'O,  Khrai,  Khunlon, Khonlontanyar, Kon jam, Loi Ai, Padaung, Pahtom, Pa nae, Pan Nanm, Nan kay, Mickon, Miclan,Ta Kyor, Taret, Tahtwe, Tatauk, Taungthar, Tayam, Ta Noe, Warphrarei and Yin Tai .

Many of the modern day Pa'O have fled to [[Mae Hong Son Province]], in northern [[Thailand]], due to ongoing military conflicts in Myanmar.

==Agriculture==
The Pa'O predominantly cultivate the leaves of the [[Cordia dichotoma|thanapet tree]], onions, garlic, chili, potatoes, rice, peanuts, beans, sesame seeds, [[mustard plant|mustard leaves]], and green tea.

==Culture==
===Fire Rocket Festival===
The ''Pwe Lu-Phaing'' (Fire Rocket Festival), is celebrated from April to July. The purpose of the festival is to bring ample rain to the villages during the planting season. According to Pa'O tradition, rockets are fired to help the clouds make rain. The village headman determines the size of the rockets. The largest rockets can contain up to 20 kilograms of gunpowder and have a range of 5–6 miles. The rockets, originally made from bamboo, are currently made from iron. Prior to firing, the rocket is carried once around the local temple on someone's shoulder. The festival also demonstrates the unity and friendship among different villages as they gather together for one week. "Pwe" means festival, "Lue" means donation and "Phaing" means to remove sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWfUVLsk954| title= Ni Lu Phaing (A song about the Fire Rocket Festival)| accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Day===
Pa'O National Day, or ''Den See Lar Bway'', is celebrated on the ''Tabaung'' (full-moon day), that falls in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=971&amp;page=1 | title=Pa-O: The Forgotten People| author=Nandar Chann|date=May 2004| work=The Irrawaddy| accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Day is a day to remember ancestors and past leaders, such as [[King Suriya Janthar]], whose birthday is also celebrated on National Day. There is a grand parade through Taunggyi followed by a festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCdvfh18Q1g| title= News report about Pa-Oh National Day| accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
The majority of Pa'O people follow [[Buddhism]], which means that most of their festivals are based on Buddhist festival days. Some Pa'O are [[Christian]], and some maintain [[Animism|Animist]] beliefs. ''Poy Sang Long'' (&lt;small&gt;{{my| Burmese :ရှင်ပြုပွဲ/Pa-O:ပွယ်ႏသျှင်ႏလောင်ꩻ}}&lt;/small&gt;) celebrates the initiation of young boys as novice monks. On reaching adulthood, being ordained a monk is considered a family celebration. During Buddhist Lent, from August to October, Pa'O youth participate in the ''Pwe Lip May Bo'' (&lt;small&gt;Pa-O :ပွယ်ႏလိပ့်ꩻမေႏဗို/Burmese:မီးကြာလှည့်ပွဲ&lt;/small&gt;) ceremony. On the monthly full-moon nights, new-moon nights, and both half-moon nights, they surround their local temple with lanterns suspended on strings raised by supporting bamboo stands. The bamboo stands are used to carry the lanterns around the temple three times, the candles being lit as they are carried, as a show of respect to [[Buddha]].

===Origin story===
The Pa'O origin story states that they are derived from a shaman([[Weakjar(shaman)|Weakjar]]), and a female dragon.

===Dress===
[[File:Pa-O village 07.jpg|thumb|rt|250px|Pa'O woman harvesting chilies]]
The Pa'O people of upper Myanmar commonly wear black or navy blue. The traditional outfit of the Pa'O consists of a turban, a white shirt, black or navy jacket and long black trousers for men. The women's traditional Pa'O outfit consists of five pieces: a blouse, a jacket, a longyi that covers the knees, a turban, and two large, conical shaped hair pins. Both men and women pin a Pa'O flag badge on to their jacket. It represents the Zawgyi and dragon from their origin story. Men use a large red sling bag to carry knives, hoes or long choppers. Women use a cane or bamboo sling basket. Those from lower Myanmar wear Burmese style clothing.

===Marriages===
To initiate a marriage, first the young man's parents ask the young woman's parents for the hand of their daughter in marriage on behalf or their son. Her parents can take four or five days to discuss their daughter's wishes. According to custom, guests at the marriage ceremony tie cotton threads around the wrists of both the bridegroom and bride, joining them together while blessing the couple with their best wishes. Common presents include money, farmland, houses, buffaloes, male cows and household items.

===Funerals===
Villagers take care of funeral arrangements. The body is kept for a couple of nights at home. Food is cooked to offer to the monks and people play card games as a way of giving constant companionship to the departed. After two or three days, the family give praise to the person who died. Common people are buried, while monks are cremated.

===Literature===
Khun Sein Win, pen-name Kanbawza Maung Phone Yee, was born on 31 August 1948 in the village of North Inya in the southern Shan State of Myanmar. Since graduating from Mandalay Arts and Science University with a B.A., he has received many awards and prizes for his novels and feature magazine articles.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book | title= &lt;small&gt;{{my|ကိုလိုနီခေတ် မြန်မာ့သမိုင်း}}&lt;/small&gt; (Myanmar History of Colony Era)| pages= 22| author= Bhamo Tin Aung| date= October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His most famous book, ''I Want to Say'', about Pa'O history, was published in 1985. He has written articles for the ''Myawaddy'', ''Shu Ma Wa'', ''Ngwe Tayi'', ''Myat Mingala'' and ''Doh Kyaungtha'' magazines. Since 1993 he has chaired the Literature and Magazine Association in Taunggyi. He has worked as an editor for the Shan State Peaceful and Development Council monthly magazine, ''Kanbawza New Bulletin'', and he has been a member of the Shan State Women Committee. He lives in Taunggyi, where he continues to study and write literature. He is also a renowned speaker.

===Music===
Khun Thar Doon (1940&amp;ndash;1978) was one of the early recording stars of Pa'O music. He set up the first Pa'O modern band in the early 1970s. One of his famous songs is "Tee Ree Ree", a song about Pa'O solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhHSEC2DcRs| title=Tee Ree Ree Cover Version| accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This song is still sung at traditional festivals today.

{{History of Burma}}

The '''Kingdom of Pagan''' ({{lang-my|ပုဂံခေတ်}}, {{IPA-my|bəɡàɴ kʰɪʔ|pron}}, lit. "'''Pagan Period'''"; also commonly known as the '''Pagan Dynasty''' and the '''Pagan Empire''') was the first kingdom to unify the regions that would later constitute modern-day [[Burma]] (Myanmar). Pagan's 250-year rule over the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy valley]] and its periphery laid the foundation for the ascent of [[Burmese language]] and [[Burmese culture|culture]], the spread of [[Bamar people|Burman ethnicity]] in [[Upper Burma]], and the growth of [[Theravada Buddhism]] in Burma and in [[mainland Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=vbl-88-123&gt;Lieberman 2003: 88–123&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdom grew out of a small 9th-century settlement at [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan) by the [[Bamar|Mranma]] (Burmans), who had recently entered the Irrawaddy valley from the [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]]. Over the next two hundred years, the small principality gradually grew to absorb its surrounding regions until the 1050s and 1060s when King [[Anawrahta]] founded the Pagan Kingdom, for the first time unifying under one polity  the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. By the late 12th century Anawrahta's successors had extended their influence farther to the south into the upper [[Malay peninsula]], to the east at least to the [[Salween river]], in the farther north to below the current China border, and to the west, in northern [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] and the [[Chin Hills]].&lt;ref name=vbl-90-91-94/&gt;&lt;ref name=mat-1985-197/&gt; In the 12th and 13th centuries, Pagan, alongside the [[Khmer Empire]], was one of two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=vbl-24/&gt;

The Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]], [[Mon language|Mon]] and [[Pali]] norms by the late 12th century. Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level although [[Vajrayana|Tantric]], [[Mahayana]], [[Brahmanic]], and [[animist]] practices remained heavily entrenched at all social strata. Pagan's rulers built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone of which over 2000 remain. The wealthy donated tax-free land to religious authorities.&lt;ref name=vbl-92-97/&gt;

The kingdom went into decline in the mid-13th century as the continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth by the 1280s had severely affected the crown's ability to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen. This ushered in a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges by the [[Rakhine people|Arakanese]], [[Mon people|Mons]], [[Yuan Dynasty|Mongols]] and [[Shan people|Shans]]. Repeated [[Mongol invasions of Burma (disambiguation)|Mongol invasions]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; (1277–1301) toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287. The collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century.&lt;ref name=vbl-119-120/&gt;&lt;ref name=mha-63-65/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
{{Main article|Early Pagan Kingdom}}

The origins of the Pagan kingdom have been reconstructed using archaeological evidence as well as the [[Burmese chronicles|Burmese chronicle]] tradition. Considerable differences exist between the views of modern scholarship and various chronicle narratives.

====Chronicle tradition====
{{see also|Tagaung Kingdom|Sri Ksetra Kingdom}}

Burmese chronicles do not agree on the origins of the Pagan kingdom. Chronicles down to the 18th century trace its origins to 167 CE, when [[Pyusawhti]], a descendant of a solar spirit and a dragon princess, founded the dynasty at Pagan. But the 19th-century Glass Palace Chronicle (''[[Hmannan Yazawin]]'') connects the dynasty's origins to the clan of the [[Buddha]] and the first Buddhist king [[Maha Sammata]] ({{my|မဟာ သမ္မတ}}).&lt;ref name=tt-1964-ix-x&gt;Than Tun 1964: ix–x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-196&gt;Lieberman 2003: 196&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glass Palace Chronicle traces the origins of the Pagan kingdom to India during the 9th century BCE, more than three centuries before the Buddha was born. Prince [[Abhiyaza|Abhiraja]] ({{my|အဘိရာဇာ}}) of [[Kosala]] ({{my|ကောသလ}}) of the [[Shakya|Sakya clan]] ({{my|သကျ သာကီဝင် မင်းမျိုး}}) — the clan of the Buddha — left his homeland with followers in 850 BCE after military defeat by the neighbouring kingdom of [[Panchala]] ({{my|ပဉ္စာလရာဇ်}}). They settled at [[Tagaung, Mandalay|Tagaung]] in present-day northern Burma and [[Tagaung Kingdom|founded a kingdom]]. The Chronicle does not claim that he had arrived in an empty land, only that he was the first king.&lt;ref name=tmu-44-45&gt;Myint-U 2006: 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Abhiraja had two sons. The elder son [[Kanyaza Gyi]] ({{my|ကံရာဇာကြီး}}) ventured south, and  in 825 BCE founded his own kingdom in what is today [[Rakhine State|Arakan]]. The younger son [[Kanyaza Nge]] ({{my|ကံရာဇာငယ်}}) succeeded his father, and was followed by a dynasty of 31 kings, and then another dynasty of 17 kings. Some three and a half centuries later, in 483 BCE, scions of Tagaung [[Sri Ksetra Kingdom|founded yet another kingdom]] much farther down the Irrawaddy at [[Sri Ksetra]], near modern [[Pyay]] (Prome). Sri Ksetra lasted nearly six centuries, and was succeeded in turn by the kingdom of Pagan.&lt;ref name=tmu-44-45/&gt; The Glass Palace Chronicle goes on to relate that around 107 CE, [[Thamoddarit]] ({{my|သမုဒ္ဒရာဇ်}}), nephew of the last king of Sri Ksetra, founded the city of Pagan (formally, '''Arimaddana-pura''' ({{my|အရိမဒ္ဒနာပူရ}}), lit. "the City that Tramples on Enemies").&lt;ref name=vbl-91&gt;Lieberman 2003: 91&lt;/ref&gt; The site reportedly was visited by the Buddha himself during his lifetime, and it was where he allegedly pronounced that a great kingdom would arise at this very location 651 years after his death.&lt;ref name=hy-1-188&gt;Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 188&lt;/ref&gt; Thamoddarit was followed by a caretaker, and then Pyusawhti in 167 CE.

The chronicle narratives then merge, and agree that a dynasty of kings followed Pyusawhti. King [[Pyinbya]] ({{my|ပျဉ်ပြား}}) fortified the city in 849 CE.&lt;ref name=geh-364&gt;Harvey 1925: 349&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scholarly reconstruction====
[[File:Pyu Realm.png|thumb|left|150px|Pyu city-states circa 8th century]]
{{Main article|Pyu city-states}}

Modern scholarship holds that the Pagan dynasty was founded by the [[Bamar|Mranma]] (Burmans) of the [[Nanzhao Kingdom]] in the mid-to-late 9th century CE; that the earlier parts of the chronicle are the histories and legends of the [[Pyu people]], the earliest inhabitants of Burma of whom records are extant; and that Pagan kings had adopted the Pyu histories and legends as their own. Indeed, European scholars of the [[British rule in Burma|British colonial period]] were even more skeptical, dismissing outright the chronicle tradition of early Burmese history as "copies of Indian legends taken from Sanskrit or Pali originals",&lt;ref name=dgeh-7&gt;Hall 1960: 7&lt;/ref&gt; and the Abhiraja story as a vain attempt by Burmese chroniclers to link their kings to the Buddha. They doubted the antiquity of the chronicle tradition, and dismissed the possibility that any sort of civilisation in Burma could be much older than 500 CE.&lt;ref name=tmu-44-45/&gt;&lt;ref name=dgeh-7/&gt;&lt;ref name=-geh-307-309&gt;Harvey 1925: 307–309&lt;/ref&gt;

The Abhiraja myth notwithstanding, more recent research does indicate that many of the places mentioned in the royal records have indeed been inhabited continuously for at least 3500 years.&lt;ref name=tmu-44-45/&gt; The earliest evidence of civilisation thus far dates to 11,000 BCE.&lt;ref name=rmc-1&gt;Cooler 2002: Chapter I: Prehistoric and Animist Periods&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence shows that as early as the 2nd century BCE the Pyu had built water-management systems along secondary streams in central and northern parts of the Irrawaddy basin and had founded one of Southeast Asia's earliest urban centres. By the early centuries CE, several walled cities and towns, including Tagaung, the birthplace of the first Burman kingdom according to the chronicles, had emerged. The architectural and artistic evidence indicates the Pyu realm's contact with Indian culture by the 4th century CE. The city-states boasted kings and palaces, moats and massive wooden gates, and always 12 gates for each of the signs of the zodiac, one of the many enduring patterns that would continue until the British occupation. Sri Ksetra emerged as the premier Pyu city-state in the 7th century CE. Although the size of the city-states and the scale of political organisation grew during the 7th to early 9th centuries, no sizeable kingdom had yet emerged by the 9th century.&lt;ref name=tmu-44-45/&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-89&gt;Lieberman 2003: 89&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a reconstruction by [[Gordon Luce|G.H. Luce]], the millennium-old Pyu realm came crashing down under repeated attacks by the [[Nanzhao Kingdom]] of Yunnan between the 750s and 830s CE. Like that of the Pyu, the original home of Burmans prior to Yunnan is believed to be in present-day [[Qinghai province|Qinghai]] and [[Gansu province]]s.&lt;ref name=ehm-236&gt;Moore 2007: 236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geh-3&gt;Harvey 1925: 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=degh-11&gt;Hall 1960: 11&lt;/ref&gt; After the Nanzhao attacks had greatly weakened the Pyu city-states, large numbers of Burman warriors and their families ''first'' entered the Pyu realm in the 830s and 840s, and settled at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin rivers,&lt;ref name=gc-105-106&gt;Coedès 1968: 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps to help the Nanzhao pacify the surrounding countryside.&lt;ref name=vbl-90&gt;Lieberman 2003: 90&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the naming system of the early Pagan kings—Pyusawhti and his descendants for six generations—was identical to that of the Nanzhao kings where the last name of the father became the first name of the son. The chronicles date these early kings to between the 2nd and 5th centuries CE, scholars to between the 8th and 10th centuries CE.&lt;ref name=geh-308&gt;Harvey 1925: 308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tmu-56-57&gt;Myint-U 2006: 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mat-1985-205&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 205&lt;/ref&gt; (A minority view led by [[Htin Aung]] contends that the arrival of Burmans may have been a few centuries earlier, perhaps the early 7th century.&lt;ref name=mha-329&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 367&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest human settlement at Pagan is radiocarbon dated to c. 650 CE. But evidence is inconclusive to prove that it was specifically a Burman (and not just another Pyu) settlement.)&lt;ref name=mat-2005-185&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 185&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thant Myint-U]] summarises that "the Nanzhao Empire had washed up on the banks of the Irrawaddy, and would find a new life, fused with an existing and ancient culture, to produce one of the most impressive little kingdoms of the medieval world. From this fusion would result the Burmese people, and the foundations of modern Burmese culture."&lt;ref name=tmu-56-57/&gt;

===Early Pagan===
{{see also|List of early Pagan monarchs}}
[[File:Tharaba Gate.JPG|thumb|The [[Tharabha Gate]] at Pagan (Bagan), the only remaining section of the old walls. The main walls are dated to c. 1020 and the earliest pieces of the walls to c. 980.]]
[[File:Pagan Empire -- 1044.PNG|thumb|150px|Principality of Pagan at Anawrahta's accession in 1044]]

Evidence shows that the actual pace of Burman migration into the Pyu realm was gradual. Indeed, no firm indications have been found at Sri Ksetra or at any other Pyu site to suggest a violent overthrow. Radiocarbon dating shows that human activity existed until c. 870 at [[Hanlin, Burma|Halin]], the Pyu city reportedly destroyed by an 832 Nanzhao raid.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-36-37&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The region of Pagan received waves of Burman settlements in the mid-to-late 9th century, and perhaps well into the 10th century. Though ''Hmannan'' states that Pagan was ''fortified'' in 849—or more accurately, 876 after the ''Hmannan'' dates are adjusted to King [[Anawrahta]]'s inscriptionally verified accession date of 1044—the chronicle reported date is likely the date of foundation, not fortification. Radiocarbon dating of Pagan's walls points to c. 980 at the earliest.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-38&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 38&lt;/ref&gt; (If an earlier fortification did exist, it must have been constructed using less durable materials such as mud.) Likewise, inscriptional evidence of the earliest Pagan kings points to 956. The earliest mention of Pagan in external sources occurs in [[Song Dynasty|Song Chinese]] records, which report that envoys from Pagan visited the Song capital [[Kaifeng|Bianjing]] in 1004. [[Champa|Cham]] and Mon inscriptions first mentioned Pagan in 1050 and 1093, respectively.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-21&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a ''partial'' list of early Pagan kings as reported by ''Hmannan'', shown in comparison with ''Hmannan'' dates adjusted to 1044 and the list of ''[[Zatadawbon Yazawin]]'' (the Royal Horoscopes Chronicle).&lt;ref name=mat-1985-21-22&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uk-1-346-347&gt;Maha Yazawin 2006: 346–347&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Anawrahta, inscriptional evidence exists thus far only for [[Nyaung-u Sawrahan]] and [[Kunhsaw Kyaunghpyu]]. The list starts from [[Pyinbya]], the fortifier of Pagan according to ''Hmannan''.

At any rate, by the mid-10th century, Burmans at Pagan had expanded irrigation-based cultivation while borrowing extensively from the Pyus' predominantly Buddhist culture. Pagan's early iconography, architecture and scripts suggest little difference between early Burman and Pyu cultural forms. Moreover, no sharp ethnic distinction between Burmans and linguistically linked Pyus seems to have existed.&lt;ref name=vbl-90-91&gt;Lieberman 2003: 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; The city was one of several competing city-states until the late 10th century when it grew in authority and grandeur.&lt;ref name=vbl-90-91/&gt; By Anawrahta's accession in 1044, Pagan had grown into a small principality—about {{convert|320|km}} north to south and about {{convert|130|km}} from east to west, comprising roughly the present districts of [[Mandalay]], [[Meiktila]], [[Myingyan]], [[Kyaukse]], [[Yamethin]], [[Magway District|Magwe]], [[Sagaing]], and the riverine portions of [[Minbu]] and [[Pakkoku]]. To the north lay the Nanzhao Kingdom, and to the east still largely uninhabited [[Shan Hills]], to the south and the west Pyus, and farther south still, [[Mon people|Mons]].&lt;ref name=geh-24-25&gt;Harvey 1925: 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the principality is about 6% of that of modern Burma/Myanmar.

===Pagan Empire===
{{See also|List_of_Burmese_monarchs#Pagan_.28849.E2.80.931298.29|l1=List of Pagan monarchs}}
[[File:Pyinoolwin -- DSA Anawrahta.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of King Anawrahta in front of the [[Defence Services Academy|DSA]]]]
In December 1044, a Pagan prince named [[Anawrahta]] came to power. Over the next three decades, he turned this small principality into the First Burmese Empire—the "charter polity" that formed the basis of modern-day Burma/Myanmar.&lt;ref name=geh-23-34&gt;Harvey 1925: 23–34&lt;/ref&gt; Historically verifiable Burmese history begins with his accession.&lt;ref name=geh-19&gt;Harvey 1925: 19&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formation====
[[File:Pagan-kingdom.jpg|thumb|150px|Pagan Empire under [[Anawrahta]]; Minimal, if any, control over Arakan; Pagan's suzerainty over Arakan confirmed four decades after his death.]]

Anawrahta proved an energetic king. His acts as king were to strengthen his kingdom's economic base. In the first decade of his reign, he invested much effort into turning the arid parched lands of central Burma into a rice granary, successfully building/enlarging weirs and canals, mainly around the [[Kyaukse district]],&lt;ref name=gc-149&gt;Coedès 1968: 149&lt;/ref&gt; east of Pagan. The newly irrigated regions attracted people, giving him with an increased manpower base. He graded every town and village according to the levy it could raise. The region, known as '''Ledwin''' ({{my|လယ်တွင်း}}, lit. "rice country"), became the granary, the economic key of the north country. History shows that one who gained control of Kyaukse became kingmaker in Upper Burma.&lt;ref name=geh-24-25&gt;Harvey 1925: 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1050s, Anawrahta's reforms had turned Pagan into a regional power, and he looked to expand. Over the next ten years, he founded the Pagan Empire, the Irrawaddy valley at the core, surrounded by tributary states.&lt;ref name=mha-34&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 34&lt;/ref&gt; Anawrahta began his campaigns in the nearer [[Shan Hills]], and extended conquests to [[Lower Burma]] down to the [[Tenasserim coast]] to [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] and [[Rakhine State|North Arakan]].&lt;ref name=tmu-56-57/&gt; Estimates of the extent of his empire vary greatly. The Burmese and Siamese chronicles report an empire which covered the present-day Burma and northern Thailand. The Siamese chronicles assert that Anawrahta conquered the entire [[Menam]] valley, and received tribute from the Khmer king. One Siamese chronicle states that Anawrahta's armies invaded the Khmer kingdom and sacked the city of [[Angkor]], and another one goes so far as to say that Anawrahta even visited [[Java]] to receive his tribute.&lt;ref name=mha-34/&gt;

Archaeological evidence however confirms only a smaller empire of the Irrawaddy valley and nearer periphery. Anawrahta's victory terracotta votive tablets emblazoned with his name in Sanskrit have been found along the [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]] coastline in the south, [[Katha, Burma|Katha]] in the north, [[Thazi Township|Thazi]] in the east and [[Minbu]] in the west.&lt;ref name=kt-41-42&gt;Kyaw Thet 1962: 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; In the northeast, a series of 43 forts Anawrahta established along the eastern foothills, of which 33 still exist as villages, reveal the effective extent of his authority.&lt;ref name=geh-29-30&gt;Harvey 1925: 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, most scholars attribute Pagan's control of peripheral regions (Arakan, Shan Hills) to later kings—Arakan to [[Alaungsithu]], and [[Thanlwin river|cis-Salween]] Shan Hills to [[Narapatisithu]]. (Even those latter-day kings may not have had more than nominal control over the farther peripheral regions. For example, some scholars such as Victor Lieberman argue that Pagan did not have any "effective authority" over Arakan.&lt;ref name=vbl-92&gt;Lieberman 2003: 92&lt;/ref&gt;)

At any rate, all scholars accept that during the 11th century, Pagan consolidated its hold of Upper Burma, and established its authority over Lower Burma. The emergence of Pagan Empire would have a lasting impact on [[Burmese history]] as well as the history of [[mainland Southeast Asia]]. The conquest of Lower Burma checked the Khmer Empire's encroachment into the Tenasserim coast, secured control of the peninsular ports, which were transit points between the Indian Ocean and China, and facilitated growing cultural exchange with the external world: Mons of Lower Burma, India and Ceylon.&lt;ref name=vbl-90-91-94&gt;Lieberman 2003: 90–91, 94&lt;/ref&gt; Equally important was Anawrahta's conversion to Theravada Buddhism from his native [[Ari Buddhism]]. The Burmese king provided the Buddhist school, which had been in retreat elsewhere in South Asia and Southeast Asia, a much needed reprieve and a safe shelter. By the 1070s, Pagan had emerged as the main Theravada stronghold. In 1071, it helped to restart the Theravada Buddhism in [[Ceylon]] whose Buddhist clergy had been wiped out by the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]]. Another key development according to traditional scholarship was the emergence of the [[Burmese script]], believed to have been derived from the [[Mon script]] in 1058, one year after the conquest of Thaton. However recent research, though not yet settled, suggests that the Burmese script may have been derived in the 10th century from the [[Pyu script]] instead.

====Cultural synthesis and economic growth====
[[File:Ananda-Temple-2.JPG|thumb|The [[Ananda Temple]]]]
Anawrahta was followed by a line of able kings who cemented Pagan's place in history. Pagan entered a gilded age that would last for the next two centuries. Aside from a few occasional rebellions, the kingdom was largely peaceful during the period. King [[Kyansittha]] (r. 1084–1112) successfully melded the diverse cultural influences introduced into Pagan by Anawrahta's conquests. He patronised Mon scholars and artisans who emerged as the intellectual elite. He appeased the Pyus by linking his genealogy to the real and mythical ancestors of Sri Ksetra, the symbol of the Pyu golden past, and by calling the kingdom Pyu, even though it had been ruled by a Burman ruling class. He supported and favoured Theravada Buddhism while tolerating other religious groups. To be sure, he pursued these policies all the while maintaining the Burman military rule. By the end of his 28-year reign, Pagan had emerged a major power alongside the Khmer Empire in Southeast Asia, recognised as a sovereign kingdom by the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]], and the Indian [[Chola Dynasty]]. Several diverse elements—art, architecture, religion, language, literature, ethnic plurality—had begun to synthesize.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-23-24&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Pagan's rise continued under [[Alaungsithu]] (r. 1112–1167), who focused on standardising administrative and economic systems. The king, also known as Sithu I, actively expanded frontier colonies and built new irrigation systems throughout the kingdom. He also introduced standardised weights and measures throughout the country to assist administration as well as trade. The standardisation provided an impetus for the monetisation of Pagan's economy, the full impact of which however would not be felt until later in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=rsw-130-131&gt;Wicks 1992: 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom prospered from increased agricultural output as well as from inland and maritime trading networks. Much of the wealth was devoted to temple building. Temple building projects, which began in earnest during Kyansittha's reign, became increasingly grandiose, and began to transition into a distinctively Burman architectural style from earlier Pyu and Mon norms. By the end of Sithu I's reign, Pagan enjoyed a more synthesised culture, an efficient government and a prosperous economy. However a corresponding growth in population also put pressure on "the fixed relationship between productive land and population", forcing the later kings to expand.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-23-24/&gt;

[[File:Bagan, Burma.jpg|thumb|Pagan plains today]]

Pagan reached the height of political and administrative development during the reigns of [[Narapatisithu]] (Sithu II; r. 1174–1211) and [[Htilominlo]] (r. 1211–1235). The [[Sulamani Temple]], [[Gawdawpalin Temple]], [[Mahabodhi Temple, Bagan|Mahabodhi Temple]], and [[Htilominlo Temple]] were built during their reigns.&lt;ref name=gc-178-183&gt;Coedès 1968: 178, 183&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom's borders expanded to its greatest extent. Military organisation and success reached their zenith. Monumental architecture achieved a qualitative and quantitative standard that subsequent dynasties tried to emulate but never succeeded in doing. The court finally developed a complex organisation that became the model for later dynasties. the agricultural economy reached its potential in Upper Burma. The Buddhist clergy, the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'', enjoyed one of its most wealthy periods. Civil and criminal laws were codified in the vernacular, [[Burmese language|Burmese]], to become the basic jurisprudence for subsequent ages.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-25-26&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Sithu II formally founded the [[Royal Burmese Army|Palace Guards]] in 1174, the first extant record of a standing army, and pursued an expansionist policy. Over his 27-year reign, Pagan's influence reached further south into the [[Malay peninsula]], at least to the [[Salween river]] in the east and below the current China border in the farther north.&lt;ref name=vbl-90-91-94/&gt;&lt;ref name=mat-1985-197&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 197&lt;/ref&gt; (Burmese chronicles also claim trans-Salween Shan states, including Kengtung and Chiang Mai.) Continuing his grandfather Sithu I's policies, Sithu II expanded the agricultural base of the kingdom with new manpower from the conquered areas, ensuring the needed wealth for a growing royalty and officialdom. Pagan dispatched governors to supervise more closely ports in Lower Burma and the peninsula.&lt;ref name=vbl-90-91-94/&gt; In the early 13th century, Pagan, alongside the Khmer Empire, was one of two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=vbl-24&gt;Lieberman 2003: 24&lt;/ref&gt;

His reign also saw the rise of Burmese culture which finally emerged from the shadows of Mon and Pyu cultures. With the Burman leadership of the kingdom now unquestioned, the term ''Mranma'' (Burmans) was openly used in Burmese language inscriptions. The Burmese script became the primary script of the kingdom, replacing Pyu and Mon scripts.&lt;ref name=mha-51-52&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; His reign also saw the realignment of Burmese Buddhism with Ceylon's [[Mahavihara]] school.&lt;ref name=geh-56&gt;Harvey 1925: 56&lt;/ref&gt; The Pyus receded into the background, and by the early 13th century, had largely assumed the Burman ethnicity.

====Decline====
[[File:Pagan period religious donations -- cumulative.PNG|thumb|300px|Cumulative donations to the Sangha in 25-year periods]]

Sithu II's success in state building created stability and prosperity throughout the kingdom. His immediate successors Htilominlo and [[Kyaswa]] (r. 1235–1249) were able to live off the stable and bountiful conditions he passed on with little state-building on their part.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-26&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 26&lt;/ref&gt; Htilomino hardly did any governing. A devout Buddhist and scholar, the king gave up the command of the army, and left administration to a privy council of ministers, the forebear of the [[Hluttaw]]. But the seeds of Pagan's decline were sowed during this seemingly idyllic period. The state had stopped expanding, but the practice of donating tax-free land to religion had not. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. Indeed, Htilominlo was the last of the temple builders although most of his temples were in remote lands not in the Pagan region, reflecting the deteriorating state of royal treasury.&lt;ref name=mha-55&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 55&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-13th century, the problem had worsened considerably. The Upper Burma heartland over which Pagan exercised most political control had run out of easily reclaimed irrigable tracts. Yet their fervent desire to accumulate religious merit for better reincarnations made it impossible for Pagan kings to halt entirely their own or other courtiers' donations. The crown did try to reclaim some of these lands by periodically purging the clergy in the name of Buddhist purification, and seizing previously donated lands. Although some of the reclamation efforts were successful, powerful Buddhist clergy by and large successfully resisted such attempts.&lt;ref name=vbl-119-120&gt;Lieberman 2003: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mha-63-65&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the rate of reclamation fell behind the rate at which such lands were dedicated to the ''sangha''. (The problem was exacerbated to a smaller degree by powerful ministers, who exploited succession disputes and accumulated their own lands at the expense of the crown.) By 1280, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivatable land had been donated to religion. Thus the throne lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges by [[Mon people|Mons]], [[Mongol people|Mongols]] and [[Shan people|Shans]].&lt;ref name=vbl-119-120/&gt;

===Fall===

====Mongol invasions====
{{Main article|First Mongol invasion of Burma}}
[[File:Burma c. 1310.PNG|thumb|150px|Rise of small kingdoms after the fall of Pagan Empire c. 1310. Tai-Shan Realm of Shan states, Lan Na and Sukhothai as well as Ramanya in Lower Burma were Mongol vassals. Myinsaing was the only non-Mongol vassal state in the region.]]

The first signs of disorder appeared soon after [[Narathihapate]]'s accession in 1256. The inexperienced king faced revolts in Arakanese state of Macchagiri (present-day [[Kyaukpyu District]])&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Harvey 1925: 326–327): The location of Macchagiri is likely to the west of [[Thayetmyo|Thayet]] on the western side of the [[Arakan Yoma]]; Harvey's map of Pagan Empire on p. 21 shows present-day Kyaukpru District (specifically, Ann) as Macchagiri.&lt;/ref&gt; in the west, and [[Mottama|Martaban]] (Mottama) in the south. The Martaban rebellion was easily put down but Macchagiri required a second expedition before it too was put down.&lt;ref name=geh-62&gt;Harvey 1925: 62&lt;/ref&gt; The calm did not last long. Martaban again revolted in 1281. This time, Pagan could not do anything to retake Martaban because it was facing an existential threat from the north. The [[Mongols]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]] demanded tribute, in 1271 and again in 1273. When Narathihapate refused both times, the Mongols under [[Kublai Khan]] systematically invaded the country. The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the [[battle of Ngasaunggyan]], and secured their hold of [[Yingjiang County|Kanngai]] (modern-day Yingjiang, Yunnan, {{convert|112|km}} north of [[Bhamo]]). In 1283–85, their forces moved south and occupied down to Hanlin. Instead of defending the country, the king fled Pagan for Lower Burma where he was assassinated by one of his sons in 1287.&lt;ref name=tmu-60-62&gt;Myint-U 2006: 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Northern Burma to [[Tagaung, Mandalay|Tagaung]] was conquered by the Yuan dynasty.

The Mongols invaded again in 1287. Recent research indicates that Mongol armies may not have reached Pagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal.&lt;ref name=vbl-119-120/&gt; But the damage was already done. All the vassal states of Pagan revolted right after the king's death, and went their own way. In the south, [[Wareru]], the man who had seized the [[List of rulers of Martaban|governorship of Martaban]] in 1285, consolidated [[Mon language|Mon]]-speaking regions of Lower Burma, and declared [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Ramannadesa]] (Land of the Mon) independent on 30 January 1287.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 148, footnote 8): Thursday, Full moon of Tabodwe 648 ME = 30 January 1287&lt;/ref&gt; In the west too, Arakan stopped paying tribute.&lt;ref name=geh-68&gt;Harvey 1925: 68&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicles report that the eastern territories including trans-Salween states of Keng Hung, Kengtung and Chiang Mai stopped paying tribute&lt;ref name=hy-1-360&gt;Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 360&lt;/ref&gt; although most scholars attribute Pagan's limits to the Salween. At any rate, the 250-year-old Pagan Empire had ceased to exist.

====Disintegration and fall====
{{see also |Myinsaing Kingdom|Hanthawaddy Kingdom}}

After their 1287 invasion, the Mongols moved farther south to [[Tagaung]] but refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created. Indeed, Emperor [[Kublai Khan]] never sanctioned an actual occupation of Pagan.&lt;ref name=geh-68/&gt; His real aim appeared to have been "to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented."&lt;ref name=mha-83&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 83&lt;/ref&gt; At Pagan, one of Narathihapate's sons [[Kyawswa of Pagan|Kyawswa]] emerged king of Pagan in May 1289. But the new "king" controlled just a small area around the capital, and had no real army. The real power in Upper Burma now rested with three brothers, who were former Pagan commanders, of nearby [[Myinsaing]]. When the Hanthawaddy Kingdom of Lower Burma became a vassal of [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] in 1294, it was the brothers, not Kyawswa, that sent a force to reclaim the former Pagan territory. Though the army was driven back, it left no doubt as to who held the real power in central Burma. In the following years, the brothers, especially the youngest [[Thihathu]], increasingly acted like sovereigns.&lt;ref name=mha-73-75&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

To check the increasing power of the three brothers, Kyawswa submitted to the Mongols in January 1297, and was recognised by the Mongol emperor [[Temür Khan, Emperor Chengzong of Yuan|Temür Khan]] as viceroy of Pagan on 20 March 1297. The brothers resented the new arrangement as a Mongol vassalage as it directly reduced their power. On 17 December 1297, the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa, and founded the [[Myinsaing Kingdom]]. The Mongols did not know about the dethronement until June–July 1298.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-119-120&gt;Than Tun 1959: 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Mongols launched another invasion, reaching Myinsaing on 25 January 1301 but could not break through. The besiegers took the bribes by the three brothers, and withdrew on 6 April 1301.&lt;ref name=tt-1959-122&gt;Than Tun 1959: 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gc-210-211&gt;Coedès 1968: 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongol government at Yunnan executed their commanders but sent no more invasions. They withdrew entirely from Upper Burma starting on 4 April 1303.&lt;ref name=mha-73-75/&gt;&lt;ref name=tt-137&gt;Than Tun 1964: 137&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, the city of Pagan, once home to 200,000 people,&lt;ref name=hk-ab-115&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 115&lt;/ref&gt; had been reduced to a small town, never to regain its preeminence. (It survived into the 15th century as a human settlement.) The brothers placed one of Kyawswa's sons as the governor of Pagan. Anawrahta's line continued to rule Pagan as governors under Myinsaing, [[Pinya Kingdom|Pinya]] and [[Ava Kingdom|Ava kingdoms]] until 1369. The male side of Pagan ended there although the female side passed into Pinya and Ava royalty.&lt;ref name=geh-365&gt;Harvey 1925: 365&lt;/ref&gt; But the Pagan line continued to be claimed by successive Burmese dynasties down to the last Burmese dynasty [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]].&lt;ref name=mat-1985-196-197&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
[[File:Bagan Palace.JPG|thumb|left|Ruins of the old Pagan Palace]]
Pagan's government can be generally described by the [[Mandala (political model)|mandala]] system in which the sovereign exercised direct political authority in the core region (''pyi'', lit. "country", {{my|ပြည်}}, {{IPA-my|pjì|}}), and administered farther surrounding regions as tributary [[vassal state]]s (''naingngans'', lit. "conquered lands", {{my|နိုင်ငံ}}, {{IPA-my|nàiɴŋàɴ|}}). In general, the crown's authority diffused away with the increasing distance from the capital.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-99-101&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-112-113&gt;Lieberman 2003: 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; Each state was administered at three general levels: ''taing'' ({{my|တိုင်း}}, province), ''myo'' ({{my|မြို့}}, town), and ''ywa'' ({{my|ရွာ}}, village), with the high king's court at the centre. The kingdom consisted of at least 14 ''taings''.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-104-105&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Core region===
The core region was the present-day dry zone of Upper Burma, measuring approximately {{convert|150|to|250|km}} in radius from the capital. The region consisted of the capital and the key irrigated hubs (''khayaings'', {{my|ခရိုင်}}, {{IPA-my|kʰəjàiɴ|}}) of [[Kyaukse District|Kyaukse]] and [[Minbu District|Minbu]]. Because of the irrigated hubs, the region supported the largest population in the kingdom, which translated into the largest concentration of royal servicemen who could be called into military service. The king directly ruled the capital and its immediate environs while he appointed most trusted members of the royal family to rule Kyaukse and Minbu. Newly settled dry zone ''taik'' ({{my|တိုက်}}, {{IPA-my|taiʔ|}}) areas on the west bank of the Irrawaddy were entrusted to the men of lesser rank, as well as those from powerful local families known as ''taik'' leaders (''taik-thugyis'', {{my|တိုက်သူကြီး}}, {{IPA-my|taiʔ ðədʑí|}}). The governors and taik-leaders lived off apanage grants and local taxes. But unlike their frontier counterparts, the core zone governors did not have much autonomy because of the close proximity to the capital.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-99-101/&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-112-113/&gt;

===Peripheral regions===
Surrounding the core region were the ''naingngans'' or tributary states, governed by local hereditary rulers as well as Pagan appointed governors, drawn from princely or ministerial families. Because of their farther distances from the capital, the regions' rulers/governors had greater autonomy. They were required to send tributes to the crown but they generally had a freehand in the rest of the administration. They were chief justices, commanders-in-chief, and tax collectors. They made local officer appointments. In fact, no evidence of royal censuses or direct contact between the Pagan court and headmen beneath the governors has been found.

Over the course of 250 years, the throne slowly tried to integrate the most strategically and economically important regions—i.e. Lower Burma, Tenasserim, northernmost Irrawaddy valley—into the core by appointing its governors in place of hereditary rulers. In the 12th and 13th centuries, for example, Pagan made a point of appointing its governors in the Tenasserim coast to closely supervise the ports and revenues. By the second half of the 13th century, several key ports in Lower Burma (Prome, Bassein, Dala) were all ruled by senior princes of the royal family.&lt;ref name=vbl-112-113/&gt;&lt;ref name=mat-1985-104-105/&gt; However, the escape of Lower Burma from Upper Burma's orbit in the late 13th century proves that the region was far from fully integrated. History shows that the region would not be fully integrated into the core until the late 18th century.

The royal authority attenuated further in farther ''naingngans'': Arakan, Chin Hills, Kachin Hills, and Shan Hills. These were tributary lands over which the crown only had a "largely ritual" or nominal sovereignty. In general, the king of Pagan received a periodic nominal tribute but had "no substantive authority", for example, on such matters as the selection of deputies, successors, or levels of taxation.&lt;ref name=vbl-112-113/&gt; Pagan largely stayed out of the affairs of these outlying states, only interfering when there were outright revolts, such as Arakan and Martaban in the late 1250s or northern Kachin Hills in 1277.

===Court===
[[File:Burmese equestrian sports.jpg|thumb|Burmese nobles partaking in equestrian sports]]
The court was the centre of administration, representing at once executive, legislative and judiciary branches of the government. The members of the court can be divided into three general categories: royalty, ministers, and subordinate officials. At the top were the high king, princes, princesses, queens and concubines. The ministers were usually drawn from more distant branches of the royal family. Their subordinates were not royal but usually hailed from top official families. Titles, ranks, insignia, fiefs and other such rewards helped maintain the loyalty-patronage structure of the court.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-130-131&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;

The king as the absolute monarch was the chief executive, legislator and justice of the land. However, as the kingdom grew, the king gradually handed over the responsibilities over to the court, which became more extensive and complex, adding more administrative layers and officials. In the early 13th century, circa 1211, part of the court evolved into the king's privy council or ''[[Hluttaw]]''. The role and power of the Hluttaw grew greatly in the following decades. It came to manage not only day-to-day affairs but also military affairs of the kingdom. (No Pagan king after Sithu II ever took command of the army again.)&lt;ref name=mha-55&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 55&lt;/ref&gt; The powerful ministers also became kingmakers. Their support was an important factor in the accession of the last kings of Pagan from Htilominlo (r. 1211–1235) to Kyawswa (r. 1289–1297).

The court was also the chief justice of the land. Sithu I (r. 1112–1167) was the first Pagan king to issue an official collection of judgments, later known as the ''Alaungsithu hpyat-hton'', to be followed as precedents by all courts of justice.&lt;ref name=mha-45&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 45&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up collection of judgments was compiled during the reign of Sithu II (r. 1174–1211) by a Mon monk named Dhammavilasa. As another sign of delegation of power, Sithu II also appointed a chief justice and a chief minister.&lt;ref name=geh-58&gt;Harvey 1925: 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
{{Main article|Military history of Pagan Dynasty}}

[[File:Aungzwamagyi Nat.jpg|thumb|150px|Pagan commander [[Aungzwamagyi|Aung Zwa]] in the service of [[Narapatisithu|Sithu II]]]]
Pagan's military was the origin of the [[Royal Burmese Army]]. The army was organised into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger conscript-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the ''kyundaw'' system (called the ''ahmudan'' system by later dynasties), which required local chiefs to supply their predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population in times of war. This basic system of military organisation was largely unchanged down to the precolonial period although later dynasties, especially the Toungoo Dynasty, did introduce standardisation and other modifications.

The early Pagan army consisted mainly of conscripts raised just prior to or during the times of war. Although historians believe that earlier kings like Anawrahta must have had permanent troops on duty in the palace, the first specific mention of a standing military structure in the Burmese chronicles is 1174 when Sithu II founded the Palace Guards—"two companies inner and outer, and they kept watch in ranks one behind the other". The Palace Guards became the nucleus round which the mass levy assembled in war time. Most of the field levy served in the infantry but the men for the [[elephantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[navy|naval]] corps were drawn from specific hereditary villages that specialised in respective military skills.&lt;ref name=geh-323-324&gt;Harvey 1925: 323–324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wod-37-38&gt;Dijk 2006: 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; In an era of limited military specialisation, when the number of conscripted cultivators offered the best single indication of military success, Upper Burma with a greater population was the natural centre of political gravity.&lt;ref name=vbl-88-89&gt;Lieberman 2003: 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Various sources and estimates put Pagan's military strength anywhere between 30,000 and 60,000 men. One inscription by Sithu II, who expanded the empire to its greatest extent, describes him as the lord of 17,645 soldiers while another notes 30,000 soldiers and cavalry under his command.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-93-163&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 93, 163&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese account mentions a Burmese army of 40,000 to 60,000 (including 800 elephants and 10,000 horses) at the [[battle of Ngasaunggyan]] in 1277. However, some argue that the Chinese figures, which came from eye estimates of a single battle, are greatly exaggerated. As Harvey puts it: the Mongols "erred on the side of generosity as they did not wish to diminish the glory in defeating superior numbers".&lt;ref name=geh-333&gt;Harvey 1925: 333&lt;/ref&gt; But assuming that the precolonial population of Burma was relatively constant, the estimates of 40,000 to 60,000 of the ''entire military'' are not improbable, and are in line with figures given for the Burmese military between the 16th and 19th centuries in a variety of sources.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-93-163/&gt;

==Economy==

The economy of Pagan was based primarily on [[agriculture]], and to a much smaller degree, on [[trade]]. The growth of the Pagan Empire and subsequent development of irrigated lands in new lands sustained a growth in the number of population centres and a growing prosperous economy. The economy also benefited from the general absence of warfare that would stunt the economies of later dynasties. According to Victor Lieberman, the prosperous economy supported "a rich Buddhist civilization whose most spectacular feature was a dense forest of pagodas, monasteries, and temples, totaling perhaps 10,000 brick structures, of which the remains of over 2000 survive."&lt;ref name=vbl-92-97&gt;Lieberman 2003: 92–97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
[[File:Pagan Irrigated Areas.PNG|thumb|300px|Development of irrigated lands]]

Agriculture was the primary engine of the kingdom from its beginnings in the 9th century. Burman immigrants are believed to have either introduced new water management techniques or greatly enhanced existing Pyu system of weirs, dams, sluices, and diversionary barricades.&lt;ref name=vbl-100-101&gt;Lieberman 2003: 100–101&lt;/ref&gt; At any rate, the Kyaukse agricultural basin's development in the 10th and 11th centuries enabled the kingdom of Pagan to expand beyond the dry zone of Upper Burma, and to dominate its periphery, including the maritime Lower Burma.&lt;ref name=vbl-95-97&gt;Lieberman 2003: 95–97&lt;/ref&gt;

As reconstructed by Michael Aung-Thwin, G.H. Luce and [[Than Tun]], the main driver for this agriculture-based economic expansion was the practice of donating tax-free lands to the Buddhist clergy. For some two hundred years between 1050 and 1250, wealthy and powerful segments of the Pagan society—members of the royalty, senior court officials, and wealthy laymen—donated to the clergy enormous acreages of agricultural land, along with hereditary tied cultivators to attain religious merit. (Both religious lands and cultivators were permanently tax exempt.) Although it ultimately became a major burden on the economy, the practice initially helped expand the economy for some two centuries. First, the monastery-temple complexes, typically located some distances away from the capital, helped anchor new population centres for the throne. Such institutions in turn stimulated associated artisan, commercial, and agricultural activities critical to the general economy.&lt;ref name=vbl-95-97/&gt;

Secondly, the need to accumulate land for endowments, as well as for awards for soldiers and servicemen, drove the active development of new lands. The earliest irrigation projects focused on Kyaukse where Burmans built a large number of new weirs and diversionary canals, and Minbu a similarly well-watered district south of Pagan. After these hubs had been developed, in the mid-to-late 12th century, Pagan moved into as yet undeveloped frontier areas west of the Irrawaddy and south of Minbu. These new lands included both irrigable wet-rice areas and non-irrigable areas suitable for rain-fed rice, pulses, sesame, and millet. Agricultural expansion and temple construction in turn sustained a market in land and certain types of labour and materials. Land reclamation, religious donations, and building projects expanded slowly before 1050, increased to 1100, accelerated sharply with the opening of new lands between c. 1140 and c. 1210 and continued at a lower level from 1220 to 1300.&lt;ref name=vbl-95-97/&gt;

By the second half the 13th century, Pagan had developed an enormous amount of cultivated lands. Estimates based on surviving inscriptions alone range from 200,000 to 250,000 hectares. (In comparison, Pagan's contemporary [[Khmer Empire|Angkor]] relied on its main rice basin of over 13,000 hectares.) But donations to the sangha over the 250 years of the empire accumulated to over 150,000 hectares (over 60%) of the total cultivated land.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-190&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 190&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the practice proved unsustainable when the empire had stopped growing physically, and a major factor in the empire's downfall.

===Trade===
[[File:Ruins of Bagan, 1999.jpg|thumb|Ruins of Pagan]]

Internal and external trade played an important but minor role in Pagan's economy. Trade was not the main engine of economic growth for much of the Pagan period although its share of the economy probably increased in the 13th century when the agricultural sector stopped growing. That is not to say that Pagan did not have any interest in trade. On the contrary, Pagan closely administered its peninsular ports, which were transit points between the Indian Ocean and China. Maritime trade provided the court with revenues and prestige goods (coral, pearls, textiles). Evidence shows that Pagan imported silver from Yunnan, and that traded upland forest products, gems and perhaps metals with the coast. Still, no archaeological, textual or inscriptional evidence to indicate that such exports supported large numbers of producers or middlemen in Upper Burma itself, or that trade constituted a large part of the economy.&lt;ref name=vbl-94-95&gt;Lieberman 2003: 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

===Currency===
For all the innovations that Pagan Dynasty introduced, one area that it regressed was the use of coinage. The Pyu practice of issuing gold and silver coinage was not retained.&lt;ref name=mha-57&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 57&lt;/ref&gt; The common medium of exchange was lump silver "coinage", followed by gold and copper lump coinage. Silver came from domestic mines as well as Yunnan.&lt;ref name=vbl-95-97/&gt; The base unit of currency of the silver ''kyat'' ({{my|ကျပ်}}), which was not a unit of value but rather a unit of weight at approximately 16.3293 grams. Other weight-based units in relation to the ''kyat'' were also in use.&lt;ref name=tt-182-183&gt;Than Tun 1964: 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''kyat'', unless specified, always meant a silver ''kyat''. Other metals were also in use. The value of other metal currencies vis-a-vis the silver kyat are shown below.&lt;ref name=mha-57/&gt;&lt;ref name=tt-182-183/&gt;

The lack of standardised coinage certainly complicated commerce. For instance, many types of silver ''kyats'' with varying degrees of purity were in use. Records show that people also used a system of barter to conduct commerce.&lt;ref name=mha-57/&gt;

===Prices===

Surviving records provide a glimpse of the kingdom's economic life. A ''pe'' ({{my|ပယ်}}, 0.71 hectare) of fertile land near Pagan cost 20 silver ''kyats'' but only 1 to 10 ''kyats'' away from the capital. Construction of a large temple in the reign of Sithu II cost 44,027 ''kyats'' while a large "Indian style" monastery cost 30,600 ''kyats''.&lt;ref name=mha-57/&gt; Manuscripts were rare and extremely costly. In 1273, a complete set of the ''[[Tripiṭaka]]'' cost 3000 ''kyats''.&lt;ref name=vbl-118&gt;Lieberman 2003: 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and society==

===Demography===
[[File:Bagan era painting of Thingyan.jpg|thumb|''[[Thingyan]]'' New Year's festivities]]

====Size of population====
Various estimates put the population of Pagan Empire as anywhere between one and two and a half million&lt;ref name=mat-1985-95-96&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; but most estimates put it between one and a half and two million at its height.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-71&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 71&lt;/ref&gt; The number would be closer to the upper end, assuming that the population of pre-colonial Burma remained fairly constant. (The size of population in medieval times tended to stay flat over the course of many centuries. England's population between the 11th and 16th centuries remained at around 2.25 million, and China's population until the 17th century remained between 60 and 100 million for 13 centuries.)&lt;ref name=mat-1985-95-96/&gt; Pagan was the most populous city with an estimated population of 200,000 prior to the Mongol invasions.&lt;ref name=hk-ab-115&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 115&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethnic groups====
The kingdom was an "ethnic mosaic". In the late 11th century, ethnic Burmans were still "a privileged but numerically limited population", heavily concentrated in the interior dry zone of Upper Burma. They co-existed with Pyus, who dominated the dry zone, until the latter came to identify themselves as Burmans by the early 13th century. Inscriptions also mention a variety of ethnic groups in and around Upper Burma: [[Mon people|Mons]], Thets, Kadus, Sgaws, Kanyans, [[Palaung people|Palaungs]], [[Wa people|Was]] and [[Shan people|Shans]]. The peoples who lived in the highland perimeter were collectively classified as "hill peoples" (''taungthus'', {{my|တောင်သူ}}) although Shan migrants were changing the ethnic makeup of the hill region. In the south, Mons were dominant in Lower Burma by the 13th century, if not earlier.&lt;ref name=vbl-114-115&gt;Lieberman 2003: 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; In the west, an Arakanese ruling class who spoke Burmese emerged.&lt;ref name=tmu-72-73&gt;Myint-U 2006: 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

To be sure, the notion of ethnicity in pre-colonial Burma was highly fluid, heavily influenced by language, culture, class, locale, and indeed political power. People changed their in-group identification, depending on the social context. The success and longevity of the Pagan Empire sustained the spread of Burman ethnicity and culture in Upper Burma in a process that came to be called ''Burmanization'', which Lieberman describes as "assimilation by bi-lingual peoples, eager to identify with the imperial elite". According to Lieberman, Pagan's imperial power enabled the "construction of Burman [[cultural hegemony]]", evidenced by "the growth of Burmese writing, the concomitant decline in Pyu (and perhaps Mon) culture, new trends in art and architecture, and the expansion of Burmese-speaking cultivators into new lands".&lt;ref name=vbl-114-115/&gt;

Nonetheless, by the end of Pagan period, the process of Burmanization, which would continue into the 19th century, and eventually blanket the entire lowlands, was still in an early stage. The first extant Burmese language reference to "Burmans" appeared only in 1190, and the first reference to Upper Burma as "the land of the Burmans" (''Myanma pyay'') in 1235.&lt;ref name=vbl-114-115/&gt; The notion of ethnicity continued to be highly fluid, and closely tied to political power. While the rise of [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] ensured the continued spread of Burman ethnicity in post-Pagan Upper Burma, the similar emergence of non-Burmese speaking kingdoms elsewhere helped develop ethnic consciousness closely tied to respective ruling classes in Lower Burma, Shan states and Arakan. For example, according to Lieberman and Aung-Thwin, "the very notion of Mons as a coherent ethnicity may have emerged only in the 14th and 15th centuries after the collapse of Upper Burman hegemony".&lt;ref name=vbl-130-131&gt;Lieberman 2003: 130–131&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social classes====
Pagan's society was highly stratified among different social classes. At the top of the pyramid were the royalty (immediate royal family), followed by the upper officialdom (the extended royal family and the court), lower officialdom, artisans and crown service groups, and the commoners. The Buddhist clergy was not a class in the secular society but nonetheless represented an important social class.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-71-73&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 71–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the people belonged to one of four broad groups of commoners. First, royal servicemen were bondsmen (''kyundaw'', {{my|ကျွန်တော်}}) of the king, and were often assigned to individual headmen and officials who acted as the king's representatives. They received land grants from the crown, and were exempt from most personal taxes in exchange for regular or military service. Second, ''Athi'' ({{my|အသည်}}) commoners lived not on royal land but on communally-held land, and owed no regular royal service but paid substantial head taxes. Private bondsmen (''kyun'', {{my|ကျွန်}}) owed labour only to their individual patron, and lay outside the system of royal obligation. Finally, religious bondsmen (''hpaya-kyun'', {{my|ဘုရားကျွန်}}) were also private bondsmen who owed labour only to monasteries and temples but not to the crown.&lt;ref name=vbl-113&gt;Lieberman 2003: 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the three bonded (non-''athi'') classes, royal bondsmen and religious bondsmen were hereditary while private bondsmen were not. A private bondsman's servitude to his patron stood until his debt was fully repaid. A bondman's obligations ceased with death, and could not be perpetuated down to his descendants. On the other hand, royal servicemen (''kyundaw'') were hereditary, and were exempt from personal taxes in exchange for royal service. Similarly, religious servicemen (''hpaya-kyun'') were hereditary, and were exempt from personal taxes and royal service in exchange for maintaining the affairs of monasteries and temples. Unlike royal servicemen or even ''athi'' commoners, the religious bondsmen could not be conscripted into military service.&lt;ref name=mat-1985-81-91&gt;Aung-Thwin 1985: 81–91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Languages====
The primary language of the ruling class of Pagan was [[Burmese language|Burmese]], a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]] related to both the [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu language]] and the language of the ruling class of Nanzhao. But the spread of the language to the masses lagged the founding of the Pagan Empire by 75 to 150 years. In the early Pagan era, both Pyu and Mon were lingua francas of the Irrawaddy valley. Pyu was the dominant language of Upper Burma while Mon was sufficiently prestigious for Pagan rulers to employ the language frequently for inscriptions and perhaps court usages.&lt;ref name=vbl-133-134&gt;Lieberman 2003: 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptional evidence indicates that Burmese became the [[lingua franca]] of the kingdom only in the early 12th century, and perhaps the late 12th century when the use of Pyu and Mon in official usage declined. Mon continued to flourish in Lower Burma but Pyu as a language had died out by the early 13th century.&lt;ref name=mha-51-52&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-114-115/&gt;

Another important development in Burmese history and Burmese language was the rise of [[Pali]], the [[liturgical language]] of [[Theravada Buddhism]]. The use of Sanskrit, which had been prevalent in the Pyu realm and in the early Pagan era, declined after Anawrahta's conversion to Theravada Buddhism.&lt;ref name=geh-29&gt;Harvey 1925: 29&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scripts====
[[File:Burmese alphabet.svg|thumb|150px|Modern [[Burmese alphabet]]. The Old Burmese script did not have cursive features, which are hallmarks of the modern script.]]
The spread of Burmese language was accompanied by that of the [[Burmese script]]. The script was developed from either the [[Mon script]] or the [[Pyu script]]. Mainstream scholarship holds that the Burmese script was developed from the Mon script in 1058, a year after Anawrahta's conquest of the Thaton Kingdom.&lt;ref name=geh-307&gt;Harvey 1925: 307&lt;/ref&gt; But recent research by Aung-Thwin argues that the Burmese script may instead have been derived from the Pyu script in the 10th century, and that the Burmese script was the parent of the ''Burma Mon'' script. He argues that the Mon script found in Burma was sufficiently different from the older Mon script found in the Mon homelands of [[Dvaravati]] or [[Hariphunchai|Haripunjaya]] (in present-day Thailand) with no archaeological evidence to prove any linkage between the two. On the other hand, Aung-Thwin continues, the latest archaeological evidence dates the Burmese script 58 to 109 years ahead of the Burma Mon script. The earliest ''Burma Mon'' script (at Prome) is dated to 1093 while the earliest Burmese script (the copper-gilt umbrella inscription of the Mahabodhi Temple) is dated to 1035. Indeed, if a ''recast'' 18th century copy of an original stone inscription is permissible as evidence, the Burmese script had already been in use at least since 984 CE.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-167-178-197-200&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 167–178, 197–200&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literature====
[[File:Bagan-Frescos-2.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Frescoes of Buddhist Jataka stories at a Pagan temple]]
Whatever the origin of the Burmese script may be, writing in Burmese was still a novelty in the 11th century. The Burmese script became dominant in court only in the 12th century. For much of the Pagan period, written materials needed to produce large numbers of literate monks and students in the villages simply did not exist. According to [[Than Tun]], even in the 13th century, "the art of writing was then still in its infancy with the Burmans". Manuscripts were rare and extremely costly. As late as 1273, a complete set of the ''[[Tripiṭaka]]'' cost 3000 ''kyats'' of silver, which could buy over 2000 hectares of paddy fields. Literacy in Burmese, not to mention Pali, was the effective monopoly of the aristocracy and their monastic peers.&lt;ref name=vbl-118&gt;Lieberman 2003: 118&lt;/ref&gt;

At Pagan and at main provincial centres, Buddhist temples supported an increasingly sophisticated Pali scholarship, which specialised in grammar and philosophical-psychological (''[[abhidhamma]]'') studies, and which reportedly won the admiration of Sinhalese experts. Besides religious texts, Pagan's monks read works in a variety of languages on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], [[phonology]], grammar, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and medicine, and developed an independent school of legal studies. Most students, and probably the leading monks and nuns, came from aristocratic families.&lt;ref name=vbl-115-116&gt;Lieberman 2003: 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; At any rate, local illiteracy probably prevented the sort of detailed village censuses and legal rulings that became a hallmark of post-1550 [[Toungoo Dynasty|Toungoo administration]].&lt;ref name=vbl-118/&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Nat-Hlaung Kyaung Vishnu Statute.JPG|thumb|150px|Statute of Vishnu at the Nat-Hlaung Kyaung Temple]]
The religion of Pagan was fluid, syncretic and by later standards, unorthodox—largely a continuation of religious trends in the Pyu era where [[Theravada Buddhism]] co-existed with [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Tantric Buddhism]], various Hindu ([[Shaivism|Saivite]], and [[Vaishnavism|Vaishana]]) schools as well as native animist (''[[nat (spirit)|nat]]'') traditions. While the royal patronage of Theravada Buddhism since the mid-11th century had enabled the Buddhist school to gradually gain primacy, and produce over 10,000 temples in Pagan alone in its honour, other traditions continued to thrive throughout the Pagan period to degrees later unseen. While several Mahayana, Tantric, Hindu and animist elements have remained in Burmese Buddhism to the present day, in the Pagan era, however, "Tantric, Saivite, and Vaishana elements enjoyed greater elite influence than they would later do, reflecting both the immaturity of Burmese literary culture and its indiscriminate receptivity to non-Burman traditions". In this period, "heretical" did not mean non-Buddhist, merely unfaithful to one's own scriptures, whether Brahmanic, Buddhist or whatever.&lt;ref name=vbl-115-116/&gt;

One of the most enduring developments     in Burmese history was the gradual emergence of Theravada Buddhism as the primary faith of the Pagan Empire. A key turning point came circa 1056 when the Buddhist school won the royal patronage of an ascendant empire with Anawrahta's conversion from his native Tantric Buddhism. According to mainstream scholarship, Anawrahta proceeded to revitalise Theravada Buddhism in Upper Burma with help from the conquered [[Thaton Kingdom|kingdom of Thaton]] in 1057 in Lower Burma. More recently, however, Aung-Thwin has argued forcefully that Anawrahta's conquest of Thaton is a post-Pagan legend without contemporary evidence, that Lower Burma in fact lacked a substantial independent polity prior to Pagan's expansion, and that the Mon influence on the interior is greatly exaggerated. Instead, he argues that it is more likely that Burmans borrowed Theravada Buddhism from their neighbour Pyus, or directly from India.&lt;ref name=vbl-90-91/&gt; The Theravada school prevalent in the early and mid Pagan periods, like in the Pyu realm, was probably derived from the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] region in southeast India, associated with the famous Theravada Buddhist scholar, [[Buddhaghosa]].&lt;ref name=mat-31-34&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 31–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mha-15-17&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; It was the predominant Theravada school in Burma until the late 12th century when [[Shin Uttarajiva]] led the realignment with Ceylon's [[Mahavihara]] school.&lt;ref name=geh-55-56&gt;Harvey 1925: 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

To be sure, the Theravada Buddhist scene of the Pagan era had little semblance to those of Toungoo and Konbaung periods. Much of the institutional mechanisms prevalent in later centuries simply did not yet exist. For instance, in the 19th century, a network of Theravada monasteries in every village used Burmese-language manuscripts to provide youths from diverse backgrounds with basic Buddhist literacy. This was a reciprocal exchange: monks relied on villagers for their daily food, while villagers depended on monks for schooling, sermons, and an opportunity to gain merit by giving alms and inducting their young men into the community of monks, the ''sangha''. Such arrangements produced a male literacy rates of over 50 percent, and remarkable levels of textual Buddhist knowledge on the village level. But in the Pagan era, key 19th century elements were not yet in place. No village-level network of monasteries or meaningful interdependence between the monks and villagers existed. The monks relied on the royal donations, and those from major sects, which had vast landed holdings, did not have to rely on daily alms, inhibiting close interaction with villagers. The low levels of interaction in turn retarded literacy in Burmese, and limited most commoners' understanding of Buddhism to non-textual means: paintings at the great temples, pageants, folkloric versions of the ''Jataka'' stories of the Buddha's life, etc. Most commoners retained the worship of ''nat'' spirits and other beliefs.&lt;ref name=vbl-117-118&gt;Lieberman 2003: 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other traditions====
[[File:Mt Popa.jpg|thumb|Mt. Popa, home of the pantheon of ''[[nat (spirit)|nats]]'']]
Other traditions also continued to thrive not only at the village level but also at the nominally Theravadin court. One powerful group was the Forest Dweller or ''[[Ari Buddhism|Ari]]'' monks, who enjoyed wide influence at the Pagan court. Contemporary inscriptions show that the Aris ate evening meals, and presided over public ceremonies where they drank liquor and where cattle and other animals were sacrificed—activities considered scandalous by Burmese Buddhist norms of the 18th and 19th centuries. Aris reportedly also enjoyed a form of ''[[ius primae noctis]]'', at least prior to Anawrahta. (Though Anawrahta is said to have driven out the Aris from his court, they were certainly back at the court by the late Pagan period, and continued to be a presence at the later Burmese courts down to the Ava period.) Ari Buddhism itself was a mix of Tantric Buddhism and local traditions. For example, ceremonial animal slaughter and alcohol consumption long antedated the Burmans' arrival, and continued in remote parts of mainland and maritime Southeast Asia until recent times.&lt;ref name=vbl-115-116/&gt;

The state also accommodated the powerful animist traditions, as shown in the official spirit (''nat'') propitiation ceremonies, and in the court's sponsorship of an elaborate ''nat'' pantheon that sought to assimilate local deities and persons of prowess to a more unified cultus. The Burmans may have derived the concept of an official pantheon from Mon tradition. Likewise, the early Pagan court worshiped snakes (''nagas'') venerated in pre-Buddhist times.&lt;ref name=vbl-115-116/&gt; To judge by 14th-century patterns, sacrifices to nat spirits mediated by shamans, were still a central village ritual. As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, homosexuals or transvestites (who already inhabited two "incompatible" realms) as well as women who provided a shamanic bridge from the human world to that of the spirits.&lt;ref name=vbl-117-118/&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Mandalay Fort Wall.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Design of 19th century [[Mandalay Palace]] followed its Pagan era predecessors]]

Pagan is well known today for its architecture, and over 2000 remaining temples that dot the Pagan plains today. Other, non-religious aspects of Pagan architecture were equally important to later Burmese states.

====Irrigation and city planning====
Burman immigrants are believed to have either introduced new water management techniques or greatly enhanced existing Pyu system of weirs, dams, sluices, and diversionary barricades. The techniques of building dams, canals and weirs found in pre-colonial Upper Burma trace their origins to the Pyu era and the Pagan era.&lt;ref name=vbl-100-101/&gt;&lt;ref name=mat-2005-26-31&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 26–31&lt;/ref&gt; Pagan's several water management projects in the dry zone provided Upper Burma with an enduring economic base to dominate the rest of the country.

In the areas of city planning and temple design, Pagan architecture borrowed heavily from existing Pyu architectural practices, which in turn were based on various Indian styles. Pagan-era city planning largely followed Pyu patterns, the most notable being the use of 12 gates, for each of the signs of the zodiac.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-26-31/&gt;

====Stupas====
Pagan stands out not only for the sheer number of religious edifices but also for the magnificent architecture of the buildings, and their contribution to Burmese temple design. The Pagan temple falls into one of two broad categories: the ''[[stupa]]''-style solid temple and the ''gu''-style ({{my|ဂူ}}) hollow temple.

A ''stupa'', also called a pagoda, is a massive structure, typically with a relic chamber inside. The Pagan ''stupas'' or pagodas evolved from earlier Pyu designs, which in turn were based on the ''stupa'' designs of the Andhra region, particularly [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] and [[Nagarjunakonda]] in present-day southeastern India, and to a smaller extent to [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref name=mat-2005-26-31/&gt; The Pagan-era stupas in turn were the prototypes for later Burmese stupas in terms of symbolism, form and design, building techniques and even materials.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-233-235&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 233–235&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, an Indian/Ceylonese ''stupa'' had a hemispheric body ({{lang-pi|anda|script=Latn}}, "the egg") on which a rectangular box surrounded by a stone [[balustrade]] (''harmika'') was set. Extending up from the top of the ''stupa'' was a shaft supporting several ceremonial umbrellas. The ''stupa'' is a representation of the [[Buddhist cosmology|Buddhist cosmos]]: its shape symbolises [[Mount Meru]] while the umbrella mounted on the brickwork represents the world's axis.&lt;ref name=hk-ab-118-120&gt;Köllner, Bruns 1998: 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Indic design was gradually modified first by the [[Pyu people|Pyu]], and then by Burmans at Pagan where the ''stupa'' gradually developed a longer, cylindrical form. The earliest Pagan ''stupas'' such as the Bupaya (c. 9th century) were the direct descendants of the Pyu style at [[Sri Ksetra]]. By the 11th century, the ''stupa'' had developed into a more bell-shaped form in which the parasols morphed into a series of increasingly smaller rings placed on one top of the other, rising to a point. On top the rings, the new design replaced the ''harmika'' with a lotus bud. The lotus bud design then evolved into the "banana bud", which forms the extended apex of most Burmese pagodas. Three or four rectangular terraces served as the base for a pagoda, often with a gallery of terra-cotta tiles depicting Buddhist ''[[jataka]]'' stories. The [[Shwezigon Pagoda]] and the [[Shwesandaw Pagoda (Bagan)|Shwesandaw Pagoda]] are the earliest examples of this type.&lt;ref name=hk-ab-118-120/&gt; Examples of the trend toward a more bell-shaped design gradually gained primacy as seen in the [[Dhammayazika Pagoda]] (late 12th century) and the [[Mingalazedi Pagoda]] (late 13th century).&lt;ref name=mat-2005-210-213&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 210–213&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hollow temples====
{{double image|right|Gawdawpalin Temple Bagan Myanmar.jpg|120|Dhammayangyi Paya, Bagan, Myanmar.jpg|120|"One-face"-style [[Gawdawpalin Temple]] (left) and "four-face" [[Dhammayangyi Temple]]}}

In contrast to the ''stupas'', the hollow ''gu''-style temple is a structure used for meditation, devotional worship of the Buddha and other Buddhist rituals. The ''gu'' temples come in two basic styles: "one-face" design and "four-face" design—essentially one main entrance and four main entrances. Other styles such as five-face and hybrids also exist. The one-face style grew out of 2nd century [[Beikthano]], and the four-face out of 7th-century Sri Ksetra. The temples, whose main features were the pointed arches and the vaulted chamber, became larger and grander in the Pagan period.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-224-225&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 224–225&lt;/ref&gt;

====Innovations====
Although the Burmese temple designs evolved from Indic, Pyu (and possibly Mon) styles, the techniques of vaulting seem to have developed in Pagan itself. The earliest vaulted temples in Pagan date to the 11th century while the vaulting did not become widespread in India until the late 12th century. The masonry of the buildings shows "an astonishing degree of perfection", where many of the immense structures survived the [[1975 Bagan earthquake|1975 earthquake]] more or less intact.&lt;ref name=hk-ab-118-120/&gt; (Unfortunately, the vaulting techniques of the Pagan era were lost in the later periods. Only much smaller ''gu'' style temples were built after Pagan. In the 18th century, for example, King [[Bodawpaya]] attempted to build the [[Mingun Pagoda]], in the form of spacious vaulted chambered temple but failed as craftsmen and masons of the later era had lost the knowledge of vaulting and keystone arching to reproduce the spacious interior space of the Pagan hollow temples.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-233-235/&gt;)

Another architectural innovation originated in Pagan is the Buddhist temple with a pentagonal floor plan. This design grew out of hybrid (between one-face and four-face designs) designs. The idea was to include the veneration of the [[Maitreya Buddha]], the future and fifth Buddha of this era, in addition to the four who had already appeared. The Dhammayazika and the [[Ngamyethna Pagoda]] are examples of the pentagonal design.&lt;ref name=hk-ab-118-120/&gt;

==Legacy==
The kingdom of Pagan, the "charter polity"&lt;ref name=vbl-88&gt;Lieberman 2003: 88&lt;/ref&gt; of Burma, had a lasting impact on Burmese history and the history of mainland Southeast Asia. The success and longevity of Pagan's dominance over the Irrawaddy valley enabled the ascent of Burmese language and culture, and the spread of Burman ethnicity in Upper Burma and laid the foundation for their continued spread elsewhere in later centuries. The 250-year rule left a proven system of administrative and cultural norms that would be adopted and extended by successor kingdoms—not only by the Burmese-speaking Ava Kingdom but also by the Mon-speaking Hanthawaddy Kingdom and Shan-speaking Shan states.&lt;ref name=vbl-131-139&gt;Lieberman 2003: 131–139&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued cultural integration in an otherwise politically fragmented post-Pagan Burma set the stage for a resurgence of a unified Burmese state in the 16th century. An apt comparison can be made with the Khmer Empire, the other Southeast Asian Empire that Mongol invasions toppled. Various Tai-Shan peoples, who came down with the Mongols, came to dominate the political landscapes of the two former empires. Whereas Burma would see a resurgence, the post-Mongol Khmer state was reduced to a mere shadow of her former self, never to regain her preeminence.&lt;ref name=mha-82-83&gt;Htin Aung 1967: 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the former Khmer Empire, did the Thai/Lao ethnicity and Thai/Lao languages spread permanently at the expense of the Mon-Khmer speaking peoples, not unlike the Burman takeover of the Pyu realm four centuries earlier.&lt;ref name=vbl-122-123&gt;Lieberman 2003: 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; In Burma, the result was the opposite: the Shan leadership, as well as lowland Shan immigrants of Myinsaing, Pinya, Sagaing and Ava Kingdoms came to adopt Burmese cultural norms, the Burmese language, and the Burman ethnicity.&lt;ref name=dgeh-30-31&gt;Hall 1960: 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vbl-188&gt;Lieberman 2003: 188&lt;/ref&gt; The convergence of cultural norms around existing Pagan-centered norms, at least in the Irrawaddy valley core, in turn facilitated the latter-day political reunification drives of [[Toungoo Dynasty|Toungoo]] and [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]] dynasties.

The Pagan Empire also changed the history of mainland Southeast Asia. Geopolitically, Pagan checked the Khmer Empire's encroachment into the Tenasserim coast and upper Menam valley. Culturally, the emergence of Pagan as a Theravada stronghold in the face of an expanding Hindu Khmer Empire from the 11th to 13th centuries provided the Buddhist school, which had been in retreat elsewhere in South Asia and Southeast Asia, a much needed reprieve and a safe shelter.&lt;ref name=mcr-43-45&gt;Ricklefs et al 2010: 43–45&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did Pagan help restart Theravada Buddhism in Ceylon but the over two centuries of patronage by a powerful empire made Theravada Buddhism's later growth in [[Lan Na]] (northern Thailand), [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Siam]] (central Thailand), [[Lan Xang]] (Laos), and Khmer Empire (Cambodia) in the 13th and 14th centuries possible.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Ricklefs et al 2010: 45–48): The spread of Theravada Buddhism in Siam, Lan Xang and Cambodia was also aided by the interaction with Ceylon. However, the Ceylonese interaction was possible only because the Theravada monk order was restarted in 1071–1072 by the monks from Pagan per (Harvey 1925: 32–33) and (Htin Aung 1967: 35).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3951">The terms '''People of the [[Caucasus]]''' and '''[[People of the Caucasus|Caucasian people]]''' indicate two main groups of people in [[Iran]]:

*[[Muhajir (Caucasus)|Immigrants]] from the [[South Caucasus]] and [[North Caucasus]] mainly due to policies of the [[Safavids]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]] and to another significant extent due to the results of the 19th century [[Russo-Persian Wars]] and the [[Caucasian War]]:
**[[Circassians]] (including the [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]], [[Kabardins|Kabarday]], [[Abazins]], and [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]]): Following the end of the Circassian insurgency in 1864 which triggered [[Muhajir (Caucasus)|an exodus]] from North Caucasia, Circassian people had settled in small amounts in the territory of Iran. The Circassian population in Iran however for the vast majority stems from the [[Safavids|Safavid]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] era. See also; [[Circassians in Iran]]
**[[Dagestan]]i people. Amongst them the [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Laks]] are the most well known.&lt;ref&gt;А. Г. Булатова. Лакцы (XIX — нач. XX вв.). Историко-этнографические очерки. — Махачкала, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Autochthonous people of [[Transcaucasia]]:
**speaking [[South Caucasian languages]]:
***[[Georgians]] ([[Iranian Georgians]]): Christian Georgians were settled en masse in Iran's heartlands during the Safavid and Qajar era when the former ruled the [[Caucasus]] as part of its territories. Hundreds of thousands of Georgians were relocated by the Safavids starting from Shah [[Tahmasp I]] and most notably by shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] to various parts of Iran, including Isfahan, Mazandaran, and [[Gilan]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthee, Rudolph P. (1999), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5U0yECMV--wC The Politics of Trade in Safavid Iran: Silk for Silver, 1600-1730].&lt;/ref&gt; A certain amount also migrated as [[Ethnic cleansing of the Circassians|muhajirs]] in the 19th century to Iran, following the Russian conquest of the [[Caucasus]]. This policy continued till the Qajar era, when Iran eventually lost its Caucasian territories to Russia in the course of the 19th century. (see [[Russo-Persian Wars]]) Nowadays all Iranian Georgians are reported to be Shia Muslims.&lt;ref name="Rezvani"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rezvani|first=Babak|title=The Fereydani Georgian Representation|journal=Anthropology of the Middle East|date=Winter 2009|volume=4|issue=2|pages=52–74|doi=10.3167/ame.2009.040205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgians played a crucial role in developing Iran's industrial economy, strengthening its military, and populating newly built towns in various places in Iran.
**[[Armenians]] ([[Iranian Armenians]])
**[[Azerbaijanis]] ([[Iranian Azerbaijanis]])

== Caucasian refugees ==
[[Iran]] and the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Empire fought 5 wars [[Russo-Persian Wars|between the mid-17th century and 1828]] (if not including the [[Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran]]). Iran eventually lost vast and often solidly Persian-speaking and Muslim territories spanning from [[Dagestan]] in the [[North Caucasus]] to what is today [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]] to the Russians per the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]]. The Russians killed many inhabitants of these Iranian ruled lands, and expelled the rest to Iran, or to a certain extent, Turkey.

'''Persian Sign Language''' is the sign language used by [[Deaf]] and [[hard-of-hearing]] people in [[Iran]].  It is a true sign language, unlike the [[Jabbar Baghtcheban|Baghcheban]] phonetic hand alphabet, which is a form of [[cued speech]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3547">The '''Phylax Society''' was a prototypical dog club pre-dating the [[German Shepherd Dog]], formed with the intention of creating a standardized [[Germany|German]] [[dog breed]].

== Establishment ==

Throughout [[Europe]], unofficial groups had been operating to [[Selective breeding|selectively breed]] dogs with profound qualities. While distinct breeds were being established they often differed dramatically, both in appearance and utility, across localities. As a result, in 1891 the Phylax Society (Phylax being [[Greek language|Greek]] for "guardsman") was formed with the intention of creating a standardised German dog breed by hand-picking, from sheep dogs belonging to local German shepherds, those that displayed superior qualities than those of other dogs.&lt;ref name="gsdcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanshepherds.com/thegsd/history/|title=History of the German Shepherd Dog|publisher=German Shepherds.com|accessdate=2008-08-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080601121843/http://www.germanshepherds.com/thegsd/history/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disestablishment ==

The official existence of the Phylax Society was short lived. Early in the group's history there was constant bickering regarding the desired traits of what would become the German Shepherd Dog. Some of the members felt aesthetics were not important in a dog breed, instead desiring that the dog be useful as a working breed, rather than having a pleasing look. Other members preferred that the dog be bred more for beauty with less of a focus on having a working breed. This argument was never settled and after numerous attempts to breed the German Shepherd dog failed by producing dogs with little to no utility, many of the members left; resulting in the Phylax Society disbanding in 1894, only four years after its establishment.&lt;ref name="gsdcom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oscar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscarthegsd.com/about_gsd.htm|title=About German Shepherds|publisher=|accessdate=2008-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915101531/http://www.oscarthegsd.com/about_gsd.htm|archivedate=2008-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="breeders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.german-shepherds-breeders.com/german-shepherds-breeders-general-information.htm|title=German Shepherds - Breeders - General Information|accessdate=2008-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204104809/http://www.german-shepherds-breeders.com/german-shepherds-breeders-general-information.htm|archivedate=2008-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="training-rice"&gt;{{cite book | title = Training Your German Shepherd Dog | last = Rice | first = Dan | isbn = 0-7641-0852-2 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Phylax Society ==

Although the Phylax Society had disbanded, many former members continued in attempts to breed a dog with superior qualities. It was due to the original formation of the Phylax Society that [[Max von Stephanitz]] was inspired to form the [[Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde]] (Society for the German Shepherd Dog) in 1899, which ultimately lead to the creation of the modern German Shepherd Dog breed.&lt;ref name="gsdcom" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4514">The '''''Quilligan Scholars''''' award, named after one of the founding fathers of [[Perinatology|Maternal-Fetal Medicine]], Dr. Edward J. Quilligan, is a prestigious title in the field of Maternal-Fetal Medicine granted by the [[Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine]] and The Pregnancy Foundation to a select group of promising residents &lt;ref name="pregnancyfoundation1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnancyfoundation.org/Programs/Quilligan-Scholars |title=Quilligan Scholars |publisher=The Pregnancy Foundation |date=2016-02-19 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Obstetrics and gynaecology]] who exhibit unparallaled potential to become future leaders &lt;ref name="pregnancyfoundation1"/&gt; in the field of [[Perinatology]].

==Purpose==
The purpose of the Quilligan Scholars Program is to identify future leaders in [[Perinatology]] early in their training and to offer them recognition, guidance, and educational opportunities to foster their careers. These individuals traditionally  exhibit leadership, commitment, and interest in teaching, research, or public policy. Some of the activities provided by the program include paid attendance to the [[Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine|SMFM]] annual meeting, the provision of special courses and experiences, and the granting of personal mentorship from current leaders in the field of [[Maternal-fetal medicine|Maternal-fetal Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://old.smfm.org/attachedfiles/SpecialDeliveryv4.5dr.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204075317/https://old.smfm.org/attachedfiles/SpecialDeliveryv4.5dr.pdf |archivedate=February 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The year 2013 marked the 40th anniversary of the formal establishment of [[Maternal-fetal medicine]] as a specialty, as 16 pioneers took the [[Maternal-fetal medicine|MFM]] boards for the first time in 1973. Amongst that group of pioneers was Dr. Edward J. Quilligan, who has gone on to dedicate decades of service to the advancement of women's health, through teaching, research, and leadership. To honour his legacy and his exemplary service to modern [[Obstetrics]], the [[Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine]] and The Pregnancy Foundation created the Quilligan Scholars program, and the first class of 5 recipients was inaugurated in 2014 at the [[Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine]] annual meeting in [[New Orleans, LA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smfm.org |title=The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine &amp;#124; SMFM.org - The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine |publisher=SMFM.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Quilligan Scholar title confers no monetary reward, the sponsored activities are covered by gracious donations from members of the medical community. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine has agreed to give matching funds to the amount raised by The Pregnancy Foundation up to $125,000 per year for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.smfm.org/media/51/March_2014_SD_v.1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Special Delivery |volume=7 |website=S3.amazonaws.com |accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scouting for Food''' is an ongoing annual program of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], begun in 1985 by the [[Greater Saint Louis Area Council]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stlbsa.org/programs/sff/Pages/Scouting-for-Food.aspx STLBSA]&lt;/ref&gt;. The program involves collecting for local food banks. It is organized at the local level throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northjersey.com/community/announcements/121756903_Pack_45_collects_food_for_St__Mary_s_Church_pantry.html Pack 45 collects food for St. Mary's Church pantry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scouting for Food is a project rooted in the very foundation of the Scouting movement and its dedication to implement the [[Scout Slogan]] and do a good turn daily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longhorncouncil.org/uploads/df/df051deb-3750-4bdd-bf7d-b1839e60cf13.pdf SFF Background]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Each year, local Cub and Boy Scouts leave plastic bags for their neighbors soliciting canned food items. One week later, the Scouts return to pick up and deliver the bags of food to a local [[food bank]].
The donations will usually be delivered directly to the local food bank that day. The time of Collection is usually the Saturday before Thanksgiving.

Over the centuries, the song spread amongst the [[Bosniak]] populations in [[Podgorica]] and the [[Sandžak]] regions of [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8865">'''Sindhi names''' ({{lang-sd|سنڌي خانداني نالا}}) are given names and surnames used among [[Sindhis]] in [[Pakistan]], [[India]], and the [[Sindhi diaspora]].

== Naming convention ==
Most Sindhi family names are a modified form of a [[patronymic]] and typically end with the suffix -ani, which is used to denote descent from a common male ancestor. One explanation states that the -ani suffix is a [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] variant of 'anshi', derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word 'ansh', which means 'descended from'. The first part of a Sindhi surname is usually derived from the name or location of an ancestor. In northern Sindh, surnames ending in 'ja' (meaning 'of') are also common. A person's surname would consist of the name of his or her native village, followed by 'ja'. Sindhis generally add the suffix ‘ani’ to the name of a great grandfather and adopt the name as a family name.there many tribe belong to sindh like jokhio. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sindhishaan.com/article/history/hist_01_02c.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tarun-sakhrani/the-sindhis-of-sindh_b_8894284.html|title=The Sindhis of Sindh And Beyond|work=Huffington Post|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=9 August 2016|first=Tarun|last=Sakhrani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History Of Jokhio Tribe ==
The existence of [[Jokhio]] tribe witnessed in early 12th [[century]], but history revealed their powerful existence in 13th century when they become the major part of ruling struggle between then rulers [[King]] Dari vs. [[Kalhora]], later throughout the era of rule of Mirs (1800). The [[Jokhio]] tribe is one of original tribe of Sindh and exists through centuries. [[Jokhio]] tribe supposed to migrate from Hangore (Blochistan) to Sindh particularly in the vicinity of Shah Norani Toms towards north side). 800 years old historical “Chukhandi” [[graveyard]] of [[Jokhio]] tribe on national highway proved that this tribe is one oldest one in the [[province]] of Sindh after “Mirbahes”. Among the many converts to [[Mahomedanism]] is [[Sindh]] were the Semma, or Soomera family or tribe of [[Rajpoots]], whose princes are mentioned in the Introductory Sketch of the History of [[Sindh]]. They were Jams of Tattah, and reigned until deposed by the Mahomedans, having, during their incumbency, embraced Mahomedanism. This branch of the family remained in [[Sindh]], while the Hindoo branch is represented at present by the chiefs of Cutch, who bear the title of Jam. Of the Sindh Jams the head is (or was) Mihr Ali, an unquiet old man of seventy, who possess large estates in land, of which he has relinquished some portions paid from the treasury .The estate is badly managed and yields comparatively little revenue. The Jokhyas represented belong to the police, and are armed in the usual manner. It will be seen at a glance how widely their features differ from those of real Mahmedan tribes, how they utterly lack the comeliness and dignity of the Belochees. It is very probable that they intermarry in their own tribe exclusively, and thus the ancient Hindoo physiognomy, in this case a remarkably ugly type, has been preserved. [[Jokhio]] tribe always has played tremendous role in political, social and economical uplift of the area in the larger interest of local community. This effort kept up their separate identity of Jokhio tribe either at local, provincial or national level. This tribe always maintained their status of independent, loyalty and patriotism. This brave and enough [[populated]] [[tribe]] set some peaceful and positive examples. Since the independence of [[Pakistan]] many Governments sworn in but [[Jokhio]] [[tribe]] have uphold their standing of neutrality .these '''government''' either political or non-political due to their community strength always considered [[Jokhio]] [[tribe]] by them and listed in the tribes, who supported and worked for progress, prosperity, peace and security of Pakistan . COMMUNITY INFORMATION: Leading to 0.500 million Jokhio tribesman living throughout Sindh province. Out of them 0.25 million living in rural part of Karachi viz Malir and Karachi west. Also recognized and followed by other communities like Memon, Khaskhali, Sarhandi, Jamote and Mirbehar of Thatta, Malir, Gadap town Karachi .About0125 million peoples belongs to these communities reside in Malir district. There are about 370 plus villages of Jokhio tribesmen existing in the province. Out of them about 325 exist in district Thatta, Malir and Karachi west where 0.4 million population live.

'''Southern Min''', or '''Minnan''' ({{zh|s=闽南语|t=閩南語}}), literally "Southern Fujian" while "Min" is short for "Fujian" and "Nan" is "South", is a branch of [[Min Chinese]] spoken in certain parts of south and eastern [[China]] including [[Fujian]] (especially the [[Minnan region]]), most of [[Taiwan]] (used to be a part of Fujian), eastern [[Guangdong]], [[Hainan]], and southern [[Zhejiang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=CAI ZHU|first1=HUANG GUO|title=Chinese language|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Fujian Education Publishing House|location=Xiamen|isbn=7533469518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minnan dialects are also spoken by descendants of [[overseas Chinese|emigrants from these areas]] in [[diaspora]], most notably the [[Philippine Hokkien|Philippines]], [[Medan Hokkien|Indonesia]], [[Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien|Malaysia]], and [[Singaporean Hokkien|Singapore]]. It is the largest Min Chinese branch and the most widely distributed Min Chinese subgroup.

In common parlance and in the narrower sense, Southern Min refers to the Quanzhang or [[Hokkien|Hokkien-Taiwanese]] variety of Southern Min originating from Southern Fujian in Mainland China. It is spoken mainly in Fujian, Taiwan, as well as certain parts of Southeast Asia. The Quanzhang variety is often called simply "Minnan Proper" ({{zh|s=闽南语|t=閩南語}}). It is considered the de-facto mainstream form of Southern Min.

In the wider scope, Southern Min also includes other Min Chinese varieties that are linguistically related to Minnan proper (Quanzhang). Most variants of Southern Min have significant differences from the Quanzhang variety, some having limited [[mutual intelligibility]] with it, others almost none. [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Longyan Min|Longyan]], and [[Zhenan Min|Zhenan]] may be said to have limited mutual intelligibility with Minnan Proper, sharing similar phonology and vocabulary to a small extent. On the other hand, variants such as [[Datian Min|Datian]], [[Zhongshan Min|Zhongshan]], and [[Hainanese dialect|Qiong]]-[[Leizhou Min|Lei]] have historical linguistic roots with Minnan Proper, but are significantly divergent from it in terms of phonology and vocabulary, and thus have almost no mutual intelligibility with the Quanzhang variety. Linguists tend to classify them as separate Min languages.

Southern Min is not mutually intelligible with other branches of [[Min Chinese]] nor other [[varieties of Chinese]], such as [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]].

==Geographic distribution==
===China===
Southern Min dialects are spoken in [[Fujian]], three southeastern counties of [[Zhejiang]], the [[Zhoushan archipelago]] off [[Ningbo]] in [[Zhejiang]], and the [[Chaoshan]] (Teo-swa) region in [[Guangdong]]. The variant spoken in [[Leizhou]], Guangdong as well as [[Hainan]] is [[Hainanese]] and is not mutually intelligible with mainstream Southern Min or Teochew.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Hainanese is classified in some schemes as part of Southern Min and in other schemes as separate.{{such as?}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Puxian Min]] was originally based on the [[Quanzhou dialect]], but over time became heavily influenced by [[Eastern Min]], eventually losing intelligibility with Minnan.The Southern Min dialects spoken in Taiwan, collectively known as [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], Southern Min is a [[first language]] for most of the [[Hoklo people]], the main ethnicity of Taiwan. The correspondence between language and ethnicity is not absolute, as some Hoklo have very limited proficiency in Southern Min while some non-Hoklo speak Southern Min fluently.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Southeast Asia===
There are many Southern Min speakers among [[Overseas Chinese]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. Many ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrants to the region were [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] from southern Fujian and brought the language to what is now [[Burma]], [[Indonesia]] (the former [[Dutch East Indies]]) and present-day [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] (formerly [[British Malaya]] and the [[Straits Settlements]]). In general, Southern Min from southern Fujian is known as [[Hokkien]], Hokkienese, Fukien or Fookien in [[Southeast Asia]] and is mostly mutually intelligible with Hokkien spoken elsewhere. Many [[Southeast Asia]]n ethnic Chinese also originated in the [[Chaoshan]] region of [[Guangdong]] and speak [[Teochew language]], the variant of Southern Min from that region. [[Philippine Hokkien]] is reportedly the native language of up to 98.5% of the [[Chinese Filipino]] community in the [[Philippines]], among whom it is also known as Lan-nang or Lán-lâng-oē (咱儂話), literally "our people’s language". 

Southern Min speakers form the majority of Chinese in Singapore, with Hokkien being the largest group and the second largest being [[Teochew people|Teochew]]. Despite the similarities, the two groups are rarely seen as part of the same "Minnan" Chinese subgroups.

==Classification==
The variants of Southern Min spoken in [[Zhejiang]] province are most akin to that spoken in Quanzhou. The variants spoken in [[Taiwan]] are similar to the three [[Fujian]] variants and are collectively known as [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]].

Those Southern Min variants that are collectively known as "Hokkien" in [[Southeast Asia]] also originate from these variants. The variants of Southern Min in the [[Chaoshan]] region of eastern Guangdong province are collectively known as [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] or Chaozhou. [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] is of great importance in the [[Southeast Asia]]n [[Chinese diaspora]], particularly in [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Sumatra]] and [[West Kalimantan]]. The Philippines variant is mostly from the Quanzhou area as most of their forefathers are from the aforementioned area.

The Southern Min language variant spoken around [[Shanwei]] and [[Haifeng]] differs markedly from [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and may represent a later migration from Zhangzhou. Linguistically, it lies between [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] and Amoy. In southwestern [[Fujian]], the local variants in [[Longyan]] and [[Zhangping City|Zhangping]] form a separate division of Minnan on their own. Among ethnic Chinese inhabitants of [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Medan]], [[Indonesia]], a distinct form based on the [[Zhangzhou dialect]] has developed. In [[Penang]], it is called [[Penang Hokkien]] while across the [[Malacca Strait]] in [[Medan]], an almost identical variant{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} is known as [[Medan Hokkien]].

==Varieties==
There are three major divisions of Southern Min : 
* [[Hokkien|Minnan Proper]] ([[Hokkien Chinese|Hokkien]]–[[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]]) under the Quanzhang division ({{lang|zh-hans|泉漳片}})
* [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] under the Chaoshan division ({{lang|zh-hans|潮汕片}})
* [[Leizhou Min|Leizhou]] and [[Hainanese]] dialects under the Qiong-Lei division ({{lang|zh-hans|琼雷片}}).

===Quanzhang===
{{main|Hokkien}}
The group of mutually intelligible '''Quanzhang (泉漳片)''' dialects, spoken around the areas of Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou in Southern Fujian are collectively called '''[[Hokkien|Minnan Proper]] (闽南语/闽南话)''' or '''Hokkien-Taiwanese''', is the mainstream form of Southern Min. It is also the widely spoken non-official regional language in Taiwan. There are two types of standard Minnan. They are classified as '''Traditional Standard Minnan''' and '''Modern Standard Minnan'''. The '''Traditional Standard Minnan''' is based on Quanzhou dialect spoken in Quanzhou, it is the dialect used in Liyuan Opera (梨园戏) and Nanying music (南音). The '''Modern standard''' forms of Minnan Proper is based on [[Amoy dialect]] spoken in the city of [[Xiamen]] and [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] dialect spoken around the city of Tainan in Taiwan. Both '''Modern Standard''' forms of Minnan are a combination of [[Quanzhou dialect|Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou dialect|Zhangzhou]] speeches. Nowadays, '''Modern Standard Minnan''' is the dialect of minnan that is popular in Minnan dialect television programming, radio programming and Minnan songs. Most Minnan language books and Minnan dictionaries are mostly based on the pronunciation of the '''Modern Standard Minnan'''. Taiwanese in northern [[Taiwan]] tends to be based on Quanzhou dialect, whereas the Taiwanese spoken in southern Taiwan tends to be based on Zhangzhou dialect. There are minor variations in pronunciation and vocabulary between Quanzhou and Zhangzhou speech. The grammar is basically the same. Additionally, in Taiwanese Minnan, extensive contact with the [[Japanese language]] has left a legacy of Japanese loanwords.

===Teo-Swa===
{{main|Teochew dialect}}
'''Teochew, or Chaoshan speech (潮汕片)''', is a closely related variant of Minnan that includes [[Swatow dialect]]. It has limited mutual intelligibility with Quanzhang speech though they share some cognates with each other. [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] speech is significantly different from Quanzhang speech in both pronunciation and vocabulary. It had its origins from Proto-Putian dialect (闽南语古莆田话), a sub-dialect of Proto Minnan - which is closely related to Quanzhou dialect. As the Proto-Putian dialect speaking Chinese emigrants from Putian perfecture settled on Chaoshan region, it later received influence from Zhangzhou dialect. It follows the same grammar pattern as [[Hokkien|Minnan Proper]]. It is marginally understood by [[Hokkien|Minnan Proper]] speakers to a small degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|nan Minnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qiong-Lei===
{{main|Leizhou Min||Hainanese}}
'''Qiong-Lei speech (琼雷片)''', is a distantly related variant of Minnan which is spoken in the Leizhou peninsula and the southern Chinese island province of Hainan. The Qiong-Lei variant of Minnan shares historical linguistic roots with Minnan Proper. However, it developed into a distinctive language of its own due to the fact that these variants are spoken in the geographic location that is relatively distant from the Southern Min region. Over time, these dialects evolved into a distinct language of its own which featured drastic changes to initial consonants, including a series of implosive consonants, that have been attributed to contact with the aboriginal languages such as Tai-Kadai languages. As a result, it has lost much of its mutual intelligibility with mainstream [[Hokkien|Minnan]] (Hokkien-Taiwanese). It is not understood well by speakers of mainstream [[Hokkien|Minnan]]. Since the late 20th century, many linguists consider this Southern Min variant as a separate Min language.

==Phonology==
{{main|Hokkien#Phonology|Teochew dialect#Phonetics and phonology}}
Southern Min has one of the most diverse phonologies of Chinese varieties, with more consonants than Mandarin or Cantonese. Vowels, on the other hand, are more-or-less similar to those of Mandarin. In general, Southern Min dialects have five to six&lt;!--they have 7 to 8 聲, but only 5 to 6 tones. A final consonant does not count as a "tone" in English-language linguistics; 'tone' and '聲' are not synonymous.--&gt; [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s, and [[tone sandhi]] is extensive. There are minor variations within Hokkien, and the Teochew system differs somewhat more.

Southern Min's nasal finals consist m, n, ŋ, ~.

==Writing systems==
{{see also|Written Hokkien}}
Southern Min dialects lack a standardized written language. Southern Min speakers are taught how to read [[Standard Chinese]] in school. As a result, there has not been an urgent need to develop a writing system.{{Synthesis inline|date=March 2017}} In recent years, an increasing number of Southern Min speakers have become interested in developing a standard writing system (either by using Chinese Characters, or using [[Romanization|Romanized]] script).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==History==
The Min homeland of Fujian was opened to Chinese settlement by the defeat of the [[Minyue]] state by the armies of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] in 110 BC.{{sfnp|Norman|1991|pp=328}}
The area features rugged mountainous terrain, with short rivers that flow into the [[South China Sea]].
Most subsequent migration from north to south China passed through the valleys of the [[Xiang River|Xiang]] and [[Gan River (Jiangxi)|Gan]] rivers to the west, so that Min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=210, 228}}
As a result, whereas most [[varieties of Chinese]] can be treated as derived from [[Middle Chinese]], the language described by [[rime dictionary|rhyme dictionaries]] such as the ''[[Qieyun]]'' (601 AD), Min varieties contain traces of older distinctions.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=228–229}}
Linguists estimate that the oldest layers of Min dialects diverged from the rest of Chinese around the time of the [[Han dynasty]].{{sfnp|Ting|1983|pp=9–10}}{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=33, 79}}
However, significant waves of migration from the [[North China Plain]] occurred:{{sfnp|Yan|2006|p=120}}
* The [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians]]  during the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], particularly the [[Disaster of Yongjia]] in 311 AD, caused a tide of immigration to the south.
* In 669, [[Chen Zheng (Tang dynasty)|Chen Zheng]] and his son [[Chen Yuanguang]] from [[Gushi County]] in [[Henan]] set up a regional administration in [[Fujian]] to suppress an insurrection by the [[She people]].
* [[Wang Chao (Tang dynasty)|Wang Chao]] was appointed governor of Fujian in 893, near the end of the [[Tang dynasty]], and brought tens of thousands of troops from [[Henan]].  In 909, following the fall of the Tang dynasty, his son [[Wang Shenzhi]] founded the [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min Kingdom]], one of the [[Ten Kingdoms]] in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].
[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern Min varieties:
# A non-Chinese substratum from the original languages of [[Minyue]], which Norman and Mei Tsu-lin believe were [[Austroasiatic]].{{sfnp|Norman|Mei|1976}}{{sfnp|Norman|1991|pp=331–332}}
# The earliest Chinese layer, brought to Fujian by settlers from [[Zhejiang]] to the north during the Han dynasty.{{sfnp|Norman|1991|pp=334–336}}
# A layer from the [[Northern and Southern Dynasties]] period, which is largely consistent with the phonology of the ''Qieyun'' dictionary.{{sfnp|Norman|1991|p=336}}
# A [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary layer]] based on the [[koiné language|koiné]] of [[Chang'an]], the capital of the [[Tang dynasty]].{{sfnp|Norman|1991|p=337}}

==Comparisons with Sino-Xenic character pronunciations==
{{refimprove|date=August 2012}}
{{tone|section|date=October 2014}}
{{undue weight|reason=the table may give undue weight to similarities to JKV|date=August 2016}}
Minnan (or Hokkien) can trace its origins through the [[Tang Dynasty]], and it also has roots from earlier periods. Minnan (Hokkien) people call themselves "[[Names of China#Tang|Tang]] people", ({{lang|zh-hans|[[:zh:唐人|唐人]]}}, pronounced as "{{lang|zh-hans|唐儂}}" ''{{lang|nan|Thn̂g-lâng}}'') which is synonymous to "Chinese people". Because of the widespread influence of the Tang culture during the great Tang dynasty, there are today still many Minnan pronunciations of words shared by the [[Sino-xenic]] pronunciations of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] languages.

'''Theodore Ringwalt Hartley''' (born November 6, 1924) is a US Navy fighter pilot, investment banker, actor, film  producer, and is currently CEO of [[RKO Pictures]]. He was married to heiress, actress and philanthropist [[Dina Merrill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedhartley.com/articles/article%20-%20people.pdf|title=Encore, Encore: Now behind the camera, Dina Merrill and Ted Hartley make movie magic together|author=Samantha Miller, Danelle Morton and Vicki Sheff-Cahan|date=April 19, 1999|work= People magazine|publisher= People magazine|accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; until her death in 2017.

==Early life==
{{unsourced|section|date=December 2018}}
Hartley was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] and raised on a farm in [[Iowa]]. His father died when he was 5, causing financial hardships for the family. At the age of 14, he entered a contest sponsored by [[Warner Bros.]], wrote a 50-word essay on “Why I like to fly”, and won some flying lessons. Hartley attended [[Shattuck Military School]] in [[Minnesota]], and by the age of '''16''' he had won an appointment to the [[U.S. Naval Academy]]. After flight training, among other tours, he served as a [[aircraft carrier|carrier]]-based [[fighter pilot]], flying [[F-11 Tiger|F-11]]s following their introduction in 1956.

==Career==
As a Navy officer, Hartley had tours as a congressional liaison for the Pentagon, as a Presidential aide, as well as a carrier-based fighter pilot. In May 1964, his [[F9F Cougar | F9F8]] fighter crashed during a carrier landing accident. He was thrown from the jet, suffered a broken back, and was medically retired from the Navy. Hartley's military career prematurely ended, he attended [[Harvard Business School]] and pursued a career in investment banking, becoming Vice President for First Western Financial Corporation.&lt;ref name="thbio"/&gt; 

His next career was in [[Hollywood]], as an actor, where he took on the role of Reverend Jerry Bedford on the 1960s television series ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]''. Hartley had minor roles in films with [[Cary Grant]], [[Robert Redford]] and [[Clint Eastwood]], and then in the late 1970s was cast in his own series, ABC's ''[[Chopper One]]'', about helicopter flying police officers. The series was short lived, and thereafter Hartley moved to [[Aspen, Colorado]], where he volunteered as the Managing Artistic Director of the local theater, and then turned to [[commodity trading]] full-time.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

In 1987 he became involved with Pavilion Communications Inc., a company designed to acquire smaller entertainment companies. Through this, Hartley learned of an opportunity to take over [[RKO Pictures]]. He and his wife, [[Dina Merrill]], purchased 51% of the company and merged Pavilion Communications with RKO Pictures Corporation in 1991, forming [[RKO Pictures | RKO Pictures, LLC]]. Their first major project was the 1998 remake of ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]''. As chairman and chief executive office of RKO Pictures, Hartley has led RKO's worldwide development and production activities in movies and television as well as the expansion of the RKO brand to stage and other entertainment and distribution venues. He produced a remake of ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1998) with Disney, ''[[Ritual]]'' (2000) with Miramax, a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (2002 film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (2002), and ''[[Shade (film)|Shade]]'' (2003). For RKO Stage, he produced the musicals ''[[Never Gonna Dance]]'' (2003), ''[[Curtains (musical)|Curtains]]'' (2007), ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'' (2008), ''[[13 (musical)|13]]'' (2008), all on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and ''[[Top Hat (musical)|Top Hat]]'' (2012) in the [[West End theatre|West End]], winner of the 2013 [[Laurence Olivier Award]] for Best New Musical.&lt;ref name=olivierawards&gt;{{cite web|title=Olivier Award Winners 2013 – Best New Musical|url=http://www.olivierawards.com/winners/view/item216388/olivier-winners-2013|website=olivierawards|accessdate=September 24, 2015|date=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2013, he was appointed chairman of the board of [[Orbis International]], a nonprofit eye-healthcare organization dedicated to saving sight worldwide that he has been involved with since 2010.&lt;ref name=orbis&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bogusz|first1=Christopher|title=Ted Hartley appointed chairman of Orbis International board of directors|url=http://www.orbis.org/news/entry/ted-hartley-appointed-chairman-of-orbis-international-board-of-directors|website=Orbis|accessdate=November 21, 2014|date=August 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129145010/http://www.orbis.org/news/entry/ted-hartley-appointed-chairman-of-orbis-international-board-of-directors|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartley belongs to a number of motion picture and television guilds and associations, is a board member of the Steadman Philippon Research Institute (formerly, Steadman-Hawkins Sports Medicine Foundation), and serves as director of the Harvard Business School Association of Southern California.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; people are a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] ethnic group in eastern Java who claim to be the descendants of the [[Majapahit]] princes. Their population of roughly 100,000 is centered in 30 villages in the isolated Tengger mountains ([[Mount Bromo]]) in the [[Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park]] in eastern [[Java (island)|Java]].

Scattered communities of Tenggerese also exist in the [[Pasuruan Regency|Pasuruan]], [[Probolinggo Regency|Probolinggo]], [[Malang Regency|Malang]], and [[Lumajang Regency|Lumajang]] [[Regencies of Indonesia|Regencies]] of eastern Java. They are traditionally believed to be the descendants of legendary Roro Anteng and Joko Seger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastjava.com/tourism/malang/mount-bromo.html Mount Bromo] East Java tourism&lt;/ref&gt; The Tenggerese are considered an ethnic sub-group of the [[Javanese people]].

==History==
Before the 15th century, the past of the Tenggerese was linked with the [[Majapahit]] and other kingdoms from the earlier period. According to legend, Jaka Seger and Roro Anteng are the ancestors of the Tenggerese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=15-988-4660-4|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Tenggerese speak an archaic [[Javanese language|Javanese]] (Majapahit) dialect called [[Tenggerese dialect|Tengger Javanese]]. Elements of modern Javanese influences can be heard in their speech. They have their own written [[Kavi script|Kavi]] script based on the old Javanese [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Frank Webster Price|contribution=P.F. Collier &amp; Son Corporation|title=Collier's Encyclopedia: With Bibliography and Index, Volume 10|year=1950|publisher=Collier|isbn=|page=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Priesters uit het Tengger district Oost-Java TMnr 10001180.jpg|thumb|right|Tengger priests during the [[Dutch East Indies]] era.]]
The Tenggerese generally profess [[Hinduism]] as their religion, although they have incorporated many [[Buddhist]] and [[Animist]] elements. Like the [[Balinese people|Balinese]], they worship Ida Sang Hyang Widi Wasa (roughly "Big Almighty Lord") for blessings in addition to other [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] gods that include the Tri Murti ([[Shiva]], [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]]) and [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Their places of worship include the Punden, Poten and Danyang. The Poten is a sacred area of ground at [[Mount Bromo]]'s sand sea and becomes the focus of the annual Kasada Ceremony. In the Poten, it contains several buildings and enclosures, arranged in a specific composition called the Mandalas (zones).

The Tenggerese also worship a host of spirits ([[ancestor worship]]). They include ''cikal bakal'', the spirits of the founders of the village, the ''roh bahurekso'', the village guardian spirits and the ''roh leluhur'', the spirits of the ancestors. Rituals to propitiate these spirits are conducted by special priests. During these rites small doll-like figures representing the spirits are clothed in batik cloth and are presented with food and drink. It is believed that the spirits partake of the essence of these offerings. The Bromo volcano is considered one of the most sacred places. If it erupts, they believe that their god is very angry.

The Tenggerese give food offerings to the gods.
* ''Sajenan'' is presented to the guardian deities by the priest in formal liturgy. For different occasions foods are offered as Sajenan. For instance, during weddings a cone of rice, ''Tumpeng Walagara'', is offered. It is considered to be a source of blessing for the couple and the whole village. 
* ''Suguhan'' are offered by ordinary Tengger Hindus to their ancestral spirits.
* ''Tamping'' are food offerings to evil spirits to ward off bad luck and typically consist of meat, rice and bananas wrapped up in leaves and put at places such as cemeteries, bridges, and road intersections.

The priests are called ''Dukun'' or ''Resi Pujangga''; they play a middle role in their religious worship. They are believed to possess spiritual knowledge of the gods and the spirits called Ilmu, which they carefully guard from ordinary Tenggers. Priesthood is hereditary and generally passes down from father to son. Each village has only one of these priests, with three assistants — ''Legen'', ''Sepuh'', and ''Dandan''.

In the past few decades, due to overpopulation in [[Madura]], many Madurese settlers exploited the Tenggerese land by clearing some of their nature reserves and converting 2-3% (up to 10,000) of the Tenggerese to [[Islam]] in the process — particularly those in the more accessible areas in the lowlands just outside the Tengger range. Because of this Islamic [[missionary]] activity, the remaining Hindu Tenggerese asked the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] Hindus for help by reforming their culture and religion closer to the Balinese. The Indonesian government declared the Tengger mountains as the Bromo-Tengger-Semeru national park and declared that any more logging in this area is an illegal act, therefore protecting the Tenggerese from further disruption.

==Lifestyle==
The Tenggerese are basically either agriculturalists or nomadic herders. The agriculturalists generally live on the lower altitudes, while the nomads live on the higher altitudes, riding on small horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=15-988-4659-0|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
[[File:Tengger Boys.jpeg|thumb|upright|Tenggerese children at a wedding in traditional attire.]]

===Yadnya Kasada===
{{See also|Yadnya Kasada}}
The main festival of the Tenggerese is the ''Yadnya Kasada'', which lasts about a month. On the 14th day of the ''Kasada'', the Tenggerese go to Poten Bromo and ask for blessing from the main deity Hyang Widi Wasa and Mahadeva, the God of the Mountain (Mount Semeru), by offerings rice, fruit, vegetables, flowers, livestock and other local produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcnordic.com/shows/lands-of-the-monsoon/|title=Lands of the Monsoon {{!}} Shows {{!}} BBC Nordic {{!}} BBC Worldwide Nordic|website=BBC Worldwide Nordic|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also see the examination of the medicine men memorizing prayers. The medicine man who passes the exam is chosen to be the spiritual leader of the Tengger tribe.

The origin of this festival is a legend that dates back to the [[Majapahit]] kingdom, during the reign of King Brawijaya; the queen of the kingdom gave birth to a daughter named Roro Anteng, who married Jaka Seger, a young man from the Brahmin caste.

According to the legend, Roro Anteng and Jaka Seger were among many others who fled from the tattering [[Majapahit]] kingdom during the 15th century, when the declining kingdom was in the brink of collapse while the rapid spread of [[Islam]] in Java has begun. The couple and their followers later settled in the Tengger mountains and ruled the region jointly under the title Purbawisesa Mangkurat Ing Tengger. Tradition holds belief that they are ancestors of modern Tengger people.

For a few years the Tenggerese people flourished under the leadership of Jaka Seger and Roro Anteng, yet the king and queen were unhappy for they had no children. Desperate, they climbed to the top of [[Mount Bromo]] and prayed for help. Deeply moved by the couple's depth faith, the god of [[Mount Bromo]] assured them of offspring but with the condition that the youngest child be sacrificed in the crater of the volcano. After giving birth to 25 children, the time came for Roro Anteng to fulfill her part of the pledge. Though reluctant, they were threatened with catastrophe, forcing them to fulfill their pledge and comply with the god's wishes. They had no choice but to sacrifice their 25th child, Kesuma, by throwing him into the crater. In an alternate story, Kesuma was taken and consumed by the fire arising from the crater when he was about to flee from [[Mount Bromo]]. The Tengger people then started to commemorate this festival.

There is a large community of '''Ukrainians in the Czech Republic'''. Labour migration from [[Ukraine]] to what is now the [[Czech Republic]] began to grow to a large scale in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nekorjak|2006|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, there were just 8,500 [[Ukrainian citizenship|Ukrainian citizens]] on Czech territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Markus|1994|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, {{asof|2009|10|lc=on}}, figures of the [[Czech Statistical Office]] showed that number had grown to 132,481, making Ukrainians the largest group of foreigners in the Czech Republic, with a 30% share of the foreign population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CSO|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
Cambodian women are traditionally expected to be modest, soft-spoken, "light" walkers, well-mannered,&lt;ref name=Mekong/&gt; industrious,&lt;ref name=Status/&gt; belong to the household, act as the family's caregivers and caretakers&lt;ref name=Mekong/&gt; and financial administrators,&lt;ref name=Status/&gt; perform as the "preserver of the home", maintain virginity until marriage, become faithful wives,&lt;ref name=Mekong&gt;Chey, Elizabeth. [http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/women.htm The Status of Khmer Women], Mekong.net&lt;/ref&gt; and act as advisors and servants to their husbands.&lt;ref name=Status/&gt; The "light" walking and refinement of Cambodian women is further described as being "quiet in […] movements that one cannot hear the sound of their [[silk]] skirt rustling".&lt;ref name=Status/&gt; As financial administrators, the women of Cambodia can be identified as having household authority at the familial level.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

In recent years, women have become more active in the traditionally male-dominated spheres of work and politics in Cambodia.

==Work==
[[File:Emile gsell cambodian woman.jpg|thumb|200px|Cambodian woman]]
In the wake of the [[Cambodian Civil War]], Cambodia suffered a deficit in the number of male laborers. Thus, women took over responsibilities that were commonly and principally done by Cambodian men.&lt;ref name=Status/&gt;  Under Cambodian law, women are to receive "equal pay for equal work".  In practice most women receive lower wages than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=Status/&gt;  During the 1990s, many "uneducated young women" from rural areas [[rural-urban migration|ventured into the city]] to work in garment factories.&lt;ref name=Status/&gt;

In 2004, the organisation Gender and Development for Cambodia stated that 6% of the female workforce in Cambodia is paid.&lt;ref name=OC&gt;[http://www.online.com.kh/~gad/Home.htm, The Status of Women in Cambodia], Gender and Development for Cambodia, online.com.kh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Cambodia}}
[[File:BuddhistMonk02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Buddhist nun]] in Cambodia.]]
Cambodian women are generally active in worshipping at [[Buddhist]] temples and participating in religious ceremonies, particularly during the ''thngai sil'' ([[English language|English]]: "holy days").  Some women not only participate as worshippers, but become [[Buddhist nun]]s (''yeay chi'') themselves, especially the widowed and the elderly.

==Education==
45% of Cambodian women were reported as being illiterate in 2004. 16% of Cambodian girls were enrolled in lower secondary schools in 2004.&lt;ref name="OC"/&gt; Many Cambodian girls have been kept from education due to several factors.  One factor is that they are needed at home to take care of younger siblings, perform household duties, and support the head of the home.  Other factors include extreme poverty, the prohibitive distance of schools from many rural houses, and sometimes even fears for their safety when traveling alone from home to school.&lt;ref name=Status/&gt;

Women are increasingly present in Cambodia's universities. As of 2004, 20% of graduates from universities were female.&lt;ref name="OC"/&gt;

==Political status==
In general, from the 1980s up to the present, the number of female participants in Cambodian politics has remained low, and they are under-represented in high-level positions at both the local and national levels of the government.&lt;ref name=Status/&gt;  Since 1993 there has been a modest rise in Cambodian women’s participation, including leadership, in non-governmental [[List of women's organizations|organization]]s focusing on the issues and [[women's rights|rights of women]].&lt;ref name=Status/&gt;

It was reported in 2004 that 10% of [[National Assembly of Cambodia|National Assembly]] members, 8% of Commune Council members and 7% of judges were women.&lt;ref name="OC"/&gt;

==Legal status==
In Cambodian legislation and indeed the country's history, men and women have always technically had equal rights before the law.&lt;ref name=Status/&gt;  This proclamation is also stated in the Constitution of Cambodia.&lt;ref name=Status/&gt; Women benefit from inheritance laws, wherein they can own property, they can "bring property into a marriage", they can retrieve the said property if they decide to do so, and they can easily obtain a divorce.&lt;ref name=Status/&gt;

==Prostitution==
{{Further|Prostitution in Cambodia}}

Prostitution in Cambodia involves the hiring or forcible prostitution of both local women&lt;ref name=Status/&gt; and [[women from Vietnam]],&lt;ref name=Factbook&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/cambodia.htm Cambodia], Factbook on Global Sexual Exploitation, uri.edu&lt;/ref&gt; and is being linked to the sex trade in nearby [[Thailand]].  In part because of the spread of prostitution, around 2.8% of Cambodia’s population are infected with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].&lt;ref name=Status&gt;[http://www.seasite.niu.edu/khmer/ledgerwood/women.htm The Status of Women in Society], seasite.niu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welfare==
In rural communities, Cambodian women are susceptible to domestic violence, and in practice have "little legal recourse".
&lt;ref name=EC&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Cambodia.html Gender Roles and Statuses], everyculture.com&lt;/ref&gt; Due to limited women's education, some Cambodian women are unable to protect themselves from discrimination, gender inequality, violence, and abuse, because they are not aware of their legal rights, and are also ignorant of global [[human rights]] standards.&lt;ref name=OC/&gt;

Gender and Development for Cambodia reported in 2004 that "23% of women have suffered physical domestic abuse".&lt;ref name="OC"/&gt;

==Social status==
[[File:Siem Reap Server - Cambodia.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A young Cambodian [[waitress]] waiting on customers.]]
Contrary to traditional Cambodian culture, young Cambodian women have been influenced by [[Western civilisation|Western]] ways in recent years. One trend is that some young female Cambodians, particularly in the capital of [[Phnom Penh]], overtly consume [[liquor]]s and other alcoholic beverages in restaurants. Other perceived Western influences include the sense of having equal rights between men and women, a sense of peer pressure, companionship, experimentation, family troubles, abandonment by a boyfriend, and increasingly, [[advertising]].&lt;ref name=Phnom&gt;[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2011040648369/LIFT/women-in-cambodia-are-increasingly-becoming-social-drinkers.html Women in Cambodia are increasingly becoming social drinkers].

'''''You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South''''' is a 2015 American [[documentary film]] produced by Hilary Saltzman, Kitty Potapow, and Jude Hagin and directed by [[John Cork]].&lt;ref name="Ocala Style Magazine"/&gt; The film works to uncover the hidden truths of the [[Ruby McCollum]] case of 1952. McCollum, the richest African American woman in [[Suwannee County, Florida]], shot White physician and politician Clifford Leroy Adams four times with her revolver.

Hagin discovered this story when meeting with the late Dr. [[James Haskins]], award-winning author and English professor at [[The University of Florida]]. Haskins provided Hagin with a copy of the [[William Bradford Huie]] book [[Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail]], saying “this story needs to be told.” Upon reading Huie’s book, Hagin disagreed with the assertion that McCollum had been in a consensual, sexual relationship with Adams and that the Adams shooting was over a money dispute. “I could not get that into my head,” she said. “I could not wrap my head around the notion that an African-American woman in 1952 would willingly have a relationship with a town’s sainted physician.”&lt;ref name="Ocala Style Magazine"/&gt;

Hagin’s pursuit of the truth led to an exploration of “[[paramour rights]],” the assumption that White men had the right to use Black women for sex, in the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] South. While there had been previous books and documentaries on Ruby McCollum, '''''You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South''''' is the first project to get witness accounts, including interviews with McCollum’s friends and family and the last surviving juror from the trial.&lt;ref name="Tampa Bay Times"&gt;{{cite news|author= Paul Guzzo |title= Pinellas film producers revisit 1952 Live Oak slaying |url= http://tbo.com/pinellas-county/pinellas-producers-revisit-1952-murder-case-20141128/|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date= November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I wanted to get family members on both sides to tell their side of the story," Hagin said.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news|author= Jason Dearen |title= Jim Crow-era shooting revisited in new documentary |url= http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-jim-crow-era-shooting-revisited-in-new-documentary-2015jan01-story.html|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date= January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film premiered at the 2014 LA Femme International Film Festival on October 17, 2014&lt;ref name=" LA Femme International Film Festival 2014"/&gt; and was released for [[Video on demand|VOD]] on February 1, 2015 in time for [[Black History Month]].&lt;ref name="Ocala Style Magazine"/&gt;

==Summary==
On the morning of August 3rd, 1952, Ruby McCollum left her children in her car and walked into the “colored entrance” of Dr. Clifford Leroy Adams’ office and shot him four times into his body. The White doctor and state Senator-elect died on the scene while McCollum returned home to warm milk for her baby.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YBTM excerpts"&gt;{{cite web|title=About You Belong to Me|url=http://www.youbelongtome.net/excerpts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors claimed that McCollum shot Dr. Adams in a dispute over a $116 medical bill, despite the fact that she had $1,800 in her purse and was the wealthiest Black woman in town. The judge ordered the jury to disregard McCollum’s testimony that Dr. Adams repeatedly [[rape|raped]] her and that the shooting was in [[self-defense]]. In fact, Dr. Adams fathered a daughter by McCollum, but the jury was not allowed to even look at her when she was presented as evidence of the rape. McCollum was found guilty and sentenced to death. Years later, she won an insanity plea and was released from prison in 1974.&lt;ref name="Associated Press"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YBTM excerpts"/&gt;

The documentary uses first-hand accounts of both the McCollum and Adams families as well as the last living juror in an attempt to uncover the truth behind the murder. Was McCollum actually insane or was she truly acting in self-defense after years of rape? '''''You Belong to Me: Sex, Race and Murder in the South''''' looks at previous conclusions and offers up its own in an effort to answer that question.

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive response from critics. Mike Spain of Irish Film Critic gave it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, “There is plenty to the story to keep the interest of the audience. One of the film’s strengths is a lot of the story is told by people who were in Live Oak at the time or had a stake in the outcome. A juror, town’s people, and Ruby’s relatives. It adds to the authenticity of the documentary.”&lt;ref name="Irish Film Critic"&gt;{{cite news|author= Mike Spain|title= Movie Review: “You Belong To Me: Sex, Race And Murder In The South” Reveal Forgotten Sins |url= http://irishfilmcritic.com/movie-review-you-belong-to-me/|website=[[Irish Film Critic]]|date= May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for Emertainment Monthly, Emily Solomon graded the film with an A- and wrote, “What is so intriguing about the way this film is put together is how the mystery unravels. The murder is established early on in the film, with new twists and turns revealed throughout that shows McCollum’s motivation to commit in the first place.”&lt;ref name="Emertainment Monthly"&gt;{{cite news|author= Emily Solomon|title= Boston Film Fest Review: ‘You Belong to Me’ Unveils a Relevant Piece of History |url= http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/boston-film-fest-review-you-belong-to-me-unveils-a-relevant-piece-of-history/|website=[[Emertainment Monthly]]|date= September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
