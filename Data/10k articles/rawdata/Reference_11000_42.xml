{{for|similarly-named listings|100 greatest (disambiguation){{!}}100 greatest}}
'''''100 Greatest of All Time''''' was a [[television series]] of five one-hour episodes, produced and first aired by [[Tennis Channel]] in March 2012. It presented a list of the "100 greatest tennis players of all time", both men and women. The series was hosted by [[Jack Nicklaus]], [[Jerry Rice]], [[Wayne Gretzky]], [[Lisa Leslie]] and [[Carl Lewis]].&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennispanorama.com/archives/tag/100-greatest-of-all-time|title=Tennis Panorama News|work=Tennis Panorama|accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many retired tennis luminaries provided commentary, including [[Rod Laver]], [[Billie Jean King]], [[Chris Evert]], [[Björn Borg]], [[John McEnroe]], [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Pete Sampras]], and [[Andre Agassi]].
 
==List==
An "international panel of tennis experts" determined this ranking of 62 men and 38 women.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt; The [[United States]] was credited with the most great players (38), followed by [[Australia]] (17), [[France]] (7), [[Great Britain]] (6) and [[Czechoslovakia]] (5). Forty-three players made the list from the [[Americas]], 39 from [[Europe]] and 18 from [[Oceania]]. 

Note: '''Bolded''' players are still active today. Slams figures reflect number of wins in Singles draws and are up-to-date, meaning that they may now be higher than the numbers used to determine the March 2012 list.

'''Antero Vipunen''' is a [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] who appears in [[Finnish mythology]] and [[Kalevala]] [[folk poetry]]. He is buried underground and possesses very valuable spells and knowledge.

The god-hero [[Väinämöinen]] has a spell with three words or ''[[luotes]]'' missing. In order to obtain them, he goes to wake up the sleeping Vipunen by pushing sharp stakes into his grave and through his mouth and stomach. Väinämöinen hits Vipunen in the stomach so hard that he gives up the luotes to get rid of the stomach ache.

== Other ==
Antero Vipunen also gave his name to a book edited by [[Yrjö Karilas]], which contains various plays and games, and contains both general and specialised knowledge. (''Antero Vipunen: arvoitusten ja ongelmien, leikkien ja pelien sekä eri harrastajien pikkujättiläinen'' [[SanomaWSOY|WSOY]], [[Porvoo]] 1950. The 1st edition).

[[File:Central Park Arsenal jeh.JPG|thumb|The central block in 2008]]

'''The Arsenal''' is a symmetrical brick building with modestly [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic Revival details]], located in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], centered on [[64th Street (Manhattan)|64th Street]] off [[Fifth Avenue]]. Built between 1847 and 1851 as a storehouse for arms and ammunition for the [[New York Army National Guard|New York State Militia]], the building predates the design and construction of Central Park, where only the [[Blockhouse (Central Park)|Blockhouse]] (1814) is older.

The Arsenal was designed by [[Martin E. Thompson]], originally trained as a carpenter, who had been a partner of [[Ithiel Town]] and went on to become one of the founders of the [[National Academy of Design]]. Thompson's symmetrical structure of brick in [[English bond]], with headers every fifth course, presents a central block in the manner of a fortified gatehouse flanked by half-octagonal towers. The carpentry doorframe speaks of its purpose with a [[Bald eagle]] displayed between stacks of cannonballs over the door, and crossed sabers and stacked pikes represented in flanking panels. The lobby contains a series of floor-to-ceiling murals by [[Allen Saalburg]] from 1935-36, combining historical vignettes of New York life during the Civil War with ornamental scrolls and arabesques.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Prudence. [http://artinprint.org/article/when-the-delay-is-the-gratification-allen-saalburg/ "When the Delay is the Gratification: Allen Saalburg,"] &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 7 No. 4 (November-December 2017), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building currently houses the offices of the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] and the Central Park [[Central Park Zoo|Wildlife Conservation Center]], but it has also served as a zoo and housed a portion of the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s collections while its permanent structure was being erected.  During the course of its lifetime it has also housed a police precinct, a weather bureau, and an art gallery.

'''''Aya: Imagined Autobiography''''' ({{lang-he|איה: אוטוביוגרפיה דמיונית}}, [[romanization of Hebrew|tr.]]'''Aya: Autobiographia Dimionit''') is a [[1994 in film|1994]] [[cinema of Israel|Israeli]] [[independent film|independent]] [[underground film|underground]] dramatic [[art film]] directed by [[Michal Bat-Adam]]. The titular character is the same one from the director's earlier film ''[[Boy Meets Girl (1982 film)|Boy Meets Girl]]'', now haunted by her past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictd.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%9C-%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9D/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA|script-title=he:מיכל בת־אדם|last=Sason|first=Yasmin|last2=Parkhomovsky|first2=Marat|date=20 December 2010|website={{ill|Israeli Cinema Testimonial Database|he|מאגר העדויות של הקולנוע הישראלי}}|language=Hebrew|access-date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Aya ([[Michal Bat-Adam]], played by {{ill|Michal Zoharetz|he|מיכל זוארץ}} as a teenager, by Shira Lew-Munk as a child, and, inside the fictional film, by Keren Tenenbaum), a thirtysomething [[film director]], married and mother of one, is shooting a film about her life. The film presents the story of the filming of this fictional film while intersecting within it her dreams and delusions from her life and relations with her father {{ill|Gedalia Besser|he|גדליה בסר}}, played inside the fictional film by {{ill|Alexander Peleg|he|אלכס פלג}}) and her mentally ill mother ({{ill|Liat Goren|he|ליאת גורן}}, played inside the fictional film by [[Levana Finkelstein]]). Aya sees her life as a striving to exist, namely, to do something important in life, both in her eyes and in her father's. However, while making this film, Aya understands that all of this striving for something large is pointless, and, that what really matters is the ability to experience every moment of life, finding meaning therein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shin|first=Uri|script-title=he:שלוש פנים לאיה|trans-title=Aya's Three Faces|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0263/02630642.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Davar]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaofisrael.co.il/%D7%90%D7%99%D7%94/|script-title=he:''איה: אוטוביוגרפיה דמיונית''|last=Munk|first=Dr. Yael|website={{ill|Cinema of Israel (website)|lt=Cinema of Israel|he|ספר הקולנוע הישראלי}}|language=Hebrew|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Writing in ''[[Haaretz]]'', critic {{ill|Uri Klein|he|אורי קליין}} opined that the film is director [[Michal Bat-Adam]]'s best one so far,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Uri|date=26 October 1994|script-title=he:רגעים קטנים של רגש|trans-title=Little Moments of Emotion|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0159/01590410.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Haaretz]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Ha'ir]]'' critic Dr. {{ill|Shmuel Duvdevani|he|שמוליק דובדבני}} wrote that it was her most personal as well as her most interesting one to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duvdevani|first=Dr. Shmuel|date=28 October 1994|script-title=he:בסרט הזה כבר היינו|trans-title=We Have Already Seen This Film|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0159/01590415.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Ha'ir]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)#Time Out Tel Aviv|Time Out Tel Aviv]]'' critic {{ill|Yair Raveh|he|יאיר רוה}} noted that watching this film "is like meeting for the first time someone who insists on telling you about a very intimate dream he had had, while exposing you to his unedited and private world of fantasies and associations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raveh|first=Yair|date=28 October 1994|script-title=he:סרט בתוך סרט בתוך סרט|trans-title=A Film Inside a Film Inside a Film|url=http://idea.cinema.co.il/ideawebinter/multimedia_11/0159/01590409.pdf|language=Hebrew|work=[[Time Out (magazine)#Time Out Tel Aviv|Time Out Tel Aviv]]|location=Tel Aviv|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abroad, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that, in this film, the "clash between film and reality is really the core of the movie, with scenes from the autobiographical film clashing with scenes from Aya’s memory. Sometimes the memory is harsher and sometimes the film is, as if Bat-Adam doesn’t trust either as a source of truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/an-imagined-autobiography-1200439526/|title=Review: ''Aya: Imagined Autobiography''|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=6 November 1994|access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chambers Book of Days''''' (''The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Including Anecdote, Biography, &amp; History, Curiosities of Literature and Oddities of Human Life and Character'')&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers Book of Days'' (1864) [http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/index.shtml Chambers Harrap web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029093258/http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/index.shtml |date=October 29, 2006 }} (this link is dead but the 1869 edition can be found here [http://www.thebookofdays.com/])&lt;/ref&gt; was written by the Scottish author [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] and first published in 1864.

A new version of ''Chambers Book of Days'' was published by [[Chambers Harrap]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sansom [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/referenceandlanguages/0,,1365950,00.html Crunchy, but not the original] in [[The Guardian]] December 4, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Book of Days'' (1864)==

''The Book of Days'' was [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]' last publication, and perhaps his most elaborate. It was a huge collection of short, largely factual pieces which today would generally be bracketed as "trivia" but very interesting trivia. The formula has been much repeated. It is supposed that his excessive labour in connection with this book hastened his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Chambers, Robert|volume=5|page=821}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in two large volumes, each over 840 pages long, and, for its day, was well-illustrated with engraved drawings linked to the articles. Its full title is ''The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar: Including Anecdote, Biography, &amp; History, Curiosities and Literature, and Oddities of Human Life and Character''. It is well-indexed adding much to its value as a reference tool.

Each day, listed in chronological order gives a short list of saints connected to the day and famous persons being born on that day and dying on that day. Individuals are then selected from these lists for more detailed articles. With six or seven articles per day the total number of articles, which are in the form of erudite essays, runs to around 2000, a staggering undertaking in terms of research. It is a much quoted reference in many hundreds of other reference books.

==''Chambers Book of Days'' (2004)==

In 2004 [[Chambers Harrap]] published a new ''Book of Days''. Rosalind Fergusson wrote for the Chambers Harrap website that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like its illustrious predecessor, ''Chambers Book of Days'' (2004) is a compendium of information relating to the days, months, and seasons of the year, selected and presented with the personal touch of the author. ... At the same time, the style of ''Chambers Book of Days'' (1864) has been preserved by the inclusion of numerous passage from the original volumes, and the selection of these was one of the current author's more pleasurable tasks. It is hard to surpass Robert Chambers' lyrical descriptions of the characteristics of the changing seasons, for example, extracts of which are included at the beginning of each month.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Fergusson {{Cite web |url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/book_of_days/index.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524082452/http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/book_of_days/index.php# |archive-date=2005-05-24 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }} September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4043">The '''Clergy List''' was a professional directory of the [[Church of England]] which appeared between 1841-1917.  From the start it also covered Wales, together with more limited information relating to Scotland, Ireland, and other churches within the [[Anglican Communion]].

==Background and early contents==

An opportunity to compile and issue a new directory had been created by the effective disappearance of the earlier [[Clerical Guide or Ecclesiastical Directory]], edited by [[Richard Gilbert (printer)|Richard Gilbert]], and also by the introduction of the much improved system of the [[Penny Post]].

The basic contents of the '''Clergy List''''s earlier editions was summarised on their title pages:
*an alphabetical list of the clergy (or at least of those who held benefices)
*an alphabetical list of the benefices, with their post towns
*lists of the cathedral establishments
*benefices arranged under their ecclesiastical divisions
*lists of ecclesiastical preferments variously under the patronage of the Crown, the bishops, and the deans &amp; chapters, etc.

The directory was always a bit less expensive than its later rival, [[Crockford's Clerical Directory]], but not surprisingly it consequently offered considerably less in the way of biographical detail.  This was especially true in the earlier editions which offered little or no information as to previous appointments, universities attended, or lists of publications by the clergy.

==Publishers and later history==

The directory was initially published by '''Charles Cox''' at the Ecclesiastical Directory Office, [[Southampton Street, London|Southampton Street]], [[Strand, London|Strand]].   Cox – who in 1839 had taken over a periodical called the '''Ecclesiastical Gazette,''' originating during the previous year – was able to produce two separate editions during the Clergy List's inaugural year of 1841.&lt;ref name="paflin"&gt;[http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=48255] [[Church Times]]: two-part article ''Shop-talk and mordant wit'', by Christopher Currie &amp; Glyn Paflin, describing the background to ''Crockford's Clerical Directory'''s first hundred editions, 6–13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter it managed to maintain annual publication right up until adverse trading conditions forced its closure as a separate volume in 1917.

Cox remained as the Clergy List's publisher for many years, but by 1881 the title had been taken over by John Hall of [[Whitehall|Parliament Street]], In 1888 it was further taken over by Hamilton, Adams &amp; Company, of London's [[Paternoster Row]].  They had earlier acquired Thomas Bosworth's '''[[Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory]]''', merging the two titles in 1889.  During the following year the combined directory was still further transferred to Kelly &amp; Company, the publishers of [[Kelly's Directories]].&lt;ref name="paflin" /&gt;

The later volumes were considerably expanded to include much greater biographical detail – broadly comparable with Crockford – but this was not sufficient to sustain the publication in the longer term.  Over the years the number of pages also increased – ranging from around 300 in 1841 to around 700 by the 1890s.

After 1917 the Clergy List finally merged with its long-time rival, '''Crockford's Clerical Directory'''.  At least as late as 1932 the latter continued to advertise on its preliminary pages that it "incorporated the '''Clergy List, the Clerical Guide and the Ecclesiastical Directory''''".&lt;ref name="paflin" /&gt;

In recent years certain of the earlier editions of the Clergy List (including the first edition &lt;ref&gt;The 1841 first edition of the ''Clergy List'' may be downloaded free of charge from the Google eBookstore [https://books.google.com/ebooks]&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt;) have been reissued by various publishers – either on CD-ROM or in scanned format on the World Wide Web.

The '''common sole''', '''Dover sole''', or '''black sole''' (''Solea solea'') is a [[species]] of [[flatfish]] in the family [[Soleidae]]. It lives on the sandy or muddy seabed of the northern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea where it often semi-immerses itself in the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The upper side is greyish-brown while the underside is white. It grows to a maximum length of about {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The species is prized as a food fish, being caught mostly by [[trawling]] on the seabed.

== Description ==
The small eyes are close to each other on the right side of the body. This gives the fish the possibility of lurking half-buried in the sand for passing prey. The common sole, just like all other flatfishes, hatches as an "ordinary" fish with one eye on each side of the body.  The young metamorphose to flatfish when they are about one centimeter long. The upper side is greyish-brown and the underside is white. The common sole approaches a maximum length of {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}.

== Distribution and habitat ==
It has a preference for relatively shallow water with sand or mud covering the bottom.
It is found in the Eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]], from the south of [[Norway]] to [[Senegal]], and in almost all of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In the winter, it withdraws to the somewhat warmer waters of the southern [[North Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Solea | species = solea | year = 2008 | month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, a small sole is commercially called a "slip".

==Ecology==
An [[ectoparasite]] of the common sole is the leech ''[[Hemibdella soleae]]''. The larvae settle on the upper surface of the fish, the only part not buried in the sediment, and after further development migrate to the underside, where they attach themselves with their suckers, feeding on the fish's blood.&lt;ref name=Kearne&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kearne, G.C. |year=2009 |title=The life cycle of the monogenean ''Entobdella soleae'', a skin parasite of the common sole |journal=Parasitology |volume=53 |issue=1–2 |pages=253–263 |doi=10.1017/S0031182000072723 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use as food ==
Chefs prize Dover sole for its mild, buttery, sweet flavour and versatility, and for its ease of filleting. The fish yields fillets that hold together well in a variety of recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sea Log |work=Santa Monica Seafood |date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2009 |url=http://www.santamonicaseafood.com/docs/Sealogs/Sealog-01-2006.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930005139/http://www.santamonicaseafood.com/docs/Sealogs/Sealog-01-2006.pdf |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Dover" comes from [[Dover]], the English fishing port landing the most sole in the 19th century.

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the common sole to its seafood red list. "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable [[Fishery|fisheries]]."&lt;ref name="greenpeace.org 2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=Greenpeace International Seafood Red list – Greenpeace International |website=greenpeace.org |date=24 December 2008 |url=https://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224050550/https://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |archive-date=24 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |access-date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/which-fish-can-I-eat Greenpeace Seafood Red list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702144606/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/which-fish-can-I-eat/ |date=2 July 2017 }}, Greenpeace, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other species named "Dover sole" ==
Because of its prestige, the name "Dover sole" was borrowed to name the eastern Pacific species ''[[Microstomus pacificus]]'', a quite distinct species with different culinary properties: the Pacific sole has thinner, less firm fillets and sells for a lower price.

Not listed are U.S. [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officers]].  A warrant officer is an officer who can and does command, carry out military justice actions and sits on both selection and promotion boards. A US warrant officer is a single-track specialty officer, initially appointed by their respective service secretary; he/she receives a commission upon promotion to Chief Warrant Officer Two (CW2).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usapa.army.mil/pdffiles/r135%5F100.pdf Army Regulation (AR) 135-100], US Department of the Army Pamphlet (DA Pam) 600-11 and US Army Field Manual (FM) 22-100 [http://www.usawoa.org/ArmyWOdefined.htm (para A-3)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206203554/http://www.usawoa.org/ArmyWOdefined.htm |date=2004-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the separation between 'other' ranks and 'officer' ranks can on occasion become permeable. Notably, within the British armed services, both [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Sir Fitzroy Maclean]] and [[Enoch Powell]] are examples of, rare, rapid career progression with the British army, both rising from the rank of Private to Brigadier during World War II. In the US military such advancement is not uncommon, all four services maintaining programs that select promising enlisted men for the commissioned ranks.
 
'''Notes to table above'''
*The Royal Marines rank alongside their army equivalents. However, when borne on the books of any of HM Ships or Naval Establishments Royal Marines are subject to the Naval Discipline Act 1957; in those circumstances, many officer ranks in the Royal Marines formerly enjoyed greater status. [[Second Lieutenant]]s were equivalent to [[Sub Lieutenant]]s and ranks from [[Lieutenant]] to [[Major]] were considered equivalent to one rank higher (OF-2 to OF-4). [[Lieutenant Colonel]]s were considered equivalent to [[Royal Navy|RN]] [[Captain (naval)|Captains]] with less than six years in the rank, and [[Colonel]]s were equivalent to [[Captain (naval)|Captains]] with more than six years seniority. Higher ranks followed the equivalence on the table above. This state of affairs ended on 1 July 1999, when Royal Marine officer ranks were fully aligned with those of the Army. 
*[[RAF officer ranks|RAF-style ranks]] are also used by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]], [[Nigerian Air Force]], [[Indian Air Force]], [[Pakistan Air Force]], [[Bangladesh Air Force]], [[Hellenic Air Force]], [[Egyptian Air Force]], [[Trinidad and Tobago Air Guard]], [[Royal Air Force of Oman]] and [[Sri Lanka Air Force]]. The [[Ghana Air Force]] and [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]] (previously [[Royal Rhodesian Air Force]]) also use the same basic system, but replace Pilot Officer and Flying Officer with Air Sub Lieutenant and Air Lieutenant. The [[Royal Thai Air Force]] uses the RAF ranks also.  The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and [[Royal Malaysian Air Force]] also previously used the system.
*Note that the U.S. military usually uses O-1 to O-10 to symbolize officers, and not the NATO codes of OF-1 to OF-10 in which all subaltern officers are classed as OF-1 (O-1 and O-2 in US). O-11 is sometimes used for the U.S. OF-10 ranks, but is not official.
*OF-10 ranks in the United States can only be attained during wartime; the last five-star officer died in 1981. This is also now generally the case in the UK, although provision is made to award them under special circumstances in peacetime (no promotions to these ranks have been made since they were generally suspended in 1997, with the exception of the honorary promotion of [[Lord Boyce]] to Admiral of the Fleet in the Queen's 2014 [[birthday honours]]). Captain-General Royal Marines is a ceremonial rank, usually held by [[Prince Henry of Wales|a member]] of the Royal Family.There is not a Field Marshal rank for the Royal Marines, although Royal Marine officers may reach full General rank.
*Due to its modern-day size, the ranks of General and Lieutenant-General are not used within 3 Commando Brigade or the main Royal Marines. The role of [[Commandant General Royal Marines|Commandant General]] being held by a Major-General. RM officers may hold the rank of Lieutenant-General, serving in MOD or Joint Forces positions. Royal Marine officers may reach the full rank of General, for example General [[Gordon Messenger]].
*At various times the O-7 rank in the USN has been called "Commodore" and "Commodore Admiral"
*Not used in the Royal Marines. Royal Marines officers join as Second Lieutenants; after two years service, provided that Phase 2 training has been successfully completed, they are promoted to the rank of Lieutenant (if under 21 at the time of joining) or Captain (if 21 or older at the time of joining).
*No longer used in the Royal Navy. All officers now join [[BRNC Dartmouth]] as Midshipmen once more, unless having previously served in the ranks ((senior)upper yardsmen) but use the non-substantive rank of Officer Cadet (OCdt) during the pre-Initial Sea  phase.
*Depending on the particular Officer Commissioning Program. [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]], [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]] and [[NROTC]] are Midshipmen (MIDN); [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] are Cadets; U.S. Navy Seaman-to-Admiral 21 (STA-21) and [[Officer Candidate School]] are Officer Candidates (OC).

==US "Enlisted" and UK "Other" ranks compared==

The British Armed Forces do not use the term Enlisted Ranks. The equivalent in the Royal Navy is Ratings and in the other services is [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]] (divided into Warrant Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Soldiers or Airmen).

UK and US ranks are categorised in the NATO rank code system OR-1 to OR-9. Ranks with the same code are equivalent. Within the US military, however, "E-1" to "E-9" is the more common usage.

'''Notes on comparison:''' 
*''In the US Army OR-1 to OR-4a (Specialist) are junior enlisted, OR-4b (Corporal) to OR-6 are Junior Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), and OR-7 to OR-9 are Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs).
*''In the USAF OR-1 to OR-4 are junior enlisted, OR-5 to OR-6 are NCOs, and OR-7 to OR-9 are SNCOs.
*''In the USMC, OR-1 to OR-3 are junior enlisted, OR-4 to OR-5 are NCOs, and OR-6 to OR-9 are Staff Non-Commissioned Officers.
*''In the US Navy and Coast Guard, OR-1 to OR-3 or "nonrated (wo)men" are junior enlisted, OR-4 to OR-6 or Petty Officers are NCOs, and OR-7 to OR-9 or Chief Petty Officers are SNCOs.''
*''In the British Army OR-1 to OR-2 are Junior Enlisted, OR-3 to OR-4 are Junior NCO's, and OR-5 to OR-9 are SNCO's
*''Generally speaking, the RN assumes a rank up despite the NATO code remaining the same. For example, a LH is more practically comparable to a PO2 or PO1 in the USN.
*''While in the British Army a Lance Corporal is the next rank up from a Private, unlike in the US Army they are considered Junior NCO's, and hold a similar command appointment to a US Army Sergeant. Because of this it is not unheard of for Lance Corporals to be given US Army Sergeant rank insignia when serving with US forces.
*''While there are different Pay-Grades for Privates (and other Enlisted Ranks) in the British Army, these are tied to Job-Role (MOS) rather than time in service. As such there is no Promotion from a Class 4 Private to a Class 3 Private, nor are there differing badges of rank.
Addendum: In the US Army (but not the USMC) the term "Trooper/(Troop)" may be used informally for lower enlisted in Cavalry, Scout, Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger, and Special Forces Units, along with the occasional use for any soldier, particularly dismounted Infantry. The specific definition of "Troop" is a company sized unit of Cavalry, organizationally equivalent to "Battery" in Artillery units.&lt;ref&gt;Source: U. S. Army.{{vague|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes to table above'''

* A [[Warrant Officer]] in UK service is a senior non-commissioned rank not comparable to the various grades of Warrant Officer in the US, although holding the Queen's Warrant and with certain privileges similar to those of officers.  In the Army and Royal Marines, they are referred to by their appointment, of which there are many (for example, [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] is a WO1 appointment).  The US rank is held by single track career specialists (ranking between Enlisted Ranks and 2nd Lieutenant) and have no NATO equivalent. A RN Warrant Officer Class 1 incorporated the former rank of Fleet Chief Petty Officer. There are now Executive Warrant Officers, denoting the senior WO1s on ships and shore establishments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004235001/http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/News-and-Events/Reference-Library/~/media/Files/Navy-PDFs/News-and-Events/Naval%20Publications/BR%202/brd2book/ch23.pdf THE EXECUTIVE WARRANT OFFICER]&lt;/ref&gt; There are four Command Warrant Officers in the RN.

* RAF Flight Sergeants: Although technically equivalent to British Army Staff Sergeant this does not equate to time served or experience since the RAF does not have the rank of WO2.
* The RN created the rate of Warrant Officer Class 2 on 1 April 2004. Previously, there was a rate of Charge Chief Petty Officer, who usually ranked as OR-7, although above other CPOs. A Charge Chief Artificer (a highly qualified technical CCPO) could be given a NATO OR-8 status, but still ranked below WO2 in the Army and Royal Marines. On the creation of WO2, all CCPOs were upgraded to this rate.By 2014, the rating of WO2 in the RN will disappear and there will be a single WO rate, that is, WO1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nff.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=444&amp;Itemid=135 NFF – Naval Families Federation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the US "OR #" system, NCOs are from OR4 onwards hence the equivalents in rank name do not tie in exactly. In the US Army a Corporal is considered an NCO, but a Specialist is not.
* British Sergeants/Petty Officers are seen as equal to E5 ''and'' E6 although Corporals ''as well as'' Sergeants may be appointed to an official OR-5 (i.e. E-5) military role as is suited to the particular situation.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* From April 1, 1999 Able Rating and Ordinary Rating merged and simply called Able Ratings, Marine 1st Class and Marine 2nd Class merged, and Junior Rating and Junior Marine were abolished.
* Technical trades and musicians only.  ''Promotion'' to the rank of Junior Technician ceased in 2005, only to be replaced by Senior Aircraftman (Technician) a short time later.
* The most senior WO1s are, in descending order, the [[Army Sergeant Major]], the [[Conductor (British Army)|Conductors]] (Cdr) of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]], the Royal Artillery Sergeant Major, Royal Artillery, the [[Academy Sergeant Major]] (AcSM), and the [[Garrison Sergeant Major]] (GSM) of the London District
* The rank of Lance Corporal is used by the RAF Section of the [[Combined Cadet Force]] as an equivalent to OR-3.
* Includes [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] (RSM), [[Garrison Sergeant Major]] (GSM), and [[Household Cavalry]] [[Regimental Sergeant Major|Regimental Corporal Major]] (RCM). These appointments are similar in function to the equivalent US rank indicated, but are equal in rank to other WO1 appointments.
* Includes [[Company Sergeant Major]] (CSM), [[Company Sergeant Major|Squadron Sergeant Major]] (SSM), [[Royal Artillery]] [[Company Sergeant Major|Battery Sergeant Major]] (BSM), [[Household Cavalry]] [[Company Sergeant Major|Squadron Corporal Major]] (SCM), and [[Band Sergeant Major]]. These appointments are similar in function to the equivalent US rank indicated, but are equal in rank to other WO2 appointments.
* [[Staff Sergeant]]s can also hold other appointments, such as [[Company Quartermaster Sergeant]].
* [[Royal Artillery]].
* [[Foot Guards|Brigade of Guards]].
* The alternatives to the rank of Private are as follows:
** [[Air Trooper]] (ATpr) in the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]];
** [[Gunner (rank)|Gunner]] (Gnr) in the [[Royal Artillery]] and [[Royal Horse Artillery]];
** [[Highlander (rank)|Highlander]] (Hdr) in The [[Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons)]] regiment;
** [[Royal Irish Rangers|Ranger]] (Rgr) in the Royal Irish Regiment
** [[Sapper]] (Spr) in the [[Royal Engineers]];
** [[Trooper (rank)|Trooper]] (Tpr) in the [[Household Cavalry]], [[Royal Armoured Corps]], [[Honourable Artillery Company]] and [[Special Air Service]];
** Craftsman (Cfn) in the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]];
** [[Guardsman]] (Gdn) in [[Foot Guards]] regiments;
** [[Kingsman (rank)|Kingsman]] (Kgn) in the [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment]];
** [[Rifleman]] (Rfn) in [[The Rifles]];
** [[Signaller]] (Sig) in the [[Royal Corps of Signals]];
** [[Fusilier]] (Fus) in Fusilier regiments;
** Musician (Mus) in the [[Corps of Army Music]];
** Where appropriate: Drummer (Dmr), Trumpeter (Tptr), Bugler, or Piper (Ppr).1
* In the US Army, First Sergeant is considered senior to and promoted laterally from Master Sergeant when assigned to a First Sergeant billet, typically the senior NCO in a company (troop, battery) sized unit.  Upon reassignment a 1SG reverts to his previous rank of MSG. In the USMC the OR-8 ranks are equivalent but on separate career tracks as are the OR-9 ranks, i.e. a Gunnery Sergeant (OR-7) is promoted to either First Sergeant or Master Sergeant depending on his indicated preference for a command/senior enlisted advisor billet or a technical specialty. A First Sergeant is promoted to Sergeant Major and a Master Sergeant to Master Gunnery Sergeant. 
* The alternatives to the rank of Seaman are as follows:
** [[Seaman#United States|Fireman]] (FN) in engineering;
** [[Airman#United States Navy|Airman]] (AN) in aviation;
** [[Hospitalman]] (HN) for medical corpsmen;
** [[Seabees|Constructionman]] (CN) in Construction Battalions ([[Seabees]]).
** The former rate of Dentalman (DN) was merged into Hospitalman in 2005.
* Also [[Seaman Apprentice|Fireman Apprentice]] (FA), [[Airman#United States Navy|Airman Apprentice]] (AA), [[Hospitalman|Hospitalman Apprentice]] (HA), [[Seabees|Constructionman Apprentice]] (CA).
* Also [[Seaman Recruit|Fireman Recruit]] (FR), [[Airman#United States Navy|Airman Recruit]] (AR), [[Hospitalman|Hospitalman Recruit]] (HR), [[Seabees|Constructionman Recruit]] (CR).
* Unique ranks; the senior NCO in each Service.

[[Conflict resolution]] is any reduction in the severity of a conflict. It may involve [[conflict management]], in which the parties continue the conflict but adopt less extreme tactics; settlement, in which they reach agreement on enough issues that the conflict stops; or removal of the underlying causes of the conflict. The latter is sometimes called "resolution", in a narrower sense of the term that will not be used in this article. Settlements sometimes end a conflict for good, but when there are deeper issues – such as value clashes among people who must work together, [[distressed relationships]], or mistreated members of one's ethnic group across a border – settlements are often temporary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007|reason=Revision needed/Inaccurate definitions}}

==Unproductive conflict communication cycle==
Unproductive conflict; this can be done by analyzing the three stages executed during this type of communication: the early stage, the middle stage, and the later stage. Generally speaking, an argument's potential is determined within the first 3 minutes of exchange, setting the tone for the early stage. It is in this stage where cross-complaining becomes present – countering one's complaint with another complaint – a negative environment is immediately set and hostility is likely to be mirrored. Exiting the early stage and entering the middle stage, we can see the kitchen-sinking concept come into, "Once a negative climate has been set, it is stoked by other unconstructive communication. People often engage in kitchen-sinking, in which everything except the kitchen sink is thrown into the argument" (Wood 234).  Constant interruptions, underdeveloped thoughts and the continuation of cross-complaining is apparent, leaving no time, breath or desire to form resolutions. Eventually, the conflict floats into the later stage. By this stage participants are exhausted from arguing and individual prosperity is emphasized over mutual solution; counterproposals are exchanged. As you can see, unproductive conflict communication truly is ineffective and puts relationships in jeopardy.

==Constructive conflict communication==
Similar to the unproductive conflict communication cycle, the constructive conflict communication cycle can be divided into the same 3 parts – early stage, middle stage and later stage. To establish a positive early stage, it is crucial to acknowledge and confirm one another's concerns. Critical listening, open-mindedness and respect create a supportive climate. Once the solid groundwork is set, participants can shift into the middle stage and begin agenda building, that is, clarifying the concerns while staying on topic; interruptions are kept at a minimum and recognition is reinforced. Last but not least, solutions will be proposed as the conflict enters the later stage, where respect shall be maintained, ideas are exchanged, and resolutions are formed. Contrary to a negative climate, this form of communication seeks to create a positive, more tolerable environment.

==Negotiation research==

[[Negotiation]], the most heavily researched approach to conflict resolution, has mainly been studied in laboratory experiments, in which undergraduate participants are randomly assigned to conditions. These studies have mostly looked at antecedents of the strategies adopted by negotiators and the outcomes attained, including whether agreement is reached, the joint benefit to both parties, and the individual benefit to each party.

===Negotiation research findings===

Here are some of the more prominent findings from these studies (see Pruitt &amp; Carnevale, 1993):

* [[Problem solving behavior]], such as giving or requesting information about a party's priorities among the issues, encourages high joint benefit. 
* [[Contentious behavior]], such as making threats or standing firm on one's proposals, encourages failure to reach agreement or,  if agreement is reached, low joint benefit. 
* Conceding makes agreement more likely but favors the other party's interests. 
* [[Prosocial motivation]] (resulting, for example, from positive mood or the expectation of future interaction with the other party) encourages problem solving and high joint benefit and discourages contentious behavior, but only when resistance to yielding is high (De Dreu, Weingart, &amp; Kwon, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Influence of social motives on integrative negotiation: a meta-analytic review and test of two theories|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = 2000-05-01|issn = 0022-3514|pmid = 10821196|pages = 889–905|volume = 78|issue = 5|first = C. K.|last = De Dreu|first2 = L. R.|last2 = Weingart|first3 = S.|last3 = Kwon|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.5.889}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The party who makes the first offer tends to achieve greater benefit than the other party. 
* Three states of mind discourage concession making: viewing concessions as producing loss rather than as foregoing gain; focusing attention on one's goal rather than one's limit (i.e., the alternative that is minimally tolerable); and adopting a fixed-pie perspective, in which one views the other's gain as one's loss, rather than an expandable pie perspective. 
* Adopting any of the states of mind above diminishes the likelihood of agreement; but if agreement is reached, it increases the likelihood of winning, especially if the other party adopts the opposite state of mind (Thompson, Neale, &amp; Sinaceur, 2004).

===Cultural differences shown in research findings===

Recent experiments have found cultural differences in negotiation behavior (Gelfand &amp; Brett, 2004):

* Negotiators from [[individualistic]] cultures tend to take a more contentious approach, while those from [[collectivistic]] cultures are more concerned about maintaining positive relationships and hence more likely to cooperate (concede or engage in problem solving). 
* Accountability to constituents encourages contentious behavior for individualists, it encourages [[cooperative behavior]] for collectivists. 
* Research tells us that people with a high [[need for closure]] (for rapid decision making) tend to think and act in accustomed ways. It follows that high need for closure should accentuate contentious behavior in [[individualistic]] societies and cooperative behavior in [[collectivistic]] societies, an hypothesis that has received support.

==Research into third party involvement==

Third parties often become involved in conflict resolution, either being called in by the disputants or acting on their own because the conflict annoys them or the community they serve. Two common forms of [[third-party intervention]] are [[arbitration]] and [[mediation]]. In arbitration, the third party listens to both sides and then renders a decision, which can be either binding or advisory. Most mediation consists of third-party assistance with negotiation. When conflict is severe and the disputants have difficulty talking calmly with each other, mediators can put them into contact and help them develop a [[cease-fire]] or settlement. If the disputants cannot or will not meet each other, mediators commonly become intermediaries and shuttle between them. Sometimes a chain of two intermediaries is necessary because there is no single individual who can communicate effectively with both sides.

===Mediation research findings===

Mediation has been studied in both the laboratory and the field. Research (see Kressel &amp; Pruitt, 1989) suggests that:

* [[Interpersonal mediation]] is usually successful in producing settlements. 
* Disputants generally prefer mediation over arbitration, since it allows them to retain control over the final decision. This means that in [[med-arb]], where failure to reach agreement in mediation is followed by [[binding arbitration]], disputants will work harder to reach agreement than in straight mediation. 
* In the case of small claims disputes, that mediation produces more compliance with the agreement than [[adjudication]] (a form of arbitration), perhaps because mediated decisions accord more with the parties' needs.
* To be fully successful, mediators must be seen as impartial between the two parties. 
* Having stronger initial ties to one side than the other is less damaging to the perception of impartiality than exhibiting bias during the mediation session. 
* Disputants even sometimes prefer that the mediator be close to the other party so that he or she can exert influence over that party.

===Mediator tactics discoveries===

More than 100 distinct [[mediator tactics]] have been identified.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Among the tactics that have been shown to work well, in the sense of producing long-lasting agreements beneficial to both sides are:

* Helping the parties to understand each other's positions, challenging them to come up with new ideas, and requesting their reactions to new ideas. 
* When conflict is severe, mediators often have to be quite active and even pushy (e.g., telling disputants that their demands are unrealistic) in order to achieve agreement. 
* When conflict is less intense, and the disputants are capable of talking productively with each other, it is best for mediators to be relatively inactive.
* When disputant discussions are unproductive it is best to separate the parties ("caucusing") and engage in problem solving with each of them. 
* Compliance to the terms of an agreement is enhanced when the parties emerge from the mediation with a positive relationship and when they view the mediation process as a fair one in which all of the issues came out. 
* Continued third-party attention to the conflict has been found to encourage compliance to agreements reached at the end of internal war (Hampson, 1996).
* When there is a continuing relationship between disputants, helping them find a settlement for their current disagreement is often not enough. New conflicts may arise or deeper issues resurface. 
* Within the specific continuing relationship of marriage, [[marital therapists]] have found that training both the parties in problem solving skills, such as effective communication, identifying key issues, developing solutions that satisfy both parties' needs, helps ease marital problems. Two evaluation studies have shown the value of this approach, and one of them (Johnson &amp; Greenberg, 1985) has demonstrated that [[emotionally focused therapy]] is even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differential effects of experiential and problem-solving interventions in resolving marital conflict.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.53.2.175|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|pages = 175–184|volume = 53|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.53.2.175|first = Susan M.|last = Johnson|first2 = Leslie S.|last2 = Greenberg|pmid=3998245|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Emotionally focused therapy is the practice where, persistent maladaptive interaction patterns are identified, and husband and wife are encouraged to reveal the feelings and needs associated with these patterns and to "accept and respond to" their partner's feelings and needs. 
* Programs have also been developed for training school children in problem solving skills, and evaluations of these programs have generally been quite positive. 
* In addition, many school systems have adopted [[peer mediation]] programs, in which students are trained to mediate conflicts that arise in their school. Evaluations of these programs have also been quite positive (Coleman &amp; Deutsch, 2001).

==Ethno-political conflict research==

Investigators have looked at the impact of several kinds of third-party interventions in [[international and ethno-political conflict]], including [[peacekeeping]], mediation, and problem solving workshops. Peacekeeping is the use of lightly armed troops to manage conflict in a war zone. Most peacekeeping has been done by the [[United Nations]], drawing on the military forces of its members. Traditional peacekeeping involved enforcing ceasefires, but in the last few years, the peacekeeper's duties have grown to include such services as the delivery of humanitarian aid, the supervision of elections, and maintenance of law and order. Research shows that as they go about these new responsibilities, peacekeepers – officers more so than enlisted men – often become heavily involved in negotiation and mediation. One study found that as conflict becomes more severe, peacekeeper mediators are more likely to meet separately with the disputants, to urge the disputants to relax, and to rely on force (Wall, Druckman, &amp; Diehl, 2002).

===Peacekeeping research findings===

Peacekeeper mediation is done at the local level. Mediation at the intergovernmental level is a much older practice that has recently come under study with statistical analyses of large samples of historical mediations (Bercovitch &amp; Houston, 2000). Among the findings in this research are:

* Mediation is more likely to be successful when the parties are of equal power, when they have been friendly in the past, when there have been relatively few fatalities in the period before mediation, when the mediator is of high rank, and when mediation comes after a test of strength between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why Do They Do It Like This? An Analysis of the Factors Influencing Mediation Behavior in International Conflicts|url = http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/44/2/170|journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 2000-04-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 170–202|volume = 44|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0022002700044002002|language = en|first = Jacob|last = Bercovitch|first2 = Allison|last2 = Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The latter finding is compatible with [[ripeness theory]] ([[I. William Zartman|Zartman]], 2000), which was developed from comparative case studies of violent ethno-political conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ripeness: The hurting stalemate and beyond|last = Zartman|first = W.I.|publisher = National Academy Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory holds that two conditions are necessary for disputants to enter into and move forward in negotiation, bilateral or mediated: (a) both sides perceive that they are in a hurting stalemate, and (b) both sides develop optimism about the outcome of mediation—a "perceived way out."

==Putting conflict research to use==

Several types of [[negotiation#Negotiation strategies|negotiation strategies]] have been developed for repairing faulty international and inter-group relations. Negotiations are usually held over a period of several days, and attended by mid-level opinion leaders and decision makers from both sides of a conflict, under the leadership of scholar and/or practitioners.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The aims of these workshops are to teach the parties about conflict in general and their conflict in particular, to forge understanding between the parties and, if possible, to develop joint projects that will contribute to reconciliation.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} One evaluation study conducted showed that these workshops improved attitudes toward the other side, increase complexity of thinking about the conflict, and facilitate further communication with people on the other side (Fisher, 1997). There is also evidence that some alumni of these workshops have later contributed to high level negotiations between the conflicting parties.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Cowboy Henk''' is a Belgian [[absurd humor]]/[[surreal humour]] [[gag-a-day]] comic strip series, drawn by [[Herr Seele]] and written by [[Kamagurka]]. It was originally published in the newspaper ''[[De Morgen]]'', but later taken over by the magazine ''[[HUMO]]'' &lt;ref name="dbnl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_ons003199901_01/_ons003199901_01_0044.php|publisher=dbnl.org|title=Ons Erfdeel Jaargang 42 (1999) &amp;middot; dbnl|accessdate=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it is still published today and for whom Henk is now their [[mascot]]. The series was in continuous syndication from 1981 until 2011. After the brief interruption it was continued again in the spring of 2013.

==History==
In 1981 [[Kamagurka]] published a one-album-only long comic story named : ''Mijnheerke Plagiaat'' ("Mister [[Plagiarism]]"), in the Belgian newspaper ''Vooruit'' (later ''[[De Morgen]]''). At the end of the story the comics character Mr. Plagiaat decided to think up a comic character of his own, whom he named ''Cowboy Henk, contrary to [[Zorro (comics)|Zorro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kamagurka &amp; Herr Seele, "Mijnheerke Plagiaat", Loempia, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, 1981 the first ''Cowboy Henk'' [[gag]] appeared in print. [[Kamagurka]] wrote the jokes and dialogues while his friend, [[Herr Seele]], drew the stories.

Originally ''Cowboy Henk'' appeared in black-and-white as a [[gag-a-day]] comic of only four to six panels per episode. Sometimes he had adventures spread over more pages too. ''De Morgen'' received many angry letters from readers who complained about the style of comedy. In [[Flanders]] ''Cowboy Henk'' was published exclusively in the magazine ''[[HUMO]]'' from 1982 until 2011, usually as a single page [[gag-a-day]] page. He also appeared on many magazine covers, thus becoming one of ''HUMO'' 's official [[mascot]]s. In October 2011, after nearly 20 years of continuous publication, the series was no longer published in HUMO and disappeared without fanfare. According to the redaction the series hardly got any reactions from readers anymore, even when publication was ceased. From that moment on until 2012 Seele drew the short-lived black-and-white comic strip ''Dikke Billie Walter'' ("Fat Billie Walter"), with [[Kamagurka]] as script writer. On April 10, 2013, the Flemish radio station ''[[Studio Brussel]]'' interviewed Seele and he announced Henk's comeback in HUMO. The character indeed reappeared. First as a [[gag cartoon]], spread over an entire page and making topical comedy, later as a parody comic strip series of Belgian history until finally back in its old form as a comic strip.

The series has been translated in French (as ''Cowboy Maurice''), Spanish and English in magazines such as ''[[L'Echo des Savanes]]'' and ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]''.&lt;ref name="hln"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/948/Kunst-Literatuur/article/detail/1786135/2014/02/02/Herr-Seele-en-Kamagurka-winnen-erfgoedprijs-met-Cowboy-Henk.dhtml|publisher=hln.be|title=Herr Seele en Kamagurka winnen erfgoedprijs met 'Cowboy Henk'- HLN.be|accessdate=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Netherlands]] the comics are published in ''[[Vrij Nederland]]''.

==Character==
Cowboy Henk is a muscular adult male with a characteristically brawny chin and a long yellow [[quiff]] which, according to the jubilee story ''De Bananenkuif'' (2001) is made from [[banana]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Seele, Herr, "De Bananenkuif", De Stripuitgeverij, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually Henk wears a white T-shirt with short sleeves, blue pants and black shoes with round noses. In his first gags Henk was a real [[cowboy]], which explains his name.&lt;ref&gt;Kamagurka and Herr Seele, "Mijnheerke Plagiaat", Loempia, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henk is a [[flat character]] and completely unpredictable. He often behaves very bizarre, but the world around him is also very [[surrealism|surreal]]. He often reacts calmly to all the madness around him, but can get aggressive and even violent at times. Sometimes Henk behaves like a naïve child still living at his mother's place and going to school. In other gags he behaves more like an adult by going to work or experiencing with sex and drugs. Since Henk has had sex with both men and women in his cartoons we can conclude he is [[bisexual]]. He has no stable profession, despite the fact that some successive gags depict him as a journalist, hairdresser or a painter.

Henk is also the only recurring character. Other side characters only appear in a few gags, then disappear again.

==Style==
Much like Kamagurka's other comics and cartoons Cowboy Henk is an [[absurd humor]] comic strip series, aimed at adults. [[Herr Seele]] told in interviews that ''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'' by [[Bill Griffith]] was a major inspiration. Some ''Cowboy Henk'' gags have an almost child friendly atmosphere while others are full of shocking [[dirty joke]]s, [[toilet humour]] and/or [[black comedy]]. Because of the simple, naïve drawing style the series have been read by many children in ''HUMO'' over the years. This led to several angry letters by parents who complained about the child unfriendly vulgarities in the comic strip.

==In other media==
[[Image:Peter schelp675.jpg|thumb|Herr Seele dressed as Cowboy Henk]]

In Kamagurka and Seele's comedy TV series ''Lava'' and ''Johnnywood'' sometimes short animated cartoons featuring Henk were seen, with Seele voicing his character. He also performed Cowboy Henk (with a yellow [[quiff]] tied to his bald head) while Kamagurka told Henk's surreal adventures to the audience. In their radio show ''[[Studio Kafka]]'' they also made [[audio play]]s about Henk.

==Award==
The series won the 2014 ''Prix du Patrimoine'' at the [[Angouleme International Comics Festival]]''.&lt;ref name="foreignrights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foreignrights.wpg.be/cowboy-henk-winner-of-the-2014-selection-patrimoine-prize-in-angouleme/|publisher=foreignrights.wpg.be|title=Pagina niet gevonden|accessdate=2017-02-16}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* Cartoonist [[GAL (cartoonist)|Gal]] once drew a series of cartoons for the magazine ''Panorama/De Post'' (nowadays [[P-Magazine]]) which showed the news events of the years 1955–1984. For the year 1956 he drew a cartoon in which [[Elvis Presley]] dances amidst of all kinds of politicians and media phenomena of that year. In the left corner Cowboy Henk, jealous of Elvis' [[quiff]], tries to turn over the page.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/anth004over01_01/anth004over01_01.pdf Page 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Diccionario biográfico español''''' is a Spanish [[biographical dictionary]] published by the [[Real Academia de la Historia]].

==History==
On 23 May 1735 [[Felipe V]] approved the constitution of ''Real Academia de la Historia''. The Academy's first Director [[Agustín de Montiano y Luyando]] proposed to create a ''Diccionario histórico-crítico de España''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rah.es/diccionario-biografico-espanol/ |title=Diccionario Biográfico Español |access-date=4 May 2018 |work=[[Real Academia de la Historia]] |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008095653/http://www.rah.es:80/diccionario-biografico-espanol/ |archive-date=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, resources were limited and the ''Diccionario biográfico español'' did not get underway until the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rah.es/diccBiografico.htm |title=Diccionario Biográfico Español |access-date=4 May 2018 |work=[[Real Academia de la Historia]] |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823200956/http://www.rah.es:80/diccbiografico.htm |archive-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printed edition==
The Dictionary was edited by [[Gonzalo Anes]] (the then Director of the Academy), Jaime Olmedo, and Quintín Aldea Vaquero. It was written over ten years by 5,000 historians. It consists of 50 volumes with 45,000 pages and 40,000 biographies of notable figures in [[History of Spain|Spanish history]], from the 7th century BC to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rah.es/diccionario-biografico-espanol/diccionario-biografico-espanol-2/ |title=El primer diccionario de biografías para el mundo hispánico |access-date=4 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910062932/http://www.rah.es:80/diccionario-biografico-espanol/diccionario-biografico-espanol-2/ |archive-date=10 September 2017 |work=[[Real Academia de la Historia]] |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first twenty-five volumes were published in 2011 with the remaining volumes completed by 2013.&lt;ref name="bne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bne.es/es/Micrositios/Guias/ObrasReferencia/RepBiografico/EvolucionHistorica/DiccBioEspanol/ |title=El Diccionario biográfico español |access-date=4 May 2018 |work=[[Biblioteca Nacional de España]] |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ealham"&gt;{{cite journal |quote=Some scholars claim that publication of the allegedly scandalous biogram exposed "the limits of post-Francoist democratization" |first=Chris |last=Ealham |title=The Emperor's New Clothes: 'Objectivity' and Revisionism in Spanish History |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary History]] |issue=48 |volume=1 |year=2012 |page=192 |doi=10.1177/0022009412461776 |jstor=23488342 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022009412461776 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic edition==
The electronic version of the dictionary was launched formally by the [[Felipe VI of Spain|King]] and [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Queen]] of Spain in 2018,&lt;ref name="Vanguardia"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20180503/443205118738/historia-conecta-era-tecnologica-diccionario-biografico-electronico.html |title=La historia se conecta a la era... |date=2018 |work=La Vanguardia |access-date=2018-05-13 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some material had been available online previously. [[Carmen Iglesias]], who became director of the [[Real Academia de la Historia]] in 2014, was the historian responsible for the electronic version, which differs in some repects from the printed version which preceded it.&lt;ref name="Vanguardia"/&gt; It is intended that any errors will be corrected continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morales |first=Manuel |title=El ‘Diccionario Biográfico Español’ se enmienda en la Red |url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2018/05/03/actualidad/1525342688_349008.html |date=3 May 2018 |access-date=4 May 2018 |newspaper=[[El País]] |language=es |location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The printed edition contains information about living persons, whereas so far the electronic edition is restricted to deceased persons. The difficulty of writing objectively about living people was one of the criticisms of the Dictionary when it appeared.&lt;ref name="Kamen"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://elmundo.orbyt.es/2011/06/09/orbyt_en_elmundo/1307633505.html |title=La ideología política y el Diccionario Biográfico |last=Kamen |first=Henry}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another source of controversy was the treatment of [[Francisco Franco]], who initially was not described as a dictator.&lt;ref name="Ealham"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His entry was revised for the online version.

In July 2012, the ESRC announced that all of ESDS will join the UK Data Service, to be established as of October 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New national digital repository for social and economic data|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-and-events/press-releases/22231/new-national-digital-repository-for-social-and-economic-data.aspx|publisher=Economic and Social Research Council|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


==Service overview==

The service currently provides an online download service, specialist user support which links up with specialist support provided by the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/ Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS)], training and workshops and a range of data enhanced longitudinal collections. Such as: 

* [[1970 British Cohort Study]] (BCS70)
* British Household Panel Survey (BHPS)
* English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA)
* [[Families and Children Study]] (FACS)
* [[Longitudinal Study of Young People in England]] (LSYPE)
* [[Millennium Cohort Study]] (MCS)
* [[National Child Development Study]] (NCDS)

It also encourages linkage with other datasets not directly supported by ESDS, such as the ONS Longitudinal Study and, in conjunction with the [[ESRC]], works to facilitate access to new longitudinal data collections. 

Recently, ESDS Longitudinal has undertaken a data audit of two major longitudinal investments by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)]]: the [[Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children]] (ALSPAC) and the National Study of Health and Development (also known as the 1946 Birth Cohort Study). 

Both studies are currently in preparation for improved access for secondary users.

The airplay [[music charts]] in [[South Africa]] are gathered and published by the company '''Entertainment Monitoring Africa''' ('''EMA'''), formerly known as '''Mediaguide South Africa'''.&lt;ref name="site"&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=http://www.sa-ema.com/ |title=Entertainment Monitoring Africa |publisher=Entertainment Monitoring Africa|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the [[Times Media Group]], under Entertainment Logistics Services (ELS).&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; The company provides a weekly top 10 airplay chart, which is available for viewing by the general public online. A top 100 is available for [[Subscription business model|subscribed]] users of the company's [[website]].&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; The first top 10 airplay chart under the EMA was issued for May 21, 2013, with its first number one single being "[[Blurred Lines]]" by [[Robin Thicke]] featuring [[T.I.]] and [[Pharrell Williams]].&lt;ref name="Blurred Lines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sa-ema.com/index.php/charts-board/?week=2013-05-21 |title=South African Airplay Chart Top 10 - May 21, 2013 |publisher=Entertainment Monitoring Africa |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428015955/http://www.sa-ema.com/index.php/charts-board/?week=2013-05-21 |archivedate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the ''[[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]]'' wrote that the EMA charts were "regarded as the industry standard when it comes to tracking what songs are being played on radio".&lt;ref name="City Press"&gt;{{cite news|last=Blignaut|first=Charl|date=January 19, 2014|title=SA's new stars of the airwaves|url=http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/SAs-new-stars-of-the-airwaves-20150429|newspaper=[[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]]|location=South Africa|access-date=October 14, 2015|via=[[News24]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMA currently monitors 48 [[radio stations]] and 8 [[television stations]].&lt;ref name="site"/&gt;

==Local music and chart==
A local content quota for radio was legislated by [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa]] (ICASA) for public stations in South Africa to play a minimum of 40% local music, while commercial stations had a quota of 25%.&lt;ref name="City Press"/&gt; EMA released a report at the end of 2013 that South African radio stations collectively played only 28% local music that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nkuna|first=Kulani|date=June 10, 2014|title=North West FM: Touting our talent|url=http://citizen.co.za/192759/touting-our-talent/|newspaper=[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]]|location=South Africa|access-date=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis was based on an annual airplay chart posted for that year, where only 28 out of the year's top 100 songs were by local artists; the highest-placed song by a local artist was [[Mafikizolo]]'s "[[Khona]]" which ranked at number five—it received more than 5500 spins in 2013. In contrast, the most played song that year was American singer [[Robin Thicke]]'s "[[Blurred Lines]]" with over 7200 spins.&lt;ref name="City Press"/&gt;

Linda Maseko, manager of South African record label Mentalwave, commented: "A shift needs to happen. We are still doing a full analysis with a view to naming the radio stations that are not complying. We need that money at home to improve the music industry. The same thing is happening with commercials. In other countries, you have to get special permission to use a foreign track on a commercial – and prove that you can't find the right local one."&lt;ref name="City Press"/&gt; Conversely, Charl Blignaut of the ''[[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]]'' noted that "the most powerful hit factory in the country is not a major international record company, but a pioneering independent".&lt;ref name="City Press"/&gt; Blignaut's observation was based on EMA's 2013 annual chart where local label Kalawa Jazmee secured over 7% of all airplay on the top 100 and 30% of all local airplay. He went on to conclude, "Independent artists are dominating the home-grown music playlists despite radio not meeting its local quotas".&lt;ref name="City Press"/&gt; It was further noted that the local genres of [[gospel music]], traditional and [[kwaito]] were in decline in 2013; while [[house music]], [[Afro pop music|Afro-pop]] and [[hip hop music]] were increasing in popularity.&lt;ref name="City Press"/&gt;

In 2015, a local chart was launched online for public viewing without registration; similar to the main airplay chart, the local chart also provides a weekly top 10 based on airplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plaatjie|first=Poliswa|date=April 14, 2015|title=DJ brings the house down with hit single|url=http://www.dispatchlive.co.za/news/video-dj-brings-the-house-down-with-hit-single/|newspaper=[[Daily Dispatch]]|access-date=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="site"/&gt;

'''stock.xchng''' (also known as '''SXC''') was a [[website]] providing free-to use [[stock photography]] and illustrations, its name being a [[SMS language|reduced version]] of "stock exchange" (meaning the exchange of stock photography, and a [[pun|play]] on the term [[stock exchange]]). The site was launched in February 2001 by Peter Hamza, and allows users to contribute, share and download high-resolution photographs and illustrations free of charge. Contributors are encouraged to submit material to enhance their photography career through wider public exposure. In 2009, the site had over 2,500,000 registered users (1,000,000 in the USA alone) and more than 400,000 photos.&lt;ref name="aboutus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sxc.hu/help/1|title=About us|publisher=stock.xchng|accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sxc.hu/stats|title=Statistics|publisher=stock.xchng|accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2009 it operated parallel to its sister site, Stockxpert.com, until the site's parent company, Jupiterimages, was purchased by [[Getty Images]], and the site is now tied in with the [[iStock]] library of paid images.

Since its acquisition by Getty Images in 2014, the site was renamed '''FreeImages''' in 2014 and the web address now redirects to a freeimages.com URL. It has retained the older SXC images and the link to the iStock website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgbstock.com/sxc_hu_down/|title='SXC.hu offline?'|date=November 2013|accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
[[File:stockxchg website 2009.jpg|thumb|The stock.xchng website in 2009, with iStockphoto results]]
The stock.xchng site operated as a hybrid of a picture library site and a [[Social network service|social networking]] site; registered users could set up a personal profile, upload their photographic works to share with other users, write a [[weblog|blog]] and participate in [[Internet forum|online forum]]s to discuss and critique each other's work.

As a design resource, the site provided a library of high-resolution, [[royalty-free]] photographs which may be [[download]]ed free of charge for use in design projects. Although images are free, contributors still retain [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] and photographs are still subject to usage restrictions.&lt;ref name="licence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sxc.hu/help/7_2|title=Image License Agreement|publisher=stock.xchng|accessdate=2009-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stockxpert==
[[File:StockXpert website 2009.jpg|thumb|The StockXpert website in 2009]]
Until 2009, stock.xchng operated alongside its sister site, '''Stockxpert'''. Stockxpert was designed with a near-identical [[user interface]], but functioned as a commercial [[microstock photography]] site, allowing users, through a system of [[Electronic money|online credits]], to purchase and download images for a very low cost, often as low as [[US$]]1.

On the free stock.xchng website, results from the [[search engine]] would also bring up a sample of five images from Stockxpert to encourage users to purchase images from Stockxpert. Following the acquisition of Jupiterimages by Getty in 2009, stock.xchng presented search results from Getty's own microstock site, iStockphoto.

Stockxpert continued to operate as a separate website until its closure on February 11, 2010.

==Parent companies==

The site was a subsidiary of [[HAAP Media]], which was the stock photography division of [[Dream Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haap.hu|title=HAAP Media Ltd.|accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, HAAP was acquired by the stock photo company [[WebMediaBrands|Jupiterimages]]. In February 2009, Jupiterimages was purchased by [[Getty Images]],&lt;ref name="getty-feb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://company.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=192&amp;isource=corporate_website_ind_press_release |title=Jupitermedia Announces Completion Of Sale Of Jupiterimages To Getty Images and Change Of Jupitermedia Name to WebMediaBrands |date=2009-02-23 |publisher=Getty Images |accessdate=2009-08-13 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stock photo operations of SXC became a joint venture between Getty and Dream Interactive.&lt;ref name="dream-hu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dream.hu/aboutus|title=About us|publisher=Dream Interactive|accessdate=2009-08-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622234451/http://dream.hu/stockphoto/|archivedate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009 the founders decided to sell their remaining interest in the sites&lt;ref name="haap-sale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dreamcsoport.hu/stockphoto/|title=HAAP Media Ltd Announces Full Acquisition by Getty Images|publisher=Dream Group|date=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later started a similar service, [[Stockfresh]].&lt;ref name="haap-sale-2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockphototalk.com/the_stock_photo_industry_/2010/06/dream-group-launches-new-stock-photo-site-stockfreshcom.html|title=Dream Group Launches New Stock Photo Site Stockfresh.com|publisher=StockPhotoTalk|date=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gallerie dell'Accademia''' is a museum gallery of pre-19th-century art in [[Venice]], [[northern Italy]]. It is housed in the Scuola della Carità on the south bank of the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], within the [[sestiere]] of [[Dorsoduro]]. It was originally the gallery of the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia]], the art academy of Venice, from which it became independent in 1879, and for which the [[Ponte dell'Accademia]] and the Accademia boat landing station for the ''[[vaporetto]]'' water bus are named. The two institutions remained in the same building until 2004, when the art school moved to the [[Ospedale degli Incurabili, Venice|Ospedale degli Incurabili]].

==History==

===Early history===
{{main|Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia}}
The Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia was founded on 24 September 1750; the statute dates from 1756.&lt;ref name=acc&gt;[http://www.accademiavenezia.it/accademia.php?id=1 Accademia di belle arti di Venezia, 1750–2010. Cenni storici] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113170828/http://www.accademiavenezia.it/accademia.php?id=1 |date=2013-11-13 }} (in Italian). Accademia di belle arti di Venezia. Accessed July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The first director was [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]]; [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Gianbattista Tiepolo]] became the first president after his return from [[Würzburg]].&lt;ref name=viola&gt;Elisa Viola (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?ei=cofZUe3TGIeK7AbZ94GYAw&amp;id=4UtNAAAAYAAJ ''L'Accademia di Venezia: i maestri, le collezioni, le sedi''] (in Italian). Venezia: Marsilio. {{ISBN|9788831786553}}. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the first institutions to study [[art restoration]] starting in 1777 with Pietro Edwards, and formalised by 1819 as a course.

In 1807 the academy was re-founded by [[Napoleon]]ic decree. The name was changed from Veneta Academia di Pittura, Scultura e Architettura to Accademia Reale di Belle Arti, "royal academy of fine arts", and the academy was moved to the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] complex of the [[Scuola della Carità]], where the Gallerie dell'Accademia are still housed. The collections of the Accademia were first opened to the public on 10 August 1817.&lt;ref name=acc/&gt;&lt;ref name=polo&gt;[http://www.polomuseale.venezia.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/145/storia-delle-collezioni Gallerie dell'Accademia: Storia delle collezioni] (in Italian). Soprintendenza Speciale per il Patrimonio storico, artistico ed etnoantropologico e per il Polo Museale della città di Venezia e dei comuni della Gronda lagunare, 7 October 2009. Accessed July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later history===
The Gallerie dell'Accademia became independent from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia in 1879. Like other state museums in Italy, it falls under the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (Italy)|Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali]], the Italian ministry of culture and heritage.

==Building==

[[Image:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1487)]]
The Napoleonic administration had disbanded many institutions in Venice including some churches, convents and [[Scuole Grandi of Venice|Scuole]]. The Scuola della Carità, the [[Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi]] and the church of Santa Maria della Carità thus became the home of the Accademia. The Scuola della Carità was the oldest of the six [[Scuole Grandi of Venice|Scuole Grandi]] and the building dates back to 1343, though the scuola was formed in 1260. The Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi was started in 1561 by [[Andrea Palladio]], though it was never fully completed. The facade of Santa Maria della Carità was completed in 1441 by [[Bartolomeo Bon]].

[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A gloss is a marginal notation regarding the main text in a document. Shown is a parchment page from the Royal Library of Copenhagen.]]
A '''gloss''' ({{ety|la|glossa}}; {{ety|gre|''γλῶσσα'' glōssa|language}}) is a brief notation, especially a [[marginalia|marginal]] one or an [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] one, of the meaning of a word or wording in a text. It may be in the language of the text, or in the reader's language if that is different. 

A collection of glosses is a ''[[glossary]].'' A collection of medieval legal glosses, made by [[glossators]], is called an ''apparatus''. The compilation of glosses into glossaries was the beginning of [[lexicography]], and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses. The [[German Romanticism|German Romantic movement]] used the expression of gloss for poems commenting on a given other piece of poetry, often in the Spanish [[Décima]] style. 

Glosses were originally notes made in the margin or between the lines of a text in a [[classical language]]; the meaning of a word or passage is explained by the gloss. As such, glosses vary in thoroughness and complexity, from simple marginal notations of words one reader found difficult or obscure, to interlinear [[translation]]s of a text with cross references to similar passages. Today [[bracket#Parentheses|parenthetical]] explanations in [[scientific writing]] and [[technical writing]] are also often called glosses. [[Hyperlink]]s to a [[glossary]] sometimes supersede them.

==Etymology==
The word "gloss" was first used in the 1570s to refer to the insertion of a word as an explanation. It began to be used to mean to "explain away" in the 1630s, and originated from the concept of a note being inserted in the margin of a text to explain a difficult word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.etymonline.com/word/gloss|title=Gloss|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Biblical gloss}}
Glosses and other marginal notes were a primary format used in medieval Biblical [[theology]], and were studied and memorized for their own merit. Many Biblical passages came to be associated with a particular gloss, whose truth was taken to be scriptural. Indeed, in one case, it is generally reckoned that an early gloss explicating the doctrine of the Trinity made its way into the Scriptural text itself, in the passage known as the "three heavenly witnesses" or the ''[[Comma Johanneum]]'', which is present in the Vulgate Latin and the third and later editions of the Greek [[Textus Receptus]] collated by Erasmus (the first two editions excluded it for lack of manuscript evidence), but is absent from all modern critical reconstructions of the New Testament text, such as [[Westcott and Hort]], [[Tischendorf]], and [[Nestle-Aland]].

==In law==
{{See also|Glossator}}
In the medieval legal tradition, the glosses on [[Roman law]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] created standards of reference, so-called ''sedes materiae'' (literally: seat of the matter). In [[common law]] countries, the term "judicial gloss" refers to what is considered an authoritative or "official" [[Statutory interpretation|interpretation]] of a statute or regulation by a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial glosses are often very important in avoiding contradictions between statutes, and determining the [[constitutionality]] of various provisions of law.

==In literature==
A gloss, or ''glosa'', is a verse in traditional [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] literature and music which follows and comments on a refrain (the "''mote''"). See also [[villancico]].

==In philology==
[[Image:Codiceemil.jpg|thumb|The [[Glosas Emilianenses]] are glosses added to this Latin codex that are now considered the first phrases written in the [[Castilian language]].]]
Glosses are of some importance in [[philology]], especially if one language&amp;mdash;usually, the language of the author of the gloss&amp;mdash;has left few texts of its own. The [[Reichenau Glosses]], for example, gloss the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] [[Bible]] in an early form of one of the [[Romance languages]], and as such give insight into late [[Vulgar Latin]] at a time when that language was not often written down. A series of glosses in the [[Old English language]] to Latin Bibles give us a running translation of Biblical texts in that language; see ''[[Old English Bible translations]]''. Glosses of Christian religious texts are also important for our knowledge of [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. Glosses frequently shed valuable light on the vocabulary of otherwise little attested languages; they are less reliable for [[syntax]], because many times the glosses follow the word order of the original text, and translate its [[idiom]]s literally.

==In linguistics{{anchor|In linguistics}}==
{{Main|Interlinear gloss}}
In [[linguistics]], a simple gloss in running text may be marked by quotation marks and follow the transcription of a foreign word. Single quotes are a widely used convention.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle. 2004. ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; For example: 

* A [[Cossack]] longboat is called a ''chaika'' 'seagull'.
* The [[moose]] gains its name from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] ''mus'' or ''mooz'' ('twig eater').

A longer or more complex transcription may rely upon an ''[[interlinear gloss]]''.  Such a gloss may be placed between a [[text corpus|text]] and its translation when it is important to understand the structure of the language being glossed, and not just the overall meaning of the passage.

===Glossing sign languages{{anchor|Glossing signed languages}}{{anchor|Glossing sign languages}}===
[[Sign language]]s are typically transcribed word-for-word by means of a gloss written in the predominant oral language in all capitals; [[American Sign Language]] and [[Auslan]] would be written in English. [[Prosody (linguistics)|Prosody]] is often glossed as superscript words, with its scope indicated by brackets. 

{{quotation|[I LIKE]&lt;sup&gt;NEGATIVE&lt;/sup&gt; [WHAT?]&lt;sup&gt;RHETORICAL&lt;/sup&gt;, GARLIC.
&lt;br&gt;"I don't like garlic."}}

Pure [[fingerspelling]] is usually indicated by hyphenation.  Fingerspelled words that have been lexicalized (that is, fingerspelling sequences that have entered the sign language as linguistic units and that often have slight modifications) are indicated with a hash.  For example, ''W-I-K-I'' indicates a simple fingerspelled word, but ''#JOB'' indicates a lexicalized unit, produced like ''J-O-B'', but faster, with a barely perceptible ''O'' and turning the "B" hand palm side in, unlike a regularly fingerspelled "B".

'''Hitar Petar''' or '''Itar Pejo''' ({{lang-bg|Хитър Петър}}, {{lang-mk|Итар Пејо}}, "Sly Peter/Pejo") is a character of [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonia]]n [[folklore]]. He is a poor village farmhand, but possesses remarkable slyness, wit and wile. He is often presented as the "typical Bulgarian" in Bulgaria and the "typical Macedonian" in Macedonia. He is the perpetual antagonist of either the rich nobles, clerics and money lenders or the "typical [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]"&amp;nbsp;— [[Nasreddin]], whom he always manages to outwit. He is therefore regarded as a strictly positive figure and a hero of the common folk. 

As a character, Hitar Petar first appeared in the 16th–17th century, when Bulgaria was still under Ottoman rule. Tales on his deeds are present in the folklore of many regions, including [[Dobrudja]] and [[Thrace]]. It is generally thought that the original Hitar Petar lived somewhere in present-day North-Western Bulgaria. He was introduced to literature, with Iliya Blaskov publishing several anecdotes involving him. His feats were adapted to an [[opera]] in 1967 and two [[comedy film]]s, ''Nastradin Hodzha i Hitar Petar'' of [[1939 in film|1939]] and ''Hitar Petar'' of [[1960 in film|1960]].

Hitar Petar is similar to other characters of European and Oriental folklore, most notably [[Nasreddin]] of [[Islam]]ic folklore, the [[German folklore|German]] [[Till Eulenspiegel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/FolktalesEurope.htm|title=Seven Folktales From Central Europe |publisher=[[University of Calgary]]|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hungarian mythology|Hungarian]] [[Peter Trickster|Csalóka Péter]] and the [[Jewish mythology|Jewish]] [[Hershele Ostropoler]].

In the Republic of Macedonia, it is thought that Itar Pejo is a native of the region of [[Mariovo]], and a monument to the character was built in [[Prilep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=F4E65D711A749640947A49917255BBD2|title=Прилеп ќе гради споменик на Итар Пејо|publisher=[[Dnevnik (Skopje)|Дневник]]|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hitar Petar Nunatak]] on [[Trinity Peninsula]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after the folklore character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/ SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cover of Komputeko book, edition 2008.jpg|thumbnail|Cover of the Komputeko book, edition 2008]]
'''Komputeko''' is an online project of the non-profit youth organization [[E@I]] (“Education@Internet”) with the goal of bringing together parallel computer terminology from various dictionaries in order to facilitate access to and comparison between different translations and thus promote exact use of language and counteract the (often sloppy) usage of linguistic borrowings from American English. ''Komputeko'' is short for the Esperanto noun phrase "Pri''kompu''tila ''te''rmino''ko''lekto", meaning "collection of computer terms". The dictionary is written in five languages ([[Esperanto]], [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]), and there are plans to expand it into other languages. A preliminary version with a few other languages already exists.&lt;ref&gt;An English-Esperanto-Spanish-Catalan-Polish version can be found at https://komputeko.net/varianto1/index_eo.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of Komputeko ==
The Esperanto dictionaries and word lists on which Komputeko is based are the ''Komputada Leksikono'' ("Computing Lexicon") by Sergio Pokrovskij (Сергей Покровский), the crowd-sourced ''[[Reta Vortaro]]'' ("Internet Dictionary", ReVo, the ''[[Plena Ilustrita Vortaro de Esperanto]]'' ("Complete Illustrated Dictionary of Esperanto", PIV), the Internet mini-dictionary of the ''Flandra Esperanto-Ligo'', the ''Techniczny Słownik Polsko Esperancki'' ("Polish-Esperanto Technical Dictionary") by Jerzy Wałaszek, the three-volume [[Pekoteko]] collection of terminology, Bill Walker's ''Komputilo Vortolisto''&lt;ref name="kovo"&gt;Bill Walker, ''[http://home2.btconnect.com/ukc802510745/eo/vortlist/kompvort.htm Komputilo Vortolisto]'' ("list of computing words")&lt;/ref&gt; and a Dutch-Esperanto dictionary. It also takes into account the terminology used in articles from the [[Esperanto Wikipedia]].

The promoter of the project, Yves Nevelsteen, among other things, joined the Esperanto translation team for the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[office suite|productivity suite]] [[OpenOffice.org]], the [[social networking]] site [[Ipernity]] and the [[content management system]] [[Drupal]] in order to make these teams' work product more widely available through Komputeko.

== Usage of Komputeko ==
Among scholars who have acknowledged the utility of the Komputeko project are [[John C. Wells]], who authored both the Teach Yourself Books' ''Concise Esperanto and English Dictionary'' (1969) and the concise yet comprehensive English-Esperanto-English Dictionary (Mondial, 2010), and Paul Peeraerts, who translated the interface of [[Ipernity]] and [[Facebook]] into Esperanto and who has served as editorial secretary of the Esperanto-language monthly ''[[Monato]]''. Others who have availed themselves of Komputeko include Cindy McKee's [[KDE]] and [[Joomla]] translation teams, [[Esperanto Wikipedia]] founder Chuck Smith's [[Drupal]] translation and the former Amikumu projects, Tim Morley's [[OpenOffice.org]] translation team, Guillaume Savaton's [[GNOME]] translation team, the translation teams for [[Plone (software)|Plone]] and [[Xfce]], and Joop Kiefte's [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] translation team.

The '''Berlin Art Library''' ({{lang-de|Kunstbibliothek Berlin}}) is an agency of the [[Berlin State Museums]] under the auspices of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]]. It has approximately 400,000 volumes and ranks among Germany's leading institutions specializing in the literature of [[Art History]]. The library is located on the [[Kulturforum]] in [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Berlin-Tiergarten]], [[Germany]] and attracts 35,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smb.museum/smb/sammlungen/details.php?objID=6&amp;lang=de | title=SMB Kunstbibliothek |trans-title=Art Library of the Berlin State Museums| date= | publisher=SMB | language=German | accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library also has a comprehensive photographic collection. Its holdings date back to the very early days of photography, through [[Pictorialism]] around the late 19th and early 20th centuries, through the [[Neues Sehen]] or ''New Vision'' of the 1920s, to the new artistic styles of the present day. Since June 2004, the collection has held exhibitions under the same roof as the [[Helmut Newton Foundation]] at the [[Museum of Photography, Berlin|Museum of Photography]] opposite the [[Zoologischer Garten]] station. After a complete restoration of the [[Kaisersaal]], the Art Library Photographic Collection now has its own exhibition space.

Selections of works from the library's many other collections are regularly presented in special exhibitions. The neighboring [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]] (Museum of Prints and Drawings) concentrates primarily on fine art drawings and prints. The Art Library does not circulate, but its collections can be viewed upon request in the Art Library's study room.

==The collections==
The Art Library acquires and researches scientific literature on the history of European art from late antiquity to the present. The collection also includes:

*1,400 current international periodicals
*Architectural drawings
*Drawings and prints in the field of [[Applied arts]]
*The [[Lipperheide Costume Library]]
*Posters and advertisements
*Graphic and Book design collections
*Photographic Collection
**Historic photographs archive,
**Collection of artistic photography
**Personal bequests archive
**Photogrammetric holdings
**Historical postcards from the 19th and 20th century.

==Embedded==
Notable [[Custom firmware|custom-firmware]] projects for [[wireless router]]s.
Many of these will run on various brands such as Linksys, Asus, Netgear, etc. 

* [[OpenWrt]] – Customizable [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]] firmware written from scratch; features a combined [[SquashFS]]/[[JFFS2]] file system and the package manager [[opkg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenWrt – Wireless Freedom|url=http://openwrt.org/|website=OpenWrt.org|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 3000 available packages (Linux/[[GNU Public License|GPL]]); now merged with [[LEDE]]
** [[Commotion Wireless]] – FOSS mesh networking
** [[DD-WRT]] – Based on OpenWrt kernel since v. 23 (Dec. 2005), paid and free versions available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DD-WRT project site|url=http://www.dd-wrt.com/|website=DD-WRT.com|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Gargoyle (router firmware)|Gargoyle]] – A free OpenWrt-based Linux distribution for a range of Broadcom and Atheros chipset based wireless routers
** [[LEDE]] – A fork of the OpenWrt project that shares many of the same goals; now merged into [[OpenWrt]]
** [[LibreCMC]] – An [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]]-endorsed derivation of OpenWRT with the proprietary blobs removed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free GNU/Linux distributions|url=https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html|website=GNU.org|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Roofnet]] – A now defunct experimental 802.11 based mesh network project developed at the [[MIT|Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] [[Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]]. The technology developed by the Roofnet project formed the basis for the company [[Meraki]] that is now owned by [[Cisco]].
* [[DebWRT]] – Combines the Linux kernel from [[OpenWrt]] and the [[package management system]] from [[Debian]] (Linux/GPL)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DebWRT project site|url=http://www.debwrt.net/|website=DebWRT.net|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[HyperWRT]] – Early power-boosting firmware project to stay close to the official [[Linksys WRT54G series|WRT54G and WRT54GS]] firmware but add features such as transmit power, port triggers, scripts, telnet, etc.
** [[Tomato (firmware)|Tomato]] – The successor to HyperWRT, features advanced QoS as well as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] graphs

'''Lonely Planet''' is a large travel [[guide book]] publisher.&lt;ref name=Fildes /&gt; The Lonely Planet books were the third series of travel books aimed at [[backpacking (travel)|backpackers]] and other low-cost travellers, after the ''[[Let's Go (book series)|Let's Go]]'' travel guide series that was founded in 1960, and the [[BIT (alternative information centre)#BIT Guide|BIT Guides]] from 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ahead of the crowd: Thirty years of Lonely Planet in India | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/asia/ahead-of-the-crowd-thirty-years-of-lonely-planet-in-india-2363620.html |publisher=Independent | author=Tony Wheeler | date=30 September 2011 | accessdate=9 November 2016 | quote =  BIT Guides were what travellers used before Lonely Planet and Rough Guides came along.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2011}}, the company had sold 120 million books since inception and by early 2014, it had sold around 11&amp;nbsp;million units of its travel [[Mobile app|app]]s.&lt;ref name="Out" /&gt;

== History ==

===Early years===
[[File:Lonely Planet Australia travel guide 16th Edition.png|left|thumb|upright|Lonely Planet's guide to Australia (16th edition, 2011)]]
Lonely Planet was founded by married couple [[Maureen Wheeler|Maureen]] and [[Tony Wheeler]]. Tony Wheeler graduated from the [[University of Warwick]] and [[London Business School]], and was a former engineer at the [[Chrysler]] corporation. The pair met in London in 1970 and, in July 1972, they embarked on an overland trip through Europe and Asia, eventually arriving in Australia in December 1972. The route that they followed was first undertaken by vehicle on the 1955 [[Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition|Oxford-Cambridge Overland Expedition]].&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;&lt;ref name=MacLean /&gt;

The company name originated from Tony Wheeler's appreciation of a [[Mondegreen|misheard line]] in "Space Captain", a song written by Matthew Moore, and first popularized by [[Joe Cocker]] and [[Leon Russell]] on the "Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen" tour of 1970—the actual lyrics are "lovely planet".&lt;ref name=Wheeler1 /&gt; Lonely Planet's first book, ''Across Asia on the Cheap'',&lt;ref name=fundinguniverse /&gt; consisting of 94 pages, was written by the couple in their home.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt; The original print run consisted of stapled booklets and sold out.&lt;ref name="Emily"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Lonely Planet Founder Looks Back|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/travel/a-lonely-planet-founder-looks-back.html|accessdate=26 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 June 2013|author=Emily Brennan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the original booklet, Tony Wheeler returned to Asia with the deliberate intention of writing a travel guide and ''Across Asia on the Cheap: A Complete Guide to Making the Overland Trip'' was published in 1975.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Wheeler|title=Across Asia on the Cheap: A Complete Guide to Making the Overland Trip|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9FENHQAACAAJ|year=1975|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|isbn=978-0-9598080-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007 ''Observer'' writer Carol Cadwalladr—who also coauthored ''Travellers' Survival Kit Lebanon''—described the book as "canonical".&lt;ref name="Car"&gt;{{cite news|title=Journey's end for the guidebook gurus?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/oct/07/escape.travelbooks|accessdate=26 May 2014|newspaper=The Observer|date=7 October 2007|author=Carole Cadwalladr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Across Asia on the Cheap'' offered the advice of amateur travelers who had completed the overland trip from London to Sydney in just under six months. The Wheelers offer practical advice, such as the importance of not mentioning "arch enemies, Iran or Israel" in [[Iraq]], as it is a "very hard-line socialist Arab country"; casual observations, such as their description of Singapore as a "groovy place"; tips of an illegal nature, such as where to obtain fake identification or an explanation of why one should have their "last drag" of the drug [[cannabis]] before they arrive at the Iranian border; and emergency options for people in need of money, whereby places that "have a good price for blood" are identified.&lt;ref name="Out" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

During the 1970s, traveling was considered an aspect of the [[counterculture]] and Tony Wheeler said in 2013: "The boomers were setting off to places their parents hadn't gone." What became known as the "[[hippie trail]]" was a popular route for such travelers, as the price of travel dropped and numerous Asian travel companies were launched.&lt;ref name="Emily" /&gt; Cadwalladr explained in 2007 that the introduction of the ''Across Asia on the Cheap'' booklet was "a generational call to arms", as it contained Tony Wheeler's motivational cry: "All you've got to do is decide to go and the hardest part is over. So go." Cadwalladr further states that Wheeler's peers throughout the world subsequently made the decision to travel, regardless of whether they possessed a Lonely Planet guide. Other travel guide brand names also emerged in the early 1970s, such as [[Rough Guides]] and [[Bradt Travel Guides|Bradt]].&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt;

The popularity of the hippy trail, combined with the success of the original Lonely Planet publications, led the Wheelers to further develop the brand they had founded. The couple discovered writers in bars and also told people that if they could return to Australia with a completed book, then Lonely Planet would publish it. Tony Wheeler explained: "You couldn’t just look for travel book writers because they weren’t out there. There wasn’t such an animal. We just told people that if you turn up in a year and a half with a book, we’ll publish it, and we did. It was very rough and ready."&lt;ref name="Emily" /&gt; The popularity of the overland route taken by the Wheelers in 1972 declined when [[Iran]]'s borders closed in 1979.&lt;ref name=bailey /&gt;&lt;ref name=MacLean /&gt;

=== Expansion ===
The Lonely Planet guide book series initially expanded in Asia, with the India guide book that was first published in 1981,&lt;ref name=Steves /&gt; but progressively became a dominant brand in the rest of the world, as consumers appreciated the way that the manner in which the guides were written—as former CEO Judy Slatyer explained: "telling it like it is, without fear or favor."&lt;ref name="Out" /&gt; Wheeler explained in 2013, as part of the brand's 40-year anniversary, that working with the company's early writers, who were primarily travelers, was often challenging:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One writer came back with a 600-page guide to Jamaica—every pirate who stopped in got his biography—and we had to cut it by two-thirds ... For a long time we had a problem that every writer wanted to rewrite the history. We’d say, “Why are we rewriting the history of India for the 10th time? Surely, it’s not changing every two years.&lt;ref name="Emily" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2007 interview, Tony Wheeler discussed one of the original Lonely Planet writers, [[Geoff Crowther]], who wrote guides for India, South America, Africa and Korea. Crowther was renowned for frequently inserting his opinions into the text of the guides he wrote, giving the guide books real, gritty and un-politically-correct passion and sometimes covering topics such as where to purchase the best hashish. His writing was instrumental to the rise of Lonely Planet. The journalist used the term "Geoffness", in tribute to Crowther, to describe a quality that has been lost in travel guides.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt; 

By 1999, Lonely Planet had sold 30 million copies of its travel guides and, by this stage, the company was recognized beyond hippie trail adventurers, and wealthier readers were an established part of the readership. The company's authors consequently benefited from profit-sharing and expensive events were held at the Melbourne office, at which limousines would arrive, filled with Lonely Planet employees.&lt;ref name="Out" /&gt; By 2007, Lonely Planet had officially been classified as a "Superbrand", having published over 500 titles and had sold 80&amp;nbsp;million titles, translated into more than eight languages.

=== Purchase by BBC Worldwide ===
In October 2007, the Wheelers and Australian businessman [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]], who became a shareholder in 1999, sold a 75% stake in the company to [[BBC Worldwide]], the commercial arm of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]. The stake was worth an estimated £63&amp;nbsp;million at the time.&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt; At the same time, a [[put option]] was negotiated on the remaining 25%.&lt;ref name="bbc-pr-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=theage /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt; The owners of a put option (eg the Wheelers and Singleton) have the right to sell a specified amount of an underlying security (eg the remaining 25%) at a specified price within a specified time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Put Option|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp|work=Investopedia|publisher=IAC|accessdate=26 May 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was led by David King, chief financial officer, and Ian Watson, International Director, and advice was provided by [[Deloitte]] Corporate Finance and [[Ashurst LLP|Blake, Dawson Waldron]] in Australia.&lt;ref name="bbc-pr-2007" /&gt; Managing director of BBC Worldwide's global brands division, Marcus Arthur, who became the chairman of Lonely Planet after the finalization of the agreement, explained in 2011 that implementing a put option arrangement allowed the BBC "to benefit from the Wheelers' experience over the last three and a half years," further explaining that the founding couple "supported Lonely Planet's ongoing migration from a traditional book publisher to a multi-platform brand."&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC to buy out Lonely Planet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/18/bbc-worldwide-lonely-planet-travel-guides|accessdate=26 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 February 2011|author=Mark Sweney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the BBC press release, published on 1 October 2007, the BBC Worldwide CEO at the time, [[John Smith (BBC executive)|John Smith]], explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lonely Planet is a highly respected international brand and a global leader in the provision of travel information. This deal fits well with our strategy to create one of the world's leading content businesses, to grow our portfolio of content brands online and to increase our operations in Australia and America.&lt;ref name=bbc-pr-2007&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Worldwide acquires Lonely Planet|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2007/10_october/lonely_planet.shtml|work=BBC Worldwide Press Release|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Wheelers also shared their motivation in the press release, stating: "we felt that BBC Worldwide would provide a platform true to our vision and values, while allowing us to take the business to the next level."&lt;ref name="bbc-pr-2007" /&gt; The founders have since written an autobiographical book titled ''Once While Travelling: The Lonely Planet Story''&lt;ref name=Wheeler2 /&gt; (known as ''Unlikely Destinations: The Lonely Planet story'' in North America),&lt;ref name=Wheeler1 /&gt; describing their relationship, their initial overland journey and the founding of Lonely Planet.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Slatyer was the CEO of Lonely Planet at the time and, in addition to the Melbourne headquarters, offices existed in the U.S. and the U.K. The company was publishing 500 titles and the "next level" that the Wheelers referred to involved ventures such as the production of the third season of its flagship television series, ''Lonely Planet Six Degrees''—in partnership with Discovery Networks and screened in over 100 countries—the company's website, which was attracting 4.3&amp;nbsp;million unique visitors each month, and the further development of ''lonelyplanet.tv'', Lonely Planet's travel video website that was used by an online community of travelers, who could upload and watch their own videos, as well as those created by Lonely Planet.&lt;ref name="bbc-pr-2007" /&gt;

Also in 2007, companies in the same category were making significant changes to their business operations. In early 2007, Bradt guides founder Hilary Bradt announced her retirement, alongside veteran independent publisher Charles James of Vacation Work—both founded their companies in the early 1970s like the Wheelers. Then, shortly before the Lonely Planet deal, the owners of Rough Guides sold their 25-year-old company to [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref name="Car" /&gt; Slatyer later reflected in 2014, in relation to the BBC acquisition: "We should have moved much more aggressively into creating a digital space where travelers could engage, interact, write their own guides".&lt;ref name="Out" /&gt;

The BBC deal also received a significant degree of criticism from rival media companies, such as Time Out and the Guardian Media Group, who argued that it represented an inappropriate expansion beyond the core programming and content of the media corporation. Such a sentiment was also evident within the BBC and the [[BBC Trust]] consequently ruled that similar acquisitions must not be sought out by the corporation's commercial arm in the future, unless "exceptional circumstances" are present. BBC Worldwide then struggled in the initial period following the acquisition, registering a £3.2&amp;nbsp;million loss in the year to the end of March 2009; however, the dire financial situation was eventually reversed with the implementation of a strategy that exploited new channels, such as Lonely Planet's non-print products.&lt;ref name="Mark" /&gt;

By the end of March 2010, profits of £1.9&amp;nbsp;million had been generated, as digital revenues had risen 37% year-on-year over the preceding 12 months, spinoff products such as a ''Lonely Planet'' magazine had grown and non-print revenues increased from 9% in 2007 to 22%. Lonely Planet's digital presence at this time included 140 apps and 8.5&amp;nbsp;million unique users for lonelyplanet.com, which hosted the well-known Thorn Tree travel forum.&lt;ref name="Mark" /&gt;

The eventual success achieved by BBC Worldwide led to the acquisition of the remaining 25% of the company, purchased for £42.1&amp;nbsp;million (A$67.2&amp;nbsp;million) from the Wheelers.&lt;ref name="Mark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="smh-business" /&gt; The ''Lonely Planet'' magazine, launched in 2008, was described by the managing director of BBC magazines as the "star of the show" and, at the time of the 25% acquisition, eight editions were printed globally and the existing circulation of 60,106 continued to significantly grow.&lt;ref name="Mark" /&gt;

===NC2 Media acquisition===
BBC Worldwide had been unable to sustain the success that it had achieved in 2010 by early 2012 and was interested in divesting itself of the company. Factors such as a global recession and the appreciation of the Australian dollar were cited as influential. Kelley noticed the opportunity and approached BBC Worldwide in April 2012 without an explanation for why he was interested in Lonely Planet. The BBC did not make an offer immediately, but in March 2013, the details of the sale were announced to the public.&lt;ref name="nc2sale"&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Worldwide sells Lonely Planet business at £80m loss|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21841479|accessdate=19 March 2013|work=''BBC News''|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 25-Year-Old at the Helm of Lonely Planet|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/The-25-Year-Old-at-the-Helm-of-Lonely-Planet.html|work=Outside Magazine|accessdate=26 May 2014|author=Charles Bethea|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2013, the BBC confirmed the sale of Lonely Planet to Kelley's NC2 Media for [[United States dollar|US$]]77.8&amp;nbsp;million (£51.5&amp;nbsp;million)—significantly less than the £130.2&amp;nbsp;million the BBC had paid for the company, at nearly an £80&amp;nbsp;million (US$118.89&amp;nbsp;million) loss.&lt;ref name="Eric"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Buyer for BBC's Book Unit on Travel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/business/media/bbc-to-sell-lonely-planet-travel-guidebooks.html|accessdate=26 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 March 2013|author=Eric Pfannner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC received £41.2&amp;nbsp;million (US$62.24&amp;nbsp;million) after the completion of the deal, followed by the remaining £10.3&amp;nbsp;million (U$15.56&amp;nbsp;million) twelve months later.&lt;ref name="nc2sale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Worldwide sells travel publisher Lonely Planet to NC2 Media at a loss of $119M|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/19/bbc-sells-travel-publisher-lonely-planet-to-nc2-media-at-a-loss-of-almost-80m/|work=The Next Web|publisher=The Next Web, Inc|accessdate=26 May 2014|author=Nick Summers|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC reassured the public that public money was not lost in the sale, as BBC Worldwide used its own money, rather than the BBC's main budget, which is primarily derived from a license fee on British television-owning households, to purchase Lonely Planet; however, as the ''New York Times'' reported, any financial losses impact upon the BBC's overall funding because all BBC Worldwide profits become part of the BBC's monetary assets. The Trust consequently initiated a review of the investment, while the Trust vice chairperson said to the media that "at the time of purchase there was a credible rationale for this deal."&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt; Tony Wheeler stated in 2014 that, upon reflection, the decline in the company's television production was a key aspect of the BBC's eventual inability to maintain profitability, explaining that innovation is "tough".&lt;ref name="Out" /&gt;

===Appointment of new CEO and restructure===
In mid-2011, before the Lonely Planet consideration, Kelley met with Daniel Houghton, a young photojournalism graduate—from Western Kentucky University, the same institution that Kelley attended. Based solely on a handshake agreement, Kelley hired Houghton to help establish media company NC2 Media—the name "NC2" is short for ''in situ'', meaning "in position" in [[Latin]]—which then launched its first venture OutwildTV, a website featuring sponsored expeditions, followed by a gear blog.&lt;ref name="Out" /&gt; Kelley eventually explained in 2014 that his hiring decision was based upon "a fortunate event" and Houghton's intense focus "on becoming something".&lt;ref name="Out"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 25-Year-Old at the Helm of Lonely Planet|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/The-25-Year-Old-at-the-Helm-of-Lonely-Planet.html|work=Outside Magazine|accessdate=26 May 2014|author=Charles Bethea|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the month before they first approached the BBC, Kelley bought a US$24-million, 12,000-square-foot studio facility to house NC2 Media. The Lonely Planet deal was closed in April 2013 and Houghton, appointed by Kelly as the head of the newly acquired operation, visited the company's international offices to acquaint himself with the global nature of the enterprise. Worldwide, staff members were bewildered by Houghton's appointment and one longtime Lonely Planet author wrote in 2014: "I figured there had to be more to the story than 'reclusive billionaire hires 24-year-old with no known experience to run the joint' . But I think it's as silly and fucked-up as it sounds.". At the London office, a visual taunt was projected onto a wall prior to Houghton's speech to the team.

Houghton then met with employees at the Footscray, Australia headquarters on 18 July 2013 to announce a restructuring process that would result in staff layoffs. He revealed to the media at the time that between 70 and 80 positions would be made redundant from the overall business. Houghton confirmed the ongoing existence of a Melbourne-based office, while the restructure occurred over a 6- to 12-month period following the July meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tearful Lonely Planet staff fear the worst after American buyout|url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/tearful-lonely-planet-staff-fear-the-worst-after-american-buyout-20130718-2q5dw.html|accessdate=22 July 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=18 July 2013|author=Deborah Gough}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, 75 of Lonely Planet's 383 full-time employees were made redundant. On 18 July, at the Footscray headquarters, Houghton "walked up in front of a microphone in Melbourne, where most of the redundancies occurred ... and told them, 'Today is going to be a really tough day.' "

===Houghton and NC2 Media era===

Tony Wheeler has publicly stated: "Certainly you don't want someone old and set in his ways—like me—at the controls". However, asking the rhetorical question" Is he [Houghton] the right 25-year-old? The jury is out on that one." Wheeler said that Houghton "seems a nice guy."&lt;ref name="Out" /&gt;

In November 2013, the company purchased the TouristEye app that is used for planning trips and offers guidance while people are traveling. Lonely Planet's new head of mobile products, Matthew McCroskey, explained, also in 2014:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... we have tons of information—all of Lonely Planet's historic content. And we're building really great technology to analyze that content and understand all the ways you can put it together ... You're in Rome, standing by the Colosseum. It's 3 P.M. on a Thursday in summer. You open your phone, and it says, "Hey, glad you enjoyed the Colosseum, which was on the itinerary we helped you make. We know you love coffee. Time for a cappuccino! The best cappuccino place in Rome is two blocks away. Here are walking instructions. And while you're walking, you should know: Don't order a cappuccino in the afternoon in Italy; they only drink them for breakfast, and they're going to think you're a stupid American. So you should get a macchiato. And this is how you ask for it." ... we've got most of the people who can deliver that kind of experience. And Daniel [Houghton] is finding more."&lt;ref name="Out" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2013 Lonely Planet acquired Budget Travel to expand its international magazine presence for the US market and launch a US edition. In 2015 Lonely Planet Magazine launched in the United States, expanding the number of global edition to 12.

In January 2016, a mobile app called Guides launched and reached number 6 in the travel category of Apple's app store. In February 2016, the company launched its released a new version of destinations on lonelyplanet.com.

===Internet presence{{Anchor|Thorn Tree}}===
Lonely Planet's online community, the Thorn Tree,&lt;ref name=ThornTree /&gt; was created in 1996. It is named for a Naivasha thorn tree (''[[Acacia xanthophloea]]'') that has been used as a message board for the city of [[Nairobi]], Kenya since 1902.&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickBewer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Fitzpatrick|author2=Tim Bewer|author3=Matthew Firestone|title=East Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3e8P7XvcokC&amp;pg=PA288|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-769-1|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree still exists in the [[Stanley Hotel, Nairobi|Stanley Hotel]]. It is used by over 600,000 travelers to share their experiences and look for advice. Thorn Tree has many different forum categories including different countries, places to visit depending on one's interests, travel buddies, and Lonely Planet support. The Lonely Planet website includes travel articles, destination and point of interest guides, hotel, hostel and accommodations listings, and the ability to rate and review sites and restaurants.

Lonely Planet temporarily closed the Thorn Tree community on 22 December 2012, with a notification stating: "We're sorry to let you know we've found it necessary to temporarily close the Thorn Tree section of Lonelyplanet.com as it has come to our attention that a number of posts do not conform to the standards of the Lonely Planet website. As soon as we have completed the necessary editorial and technical updates we will let you know but in the meantime we are very grateful for your understanding and patience." Later, Lonely Planet clarified the alert to say that it had found numerous posts containing "inappropriate language and themes," and the site would be reopened once these posts were found and deleted.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Andrew. [https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/bbc-shuts-down-thorn-tree-travel-forum-on-lonely-planet-website-over-uncomfortable-themes-8431501.html BBC shuts down Thorn Tree travel forum]. 26 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Thorn Tree returned on 5 January 2013, having shut forums they felt were non-travel related.&lt;ref name=ThornTreeReturn&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/01/07/lonely-planet-thorn-tree-reopens_n_2426810.html Lonely Planet Thorn Tree Reopens]. 7 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the forum is regulated regularly and allows users to flag responses they deem inappropriate or not relevant.

The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported that a disgruntled former user alerted the BBC to numerous posts related to [[paedophilia]]. A source close to Lonely Planet management told the ''Herald'' that BBC executives still smarting from the [[Jimmy Savile scandal]] went into "full freak out, panic attack mode" over posts about the age of consent in Mexico and child prostitution in Thailand. However, a BBC Worldwide spokesman denied there was any evidence of paedophilia discussions on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Moses, Asher. [http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/lonely-planet-shuts-thorn-tree-forum-over-paedophilia-posts-20121226-2bvtd.html Lonely Planet shuts Thorn Tree forum 'over paedophilia posts']. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC subsequently stated that the cause of the shutdown wasn't paedophilia, but general concern with language and themes that the BBC was "uncomfortable" with.&lt;ref name=ThornTreeReturn/&gt;

===Magazine===
In 2009, Lonely Planet began publishing a monthly travel magazine called ''Lonely Planet Traveller'' in the UK, and in 2010, it launched the Indian&lt;ref name=sify /&gt; and the Argentine&lt;ref name=Paris /&gt; editions. Its Korean edition, with a digital edition for iPad, was launched in March 2011.&lt;ref name="Korea" /&gt; Its Chinese version was launched in Mainland China in Aug 2012. In October 2014, Lonely Planet announced a U.S. version of the travel magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clampet |first1=Jason |url=http://skift.com/2014/11/03/skift-forum-video-lonely-planets-ceo-on-the-future-of-travel-content/ |title=Skift Forum Video: Lonely Planet's CEO on the Future of Travel Content|website=''skift.com'' |date= 3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
Lonely Planet also has its own television production company, which has produced numerous series, such as ''The Sport Traveller'', ''Going Bush'', ''Vintage New Zealand'', and ''Bluelist Australia'', along with the following:
* ''[[Globe Trekker]]'' – television series (also known as ''Pilot Guides'') inspired by and originally broadcast under the name ''Lonely Planet''
* ''[[Lonely Planet Six Degrees]]'' – hosted by Asha Gill and [[Toby Amies]]
* ''[[Lonely Planet: Roads Less Travelled]]'' – A co-production between Singapore's Beach House and Lonely Planet Television, airing on the National Geographic Adventure Channel 2009–2010, RLT is a reality-based travel series following nine LP guidebook authors and photographers.&lt;ref name=natgeotv /&gt;

== Controversies ==
A mention in a Lonely Planet guidebook can draw large numbers of travellers, which changes places mentioned. For example, Lonely Planet has been blamed for the rise of what is sometimes referred to as 'the [[Banana Pancake Trail]]' in South East Asia.&lt;ref name=hackwriters /&gt;&lt;ref name=Priestley /&gt; 

In 1996, in response to a "Visit Myanmar" campaign by the [[State Peace and Development Council|Burmese military government]], the Burmese opposition [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) and its leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] called for a tourism boycott.&lt;ref name="smh-opposition"&gt;Read more: http://www.smh.com.au/world/suu-kyis-party-ends-opposition-to-tourism-20110529-1fasg.html&lt;/ref&gt; As the publication of Lonely Planet's guidebook to [[Myanmar]] ([[Burma]]) is seen by some as an encouragement to visit that country, this led to calls for a boycott of Lonely Planet.&lt;ref name=NewsLimited /&gt; Lonely Planet's view is that it highlights the issues surrounding a visit to the country, and that it wants to make sure that readers make an informed decision.&lt;ref name=responsible /&gt; In 2009, the NLD formally dropped its previous stance and now welcomes visitors "who are keen to promote the welfare of the common people".&lt;ref name="smh-opposition"/&gt;

==In popular culture ==
In April 2008, American writer [[Thomas Kohnstamm]] published the memoir ''[[Do Travel Writers Go to Hell?]]'', which touched on his experience writing a guide book for Lonely Planet in Brazil. After a review of Kohnstamm's guidebooks, publisher Piers Pickard agreed that no inaccuracies had been found.&lt;ref name=dailytelegraph /&gt;

In 2009, Australian author and former Lonely Planet guidebook writer [[Mic Looby]] published a fictional account of the guidebook-writing business, entitled ''[[Paradise Updated]]'', in which the travel guide industry is satirised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guest review: Elena Gomez on Mic Looby’s Paradise Updated|url=http://blogs.crikey.com.au/literaryminded/2009/10/13/guest-review-elena-gomez-on-mic-loobys-paradise-updated/|work=Crikey Blog|publisher=Private Media Pty Ltd|accessdate=20 September 2013|author=Angela Myer|author2=Elena Gomez |date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alexandre Millerand Letter''' was written by French Prime Minister [[Alexandre Millerand]] and was an annex to the [[Trianon Treaty]]. It stated that the border amendments made by the Trianon Treaty were not final, and could be reviewed in the future. This give the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] government the false impression that the treaty itself was only temporary, and so the delegation signed the treaty on June 4, 1920.

==Millerand, the Chairman of the Conference of Ambassadors==
On March 8, 1920, the [[Council of Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors]] discussed for the last time the new borders of Hungary in [[London]], and Millerand was the chairman. [[Lloyd George]] questioned the viability of such border modifications, but [[Philippe Berthelot]] refused to do any adjustment at the last moment, so as a compromise, the council produced the Millerand Letter, as an annex to the Treaty. The letter stated: "in order to preempt any further discussion regarding territory, that the eventual modification of the designated boundaries would be referred to the boundary committees in accordance with the same conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kiraly, B. K., Pastor, P., Sanders, I |title=A Case Study on Trianon |chapter=The Causes and Consequences of Trianon: A Re-Examination |chapter-url=http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/tria/tria07.htm |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter stated: "Examinations are to be done locally, and in some cases it might be necessary to move the borders stated in the treaty... if the border committees ... come to the conclusion ... that the declarations of the treaty are unfair, then they will have the possibility to report it to the Council of the [[League of Nations]]. In this case the [[Entente Powers]] agree to that, on request to one party involved, the ''League of Nations will offer its services to retain the original border, with the same conditions, in a peaceful way'', in locations where the Council decides so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Suba |first1=Janos |title=Magyarország trianoni határainak kitűzése |publisher=RubiconOnline |url=http://www.rubicon.hu/magyar/oldalak/magyarorszag_trianoni_hatarainak_kituzese/ |language=Hungarian |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The consequences of this annex were adverse for Hungary. It fed [[Hungarian revisionism]] and speeded up the signing and [[ratification]] of the Treaty both in the [[Hungarian Parliament]] and in [[England]] and [[France]].

[[Léon Blum]], politician of the [[French Socialist Party]], published in the French newspaper ''Populaire'' that the cost of the help of Millerand would be to put the [[Hungarian State Railways]] rented to a French investment fund. According to the publication, if the railway was controlled by this fund, then Millerand would modify the borders in favour of Hungary. Millerand did not respond to this allegation, and it cannot be verified. It is fact that Millerand has receded to do any favour for Hungary afterward.

The Trianon borders were later revised during the [[Munich Agreement]] (1938), during both Vienna Awards ([[First Vienna Award|1938]] and [[Second Vienna Award|1940]]), and reconquering areas from [[Yugoslavia]] in 1941. All border modifications were resettled in 1947 according to the original treaty.

==Plot==
&lt;!--Per [[WP:FILMPLOT, plots are 400 to 700 words only--&gt;
Following the events of [[The Muppets (film)|the previous film]], The [[The Muppets|Muppets]] find themselves at a loss as to what to do until Dominic Badguy suggests the Muppets go on a European tour with him as their tour manager. As the Muppets begin their tour, a criminal mastermind named [[Constantine (Muppet)|Constantine]], a near-exact double for [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] in appearance, escapes from a [[Gulag|Siberian Gulag]] and joins his subordinate Dominic to begin a plot to steal the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]].

Once the Muppets arrive in [[Berlin]], Germany, Dominic secures them a show at a prestigious venue. Frustrated with the group's incessant requests and [[Miss Piggy]]'s insistence they marry, Kermit goes for a walk at Dominic's suggestion. Constantine ambushes him and glues a fake mole onto his cheek then slips away. Mistaken for Constantine, Kermit is sent to the Gulag. Taking Kermit's place, Constantine's blunders in imitating him are covered by Dominic; however, [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] knows the truth. After the Berlin performance opens with Constantine freezing at the audience, [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]] has to introduce the show. Constantine and Dominic steal paintings from a museum while the Muppets perform. The next morning, [[Interpol]] agent Jean Pierre Napoleon and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Sam Eagle|Sam the Eagle]] grudgingly team up to apprehend the culprit whom Napoleon believes to be his nemesis "The Lemur" - the number-two criminal in the world.

Meanwhile, Kermit has attempted several times to escape the Gulag but is thwarted each time by [[Prison officer|prison guard]] Nadya, who is not only aware of his true identity but is as infatuated with him as Miss Piggy is. Nadya orders Kermit to help organize the prisoners' annual talent show.

Following hidden instructions on the stolen painting, Constantine and Dominic divert the tour to [[Madrid]], Spain. Constantine allows the Muppets to perform whatever they wish, much to [[Walter (Muppet)|Walter]]'s confusion. During this show, Constantine and Dominic break into a museum and destroy a roomful of busts to find a key needed for their plan. Even though the performance is a disaster, the Muppets receive critical acclaim. Sam and Napoleon deduce that the connection between the crimes is the Muppet tour, and the pair interrogates the Muppets, only to find that they are too ill-equipped to be guilty. The instructions on the stolen key lead Constantine and Dominic to schedule the next show in [[Dublin]], Ireland.

In Dublin, Walter discovers that Dominic has been giving away show tickets and [[Bribery|bribing]] critics to ensure a packed house and rave reviews, while [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]] notices Kermit's resemblance to Constantine. They both realize that Constantine has taken Kermit's place and brought in Dominic as his accomplice. Constantine attacks Walter and Fozzie, but Animal fends him off and the three escape from the train to rescue Kermit. During the Dublin performance, Dominic steals a locket from a museum and Constantine proposes to Miss Piggy onstage; Piggy accepts, and the pair plan a ceremony to be held at the [[Tower of London]] in [[London]], England, where the Crown Jewels are kept.

Fozzie, Walter, and Animal reach the Siberian Gulag on the night of the performance, and Kermit uses it as a front to allow them, himself, and all the prisoners to escape the Gulag. Kermit, Fozzie, Walter, and Animal infiltrate the Tower as the wedding begins, and Dominic (with the help of Bobby Benson's Baby Band) manages to steal the jewels.

Kermit interrupts the ceremony, revealing Constantine's ruse, but the crook takes Miss Piggy hostage and flees to a helicopter, where he is intercepted by Dominic, who is actually the Lemur and intends to double-cross him. Constantine ejects him from the helicopter and tries to take off with Piggy, but Kermit jumps aboard and the rest of the Muppets climb atop each other to stop the escape. Kermit and Piggy knock out Constantine and both criminals are arrested by Sam and Napoleon. Nadya arrives in London to arrest Kermit for escaping. The other Muppets tell her that if she arrests him, then she will have to take all of them as well; she relents, allowing Kermit to go free. The Muppets perform at the Gulag with Constantine and the prisoners participating, ending the film.

==Production==

===Development===
In March 2012, after the critical and commercial success of ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'', [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] negotiated a deal with [[James Bobin]] and [[Nicholas Stoller]] to direct and write, respectively, an eighth installment.&lt;ref name=Vulture1/&gt; Disney [[Green-light|green-lit]] the film on April 24, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|title=CinemaCon 2012: Pixar Announces New Latin-Themed Project, Disney Plans 'Muppets 2'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-pixar-muppets-sequel-dia-de-los-muertos-315796|accessdate= January 18, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Brian Henson]], Bobin is the only other person to have directed two Muppet films.&lt;ref name="Collider1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Radish|first=Christina|title=Director James Bobin &amp; Songwriter Bret McKenzie Talk MUPPETS MOST WANTED, the Hensons' Reaction to the Film, the Pressure of Following an Oscar Win, and More|url=http://collider.com/james-bobin-bret-mckenzie-muppets-most-wanted-interview/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=March 21, 2014|date=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing began in April 2012 after a couple of weeks of outlining.&lt;ref name="Collider2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|title=Exclusive MUPPETS Sequel News: It’s a Caper, Will Have New Muppets, Jason Segel Might Cameo, Possible Summer 2013 Release, More|url=http://collider.com/the-muppets-2-sequel-caper-nicholas-stoller-interview/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=March 21, 2014|date=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Segel]], co-writer and star of the previous film, declined any involvement with the eighth entry, citing that he had accomplished his ambition of bringing the characters to the forefront with the 2011 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beard|first=Lanford|title=Jason Segel not involved in 'Muppets' sequel|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/03/05/jason-segel-not-involved-muppets-sequel/?cnn=yes|accessdate=January 19, 2013|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Bobin and Stoller quickly began work on the film based on Disney's demand. Taking on the form of a caper, the film was inspired by both ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' as well as ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' and ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]''.&lt;ref name="Collider1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Collider2" /&gt; Bobin said that the film was "a tip of the hat to the old-school crime capers of the '60s, but featuring a frog, a pig, a bear, and a dog—no panthers, even pink ones—along with the usual Muppet-y mix of mayhem, music and laughs".&lt;ref name=THR1&gt;{{cite news|last=Zakarin|first=Jordan|title=Disney Reveals Muppet Movie Sequel's Name and Synopsis|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/muppets-again-new-muppets-movie-416805|accessdate=January 30, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maytum|first=Matt|title=First official images from sequel The Muppets...

[[File:Okakura Tenshin.jpg|thumb|Okakura Kakuzō in 1898]]
{{nihongo|'''Okakura Kakuzō'''|岡倉 覚三|extra=February 14, 1862 – September 2, 1913}} (also known as 岡倉 天心 '''Okakura Tenshin''') was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[scholar]] who contributed to the development of [[arts]] in [[Japan]]. Outside Japan, he is chiefly remembered today as the author of ''[[The Book of Tea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;'Ambassador of Tea Culture to the West' (biography of Okakura), Andrew Forbes and David Henley, ''The Illustrated Book of Tea'' (Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Yokohama]] to parents originally from [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]], Okakura learned English while attending a school operated by Christian missionary, Dr. Curtis Hepburn. At 15, he entered [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]], where he first met and studied under Harvard-educated professor [[Ernest Fenollosa]].  In 1889, Okakura co-founded the periodical ''[[Kokka]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qclOb70JnpgC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=okakura+tenshin+kokka&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rfGOk6nNl-&amp;sig=uze_smJoid-QkO_fhsYFw1ulzlE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VBMxT7PhNomo8QOyibmCBw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asian Treasures: Gems of the Written Word |author=Gosling, Andrew |publisher=[[National Library of Australia]] |year=2011 |page=77 |ISBN=978-0-642-27722-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geidai.ac.jp/english/about/a-brief-history-of-the-university founding of Tokyo University of the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of the principal founders of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts (東京美術学校 ''Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō''), and a year later became its head, although he was later ousted from the school in an administrative struggle. Later, he also founded the [[Japan Art Institute]] with [[Hashimoto Gahō]] and [[Yokoyama Taikan]]. He was invited by [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in 1904 and became the first head of the Asian art division in 1910.

Okakura was a high-profile urbanite who had an international sense of self. In the [[Meiji period]] he was the first dean of the Tokyo Fine Arts School (later merged with the Tokyo Music School to form the current [[Tokyo University of the Arts]]). He wrote all of his main works in [[English language|English]]. Okakura researched Japan's traditional art and traveled to [[Europe]], the [[United States]], [[China]] and [[India]]. He emphasised the importance to the modern world of [[Eastern world|Asian culture]], attempting to bring its influence to realms of art and literature that, in his day, were largely dominated by [[Western culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/modernism-modernity/summary/v018/18.1.arrowsmith.html Rupert Richard Arrowsmith, "The Transcultural Roots of Modernism: Imagist Poetry, Japanese Visual Culture, and the Western Museum System"], ''[[Modernism/modernity]]'' Volume 18, Number 1, January 2011, 27-42. {{ISSN|1071-6068}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Picture of Okakura Kakuzō.jpg|thumb|Okakura Kakuzō]]
His 1903 book on Asian artistic and cultural history, ''The Ideals of the East with Special Reference to the Art of Japan'', published on the eve of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], is famous for its opening paragraph in which he sees a spiritual unity throughout Asia, which distinguishes it from the West:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Asia is one.  The Himalayas divide, only to accentuate, two mighty civilisations, the Chinese with its communism of Confucius, and the Indian with its individualism of the Vedas. But not even the snowy barriers can interrupt for one moment that broad expanse of love for the Ultimate and Universal, which is the common thought-inheritance of every Asiatic race, enabling them to produce all the great religions of the world, and distinguishing them from those maritime peoples of the Mediterranean and the Baltic, who love to dwell on the Particular, and to search out the means, not the end, of life.&lt;ref name="Okakura 1903"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okakura|first1=Kakuzō|title=The Ideals of the East with Special Reference to the Art of Japan|date=1903|publisher=J. Murray|location=London|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his subsequent book, ''The Awakening of Japan'', published in 1904, he argued that "the glory of the West is the humiliation of Asia."&lt;ref name="Okakura 1904"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okakura|first1=Kakuzō|title=The Awakening of Japan|date=1904|publisher=The Century Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}} This was an early expression of [[Pan-Asianism]]. In this book Okakura also noted that Japan's rapid modernization was not universally applauded in Asia: ″We have become so eager to identify ourselves with European civilization instead of Asiatic that our continental neighbors regard us as renegades—nay, even as an embodiment of the White Disaster itself."&lt;ref name="Okakura 1904"/&gt;{{rp|101}}

In his ''[[The Book of Tea]]'', which was written in English in 1906, he states: &lt;blockquote&gt;It (Teaism) insulates purity and harmony, the mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Japan, Okakura, along with Fenollosa, is credited with "saving" [[Nihonga]], or painting done with traditional Japanese technique, as it was threatened with replacement by Western-style painting, or "[[Yoga (Painting style)|Yōga]]", whose chief advocate was artist [[Kuroda Seiki]]. In fact this role, most assiduously pressed after Okakura's death by his followers, is not taken seriously by art scholars today, nor is the idea that oil painting posed any serious "threat" to traditional Japanese painting. Yet Okakura was certainly instrumental in modernizing Japanese aesthetics, having recognized the need to preserve Japan's cultural heritage, and thus was one of the major reformers during Japan's period of modernization beginning with the [[Meiji Restoration]].

Outside Japan, Okakura influenced a number of important figures, directly or indirectly, who include [[Swami Vivekananda]], philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], poet [[Ezra Pound]], and especially poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and heiress [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]], who were close personal friends of his.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/arrowsmith/cosmopolitanism-and-modernism Video of a Lecture discussing the importance of Japanese culture to the Imagists], ''[[London University School of Advanced Study]]'', March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open Sourced Vulnerability Database (OSVDB)''' was an independent and open-sourced [[database]]. The goal of the project was to provide accurate, detailed, current, and unbiased technical information on [[Information security|security]] vulnerabilities. The project promoted greater and more open collaboration between companies and individuals.

Its goal was to provide accurate, unbiased information about security vulnerabilities in computerized equipment. The core of OSVDB was a relational database which tied various information about security vulnerabilities into a common, cross-referenced [[open security]] data source. As of November, 2013, the database cataloged over 100,000 vulnerabilities.

==History==
The project was started in August 2002 at the [[Black Hat Briefings|Blackhat]] and [[DEF CON]] Conferences by several industry notables (including [[H. D. Moore]], rain.forest.puppy, and others). Under mostly-new management, the database officially launched to the public on March 31, 2004.

The [[Open Security Foundation]] (OSF) was created to ensure the project's continuing support. Brian Martin (AKA Jericho) and Jake Kouns are project leaders for the OSVDB project,&lt;ref&gt;http://opensecurityfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and currently hold leadership roles in the OSF. It is a client/server implementation that consists of a server daemon (mysqld) and many different client programs/libraries. It has a pluggable data store architecture

On the 5th April 2016, the database was shut down,&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.osvdb.org/2016/04/05/osvdb-fin/&lt;/ref&gt; although the blog will continue.

==Process==
Originally, vulnerability reports, advisories, and exploits posted in various security lists enter the database as a new entry. The new entry contains only a title and links to entries of the same vulnerability in other security lists. However, at this stage the page for the new entry doesn't contain any detailed description of the vulnerability. After the new entries are thoroughly scrutinized, analyzed and refined, descriptions of the vulnerability, its solutions and test notes are added. Then these details are reviewed by other members of '''OSVDB''', further refined if necessary and then made stable. Once it is stable, the detailed information appears on the page for the entry.

As of January, 2012, vulnerability entry was performed by full-time employees of the OSF. Every new entry included a title, description, solution (if known), classification data, references, products, and creditee.

==Contributors==
Some enthusiastic hackers are volunteering to maintain '''OSVDB'''. Some of the active members are as follows:

* Brian Martin (COO of OSF, Moderator)
* Jake Kouns (CEO of OSF, Moderator)

Other volunteers who have helped in the past include:

* [[Chris Sullo]] (Moderator)
* Steve Tornio (Moderator)
* Travis Schack (Mangler)
* Susam Pal (Mangler)
* Christian Seifert (Mangler)
* Zain Memon (Codebase)

== Open Security Foundation ==
The Open Security Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization established in early 2005 to function as a support organization for [[open source]] security projects.  It was originally conceived and founded as a support for the OSVDB project, but its scope is evolving to provide support for numerous other projects.

The foundation allows organizations and individuals to provide charitable contributions to support open source security projects that provide value to the global community. The foundation also provides guidance, legal, administrative, policy guidelines, and other support to numerous projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open source vulnerability posts|url=https://www.peerlyst.com/categories/open-source-intelligence-(osint)|publisher=www.peerlyst.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open Security Foundation was conceived by [[Chris Sullo]], Brian Martin, and [[Jake Kouns]] in early 2004, and obtained official US 501(c)3 non-profit status in April, 2005.

[[File:PickmanHouse Salem Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|The Pickman House is from the ([[First Period]]) and is located in Salem Massachusetts on Charter Street, 1664]]
The '''Pickman House''' is located on Charter Street in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], behind the [[Peabody Essex Museum]].  The house, built in 1664, abuts the Witch Memorial dedicated in 1992 on the 300th anniversary of the [[Salem witch trials]] and is also next to the second oldest burying ground in America.  These properties form part of the [[Charter Street Historic District]].

The house was restored by Historic Salem&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicsalem.org/ Historic Salem]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 and purchased by the Peabody Essex Museum in 1983. The Pickman House is not open to the public.

The Pickman House falls into the category of [[American colonial architecture]] from the First Period.  The style of the large central brick chimney is an excellent example of First Period craftsmanship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9804">'''Polish–Mongolian literary relations''' are the interrelationships between [[Polish literature|Polish]] and [[Mongolian literature|Mongolian]] literature that date to [[Poland in the Middle Ages|the late Middle Ages]]. There are also links between Polish and Mongolian philology and literary studies. Their first manifestations were reports about Mongols in the Polish chronicles and in the relations of medieval Polish travelers to Asia. Knowledge about Mongolia in [[Poland]] became more vivid in the 19th century, when many Polish adventurers, prisoners in [[Siberia]] (see [[sybirak]]), learned people and businessmen of the part of Poland under Russian rule engaged heavily in Siberian, Mongolian, and Chinese affairs. Interest in Polish matters in Mongolia is smaller and dates mainly to the 20th century. There are also literary works (mainly adventure novels) about Mongolia in the Polish literature and a few translations of Polish literature into Mongolian, or Mongolian literature into Polish.

== Early works ==
[[File:HedwigManuscriptLiegnitz b.jpg|thumb|right|The Mongols at [[Legnica]]. A medieval manuscript about the legend of [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], 1451. [[Wrocław University]] Library]]
There are numerous mentions of the Mongols in the writings of virtually all Polish chroniclers, notably [[Jan Długosz]]. From the 15th to the 18th centuries, Mongolian affairs were connected or identified in Poland directly with the severe devastation wrought on the country by [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|the Mongol invasions]] from late 1240 to 1241, then again in 1259–1260 and in 1287–1288. Mongol [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] under [[Orda Khan]] devastated most of central Poland, besieged and sacked [[Lublin]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Wolbórz]], [[Łęczyca]], then turned south towards [[Sieradz]] and [[Wrocław]]. All the while, the armies of [[Baidar]] and [[Kadan]] ravaged the southern part of Poland including [[Chmielnik]], the royal city of [[Kraków]], [[Bytom]], [[Opole]], [[Legnica]] and others. Panic spread through the Polish lands. In 1259, mere 18 years after the first attack, two tumens of 40,000 men from the [[Golden Horde]] under the leadership of [[Berke]], attacked Poland again. Most towns in Galicia and Volhyinia were burned to the ground. The Rus soldiers under Daniel's son, Lev, and brother, Vasily, joined the Mongol expedition. Here's where the Mongolian affairs became connected and identified in Poland with the Tatar issues. More death and destruction was unleashed on the cities of [[Lublin]], [[Sieradz]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Zawichost]], [[Kraków]] and [[Bytom]]. The Golden Horde remained very important in the literary tradition of Poland dating back to the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Kawecki"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.futurum.pl/historia/najazd.doc | title=Najazd mongolski na Polskę w 1287 roku | publisher=''Futurum.pl''. Historia | work=Including bibliography | year=2005 | accessdate=September 23, 2012 | author=Jacek Kawecki | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It inspired such works as a treatise on the origin of the Tatars by [[Mikołaj Rozembarski]] (1499).

Until the 19th century Polish–Mongolian relations were sporadic. Some of the earliest European mentions about the life, history and culture of the Mongols come from the travel reports from the journey to the [[Great Khan]] in the years 1245–47, written by Franciscan monks, members of the expedition prepared by the pope [[Innocent IV]] and headed by [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]]. One of the members of this expedition was [[Benedict of Poland]]. He wrote a short account of his journey, ''[[De Itinere Fratrum Minorum ad Tartaros]]''. An author of the more extensive account of this journey, based on Benedict's oral narrative, ''[[Historia Tartarorum]]'', was [[C. de Bridia]], probably also a Pole. ''Historia Tartarorum'' contains an important description of the [[Battle of Legnica]], one of the most important events during the [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Mongol invasion of Poland]].

== 19th century ==

The first nineteenth-century Polish traveler to Mongolia was [[Jan Potocki]] (1761–1815), who visited Mongolia during his journey to China and wrote a travel report in French (Polish translation ''Podróże'', 1959). The father of the Polish Mongolian philology was [[Józef Kowalewski]], who visited Mongolia several times (1829, 1831–33). Kowalewski was a former [[filomaci|filomata]], a friend of [[Adam Mickiewicz]], a professor of Mongolian philology at the [[University of Kazan]], an author of several works devoted to very diverse aspects of Mongolian culture and language, often pioneering. His most important work is a Mongolian–Russian–French dictionary in three volumes (1844–49). Polish research on the geography and culture of Mongolia intensified after the [[January Uprising]], when many Poles became political prisoners in neighboring Siberia – one of the most famous among Poles participating in the research expeditions to Mongolia was [[Aleksander Czekanowski]].

== 20th century ==

World-famous among [[turkologist]]s and [[mongolist]]s was a Polish scholar [[Władysław Kotwicz]], author of many works devoted to Mongolia and Mongolian literature, the discoverer (1912) of the old-Mongolian stone inscriptions in the [[Erdene Zuu Monastery]]. Other well-known Polish mongolists were [[Marian Lewicki]], [[Stanisław Kałużynski]] and [[Stanisław Godziński]]. Lewicki prepared editions of many monuments of the classical Mongolian literature.

In 20th-century Mongolia there was interest in Polish literature, strengthened by the fact that both communist Mongolia and communist Poland belonged to the same political bloc. Many translations of Polish literary works into Mongolian were published, although they were usually translated indirectly, through the Russian language. Especially a large number of Polish children's literature was translated into Mongolian. However, most of these texts were published in magazines and not as books. Some Mongolian citizens studied Polish philology at Polish universities. Some translators translated literary works directly from Polish into Mongolian. Among the most important were D. Biambaa (poems of Władysław Broniewski and Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński), B. Bandi (Polish folk literature), P. Biambasan and D. Kim (novels by Ewa Szelburg-Zarembina). The most important translator was [[Byambyn Rinchen]] (1905–77): writer, historian, ethnographer and linguist, who translated into Mongolian many main literary works of many world literatures, including (directly from Polish) works of Adam Mickiewicz, Wanda Wasilewska, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz and Jerzy Andrzejewski. There are translations of his ethnographical books into Polish.

The number of translations of contemporary Mongolian literature into Polish is not very big. As in the case of translations from Polish to Mongolian, many texts were translated through the Russian language. To the most important belong ''Opowiadania mongolskie'' [Mongolian Stories] by [[Tsendiin Damdinsüren]] (1953), ''Wiersze'' [Poems] by [[Begzin Yavuuhulan]] (1962) and the novel ''Przejrzysty Tamir'' [The Crystal Clear Tamir River] by [[Chadraabalyn Lodoidamba]] (1980). Translations directly from Mongolian were published mainly in the [[Orientalism|orientalist]] journal ''Przegląd Orientalistyczny'', for example poetry and prose of [[Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj]] translated by [[Stanisław Godziński]] and [[Adam Latusek]]. Godziński translated also a selection of Mongolian epic poetry and chronicles (''W kręgu lamajskich legend i mitów'' [Among lamaist legends and myths], 1981). To the most important translators of the classic Mongolian literature belongs [[Stanisław Kałużynski]]. He prepared ''Głosy z Jurty'' [Voices of the yurts] (1960) – a selection of Mongolian riddles, parables, proverbs, etc.; ''Tajna historia Mongołów'' (1970), a translation of the anonymous thirteenth-century Mongolian chronicle ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''; ''Tradycje i legendy ludów Mongolii'' [Traditions and legends of the peoples of Mongolia] (1978), which include excerpts from the seventeenth-century chronicle ''[[Erdeniin Tobchi]]'' and Mongolian folk epic poetry. Among Polish writers, whose works were affected by the culture of Mongolia, were [[Wacław Sieroszewski]] – especially his novel ''Dalaj Lama'' [The Dalai Lama] (1927) and its versions for children ''W niepodległej Mongolii'' [In the independent Mongolia] (1937); [[Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski]] – especially his travel novel ''Przez kraj ludzi, zwierząt i bogów'' [In the country of people, animals and gods] (1923); [[Kamil Giżycki]] (''Przez Urianchaj i Mongolię'', 1929); [[Przecław Smolik]], an author of the story on the life of Buryats ''Wśród wyznawców Burchan-Buddhy'' [Among the believers of Burchan-Buddha] (1925).

'''''Selected Manifestations: Being an Unofficial Collection of Temple Dedicatory Prayers, Revelations, Visions, Dreams, Doctrinal Expositions, &amp; Other Inspired Declarations Not Presently Included in the Official Canon of Scriptures Known as the Four Standard Works of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''''' is a 413-page book [[self-published]] in 1985 by David M. and Vonda S. Reay.  It is a compilation of scarce, non-canonical [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] of leaders of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Reay, David M. |author2=Reay, Vonda S.  | title=Selected Manifestations: Being an Unofficial Collection of Temple Dedicatory Prayers, Revelations, Visions, Dreams, Doctrinal Expositions, &amp; Other Inspired Declarations Not Presently Included in the Official Canon of Scriptures Known as the Four Standard Works of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | year=1985 | publisher=[[Sine nomine|s.n.]] | location=Oakland, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The book contains 185 revelations, visions, temple dedications, etc..., some of which are very short or intended for a specific individual rather than general readers.&lt;ref name=forum&gt;{{cite web | title=Selected Manifestations | work=LDS Mormon Forums | date=September 29, 2008 | url=http://www.lds.net/forums/book-club/10126-selected-manifestations.html | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The library of the church-owned [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) identifies the book as containing "[[Private revelation]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=keyword anywhere "Selected manifestations reay" | work=iLink BYU Online Catalog | publisher=[[Harold B. Lee Library]], [[Brigham Young University]] | url=http://catalog.lib.byu.edu/uhtbin/cgisirsi/X/0/0/123/?srchfield1=TI^TITLE^SERIES^^keyword+anywhere&amp;query_type=keyword&amp;user_id=WEBSERVER&amp;new_gatewaydb=ILINK&amp;library=ALL&amp;searchdata1=Selected%20manifestations%20reay | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each revelation is presented in its own enumerated "selection" which is further divided into numbered verses.&lt;ref name=lovers&gt;{{cite web | title=Selected Manifestations | work=LDS Book Lovers | url=http://ldsbooklovers.com/saleitem.asp?id=236&amp;pid=9 | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these revelations are excluded from the accepted canon of the LDS Church, they are presented in a very similar format to the church's [[Standard Works|canonical]] [[Doctrine and Covenants]] (D&amp;C), which also contains revelations of LDS Church leaders divided into "sections" and verses.&lt;ref&gt;Since the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1835, each revelation divided into its own enumerated "section", although the earlier [[Book of Commandments]] listed each revelation as a "chapter".  {{cite book | author=Doxey, Roy W. | chapter=Doctrine and Covenants: Overview | title=[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] | year=1992 | editor=[[Daniel H. Ludlow]] | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] | location=New York | chapter-url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Doctrine_and_Covenants#Doctrine_and_Covenants:_Overview | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1876 [[Orson Pratt]] first divided the D&amp;C sections into verses.  {{cite book | author=Woodford, Robert J. | authorlink=Robert J.

The various revelations in the book include:
* Vision of the Savior at the School of the Prophets
* A Revelation on [[Copyrights]] for Church Publications
* A Revelation Reproving the Brethren for Not Honoring Official Titles
* Remarks to the Twelve on the Endowment
* Revelation on Eternal Progress of Mankind Given to [[Lorenzo Snow]]
* Revelation on the [[Council of Fifty]] Giving Full Name
* Revelation on the Proper Names of God by Elder [[Orson Pratt]]
* Revelation on the Design of Temples by President [[Brigham Young]]
* Vision of the Savior in [[Gethsemane]] Given to [[Orson F. Whitney]]
* Revelation on the Holy Priesthood
* Visitations of Joseph the Prophet to President [[Wilford Woodruff]]
* Vision of Savior in Salt Lake Temple Given to [[Melvin J. Ballard]]
* Status of Children in the Resurrection by [[Joseph F. Smith]]
* Power of the Holy Priesthood by President [[Joseph Fielding Smith]]
* Vision of the [[Lamanites]] Given to President [[Spencer W. Kimball]]
Also included are revelations to [[David O. McKay]] and others, and famous speeches from such figures as [[Boyd K. Packer]] and [[Bruce R. McConkie]].&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;  In addition, the book contained [[dedication]] prayers for all the church's [[Temple (LDS Church)|Temples]] at that time, as well as for uncompleted sites, such as [[Temple Lot|Independence]], [[Far West, Missouri|Far West]], and [[Adam-Ondi-Ahman]].&lt;ref name=Kimball/&gt;  Among the twelve appendices is a bibliography on the D&amp;C and a list of the Priesthood Courses of Study.

==Scarcity==
Shortly after publication in 1985, ''Selected Manifestations'' was recalled from retailer bookshelves, reportedly over copyright concerns with the LDS Church, and due to the fact that they were arranged like scriptures, i.e. the Doctrine and Covenants, but in "Selections" rather than "Sections." Another controversial feature was that the book was dedicated to our "Mother in Heaven."&lt;ref name=lovers/&gt;  Some allege the church tried to stop its publication{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and ordered the authors, who were members of the church in [[Oakland, California]], to stop selling it.  Copies of the book are rare (it is believed that only about 200 copies exist) and it is listed in Bret Eborn's "Guide to Mormon Books" and sells for $400 to $800 on the [[Rare books|rare book market]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 2013, [https://www.amazon.com/Selected-manifestations-unofficial-revelations-expositions/dp/B00071Z96C Amazon] was offering two copies of the book at $900 apiece. Accessed May 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is usually on rare book dealer want lists. It is available online in a pdf format.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/48726101/Selected-Manifestations {{Unreliable source?|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13064">[[Image:Vista del Studiolo de Francisco I.jpg|thumb|Studiolo of Francesco I]]
The '''Studiolo''' is a small painting-encrusted barrel-vaulted room in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]].  It was commissioned by [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]]. It was completed for the duke from 1570-1572, by teams of artists under the supervision of [[Giorgio Vasari]] and the scholars [[Giovanni Batista Adriani]] and [[Vincenzo Borghini]]. 

This [[Cabinet (architecture)|small room]] was part-office, part-laboratory, part-hiding place, and part-[[cabinet of curiosities]]. Here the prince tinkered with alchemy and kept his collection of small, precious, unusual or rare objects.  The walls and ceiling were decorated with paintings showing a similar variety of subjects, some showing exotic forms of industry and others mythology.  The inset paintings are now all that remains in the room of the original contents.  They are rather larger than what is normally meant by the term [[cabinet painting]].

The late-[[Mannerism|Mannerist]] decorative program of paintings and sculpture was based on items encompassed by the collection. The object collection itself was stored in ~ 20 cabinets. In the center is a fresco of [[Prometheus]] receiving jewels from nature, commenting on the interplay of divine, nature, and humanity, that is the goal of both artistic and scientific interests.

==Paintings==
[[image:Jacopo Coppi Invención de la polvora en 1313 Studiolo.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''Invention of Gunpowder'' by [[Jacopo Coppi]]]]
The walls were also covered with 34 paintings representing mythologic or religious subjects, or representing trades. The arrangement was such that paintings were somehow related to their neighbors, and emblematic of the objects in the cabinets below. The arrangement we see today is somewhat speculative; and the relationships are not always clear. For example, [[Tommaso d'Antonio Manzuoli|Tommaso d'Antonio Manzuoli's]]  ''Diamond Mines'' hangs above the [[Maso de Sanfriano|Maso de Sanfriano's]] ''Fall of Icarus''. The painting by [[Giovanni Battista Naldini]] of the ''House of the Dreams'' emphasized the relationship with the adjacent bedroom of the Prince. The Studiolo is arrayed and visible through an arched opening and lacks cabinets, which fails to accurately recreate the claustrophobic feel of the original. In addition, originally a portrait of Francesco's mother, [[Eleonora of Toledo]] by [[Bronzino]], kept vigil.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hibbert, ''The Rise and Fall of the House of Medici'' (1979), Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Studiolo employed many of the best of contemporary Florentine painters, their work in this room, for most, does not represent their best efforts. The room itself is now more interesting as an example of an introverted and eccentric monarch; from an artistic viewpoint, the style of these paintings is the high point of Florentine [[Mannerism]], as reflected in the affected and contorted crowds in the canvases. The pseudo-allegiance to the sciences couple with the sense that they illuminated the educated monarch, suggest a prescient hint of the encyclopedic philosophy of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. However, Francesco ultimately was a poor representative of the inquisitive mind; at best this room served as a tinkerer's closet, a place for this personally awkward monarch to find seclusion from his wife, family, and court. Not long after the death of the Grand Duke, it was neglected and dismantled by 1590, only to be partially reconstructed in the twentieth century as an [[Renaissance]] oddity within the medieval palace.

'''Sunnydale High Yearbook''' is a tie-in book based on the United States television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. In the series, the closing shot of the episode "[[Graduation Day, Part Two]]" shows the fictional yearbook this tie-in was modeled after.

==Plot summary==
The [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]] are coming to the end of their Senior year at High School, [[Buffy Summers]] is busy [[Graduation Day, Part Two|making battle plans]]. [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] has time to pick up the High School Yearbook for her. Once the gang could relax knowing that high school truly was over, [[Xander Harris|Xander]], [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Oz]], [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], [[Rupert Giles|Giles]], [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] and others scrawled notes in Buffy's yearbook to make it special. It is now full of notes, photos and in-jokes only the Scoobies understand and appreciate, having fought on the Hellmouth for three years and survived High School.

This book was an oddity in the release of ''Buffy'' publications by [[Pocket Books]], it was neither a novelization of an episode, nor an original novel, but instead a fictional school yearbook. It featured "inscriptions" from characters on the front inside cover; Willow, Xander, Oz, Giles, Cordelia, Angel, [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], [[Wesley Wyndham-Price|Wesley]], [[Principal Snyder|Snyder]], [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]], [[Jonathan Levinson|Jonathan]], [[Harmony Kendall|Harmony]], [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Larry Blaisdell|Larry]], and [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Devon MacLeish|Devon]]. It also included inscriptions from the crew-folk on the back inside cover. In the "In Memoriam" section Willow mentions Harmony's absence but she doesn't know Harmony is dead until "[[The Harsh Light of Day (Buffy episode)|The Harsh Light of Day]]".

[[File:Tabularium-and-temple.jpg|thumb|The Tabularium, behind the corner columns of the Temple of Vespasian and Titus.]]
The '''Tabularium''' was the official records office of [[ancient Rome]], and also housed the offices of many city officials.  Situated within the [[Roman Forum]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=341}} it was on the front slope of the [[Capitoline Hill]], below the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]], to the southeast of the [[Arx (Roman)|Arx]] and [[Tarpeian Rock]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Within the building were the remains of the [[temple of Veiovis]]. In front of it were the Temples of [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus|Vespasian]] &amp; [[Temple of Concord|Concord]], as well as the [[Rostra]] and the rest of the forum. Presently the Tabularium is only accessible from within the [[Capitoline Museums and Piazza del Campidoglio|Capitoline Museum]], although it still provides a panoramic view over the Forum.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Construction of the Tabularium was ordered around 78 BC by the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(eds.)|first1=Olivier Hekster/Richard Fowler|title=Imaginary Kings royal images in the Ancient Near East, Greece and Rome|date=2005|publisher=Steiner|location=[Stuttgart]|isbn=3515087656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was completed by [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]], consul in 78 BC. This was part of a public works
programme for the redevelopment of the Capitoline Hill, which had been damaged by a fire in  in 83 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Musei Capitoloni, Rome.[http://www.museicapitolini.org/en/sede/campidoglio_antico/tabularium]&lt;/ref&gt; The construction by Catulus is  not motioned in the ancient literature. It is known through an inscription (CIL 1).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Classical dictionary, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Architecture==
The building itself had a facade of [[peperino]] and [[travertine]] blocks. The interior vaults are of [[concrete]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Its great corridor, {{convert|67|m|abbr=on}} long, raised {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} above the forum on a massive substructure, is still partly preserved. This corridor was lighted through a series of arches divided by semi-detached columns of the Doric order, the earliest example of this class of decoration, which is in the Theatre of Marcellus, the Colosseum, and all the great amphitheatres throughout the Roman empire constituted the decorative treatment of the wall surface and gave scale to the structure.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=341}}

The facade faced the back of the [[Temple of Concord]] in the Forum and consisted of three levels. The first story was a large and tall fortified wall with a single door and only small windows near the top to light the interior, forum level rooms. The second story featured a [[Doric order|Doric]] arcade (partially preserved) and the third, no longer extant story, had a high [[Corinthian order]] colonnade.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The upper floors of this structure was much changed in the 13th century, when the ''Palazzo dei Senatori'' was built.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=341}}

Some scholars, such as Filippo Coarelli, in the past, have suggested that the ‘Tabularium’ itself is unattested to in any literary sources. Furthermore, its function and purpose has been the subject of debate. The unity of the main structure does however suggest that the building was at least initially conceived to serve a singular purpose. To illustrate the complexity of the building, Filippo Coarelli has stated that a particular annex of the Aerarium Saturni was constructed specifically to house metal ingots and minted Republican coins.
Recent evidence, in the form of six military diplomas dated from AD 85 to 88, confirms the existence of the ‘Tabularium’ in its renowned form.
Coarelli has suggested that the ‘Tabularium’ can be dated precisely to 78 BC, although construction began many years prior and almost certainly prior to the death of Sulla. The building itself is in many ways intrinsically tied to the politics of Sulla, especially in regard to the temple substructure. 
The structure was considered such an enduring masterpiece of late Republican architecture that a funerary inscription for the architect commissioned by Lutatius Catalus was created and preserved in a courtyard of the hospital of the Fatebenefatelli, on Tiber island. The inscription reads as follows: ‘Lucius Cornelius, son of Lucius, of the Voturia tribe, chief engineer to Q. Lucius Catulus when he was consul, architect (to him) when he was censor’.&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Coarelli, Substructio et Tabularium, Papers of the British School at Rome, Vol.

Nicholas Purcell's article ''Atrium Libertatis'' is aligned with the view of contemporary historians regarding the [[epigraphic]] evidence once present within the Tabularium. In his detailed analysis of the now-lost inscriptions Purcell makes clear that these inscriptions have compounded our misunderstanding of one of the largest, oldest and best-preserved buildings of the Roman Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Purcell, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40344494 Atrium Libertatis], Papers of the British School at Rome, Vol. 61 (1993), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The generic terms 'probatio' of a 'substructio' and a 'tabularium' were recorded by an early Renaissance antiquarian in that order. It is arguable that the identification of the so-called 'Tabularium' is incorrect. Purcell draws our attention to the lack of archaeological and epigraphic knowledge on ‘tabularia' suggesting that these inscriptions were not intended to be grandiose in scope, nor did they name the building&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Purcell, Atrium Libertatis, Papers of the British School at Rome, Vol. 61 (1993), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; which further reflects the prevailing credulity of the structure in question. Purcell’s reference to the archaeological research conducted by [[Theodor Mommsen]] aligns with his argument and likely indicates that historians must set aside such misunderstandings reflected in the literary sources. As Mommsen stated quite rightly that 'tabularium' may refer to any structure associated with administration.&lt;ref&gt;Atrium Libertatis&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is likely that the 'Tabularium' in question, despite the sheer size fronting the Capitoline Hill, was one of many structures built for the purpose of holding records. 

Purcell’s assessment of the epigraphic evidence once found within the structure in question reaffirms the following view long held by academics that the 'Tabularium' is insufficiently documented and the product of scholarly inertia. This unfortunately has further compounded our understanding of the Capitoline substructure, and as a result, we are no closer to identifying the extent of its function, let alone its name.

Tucci’s article radically changed the way historians and archaeologists alike would view the ‘Tabularium’, questioning the very identification of the structure and its function. Exploring the history of archaeology at the site, Tucci makes clear that the identification of the so-called ‘Tabularium’ is hinged solely upon an inscription long lost (CIL VI 1314, 31597), with no ancient evidence from the period directly correlating to the site. As such, it is arguable that the word tabularium itself has been incorrectly in modern scholarship with reference to the building. Instead, Tucci argues that the substructure, which provides the foundations for the entire building, was itself likely a tabularium, being one of many offices housed within Roman buildings and temples for the purpose of holding records. As such, Tucci disputes the idea that a sole Tabularium or mass-archive of Rome ever existed. In alignment with this argument, Tucci subsequently seeks to identify the structure in occupation of the space above the Tabularium substructure. In examining the architectural link between the rooms of the substructure and that of a south-western building, Tucci, in accordance with historians before him, could identify the remnants of an extension of the Aerarium, or treasury, which was housed in the Temple of Saturn. Subsequently, in correlation with the accounts of Livy (7.28.4-6), Ovid (Fasti 6.183-85) and Cicero (De domo 38.101) Tucci draws attention to a clear association between the location of this mint, and that of the Temple of Juno Moneta. With reference to the archaeological research of Giannelli and his identification of concrete remains in the Aracoeli Garden in the Forum, Tucci argues for the foundations of Giannelli’s supposed Temple of Juno Moneta to date back to the 4th century B.C, thus indicating a relocation. Tucci’s argument thus is fulfilled as he concludes that in circa 78 B.C., the Temple of Juno Moneta was rededicated atop the substructure of the Tabularium, in a complex which included the extended Aerarium, and that this relocation likely occurred after the fire of 83 B.C. As a result, Tucci called into question both the identification and function of the so-called ‘Tabularium’, in his attempt to overturn a theory that had been taken for historical fact since the 15th century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Tucci, P. L., 2005. ‘Where High Moneta leads her steps sublime. The “Tabularium” and the Temple of Juno Moneta’, Journal of Roman Archaeology vol. 18, 6-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Giannelli, 1978. “La Leggenda dei ‘Mirabilia’ e l’antica topografia dell’Arce Capitolina”, StRom vol. 26, 60-71, as cited in P. L. Tucci (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fillipo Coarelli (2010) uses the arguments and findings of Nicholas Purcell (1993), Henner von Heserb (1995) and Pier Luigi Tucci (2005) to propose an alternative understanding of the function of the Tabularium. These works are characterised by their ability to provide alternative understandings when questioning the function of the “Tabularium.” It is important to note that prior these studies, research and scholarship of the “Tabularium” was primarily saturated by the Richard Delbruck’s Hellenistiche Bauten in Latium, published in 1875. It was Delbruck’s findings that rendered the conclusion that the Tabularium served as a house of public records. However, writing in 2010, Coarelli has had access to a wider range of both archaeological and written sources that probe a deeper inquest in to traditional discourses that cloud our conception of the function and meaning of the “Tabularium.”

Within Substructio et tabularium, Coarelli fundamentally purports that “the so-called tabularium is not the archive of the Roman state, known by this name’ and the rejection of this long held but incorrect hypothesis permits us to study the monument afresh.” He goes on to state that “[the tabularium] represents in fact the foundations (substructio) of a large temple of the Sullan period, restored by Domitian after the fire of 80AD.” Throughout his work, Coarelli uses the findings of Purcell, von Hesberg and Tucci as a roadmap that forms the basis of his argument. He begins with Purcell’s epigraphic discoveries that connotes the classification of the Tabularium as a records building: “Populi tabularia ubi publici continentur” (Tabularia of the [Roman] People where the public [documents] are housed). Moving to von Hesberg, Coarelli highlights the study of the dimensions of architectural pieces from the Tabularium that suggest “the second floor of the building must have been significantly wider than the arched lower floor”, proposing that there was a temple structure within the Tabularium (Fig. X.). Finally, Coarelli’s inclusion of Tucci’s findings builds upon von Hesberg’s assertion, serving as a sounding board for Coarelli’s initial thesis; that the “Tabularium” served as the basement of a proposed temple. 

Coarelli tracks the structural changes that took place within the Tabularium, and ultimately concludes that it is challenging for historians to ascertain the absolute meaning of this structure due to the “complexity of [it].” He points out that only until recently have we been able to understand that the Tabularium actually existed due to the emergence of from six military diplomas, with dates ranging from AD85-88. Further, these diplomas refer the location of the Tabularium publicum to the Capitolium. Here, the location is extremely significant. Coarelli states that the tabularium “must have been situated in the immediate environs of the area Capitolina, where the military diplomas were displayed until AD90.” Thus, it is clear that the tabularium was a multifaceted building that pertained to the political and religious culture of the Roman empire. 
	
Thus, by expanding upon the arguments of Purcell, von Hesberg and Tucci, Coarelli positions himself to further execute his overarching thesis with increased clarity. Fundamentally, by galvanising the “deep-rooted biases” that obfuscate the understanding of the Tabularium, Coarelli is able to suggest that the Tabularium is rather a multifaceted structure that pertained to the political and religious centre of the Roman world.

The '''''Deeds of the Saxons, or Three Books of Annals''''' ({{lang-la|Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres}}) is a three-volume chronicle of 10th century [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] written by [[Widukind of Corvey]]. Widukind, proud of his people and history, begins his chronicon, not with [[Rome]], but with a brief synopsis derived from the orally-transmitted history of the [[Saxons]], with a terseness that makes his work difficult to interpret. Widukind omits [[Italy|Italian]] events in tracing the career of [[Henry the Fowler]] and he never mentioned a [[pope]].

==Manuscripts==
Widukind's ''Gesta'' is known from five manuscripts, one of which came to light at the beginning of the twentieth century. The contexts and dates of the various versions which these represent have occasioned much discussion. The work was first completed in 967 or 968, when it was dedicated to [[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Mathilda]], the young daughter of Otto I and newly appointed abbess of [[Quedlinburg]]. However, in four of five manuscripts, the history was continued down to 973 (adding chapters 70-6 of Book III), whether by Widukind himself or another author. Since its composition must have been a long process, it is likely that the dedication was not originally part of Widukind's design and that he consequently had to make a number of adjustments to suit other needs. Three main recensions called A, B and C have been distinguished:

* '''Recension A'''. Ends at Book III, chapter 69, year 967/9.
** MS A. MS J 38 ([[Saxon State Library|Sächsischen Landesbibliothek]], Dresden). Date: 1200 x 1220.
* '''Recension B''' (continues until 973)
** MS B 1. MS Addit. 21109 ([[British Library]], London), pp.&amp;nbsp;138–181.&lt;ref&gt;Formerly in the monastery of Steinfeld and then in the possession of Chevalier de Bearzi in Paris&lt;/ref&gt; Date: mid-12th century.
** MS B 2. Lost manuscript, once housed in the [[Eberbach Abbey]] in the Rheingau. Date: mid-12th century. Its contents can be reconstructed based on a transcript and an official edition, both of the 16th century:
*** B 2a. Clm 4029 ([[Bayerische Staatsbibliothek|Münchener Staatsbibliothek]]), paper MS, a transcript written in the 16th century for the humanist [[Konrad Peutinger]].
*** B 2b. Martin Frecht (ed.), ''Witichindi Saxonis rerum ab Henrico et Ottone I impp. gestarum libri III [...]'', the ''editio princeps'' published in Basel, 1532. [http://www-gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/cgi-bin/digbib.cgi?PPN512254001 Available for viewing online]
* '''Recension C''' (also continues until 973)
** MS C 1. MS no. 298, f. 81-244 ([[Monte Cassino]] monastery). Date: 11th century. Transcribed at [[Benevento]], the [[Duchy of Benevento|Lombard duchy]] south of Rome.
** MS C 2. MS Lat. oct. 198 ([[Berlin State Library|Berliner Staatsbibliothek]]), f. 1-39'. Date: 13th century. Donated to the library in 1909 and before that time unknown to scholarship.

==Volumes==
''Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres'' consists of three volumes:

===First===
Widukind of Corvey starts book one with the fall of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Thuringii|Thuringian]] dynasty. In his version, [[Amalaberga]] is the daughter of the [[Franks|Frankish]] king Huga. After Huga's death [[Theuderic I|Thiadrich]], his son by a [[concubine]] is crowned as king, but Amalaberga convinces her husband, [[Hermanafrid|Irminfrid]], with the help of the warrior Iring, that it is really she who should inherit the kingdom. A war starts, and after the Franks under Thiadrich have won a battle at Runibergun, the [[Thuringii]] retreat into the fortress of Scithingi (modern [[Burgscheidungen]]).

The Franks get the help of the newly immigrated Saxons who are looking for land, and a bloody battle is fought at Scithingi. After many warriors have been slain, Irminfrid sends Iring as a messenger to Thiadrich to ask for peace. The kings reach an agreement and plan to slay the Saxons on the morrow, but the Saxons get word of this, storm Scithingi during the night and kill all adults. Only Irminfrid and his family escape. The Saxons celebrate their victory for three days, afterwards they return to Thiadrich, who gives the country over to them.

By the order of Thiadrich, Iring convinces Irminfrid to return to the Frankish court. When Irminfrid kneels in submission before Thiadrich, Iring slays him. Thiadrich banishes him, as he has become despicable to all men by this deed, and he wants to have no part of this crime. Iring announces that he will atone for his crime and get revenge for his former master and slays Thiadrich as well. He places the body of Irminfrid over that of Thiadrich, so he will be victor in death at least, and leaves.

Widukind ends by doubting the truth of this story, but recounts that the [[Milky Way]] is called "Iring's Street" to his day. An allusion to the conversion of the Saxons to [[Christianity]] under [[Charlemagne]] brings him to the early Saxon [[duke]]s and details of the reign of [[Henry the Fowler]].

===Second===
The second book opens with the election of [[Otto the Great]] as [[King of Germany|German king]], treats of the risings against his authority, omitting events in Italy, and concludes with the death of his wife [[Eadgyth|Edith]] in 946. He dedicates his writings to Matilda, daughter of Otto and abbess of [[Quedlinburg]], a descendant of the Saxon leader [[Widukind]], his own namesake.

===Third===
Book three tells the story of [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia]] and Otto's [[Franconia]]n campaign.

The [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] '''Thyrsus''' is a mythical figure from [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]. He is said to have lived in [[Innerleithen]] close to Reith.

Thyrsus is mentioned in the legend of the giant [[Haymon]]. According to tradition, Thyrsus was stronger, more dexterous and half a head taller than Haymon.

==Background==
In the Germanic [[mythology]], Thürse, Thürsus, and Thurse are names for prehistoric [[Giant (mythology)|giants]]. The [[hrimthurs]], who are made of frost and ice, are descendants of the world's giant [[Ymir]].
In the legend of the [[Giant (mythology)|giant]] [[Haymon]], however, Thyrsus is a proper name.

==Tradition==
The cause of the dispute between the two giants [[Haymon]] and Thyrsus is reported differently:
One tradition tells that Thyrsus felt provoked by the immigrating [[Haymon]] ("Rheinländer" which means man from the river Rhine), because Thyrsus had already lived for ages in the Upper [[Inn]] Valley.

Another tradition reports of a sudden destruction of [[Haymon]]'s castle during one night.
Whilst one reported variant provides no reason for the sudden destruction, another variant says that it was Haymon's human neighbors who destroyed his castle. Then, they knowingly accused Thyrsus to be the perpetrator.

The fight between the two giants was reported to have taken place close to the hamlet Thyrschenbach - today: [[Dirschenbach]].
During the fight, [[Haymon]] stabbed a deep wound into Thyrsus' heel with his sword, so that a fountain of bright blood poured out. Thyrsus took a turf, stuffed it into the wound, and fled into [[Karwendel]]. The many blood, which he had lost, leaked into the rocks. Haymon followed him and reached him close to the hill Leitner Kogel. There Haymon slew Thyrsus. The last words of the giant Thyrsus should have been: "Blood spray! Be good for man and beast! (Spritz Bluet! Sei für Viech und Menschen gut!“)"

Only long time later, local farmers found the healing ''Thyrsusblut'' - named ''Dirschenblut'' - in the rocks of the [[Karwendel]] mountains (cf.[[Tyrolean Shale Oil]]).

== Miscellaneous ==
At the time of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], Thyrsus once fell ill. In order not to infect the rest of the villagers, he retreated into the cellar of his house. Thus his village was spared from the plague.

The house vis-à-vis the Chapel of the Holy Saint Magnus in Reith (almost Leithen) is said to be Thyrsus' house.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19525">The '''Woman's Civic Betterment Club''' (also known as the "WCBC" or the "Roanoke Civic Betterment Club") of [[Roanoke, Virginia]], was started in 1907 to improve the sanitation and civic life in Roanoke and the surrounding area. The Club issued a press release claiming that the “object of this organization shall be to gain the co-operation of all loyal and progressive citizens in making the Magic City a city beautiful, to promote health and cleanliness, to advance present conditions, and to point to higher ideals.”&lt;ref&gt;Dotson, Paul R. 2003.[https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1067&amp;context=gradschool_dissertations "Magic City" class, community, and reform in Roanoke, Virginia, 1882-1912]. Louisiana State University Doctoral Dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; The WCBC is significant in southwestern Virginia because it was an early woman's organization to push for political change and political power at a time when women had little or no power except by persuading men to change their minds.

==WCBC Origins==
At a time when women could not vote, the WCBC was established to improve the Roanoke city infrastructure. Started in 1906 and established in 1907, by 1913 it had 180 members, and was part of the Women's Clubs of America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uUkMAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;ots=JXR6iQ8cnA&amp;dq=%22Roanoke%20Civic%20Betterment%20Club%22&amp;pg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Roanoke%20Civic%20Betterment%20Club%22&amp;f=false Official Register and Directory of Women's Clubs of America]. "Virginia". Page 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

These women formed the Women's Civic Betterment Club in 1906, a civic club to have lasting effects on Roanoke's future. It was a move of "responsible and responsive women of the city which would ultimately lead to the formation of a library, a juvenile court, a nursery school for the children of working mothers, and a local unit of the [[American Cancer Society]]. The maiden effort, however, was a plan for the city, only the fifth such ever done for any city. The club, led by Mrs. Lucian H. Cocke&lt;ref&gt;Cocke, “From Hoopskirts to Airplanes,” 99-104. Mrs.
Lucian H. Cocke, “The Woman’s Civic Betterment Club of Roanoke,” The Virginia Realtor (Sept
1926): 35.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Willie Walker Caldwell|Mrs. M.M. Caldwell]],&lt;ref&gt;O. Link Winston Link Museum. History Museum Photograph Collection "[http://hswv.pastperfectonline.com/photo/BD3D6C6A-D260-4297-957D-302364421785Southwest Virginia Fall Festival Parade]." Description: A black and white photograph taken in 1907 of Mrs. Manley M. Caldwell (Willie Walker Caldwell) and Mrs. Lucian H. Cocke (Sarah Johnson Hagan Cocke), riding in a flower bedecked horse-drawn carriage in the Floral Parade of the Southwest Virginia Fall Festival. There is a third unidentified lady riding with them (possibly Mrs. Samuel W. Jamison (Alice Peyton Terry Jamison), who was also very involved in the club). These ladies are members of the Woman's Civic Betterment Club of Roanoke, Virginia. The parade was part of the Virginia Fall Festival, which was started by the Woman's Civic Betterment Club in an effort to improve city of Roanoke. The parade had two sections, one for horse drawn carriages and the other for automobiles. The festival was held at the Roanoke Armory and lasted two weeks. The carriage is driven by two liveried black men in top hats. The parade is going by a large Victorian clapboard house where there are several people hanging out of the windows to get a better view of the event.&lt;/ref&gt; engaged John Nolen of Boston to develop a comprehensive plan for the development of Roanoke".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Danielle. The Railroad Builds a Magic City: Roanoke 1880-1910."[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~class/am485_98/hall/progress.html New Progress]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The club is noted for its influence in city planning, public sanitation and engineering, cultural activities, and publications. "While the city fathers had been successful in attracting investors and industry, they had done little to address the city’s cultural needs and improve its public spaces. The city mothers, however, knew that sanitation, safety, good schools, playgrounds and cultural opportunities were equally important to the city’s future. In 1906, they formed the Woman’s Civic Betterment Club to tackle these issues. (Sarah Butler’s mother, Willie Walker Caldwell, was one of the organizers of the WCBC.) They commissioned studies and lobbied city council for improvements – with mixed results."&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Western Virginia. 2012. "One Year in Roanoke: 1921". The Roanoker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==City Planning==
Concerned with the open sewers, abundant saloons and traffic problems, and rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, Debra Lynn. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26797605 John Nolen, City Planner: The Roanoke Plans (1907, 1928)]. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In less than twenty years, from 1882 to 1900, Roanoke had grown from 669 citizens to 21,000. In 1907 the WCBC held a "Great Fall Festival" in order to raise money to hire a city planner. They were able to raise enough money to hire [[John Nolen]]. At the festival, they were able to raise the equivalent of $125,000 (they raised $5,000.00, or about $125,000.00 in 2017 dollars). This was enough to hire Nolen and two bacteriologists who were able to report on Roanoke's sanitation problems.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, Emily. 2017. "[http://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/harmon-the-woman-s-civic-betterment-club-how-women-shaped/article_0dc120df-bc08-5e67-94f9-66b4d210ac03.html The Womans' Civic Betterment Club: How Women Shaped Roanoke]." [[Roanoke Times]]. November 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
"On December 7, 1906, more than 100 women turned out for an urgently-called meeting in Roanoke Virginia, to discuss matters of the utmost importance. Two days later, the group met again and chartered the Roanoke Civic Betterment Club. Its mission: to ensure sanitary conditions in the city's market district, to provide a healthier community for their families, and to ensure quality education for their children."&lt;ref&gt;Robb, Lynda Bird, M. Caldwell Butler, Malcolm Bryan, George Kegley, John Nolen, and Clare White. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471480086 The Hand That Rocked the Cradle Pulled the Strings: The Story and Legacy of the Roanoke Civic Betterment Club]. [Roanoke, Va.]: Blue Ridge PBS, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the recommendations of John Nolen included planting trees along the streets; renaming the streets "avenues" for those going east-west, and "Streets" for those running north-south; creating parkways and playgrounds; dividing the city into four districts.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen, John. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45067574 Remodeling Roanoke; Report to the Committee on Civic Improvement]. [Roanoke, Va.]: [Stone Prtg. and Manufacturing Co.], 1907. Electronic version: https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433082493283 Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparing the [[Melrose–Rugby, Roanoke, Virginia|Melrose-Rugby Historic District]] in Roanoke, the effects of the Woman's Civic Betterment Club were appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;National Register of Historic Places Registration Form NPS Form 10-900, June 19, 2013. [http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Roanoke/128-6261_Melrose-Rugby%20HD_2013_NRHP_FINAL.pdf Melrose-Rugby Historic District].&lt;/ref&gt; The Woman's Civic Betterment Club also worked with Nolen on the [[Riverland/Walnut Hills, Roanoke, Virginia]] neighborhood in promoting sanitation and overcrowding. At the turn of the century, Riverland housed railway workers and their families, and contributed to overcrowding and unhealthy tenement conditions.&lt;ref&gt;National Register of Historic Places Registration Form NPS Form 10-900, July 12, 2013. "[https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000646.pdf Riverland Historic District]." Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under contract, Nolen focused on the development of a civic center, which led to the construction of the Beaux-Arts style Municipal Building in 1915. He also made provisions for paved streets with gutters, sewage systems and other sanitation improvements in the residential neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Landon, Barbara, executive producer. “The Hand that Rocked the Cradle Pulled the Strings: The Story and Legacy of the Roanoke Civic Betterment Club.” Roanoke, VA: Blue Ridge Public Television, 1997 (video).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to producing the reports on civic improvement, the WCBC also hired speakers to promote and discuss the benefits of city improvement. Mr. J. Horace McFarland of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to come and speak to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://virginiachronicle.com/cgi-bin/virginia?a=d&amp;d=TVN19110505.1.8 Evening News]. Roanoke. Volume 23, Number 105, May 5, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; During his talk, [[J. Horace McFarland]], president of the American Civic Improvement Association, criticized several areas of Roanoke. Indeed, below his window at the hotel was an open "pit of slime and filth". The WCBC paid other speakers to come, including bacteriologists who criticized Roanoke's potential for typhoid, tuberculosis and polluted milk.&lt;ref&gt;Dotson, Paul R. 2003.[https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1067&amp;context=gradschool_dissertations "Magic City" class, community, and reform in Roanoke, Virginia, 1882-1912]. Louisiana State University Doctoral Dissertation. Pages 355-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Woman's Civic Betterment Club turned in Nolen's work, it was filed away by the city fathers. The city finally adopted Nolen's plans in the 1930s, and the extensive greenway system, riverside drive and Mill Mountain Park are part of that legacy of John Nolen and the Woman's Civic Betterment Club. "While Nolen’s work deserves public recognition in Roanoke, the women of the WCBC had a greater role in shaping Roanoke into the city it is today. Roanoke did little to recognize the work of these women over one hundred years ago; perhaps now is the time to honor their contributions."&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, Emily. 2017. "[http://www.roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/harmon-the-woman-s-civic-betterment-club-how-women-shaped/article_0dc120df-bc08-5e67-94f9-66b4d210ac03.html The Womans' Civic Betterment Club: How Women Shaped Roanoke]." [[Roanoke Times]]. November 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library==
While the Woman's Civic Betterment Club was not able to get all their goals accomplished, one goal for a public library was completed. Sarah Poage Caldwell Butler, married to  William Wilson Samuel Butler and mother to Dr. [[M. Caldwell Butler]], was trained in [[Library Science]] and had worked at the [[New York Public Library]] before her marriage. She worked with the WCBC to petition the [[Roanoke City Council]] to establish a library. "Possibly believing they were presenting an insurmountable hurdle, council members told Butler that if she could raise $30,000, the city would contribute the rest. In one week’s time (appropriately, Library Week April 19–24), Butler raised $27,000!" Sarah Butler also worked with Miss [[Lucy Addison]] to open a public library for the black neighborhoods in segregated Roanoke, and the [[Gainsboro, Roanoke, Virginia|Gainsboro]] Branch Public Library opened seven months later, on December 13, 1921. "Sarah Butler died on December 2, 1983, at age 91. In a 1971 interview, she stated that getting a public library in Roanoke was her proudest civic achievement."&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Western Virginia. 2012. "One Year in Roanoke: 1921". The Roanoker.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roanoke Cook Book==
While much of the cost of producing the first city plan came from the Great Fall Festival, additional money was needed. It was provided from the sales of the WCBC "[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2061983 The Roanoke Cook Book, Favorite Recipes by Some of Roanoke's Good Housekeepers]." Compiled by Mrs. Albert A. Stone from the WCBC members and published quickly in 1907, the 164 page book was a financial success. In addition to the recipes, the book also included advertising of local businesses and services to offset the costs of publication. "Cook book sales helped pay for one of the first city plans ever drawn up; and a woman's civic club was the first organized body to arrange for the preparation of a city plan by a competent professional man."&lt;ref&gt;Forum of civics (Houston, Tex.). [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9848105 Civics for Houston].: V.1 (No. 1-12) ; Jan. 1928-Jan. 1929. [Houston, Tex.]: [publisher not identified], 1928. [https://books.google.com/books?id=xOkTAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;ots=2LKP1xNzOs&amp;dq=%22Civic%20Betterment%20Club%22%20roanoke&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Civic%20Betterment%20Club%22%20roanoke&amp;f=false Roanoke Counts Cost of Not Planning: Cook Book Sales by Woman's Club Made Possible the First Plan of Virginia.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a hundred years later, the WCBC cook book is still referred to as an example of period cooking in Southwestern Virginia." The book says on page one: "Purchasers may congratulate themselves on acquiring so much kitchen lore in clear and condensed form." The recipes are so unique, not necessarily in the ingredients, but in the descriptions and the "flavor" of the times that is given. I don't know about the taste of the food if you choose to follow the recipes, but I'm sure you will enjoy reading them." In addition to the cooking recipes, advice is also given on using some of the recommended dishes for treating medical conditions." The chicken broth, for example,  is intended for sick children: "If patient has a fever or is very ill, set the broth aside until cold, and then remove the grease, after which heat and serve."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cookinlikeits1917.blogspot.com/2013/ 1907 Chicken Broth]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Woman's Civic Betterment Club was formed at a time when women could not vote, hold elected office, or influence civic government directly. Yet, within only a few years the citizens of Roanoke as seen marked improvement in the acquisition of land for public parks; school facilities; better city sanitation; abatement of dust and dirt nuisances on the streets. While they were unable to directly influence the city council, they were able to press for the first public library in Roanoke, and the purchase of parks, playgrounds, and pressed for a juvenile court. As a writer in 1912 said, "Their cooperation in work for Roanoke's uplift and welfare has been of signal service to the community, and the part they have taken in the general scheme of development work is worthy of the highest praise."

== History ==

Development on Zathura began on 12 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/pwmt/zathura/commit/0eeb457bea2f93983e556d07028c2cfdb49b898c|title=Zathura initial commit}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2009, version 0.0.1 was announced to the Arch Linux community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=80458|title=zathura - a document viewer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zathura has been an official Arch Linux package since April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/log/trunk?h=packages/zathura|title=Arch Linux package history for Zathura}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same year, by the end of July it was imported into Source Mage test grimoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scmweb.sourcemage.org/?p=smgl/grimoire.git;a=commit;h=c0963f5c0a65a0536d21a03a528ffaff4245cce7|title=zathura package in Source Mage}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been an official Debian package since at least 2011, as part of Debian Squeeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://packages.debian.org/squeeze/zathura|title=Debian Squeeze package for Zathura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

Zathura automatically reloads documents. When working in compiled documents such as those written in [[LaTeX]], Zathura will refresh the output whenever compilation takes place. Zathura has the option of enabling [[inverse search]] (using "synctex").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.math.cmu.edu/iki/wiki/tips/20140310-zathura-fsearch.html|title=LaTeX forward/inverse searches with Zathura}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gist.github.com/vext01/16df5bd48019d451e078|title=Vim+Zathura+Synctex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zathura can adjust the document to best-fit or to fit width, and it can rotate pages. It can view pages side-by-side and has a fullscreen mode. Pages can also be recolored to have a black background and white foreground.

Zathura can search for text and copy text to the [[X Window selection|primary X selection]]. It supports bookmarks and can open encrypted files.

The behavior and appearance of Zathura can be customized using a [[configuration file]]. Zathura has the ability to execute external [[List of command-line interpreters#Unix-like systems|shell]] commands. It can be opened in tabs using {{URL|http://tools.suckless.org/tabbed/|tabbed}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taitran.ca/vim/latex/markdown/2015/03/11/vim-latex-and-markdown-preview-scripts.html|title=Vim, Latex and Markdown preview scripts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forward/Inverse Search with Kile ==
Modifying the python codes in https://texwiki.texjp.org/&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://texwiki.texjp.org/?Kile#ob62a5ad|title=Kile - TeX Wiki|website=texwiki.texjp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with the file name ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'zathuraforward.py',''&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import sys
import re
import subprocess

if __name__ == '__main__':
    m = re.match(r'file:(\S*)#src:(\S*) (\S*)', sys.argv[1])
    if m:
        pdf = m.group(1)
        line = m.group(2)
        tex = m.group(3)
	args = line + ':0:' + tex
    subprocess.call(['zathura', '--synctex-forward', args, pdf])
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;followed by&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="console"&gt;
$ chmod +x zathuraforward.py
$ sudo cp zathuraforward.py /usr/local/bin
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;Zathura is ready for the forward search. In Kile &amp;rarr; Setting &amp;rarr; Configure Kile &amp;rarr; Build &amp;rarr; Forward pdf, set the viewer command to be zathuraforward.py with the option '%target', which will pass the line number, tex file name, and pdf file name to Zathura through the python script.

To get inverse search done, add following two lines to ~/.config/zathura/zathurarc&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="vim"&gt;
set synctex true
set synctex-editor-command "kile --line %{line} %{input}"
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
