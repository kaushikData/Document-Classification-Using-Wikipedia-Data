      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7885">'''Asset stripping''' is a term used to refer to the practice of selling off a company's [[asset]]s in order to improve returns for equity investors.  With a lower level of assets, it is maintained, the business is rendered financially less stable or viable.  For example, the sale-and-leaseback of a building would lead to an increased rental bill for the company.

The proceeds of the sale of assets may be used to lower the company's net debt. Alternatively, they may be used to pay a dividend to equityholders, leaving the company with lower [[net worth]] – i.e. the same level of debt but fewer assets (and weaker earnings) to support that debt.

In many cases where the term is used, a financial investor, referred to as a '[[corporate raid]]er', [[takeover|takes control of]] another company and then auctions off the acquired company's assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Stripping|url=http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Asset-stripping|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is generally used in a [[pejorative]] sense as such activity is not considered helpful to the company.  Asset stripping has been considered to be a problem in economies such as [[Russia]] or [[China]] which are making a transition to being market economies.  In these situations, managers of a state-owned company have been known to sell the assets they control, leaving behind nothing but debts to the state.

==History==

Early innovators of asset stripping were [[Carl Icahn]], [[Victor Posner]], and [[Nelson Peltz]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Mark|title=King Icahn|date=May 2014|publisher=Createspace|page=4|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom were investors in the 1970s and 1980s. Carl Icahn performed one of the most notorious and hostile takeovers when he acquired [[Trans World Airlines]] in 1985. Here Icahn stripped TWA of its assets, selling them individually to repay the debt assimilated during the takeover. This particular corporate raid formed the idea of selling a company's assets in order to repay debt, and eventually increase the raider's net worth.

One of the biggest corporate raids that failed to materialize was the takeover of [[Gulf Oil]] by [[T. Boone Pickens]]. In 1984, Pickens attempted to acquire Gulf Oil and sell its assets individually to gain net worth. However, the purchase would have had been severely detrimental to [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]; a customer of Gulf Oil. Therefore, Chevron stepped-in and [[Merger|merged]] with Gulf Oil for $13.2 billion, which at that time was the biggest merger between two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mattera|first1=Phillip|title=Chevron: The Big Oil Boys|url=http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1992/04/mm0492_11.html |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[BC Partners]] acquired [[Phones 4u]] for a fee in the region of £700 million. At this point in time Phones 4u had already entered [[Administration (law)|administration]] and had deep financial struggles. However, this did not prevent BC Partners from taking a £223 million dividend in order to pay off some of its own debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset-stripping by bosses finished Phones4U|url=http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/39005/Asset-stripping+by+bosses+finished+Phones4U |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ownership of BC Partners, Phones 4u had very little [[Financial independence|financial freedom]] to expand and claim back the contract of EE. In September 2014 [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]], [[Vodafone UK|Vodafone]] and [[Hutchinson 3G|Three]] decided to withdraw the rights for Phones 4u to sell their products. Due to the already poor financial situation of Phones 4u, the company has now no alternative but to sell its individual assets and close down. The net worth of Phones 4u's assets are estimated to exceed £1.4 billion, which provides BC Partners with the credit to pay off some of its debts and significantly improve its net worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Partington|first1=Adam|title=Ex-Phones 4U employee: How the retailer fell down around our ears, and BC Partners forgot to say goodbye |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/exphones-4u-employee-how-the-retailer-fell-down-around-our-ears-and-bc-partners-forgot-to-say-goodbye-9787723.html |publisher=London Evening Standard|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Asset stripping is highly controversial topic within the financial world. The benefits of asset stripping generally go to the corporate raiders, who can slash the debts they may have whilst improving their net worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pettinger|first1=Tejvan|title=Asset Stripping|url=http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/asset-stripping/ |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, since asset stripping often results in thousands of employees losing their jobs without much consideration of the consequences to the affected community, the concept can be unpopular in the public sphere. One particular example of where asset stripping cost a significant number of workers their jobs was in the [[Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas|Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC]] case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stutz|first1=Howard|title=Removal of Fontainebleau's construction crane signals doom for ill-fated Strip hotel|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/economy/removal-fontainebleau-s-construction-crane-signals-doom-ill-fated-strip-hotel |publisher=Stephens Media LLC|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the takeover, 433 people lost their jobs when assets were sold off and the company was stripped.

==In the United Kingdom==
The process of asset stripping is not an illegal practice. If a corporate raider sells the target companies assets individually and pays off its debts the [[financial regulator]]s have no room for investigation. However, some firms perform the process illegally and if found guilty may incur a substantial fine or even prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Stripping |url=http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/asset-stripping.aspx |publisher=Crown |accessdate=30 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030194421/http://www.sfo.gov.uk/fraud/what-is-fraud/corporate-fraud/asset-stripping.aspx |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asset stripping by private equity firms in Europe is now regulated pursuant to the [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive]].

===Phoenixing===

This is one of two methods a corporate raider can use to strip assets illegally. For this method to work, the corporate raider and the targeted firm must have the same director. Assets of the targeted firm are transferred to the corporate raider to ensure they remain safe from debt collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Stripping|url=http://www.lawontheweb.co.uk/Fraud_Law/Asset_Stripping |publisher=Law on the Web|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process lets the corporate raider improve their net worth while leaving liabilities with the targeted company.

===Liquidation===

This method acts on completely fraudulent terms, and results in a higher punishment from the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA). Here, corporate raiders take ownership of a company on hostile terms, transfer the assets to their name and then put the dilapidated firm into liquidation. This ensures that the corporate raider improves their net worth, and has no liability to deal with the firm recently placed into liquidation. In comparison to phoenixing, this method has the highest rate of jail sentences issued for those found guilty.

'''Clayton Magleby Christensen''' (born April 6, 1952) is an American academic, business consultant, and religious leader who currently serves as the [[Kim B. Clark]] Professor of [[Business Administration]] at the [[Harvard Business School]] of [[Harvard University]]. He is best known for his theory of "[[disruptive innovation]]"{{mdash}}first introduced in his first book, ''[[The Innovator's Dilemma]]''{{mdash}}which has been called the most influential business idea of the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Bagehot|date=15 June 2017|work=The Economist|page=53|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21723426-labours-leader-has-disrupted-business-politics-jeremy-corbyn-entrepreneur|title=Jeremy Corbyn, Entrepreneur|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen is also a co-founder of Rose Park Advisors, a venture capital firm, and [[Innosight]], a management consulting and investment firm specializing in innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Clay Christensen's Life Lessons|first=Bradford|last=Wieners|date=3 May 2012|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-03/clay-christensens-life-lessons#p4|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Clayton M. Christensen was born on April 6, 1952, in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], the second of eight children born to Robert M. Christensen (1926–1976) and his wife Verda Mae Christensen (''née'' Fuller; 1922–2004).&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;{{cite news |last=de Groote |first=Michael |date=27 Nov 2010 |title=Clayton Christensen: Just a Guy from Rose Park |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700086287/Clayton-Christensen-Just-a-guy-from-Rose-Park.html?pg=all |newspaper=Deseret News |location= |access-date=9 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the [[Rose Park, Salt Lake City|Rose Park]] neighborhood of Salt Lake City and attended the nearby [[West High School (Utah)|West High School]], where he was student body president.&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt;  Christensen and his siblings were raised as members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).

After graduating from high school in 1970, Christensen matriculated at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU). While at BYU, he took a two-year leave of absence from 1971 to 1973 to serve as a volunteer [[Missionary (LDS Church)|full-time missionary]] for the LDS Church.  He was assigned to serve in [[South Korea]] and became a fluent speaker of [[Korean language|Korean]]. After completing his missionary service, Christensen returned to BYU, graduating in 1975 with an [[University Honors|Honors]] [[B.A.]] ''[[Magna cum laude|summa cum laude]]'' in [[economics]]. Upon graduating, he received a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and spent two years studying applied [[econometrics]] at [[Oxford University]], receiving an [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil.]] in 1977.   Christensen then returned to the United States and moved to [[Harvard University]] to pursue an [[MBA]] at the [[Harvard Business School]], which he earned with high distinction in 1979.

== Career ==
After receiving his MBA in 1979, Christensen began working for the [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG) as a consultant and project manager.&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt; He took a leave of absence  from 1982 to 1983 to work in [[Washington, D.C.]] as an assistant to the [[United States Secretary of Transportation|U.S. Secretary of Transportation]], serving under [[Drew Lewis]] and then [[Elizabeth Dole]].  In 1984, he and several professors from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] founded an advanced [[ceramics]] company called Ceramics Process Systems Corporation (now known as CPS Technologies).  Christensen served as its president and CEO through the late 1980s, then decided to leave the company and become a university professor.  He returned to Harvard for doctoral study in business, receiving a [[Doctor of Business Administration]] degree in 1992.  After completing his doctorate, Christensen joined the Harvard Business School faculty and set a record by achieving the rank of [[Professor|"full" professor]] in only six years.&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt;

In 2000, he founded Innosight LLC, a consulting and training firm. In 2005, together with his colleagues at Innosight, he launched Innosight Ventures, a venture firm focused on investing in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. In 2007, he co-founded Rose Park Advisors LLC (named after the neighborhood in Salt Lake City where he was raised), an investment company which applies his research as an investment strategy.

He serves on the board of directors of [[Tata Group|Tata]] Consultancy Services (NSE: TCS), Franklin Covey (NYSE: FC), and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.

At HBS, he teaches an elective course he designed called "Building and Sustaining a Successful Enterprise", which teaches  how to build and manage an enduring, successful company or transform an existing organization, and also  in many of the school's  executive education programs. Christensen was awarded a full professorship with tenure in 1998, and currently holds eight [[honorary doctorates]] and an honorary chaired professorship at the [[National Tsinghua University]] in [[Taiwan]].
&lt;ref name="drfd.hbs.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=bio&amp;facEmId=cchristensen |title=Clayton M. Christensen - Faculty - Harvard Business School |publisher=Drfd.hbs.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen is the best-selling author of ten books, including his seminal work ''[[The Innovator's Dilemma]]'' (1997), which received the Global Business Book Award for the best business book of the year. One of the main concepts depicted in this book is also his most disseminated and famous one: disruptive innovation. The concept has been growing in interest over time since 2004, according to Google Trends' data. However, due to constant misinterpretation, Christensen still often writes articles trying to explain the concept even further. Some of his other books are focused on specific industries and discuss social issues such as education and health care.  ''Disrupting Class'' (2008) looks at the root causes of why schools struggle and offers solutions, while ''The Innovator's Prescription'' (2009) examines how to fix the American healthcare system.  The latter two books have received numerous awards as the best books on education and health care in their respective years of publication.  ''The Innovator's Prescription'' was also awarded the 2010 James A. Hamilton Award, by the College of Healthcare Executives.&lt;ref name="drfd.hbs.edu"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Christensen lives in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], [[Massachusetts]] with his wife, Christine.  They have five children, including Matthew Christensen, who played college basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] and was a member of the [[2000–01 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|2001 National Championship team]].&lt;ref name=mattc_duke&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toone|first1=Trent|title=Mormons in the ACC: Tar Heel guard plans to serve mission, while former Duke center reflects on career|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700218888/Mormons-in-the-ACC-Tar-Heel-guard-plans-to-serve-mission-while-former-Duke-center-reflects-on.html?pg=all|accessdate=19 January 2015|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christensen himself is an avid [[basketball]] player who stands {{height|ft=6|in=8}} tall, and was the starting [[Center (basketball)|center]] on the men's basketball team during his time at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/transcripts/devotionals/2004_06_08_christensen.htm|title=Decisions for Which I've Been Grateful|year=2004|publisher=BYU-Idaho|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as an [[area seventy]] from 2002 to 2009. He has also served as a counselor in the [[mission president|presidency]] of the Massachusetts Boston [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] and as a [[Bishop (LDS Church)|bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= New Area Authority Seventies |newspaper= [[Church News]] |url= http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/41712/New-Area-Authority-Seventies.html |date= April 20, 2002 |accessdate= 2013-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Christensen announced that he had been diagnosed with [[follicular lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Comments on my health |url=http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facEmId=cchristensen%40hbs.edu&amp;facInfo=custom&amp;linkId=1251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, he had an [[Brain ischemia|ischemic stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2011/0314/features-clayton-christensen-health-care-cancer-survivor.html|title=Clayton Christensen: The Survivor - Forbes.com|last=Whelan|first=David|date=14 March 2011|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonchristensen.com/myhealth.html|title=Clayton Christensen - My Health|accessdate=10 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207205607/http://claytonchristensen.com/myhealth.html|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Christensen’s health setbacks, he is once again actively teaching, speaking and writing. In 2011, Christensen published two books: ''The Innovative University''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Innovative University – Changing the DNA of Higher Education © 2011|publisher=(Jossey-Bass)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Innovator’s DNA'' (Harvard Business Press).

'''Comerica Bank Tower''' (formerly '''Momentum Place''', '''Bank One Center''' and '''Chase Center''') is a 60-story [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] [[skyscraper]] located at 1717 Main Street in the [[Main Street District, Dallas, Texas|Main Street District]] in [[downtown Dallas]], Texas.&lt;ref name="comericahq"&gt;{{cite news|title=Comerica Announces Site of New Corporate Headquarters in Texas |url=http://comerica.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=832 |publisher=Comerica Inc. |date=2007-08-13 |accessdate=2007-08-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030093619/http://comerica.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=832 |archivedate=2007-10-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing at a structural height of {{convert|787|ft|m|0}}, it is the third tallest skyscraper in the city of Dallas. (If the antennas and spires of [[Renaissance Tower (Dallas)|Renaissance Tower]] were excluded, Comerica Bank Tower would be the second tallest.) It is also the [[Tallest buildings in Texas|sixth tallest]] building in Texas and the [[Tallest buildings in the United States|61st tallest building]] in the United States.{{as of?|date=July 2018}} The building was designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[John Burgee]], land was completed in 1987.  The structure has {{convert|1500000|sqft|m2|-5}} of office space.

== History ==
Originally known as '''Momentum Place''', the tower was built as the new headquarters of MCorp Bank. The site, which included the [[Woolf Brothers]] and [[Volk Brothers]] department stores, was one of the busiest blocks in downtown Dallas. Adjacent blocks included the [[Neiman Marcus Building]], [[Wilson Building (Dallas, Texas)|Wilson Building]], [[Titche-Goettinger Building]] and [[Mercantile National Bank Building]]. The entire block from Ervay to St. Paul was leveled to make way for the new tower. The original design as proposed by Johnson called for several office buildings, a hotel and a large shopping mall designed in an ornate classical style. MCorp Bank instead desired a more restrained office tower without any retail; the design for the banking hall was also scaled down.&lt;ref&gt;David Dillon. "PHILIP JOHNSON - The flamboyant architect has transformed skylines from New York to Houston. What's in store for Dallas?." The Dallas Morning News 28 Apr. 1985, HOME FINAL, ARTS &amp; ENTERTAINMENT: 1C. NewsBank. Web. 4 Jan. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1985 and the tower opened in 1987, with MCorp initially leasing {{convert|600000|sqft|m2}} of space after moving from the [[Mercantile National Bank Building]]. At time of completion it was the most legally-contested building on the Dallas skyline due to the economic downturn of the late 1980s and the [[savings and loan scandal]]. MCorp Bank collapsed shortly after the building's opening and the bank was dissolved by [[Bank One]]. Developers and financial backers sued over ownership of the tower. Other parties defaulted on loans, and the building went into foreclosure in 1991 and again in 1995, the two largest in city history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/fatguyinalittlecoat/3043650509/in/pool-dallasurbanhistory&lt;/ref&gt; Without a lead tenant, the tower was remarketed into fully leasable class AA office space. Due to [[History of Dallas, Texas (1986-1995)|the economic downturn]], this was the last high-rise to be completed in [[Downtown Dallas|downtown]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="emporis.com"&gt;http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;id=118428 Emporis Facts&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
*The tower uses a traditional three-sectioned skyscraper form with upper level setbacks. A modern interpretation of the classic barrel vault is used throughout the structure, giving the building an overall art deco style. The setbacks carve a cross shape from the building's top section, but sheets of glass descending like a waterfall from the vaults continue the illusion to street level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/491.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104030846/http://glasssteelandstone.com/BuildingDetail/491.php |archivedate=2010-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first five floors contain a massive banking/stock exchange hall with a vaulted ceiling and skylight.&lt;ref name="emporis.com"/&gt;
*The building contains a 3 level underground parking garage and is connected to the Elm Street Garage, giving tenants 1,530 parking spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comericabanktower.com/home/pages/about.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109023221/http://www.comericabanktower.com/home/Pages/about.asp |archivedate=2009-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Comerica Tower is a main hub in the [[Dallas Pedestrian Network]] and features several retail spaces below ground.
*The east side of the building features a small plaza with a grid of trees and benches facing the [[Titche-Goettinger Building]].
*The building has been criticized heavily for its poor urban environment at street level. The lack of retail, block-long walls of polished granite and dark glass cause the tower to seem very formidable. The west side entrance plaza, located at one of the busiest corners in downtown Dallas, isolates the building from the street instead of acting like a true public space. At the time of opening, MCorp stated that the stolid exterior was intended. "We wanted a banking building, not an office building,' says MCorp chairman Gene Bishop. "We didn't want the block to be crowded. And we prevailed.'&lt;ref&gt;David Dillon. "A BUTTON-DOWN BUILDING - Momentum Place is grand and elegant, but uninviting." The Dallas Morning News 30 Aug. 1987, HOME FINAL, ARTS &amp; ENTERTAINMENT: 1C. NewsBank. Web. 4 Jan. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 a small restaurant extension was constructed along Main Street in the east plaza, hoping to mitigate some of these problems.

'''Sir Denys Hartley Henderson''' (11 October 1932 – 21 May 2016) was a British businessman. He was chairman of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] from 1987 to 1995.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Henderson was born on 11 October 1932, in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka, where his father was a tea planter.  The family returned to Scotland and Henderson went to school in [[Aberdeen]] and graduated from the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1955 in Arts and Law with an [[Master of Arts|MA]] and an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]]

===National Service===
Henderson trained as a solicitor but never practised at a [[law firm]].  He says that it was his [[National Service]] that finally convinced him to use his legal training, by showing him a side of the law which he could never aspire to in [[:wikt:civvy street|civvy street]]. He was a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[Army Legal Services Branch|directorate of army legal services]] and for 18 months acted as a [[Prosecutor|prosecuting attorney]] handling everything from fraud, assault and attempted murder to what he has described, with great delicacy, as "various unnatural offences".   After that kind of drama he said there was no way he could face the tedium of a provincial solicitor's office where wills and small debt summonses would be the highlights of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=1 April 1991 | url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/408214/uk-sir-denys-henderson-nucleus-ici-1-3/ | title=Sir Denys Henderson – the nucleus of ICI. (1 of 3) | publisher=managementtoday.co.uk | accessdate=14 January 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Chemical Industries===
Henderson joined the secretary's department at ICI head office in 1957 and was paid £900 a year.  He said "The honest truth is I just wanted a job that paid the rent" adding that "I found the change from having a huge amount of personal initiative and personal responsibility as a prosecuting officer to being a 'scrubber' in the secretary's department not very stimulating – I made one or two attempts to leave but never did."  He went on to hold various ICI legal posts including at Paints and after taking on various commercial roles went on to become Chairman of the Paints division in 1977, a position he held until 1980 when he joined the main ICI board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=1 April 1991 | url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/408213/uk-sir-denys-henderson-nucleus-ici-2-3/ | title=Sir Denys Henderson – the nucleus of ICI. (2 of 3) | publisher=managementtoday.co.uk | accessdate=14 January 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=1 April 1991 | url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/408220/uk-sir-denys-henderson-nucleus-ici-3-3/ | title=Sir Denys Henderson – the nucleus of ICI. (3 of 3) | publisher=managementtoday.co.uk | accessdate=14 January 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henderson joined the main ICI board in 1980 and was appointed deputy chairman in 1986, succeeding [[John Harvey-Jones|Sir John Harvey-Jones]] as chairman a year later.  He was instrumental in implementing a major streamlining of ICI to help it ride out the recession and face up to the tough competition of the 1990s, including a severe belt tightening and decentralised organisation with a lot of authority delegated to the chief executives who ran the individual businesses.

In recognition of his service to not only his business but his country, Henderson was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[1989 Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51772 |date=17 June 1989 |pages=1–2  |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52009 |date=5 January 1990 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 1991, [[Hanson plc|Hanson]] disclosed that it had purchased about 20 million, or 2.8 percent, of ICI's shares, leading to speculation of a possible takeover of what was at the time the UK's third-largest company.  A management team headed by Henderson and [[Frank Whitely]], its deputy chairman, led the takeover-defense plan against [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|Lord Hanson]], the chairman of Hanson, and his partner, Sir Gordon White (later [[Gordon White, Baron White of Hull|Lord White of Hull]]), enlisting the help of [[S. G.

The '''Edward A. Garmatz U.S. Courthouse''' is a [[courthouse]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland]].

==Building history==

During the 1960s, the federal courts in Baltimore occupied the old U.S. Courthouse and Post Office, now known as Courthouse East, on Calvert Street. The courts rapidly outgrew their facilities, however, and required a larger building to accommodate the growing caseload. In 1970, the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] selected a {{convert|2.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land bounded by West Pratt, West Lombard, and South Hanover streets and Hopkins Place for a new federal courthouse. Congress allocated funding for the proposed building the same year. The courthouse was designed by [[RTKL Associates]] and contains elements of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture, first popularized in 1930s Europe and later adopted for federal buildings in the United States. The International Style does not reference regional architectural trends, so similar buildings can be found throughout the United States.

In 1972, the building was named to honor [[Edward A. Garmatz]] (1903–1986). Garmatz, who was born and died in Baltimore, was a U.S. Representative for Maryland from 1947 to 1973, serving as the chairman of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries for much of his political career. Garmatz was elected during a special vote after [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.]], resigned his Congressional seat to become mayor of Baltimore.

Completed in 1976 at a cost of $23 million, the new Edward A. Garmatz Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse had 532,020 gross square feet. The federal courts occupied the building later the same year. On May 1, 1978, a dedication ceremony was held in the plaza adjoining the building. In 2004, in Courtroom 5-D of the building, [[Ed Norris]], former superintendent of the Maryland State Police, pleaded guilty to charges that he made illegal personal expenditures from the Baltimore Police Department's discretionary fund while serving as the department's commissioner.

The building's tenants include the U.S. District Court, [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]], and the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]].

==Architecture==

The construction of this building was part of an early phase of redevelopment for the area west of the [[Inner Harbor]]. Designed by RTKL Associates, a Baltimore-based, multidisciplinary firm of architects, engineers, and planners, the building exhibits characteristics of the International Style of architecture including a simple cubic mass, lack of ornamentation, and horizontal bands of windows. The designers embraced contemporary trends, materials, and technology to develop an efficient and economical building that eschewed elaborate designs of earlier federal architecture. The nine-story box-like building has an L-shaped footprint with a flat roof. The building is a poured-concrete shell with a strong exterior horizontal emphasis created by alternating concrete strips and bands of fixed windows. The windows are separated by narrow aluminum [[mullion]]s.

Interior spaces evoke the clean, [[Modern architecture|Modern]] exterior of the courthouse. Pale grey [[terrazzo]] floors and white walls are accented with dark grey painted surfaces and aluminum and silvertone metallic details such as handrails and vent grilles. Green marble panels cover elevator lobby walls, and granite tiles in pale and dark tones cover the floor. Gleaming steel elevator doors and surrounds reinforce the Modern interior design features and finishes. [[Courtroom]]s, some of which have been altered to make them appear more [[Classical architecture|Classical]], have dark wood [[wainscoting]] and [[jury box]]es. [[Coffer]]ed ceilings contain both recessed lighting and hemispherical pendant lights. [[Clerestory]] windows with decorative geometric metalwork admit exterior light into some of the courtrooms. A covered patio with brick flooring, planted containers, chairs, and tables provides a transitional space between indoor and outdoor areas.

The U.S. General Services Administration sought to add local context to the site during renovations completed in 2000. Most notably, O'Doherty Group Landscape Architecture redesigned the formerly stark brick plaza to include engaging design features that provide a human scale. Drawing inspiration from Baltimore's past, the landscape architects chose to celebrate the city's mill history, installing a water feature that invokes [[weir]]s (dams) and [[mill race]]s, culminating in a semi-circular fountain base. Designers introduced terraced grassy lawn panels and indigenous plantings. Tiered stone retaining walls of varying lengths are constructed of reclaimed Belgian block from the city's streets and respond to the natural site topography. Unique pyramidal [[bollard]]s add visual interest to the site while providing security for the building.

''Baltimore Federal'', a large-scale sculpture by noted artist [[George Sugarman]], was originally installed just outside the building's entrance in 1978. The brightly colored organic forms, executed in painted aluminum, create areas for seating and shelter. The sculpture was initially controversial. When the plaza was renovated in 2000, the work was conserved and relocated to its present site at the corner of South Hanover and West Lombard streets. Baltimore-born sculptor [[Reuben Kramer]]'s rugged bronze depiction of [[Thurgood Marshall]], accomplished lawyer, civil rights advocate, and the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, was unveiled in 1980. It is located on the corner of West Pratt Street and Hopkins Place.

As a simulation, the game and the direction of the company is controlled by the player, following a parallel timeline of the [[video game industry]] and [[History of video games|its history]]. The game was released to positive reviews, with many reviewers focusing on ''Game Dev Story''{{'}}s addictive aspects and its witty references to video game [[popular culture|pop culture]].

== Gameplay ==
[[File:GameDevscreen.png|thumb|upright|left|The menu on the left-hand side of the screen allows the player to control the direction of their game studio, while the bottom menu row shows the sales of their currently released game.]]

The player takes control of a start-up [[video game developer]], with the goal of making hit titles and consoles in order to make money.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The user controls a number of factors which can help or hinder the quality of the games released, including hiring staff, controlling the direction and speed of development, and using items which give boosts for workers or change their jobs. As the player progresses and earns more money, their building is improved upon and they are allowed to hire more staff, and thus create better games.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

Games are assigned review scores upon completion of a game ranging from 1–10 with a comment from the associated reviewer with his score. The scores generally affect the sales that go along with the game, and as they are in real life, sales are ranked with a number according to how they sold that week.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

When the player reaches the Hall of Fame level, they can hire more staff. To reach the Hall of Fame, the player needs to get the critics to give a score of at least 32.

''Game Dev Story'' received positive reviews, praising the addictiveness of its mechanics and its somewhat realistic treatment of video game development. It received an 86/100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' praised the game's freedom for the player's choice in how they choose to develop their company.&lt;ref name="AVCLUB"&gt;{{cite web|author=Heisler, Steve|date=November 1, 2010|url=http://origin.avclub.com/articles/november-1-2010,46598/|title=Games: November 2010|publisher=''[[The A.V.

Criticism of the game mostly focused on the end-period of the game. ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'' felt that ''Game Dev Story'' slowed down towards the end of the game because it became too easy to churn out successful games at a quick pace.&lt;ref name="pocketgamer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Game Dev Story review|author=Mundy, Jon|publisher=''[[Pocket Gamer]]''|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Game+Dev+Story/review.asp?c=24481|accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giant Bomb]]'s Ryan Davis felt that although the game's menu system was clunky, ''Game Dev Story'' contained a large amount of charm and addictiveness that made it worth playing.&lt;ref name="GB" /&gt; Thunderbolt felt that the game would only appeal to those who understood the video game industry.&lt;ref name="thunderboltreview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Game Dev Story – iPhone review|author=Kemph, Calvin|date=March 1, 2011|publisher=Thunderbolt|url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/reviews/article/game-dev-story-review-for-iphone.html|accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GlobaLeaks''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]], [[free software]] intended to enable secure and [[internet anonymity|anonymous]] [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]] initiatives. It was developed by the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights, an Italian-based NGO supporting freedom of speech online.

The software [[Empowerment|empowers]] anyone, even non-technical people, to easily setup and maintain a whistleblowing platform.

==History==
The project concept was initiated by Fabio Pietrosanti and shared for the first time within the hacktivist community on 15 December 2010.&lt;ref name=preconcept&gt;{{cite web|last= Pietrosanti |first= Fabio |title= An idea of leaking alternative to wikileaks |publisher= Full Disclosure |date=15 December 2010 |url= http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Dec/340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevant figures in the first development are Claudio Agosti, Arturo Filastò, Michele Orrù and Giovanni Pellerano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://logioshermes.org/home/about-mission/about-us/|title=About Us - HERMES Center For Transparency And Digital Human Rights|work=HERMES - Centro Studi Trasparenza e Diritti Umani in Rete|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="28c3workshop1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/wiki/Workshops/GlobaLeaks|title=Workshops/GlobaLeaks|last=28th [[Chaos Communication Congress]]|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/12/whistleblowing-rippling-new-corners/|title=Whistleblowing Rippling into New Corners|publisher=wired.com|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first prototype was announced on 6 September 2011 on the [[Full Disclosure (mailing list)|Full disclosure]] mailing list.&lt;ref name=prealpha&gt;{{cite mailing list | last = Filastò | first = Arturo | title = Globaleaks demo of the Prototype online! | mailinglist = Full Disclosure | date=6 September 2011 | url = http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Sep/38 | accessdate=21 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked by an interviewer on how the GlobaLeaks project began, Filastò explained: "After the whole [[WikiLeaks]] [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Cablegate]] drama we decided to work on this."&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite web| last =Renzenbrink| first =Tessel| title =Building an Infrastructure for Whistleblowing| work =Tech the Future| url = http://www.techthefuture.com/featured/building-an-infrastructure-for-whistleblowing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for GlobaLeaks "was born from the realization of a need for journalists to ensure the confidentiality of their sources despite an insecure network." It is designed to be used by journalists who do not have advanced computer skills but who need a secure platform to protect their sources. The software enables journalists and their sources to communicate securely, allowing "a continuous flow of data among individuals with complete security." It also enables journalists to verify sources by requesting various kinds of data and documents. Moreover, GlobaLeaks is more flexible than WikiLeaks, which is only in English, and is centralized, with a focus on "events of national and international resonance." GlobaLeaks, by contrast, "allows you to communicate in the language of users and is open to local issues with an impact on everyday life."&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{cite web| title =GlobaLeaks e la protezione delle fonti nell'era digitale: intervista a Claudio Agosti| work =Web Magazine| date =28 Apr 2013| url = http://magazine.festivaldelgiornalismo.com/?p=4167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filastò and his partners noted that most leaksites "had poor security," with the vulnerabilities of the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'s whistleblowing dropbox SafeHouse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Wall Street Journal faces backlash over WikiLeaks rival|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/06/wall-street-journal-wikileaks-safehouse|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, being "exposed only hours after it went online." Filastò commented that: "We saw that there is a user base but the developers were doing it wrong. We said: 'we are security people, we can do this better'. So two years ago we came up with an advanced prototype: Globaleaks 0.1. It was an initial experiment but it went quite well. We then redid it from scratch and we're now at version 2.24.".&lt;ref name=tech/&gt;

In 2011, [[Tor2web]], [[.onion|Tor Hidden Service]] proxy designed by [[Aaron Swartz]] and [[Virgil Griffith]], became part of the GlobaLeaks project as a component intended for extending platforms reachability to traditional [[HTTPS]] connections.

In 2012, the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights NGO was founded in Italy.

==Reception==
Brandon Stosh has described GlobaLeaks as "an open source project aimed at creating a worldwide, anonymous, censorship-resistant, distributed whistleblowing platform."&lt;ref name=freedomhacker&gt;{{cite web| last=Stosh| first =Brandon| title =Interview with GlobaLeaks – The Open Source Whistleblowing Platform| work =Freedom Hacker| url = http://freedomhacker.net/interview-globalleaks-open-source-whistleblowing-platform/}}&lt;/ref&gt; GlobaLeaks seeks "to democratize the [[WikiLeaks]] model" and to become "the [[De facto standard|de-facto standard]] in technologically-powered whistleblowing" focused on the research of the best trade-off between [[security]] and [[usability]]. The Hermes Center NGO "aims to help with the release of information on a different scale than WikiLeaks can address." Pietrosanti said in December 2013, we identified the needed for a "solution or software that would enable any organization to engage in whistleblower solicitation, even at the local level." he added.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web| last =Borland| first =John| title =Whistleblowing Rippling into New Corners | work =Wired| date =30 December 2013| url = https://www.wired.com/2013/12/whistleblowing-rippling-new-corners/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andy Greenberg]] has quoted Pietrosanti in saying that Hermes's goal "is to expand the leaking movement from the current fifty or so WikiLeaks copycats to a network of hundreds or thousands of 'leak nodes' run by everyone from U.S. corporations that are legally mandated to run an internal whistleblowing outlet to radical activists that hope to pass their materials on to publishers while using [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] to remain completely anonymous." GlobaLeaks, wrote Greenberg, "aims to disperse the risk of handling sensitive material over an army of individuals rather than one vulnerable group of intermediaries. 'Some people may be like [[Julian Assange|Assange]], and say, OK, we'll publish and fight and whatever,' says Pietrosanti. 'But lots of people want to fight corruption without taking that much responsibility. If the risk profile of everyone who runs a leak node is reduced, there will be a lot more leak nodes. WikiLeaks taught us something. And it brought the word whistleblower back into the awareness of the public (...) But GlobaLeaks is the next logical step." Filastò added.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite web| title =This Machine Kills Secrets: Julian Assange, the Cypherpunks, and Their Fight | work =Google Books| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vVU-l_DpZaIC&amp;pg=PT222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, Tessel Renzenbrink wrote in her article "Building an Infrastructure for Whistleblowing" that "there are very few protection mechanisms in place for whistleblowers," and that because of this, "whistleblowing featured as an important topic at OHM2013, the biggest outdoor hacker festival in Europe." At the festival, Renzenbrink spoke with people from "several organizations that have started initiatives to build a better whistleblowing infrastructure," including Filastò, who told her: "Globaleaks is a software designed to allow anybody to easily set up a whistleblower site". Filastò emphasized that "It is open source software so anybody can download it, install it and have a whistleblower site set up. (...) we don't run a whistleblowing platform ourselves (...) but we contribute to this ecosystem by enabling other people to run successful initiatives."

==Operation==
A GlobaLeaks site utilizes [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor Hidden Services]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steele|first1=Shari|title=Tor at the Heart: GlobaLeaks|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-heart-globaleaks|website=Tor Blog|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to guarantee the anonymity of the source. &lt;ref name="28c3workshop1"/&gt;

Once the submission is performed on a GlobaLeaks platform, the data is encrypted using [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] and the system automatically notifies registered recipients (e.g., local media, NGOs, or even single journalists). GlobaLeaks platforms do not store anything permanently and the submitted information and files are deleted as soon as possible with a strict [[Data retention|data retention policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GlobaLeaks Threat Model|url=https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1niYFyEar1FUmStC03OidYAIfVJf18ErUFwSWCmWBhcA/pub|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GlobaLeaks Application Security Design and Details|url=https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1SMSiAry7x5XY9nY8GAejJD75NWg7bp7M1PwXSiwy62U/pub|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process is generally improved by suggesting the sources to use the [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]] anonymous operating system while connecting to GlobaLeaks.&lt;ref name="freedomhacker" /&gt;

JavaScript is required from the [[user agent]] to access GlobaLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/issues/1928 Reference to the "Javascript required" page why Javascript it's required article #1928] Github&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
By 2017, GlobaLeaks has been internationalized in 20+ languages and implemented by more than 60 projects and initiatives all over the world. The vast range of adopters include independent media, activists, media agencies, corporations and more.

Describing the early deployments, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' reporter John Borland, GlobaLeaks had been "deployed around Europe, by independent journalism and activist groups in Serbia, investigative journalism organizations in Hungary and Italy, and an anti-Mafia group in Italy." Borland noted that "A GlobaLeaks-powered whistleblowing site in Iceland, called Ljost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dreyfus|first=Suelette|title=Whistleblowers: gagged by those in power, admired by the public|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/19/whistleblowing-survey|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Veal|first=Lowana|title=Alternative to Wikileaks Arises in Iceland|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/09/alternative-to-wikileaks-arises-in-iceland/|publisher=inter press service|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; today [30 December 2013] released new documents on that country's 2008 financial collapse." Pietrosanti told Borland that GlobaLeaks was "currently talking with organizations in a number of other countries, including several media groups that want to replicate the successful Dutch model." Borland added that "activists are also examining topic-specific leaks sites for issues such as human rights, [[wildlife]] crimes, surveillance, food safety in the United States, and censorship."&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

The largest implementation of GlobaLeaks occurred in 2014 by PubLeaks in the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vanaf vandaag: anoniem lekken naar media via doorgeefluik Publeaks|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2694/Tech-Media/article/detail/3506349/2013/09/09/Vanaf-vandaag-anoniem-lekken-naar-media-via-doorgeefluik-Publeaks.dhtml|publisher=volkskrant.nl|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handling ethical problems in counterterrorism An inventory of methods to support ethical decisionmaking|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR200/RR251/RAND_RR251.pdf|publisher=RAND Corporation|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "a foundation that counts 42 of the country's biggest media organizations among its members. There, each organization pays €500 per year, and in return receives a special laptop designed to access the leak system." Borland noted that "When accessing Publeaks from the web, whistleblowers can choose to send information to three of these media organizations. All participating organizations agree to honor embargo periods, enabling information to be examined without immediate publication pressure. The group has already had several high-profile leaks, including one that led to the resignation of a prominent parliamentarian."&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

Other major organizations supporting the setup of GlobaLeaks based whistleblowing platforms are Free Press Unlimited (FPU) and [[Associated Whistleblowing Press]] (AWP).

FPU, a Netherland-based organization, created AfriLeaks and MéxicoLeaks. AfriLeaks was GlobaLeaks' first project outside the western world run by an alliance of 15+ African news organisations that are committed to speaking truth to power. "Whistleblowing is an important instrument that should be used carefully, so future training is now being planned and will continue to take place regularly." said Pellerano to the Guardian.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Basia|title=Wikileaks for Africa? Introducing Afrileaks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/13/wikileaks-for-africa-introducing-afrileaks | publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As for MéxicoLeaks, it is an active independent whistleblowing platform aimed at revealing information for the public interest in Mexico which was awarded the 2016 FRIDA award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frida Award by MexicoLeaks|url=http://programafrida.net/en/archivos/project/mexicoleaks|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AWP, a Belgium-based organization, created [[Associated Whistleblowing Press#Ljost|Ljost]] ([[Iceland]]), [[Associated Whistleblowing Press#Filtrala|Filtrala]] ([[Spain]]), EcuadorTransparente ([[Ecuador]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Katitza|title=Leaked Documents Confirm Ecuador's Internet Censorship Machine|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/leaked-documents-confirm-ecuadors-internet-censorship-machine|accessdate=3 January 2017|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Franceschi Biccherai|first1=Lorenzo|title=Ecuador Briefly Censored Google and YouTube, Leaked Document Shows|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/ecuador-briefly-censored-google-and-youtube-leaked-document-shows|accessdate=3 January 2017|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PeruLeaks ([[Peru]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La República se suma a 'Perúleaks'|url=http://larepublica.pe/politica/750787-la-republica-se-suma-peruleaks|publisher=[La_República]|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AWP co-founder [[Pedro Noel]] describes AWP as "a nonprofit organization which struggles for freedom of expression and against human rights violations by means of whistleblowing."&lt;ref name=tech/&gt;

One of the most successful GlobaLeaks projects is [[Elephant Action League#WildLeaks project|WildLeaks]], the world's first whistleblower initiative dedicated to Wildlife and Forest Crime funded and managed by the [[Elephant Action League]] (EAL) which reported and investigated various crimes. One of the investigations was highlighted in the award-winning Netflix documentary "[https://wildleaks.org/the-ivory-game/ The Ivory Game]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New WildLeaks Website Invites Whistle-Blowers on Wildlife Crime|first=Lauren|last=Neme|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140210-wildleaks-wildlife-crime-trafficking-whistleblower/|publisher=nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nadia|last=Drake|title=A New Website That Lets Tipsters Report Wildlife Crimes|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2014/02/wildleaks/|publisher=wired.com|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carrington|first1=Damian|title=WildLeaks attracts major wildlife crime leads in first three months|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/12/wildleaks-illegal-wildlife-crime|publisher=[The Guardian]|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GlobaLeaks also partnered with major anticorruption and human rights NGOs like [[Transparency International]] Allerta Anticorruzione,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Allerta Anticorruzione project by Transparency International|url=https://allertaanticorruzione.transparency.it/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project|OCCRP]] ([https://www.occrp.org/occrpleaks/ OCCRPLeaks]) and [[Amnesty International]] Amlea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amlea project by Amnesy International|url=https://amlea.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Xnet]], an activist project which has been working on and for networked democracy and digital rights since 2008, launched in the Barcelona City Hall the first public Anti-Corruption Complaint Box using anonymity protection technology like Tor and GlobaLeaks ("Bústia Ètica" in Catalan). With this pioneering project, the Barcelona City Hall is the first municipal government to invite citizens to use tools which enable them to send information in a way that is secure, that guarantees privacy and gives citizens the option to be totally anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xnet installs a Whistleblowing Platform against corruption for the City Hall of Barcelona – powered by GlobaLeaks and Tor friendly|url=https://xnet-x.net/en/whistleblowing-platform-barcelona-city-council/}} [[File:CC-BY-SA icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported] license.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[National Anti-Corruption Authority (Italy)|Italian Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC)]], an administrative watchdog, launched their national online whistleblowing platform using GlobaLeaks and onion services, giving whistleblowers who come forward a secure way to report illegal activity while protecting their identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italian Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC) Adopts Onion Services|url=https://blog.torproject.org/italian-anti-corruption-authority-anac-adopts-onion-services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
In 2011, GlobaLeaks 0.1 received funding from [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] Serbia.

In 2012, GlobaLeaks 2.0 had been funded with $108,400 by the [[Open Technology Fund]] under the Freedom2Connect program.&lt;ref name="opentechfund"&gt;{{cite web| title = Open Technology Fund | url = https://www.opentechfund.org/project/globaleaks | accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the project was able to survive with few donations and a lot of volunteer work done by its core members.

He was the eldest son of [[Godfrey Stillman Rockefeller]] (1899–1983) and Helen Gratz. He is best known for his environmental interests and role in the [[World Wildlife Fund]].

==Early life==
Godfrey Anderson Rockefeller was born on May 22, 1924 in [[New York City]] to [[Godfrey Stillman Rockefeller]] (1899—1983) and Helen Gratz. He attended [[Phillips Academy Andover]]&lt;ref name="bushes"/&gt; and later [[Yale University]], at the same time as family friend [[George H. W. Bush]],&lt;ref name="bushes"&gt;{{cite book| author = Peter Schweizer|author2=Rochelle Schweizer| title = The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Rg94FuhoZDUC| date = 2005-01-04| publisher = Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-385-49864-7| page = 65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] and served in both [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]], achieving the rank of Major Aviator Pilot.&lt;ref name="RotorNews"&gt;[http://www.rotor.com/Publications/RotorNewssupregsup/tabid/177/newsid375/70255/Default.aspx Godfrey A. Rockefeller Obituary], RotorNews ([[Helicopter Association International]]). 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Godfrey spent 25 years in the commercial helicopter industry, working for [[Bell Helicopter]]s as Chief Pilot; Peter Wright, Sr. recalled that he once landed a {{convert|32|ft|adj=on}} [[Bell 47]] on a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} wide [[tennis court]] "because he did not want to ruin the lawn!"&lt;ref name=RotorNews/&gt; He was President and Chairman of the Helicopter Association of America, now known as the [[Helicopter Association International]], in 1968, and also belonged to the [[American Helicopter Society]], being a member since 1952 and belonging to its Gold Circle Club.&lt;ref name=RotorNews/&gt;

Rockefeller "played an important role in the founding and creation" of the [[World Wildlife Fund]], which included "hiring the first staff and chief scientist",&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/in-memoriam-godfrey-a-rockefeller In Memoriam: Godfrey A. Rockefeller], Kerry Zobor ([[World Wildlife Fund]]). January 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and later served as its Executive Director from 1972 to 1978. From 1977 to 2006 he served on the Board of Directors and the National Council of the WWF.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

From 1981 to 1990, he was Chairman of the [[Chesapeake Bay Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbf.org/Page.aspx?pid=392 Chesapeake Bay Foundation: Our History]&lt;/ref&gt; and after that Chairman Emeritus. Rockefeller owned a home on [[Gibson Island (Maryland)|Gibson Island]] in [[Maryland]] and was keenly interested in the preservation of the failing [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Following his unexpected death on January 22, 2010, at the St. Andrew's Club in [[Delray Beach, Florida]], where he also owned a home, the Gibson Island community honored him by flying their flag at [[half-mast]].&lt;ref name=RotorNews/&gt;

==Personal life==
Godfrey's first marriage to Constance Hamilton Wallace ended in divorce. He was then married to Margaret "Margo" Kuhn Rockefeller for fifty three years; she died in 2009, a year before his death.&lt;ref name=RotorNews/&gt; He is survived by four children and several grandchildren.

'''''Grand Prix Story''''' is an [[auto racing]] management [[simulation game|simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Kairosoft]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems. It was released for Android on June 8, 2011, and for iOS on September 8, 2011. The player serves as the manager for a racing team and controls the [[research and development]] of the team's cars, its crew and drivers, and the races they perform in. The game was released to mostly positive reviews.

==Gameplay==
''Grand Prix Story'' is a management [[simulation game|simulation]] [[video game]], in which the player controls a new racing team.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/12/grand-prix-story-review-iphone |title=Grand Prix Story Review (iPhone) |last=Kolan |first=Nick |date=September 12, 2011 |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players progress their team through races, which earn them money and [[unlockable (gaming)|unlocks]] longer and more difficult single race and [[Grand Prix motor racing|grand prix]] events.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; As the game progresses, the terrain on which the cars race often changes, forcing the player to take into account varying road conditions and rain.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

One of the large differences from past Kairosoft efforts such as ''[[Game Dev Story]]'' and ''[[Hot Springs Story]]'' is that progress is made visual during races. The player does not control the cars during races, and instead watches as their driver races the cars that they have improved and worked on beforehand.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; As the player's team wins Grand Prix events, the racing team expands to include multiple teams that the player must manage.&lt;ref name="ta" /&gt;

==Reception==

}}

The game received mostly mixed reviews from critics, with a 74/100 from [[review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; [[IGN]]'s Nick Kolan felt that the visuals and the formula from past Kairosoft efforts were the same, but that the execution of the concept, and the visual feedback provided by it, improved the game handily.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; ''[[TouchArcade]]''{{'s}} Brad Nicholson felt that the game ratcheted up after its slow beginning, feeling that the addition of multiple teams to manage makes the game more interesting in the longer term.&lt;ref name="ta" /&gt;

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' criticized Kairosoft's formula for its management games, feeling that ''Grand Prix Story'' reminded them more of [[deja vu]] than a fresh concept. They critiqued the game's non-interactive races, as they felt the races were dull to watch and made for a rather flat game.&lt;ref name="edge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Prix Story review|date=September 21, 2011|publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|url=http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/grand-prix-story-review|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''TouchArcade'' called the racing segments, "of having to wait and watch for most of the game’s finer points of its simulation" in their overall positive review.&lt;ref name="ta" /&gt;

The '''Hamburg University of Technology''' (in [[German language|German]] '''Technische Universität Hamburg''', abbreviated '''TUHH''') is one of the youngest universities in [[Germany]] as well as among those which have achieved popularity in a short time.

The university was founded in 1978 and in 1982/83 lecturing followed. Around 100 senior lecturers/professors and 1,150 members of staff (450 scientists, including externally funded researchers) work at the TUHH. With an average of 5,000 students the TUHH offers a high ratio of staff to students.

It is located in [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]], a district in the south of [[Hamburg]].

==Interdisciplinary Studies==
[[File:TUHH, Hamburg, Germany3.jpg|thumb|TU Hamburg Campus]]
[[File:Blick über den TUHH Campus.jpg|thumb|Inside view of the TUHH Campus]]
Instead of traditional faculties, the TUHH has separate administrations for teaching and for research: research is conducted in departments, teaching is divided into schools of study. Scientists from different subjects work together in the departments. Curricula are organized by academic speciality, depending on the course of study followed.

In the year 2000, the TUHH defined the following strategic topics of research activities:

# Information as economic value
# Organization for enterprises
# Production and process integrated environmental protection
# Sustainable management of resources
# Advanced energy systems and energy management
# Sustainable urban structures
# Systems of transport and logistic
# Advanced information and communication technologies
# Advanced materials and microsystems
# Biotechnologies and biomedical engineering

Research is divided into six interdisciplinary research departments:

# Town, Environment, Technology
# Systems Engineering
# Civil Engineering and Marine Technology
# Information and Communication Technology
# Materials, Design, Manufacturing
# Processing Technology and Energy Systems

Teaching is organized in six schools of study:
# Civil Engineering
# Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics
# Vocational Subject Education
# Management Science and Technology
# Mechanical Engineering
# Process and Chemical Engineering

==Northern Institute of Technology ==
{{main|Northern Institute of Technology}}
[[File:NIT, Gebäude F der TUHH.jpg|thumb|NIT]]
The Northern Institute of Technology (NIT) is a private business school, located in Hamburg, Germany. It was founded in 1998 as a public-private partnership of the Hamburg University of Technology and sponsoring companies. Students graduate with an MBA or Master of Technology Management (MTM) degree after completion of this course.

NIT offers a 2-year double-degree program: Students study a Master of Science in an engineering program of their choice at TUHH and concurrently are taking part in the MBA/MTM program at the NIT. The idea is to equip engineers not only with technical knowledge but at the same time provide a practical education for leading positions in industry. Besides the classical management disciplines, the MBA program includes an intensive training in various soft skills, law and a foreign language (usually German). All classes are held in English language. The faculty consists of distinguished professors and industry experts from various universities and companies across the world.

==Innovation==

TUHH founded the TUHH Technologie GmbH (TuTech). Since 1992 the TuTech has been responsible for technology transfer and advice, for trade fairs and further training, as well as congresses and the initiation of projects. Examples are the "Starterzentrum", the local initiation "hep", the "Gründerrat" of the TUHH as well as a course of studies for carriermanagement. Young entrepreneurs are accompanied and advised on setting up their own business. In 1994 the TUHH became the pioneer German university in the creation of modular courses and introduced a course with a bachelor's degree in General Engineering Science. Since 1997 nine master's degree courses and a bachelor's degree course have been added.

==University Library==
[[File:TUB TUHH.jpg|thumb|TUB]]
The library is not only used internally but as a specialized technical library of the Hamburg region. Its services are also available to citizens who are not students.

In addition to the basic service of providing printed media on loan or for use within the TUB HH, the library also procures documents from cooperation partners such as libraries, specialized information centres and publishers.

[[File:Men painting fence green.jpg|thumb|A man painting a fence green]]

A '''house painter and decorator''' is a [[tradesman]] responsible for the painting and decorating of buildings, and is also known as a '''decorator''' or '''house painter'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Painting and Decorating |author= Alf Fulcher|year= 2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=1-4051-1254-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMD"&gt;''The Modern Painter and Decorator'' volume 1 1921 Caxton&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of painting is to improve the appearance of a building and to protect it from damage by water, rust, corrosion, insects and mold.

==History of the trade in England==
In England, little is known of the trade and its structures before the late 13th century, at which paint [[guild]]s began to form, amongst them the Painters Company and the Stainers Company. These two guilds eventually merged with the consent of the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] in 1502, forming the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers]]. The guild standardised the craft and acted as a protector of the [[trade secret]]s. In 1599, the guild asked Parliament for protection, which was eventually granted in a bill of 1606, which granted the trade protection from outside competition such as [[plaster]]ers.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

The Act legislated for a seven-year [[apprenticeship]], and also barred plasterers from painting, unless apprenticed to a painter, with the penalty for such painting being a fine of £5. The Act also enshrined a maximum daily fee of 16 [[old pence]] for their labour.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

[[File:painter paints a room arp.jpg|thumb|A paint master]]
;The Paint Master
Enforcement of this Act by the Painter-Stainers Company was sought up until the early 19th century, with [[master craftsman|master painters]] gathering irregularly to decide the fees that a [[journeyman]] could charge, and also instigating an early version of a [[job centre]] in 1769, advertising in the [[London]] [[newspaper]]s a "house of call" system to advertise for journeymen and also for journeymen to advertise for work. The guild's power in setting the fee a journeyman could charge was eventually overturned by law in 1827, and the period after this saw the guild's power diminish, along with that of the other guilds; the guilds were superseded by [[trade union]]s, with the Operative United Painters' Union forming sometime around 1831.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

In 1894, a national association formed, recreating itself in 1918 as the National Federation of Master Painters and Decorators of England and Wales, then changing its name once again to the British Decorators Association before merging, in 2002, with the Painting &amp; Decorating Federation to form the Painting &amp; Decorating Association. The Construction Industry Joint Council, a body formed of both unions and business organizations, today has responsibility for the setting of pay levels.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

==Activities of the trade==
Historically, the painter was responsible for the mixing of the [[paint]]; keeping a ready supply of [[pigment]]s, [[oil]]s, [[paint thinner|thinner]]s and [[Oil drying agent|drier]]s. The painter would use his experience to determine a suitable mixture depending on the nature of the job. In modern times, the painter is primarily responsible for preparation of the surface to be painted, such as patching holes in [[drywall]], using masking tape and other protection on surfaces not to be painted, applying the paint and then cleaning up.&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;

Larger firms operating within the trade were generally capable of performing many painting or decoration services, from creating an [[accent wall]] to [[signwriter|sign writing]], to the [[gilding]] of objects or the [[wood finishing|finishing]] or refinishing of [[furniture]].&lt;ref name="TMD" /&gt;  

More recently, professional painters are responsible for all preparation prior to painting. All scraping, [[sanding]], [[wallpaper]] removal, [[caulk]]ing, drywall or [[wood]] repair, patching, [[stain removal]], filling [[nail (fastener)|nail]] holes or any defects with plaster or [[putty]], cleaning, [[adhesive tape|taping]], preparation and priming are considered to be done by the professional [[independent contractor|contracted]] painter.

'''Irineu Evangelista de Sousa''' ({{IPA-pt|iɾiˈnew ivɐ̃ʒeˈliʃtɐ dʒi ˈsowzɐ}}), the '''Viscount of Mauá'''  ({{IPA-pt|viʃˈkõdʒi dʒi mɐwˈa|}}, 1813–1889) was a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] entrepreneur, [[industrialist]], banker and politician. Born to a family of small [[estancieiros]] (ranchers), Mauá became one of the world's richest men; by 1867, his wealth was larger than the annual budget of the [[Brazilian Empire]]. He was called ''the [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] of the South American continent'' by the [[New York Times]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D07E0DD163DE43BBC4A51DFBE66838A669FDE&amp;scp=10&amp;sq=San+Paulo&amp;st=p|title=SOUTH AMERICA.; The Great Coffee Product of Brazil-- New-York Losing the Trade-- Brazilian Emancipation-- Railway Loans and Amazonian Navigation Contracts-- General News.|publisher=New York Times|date= 22 August 1871|accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received the titles of [[baron]] (1854) and ''visconde com grandeza'' ([[Viscount|viscount with greatness]]) (1874) of [[Mauá]]. A pioneer in several areas of the [[economy of Brazil]], one of his greatest achievements was to start the construction of the [[Mauá Railroad]], the first railroad in Brazil.

At his peak, Mauá controlled eight of the country's ten largest companies (the remaining two were state-owned); his banking interests stretched over to Britain, France, the United States and [[Argentina]]. Mauá also founded the first bank in [[Uruguay]] (Banco Mauá Y Cia).

Mauá, who established the modern [[Banco do Brasil]], is credited with financing much of the Brazilian economy activity in the 19th century, particularly in coffee plantation, and with the construction of the first railroads, [[shipyard]] and [[cast iron]] [[metalwork]] in the country. Mauá commissioned the first [[telegraphic]] [[submarine communications cable|submarine cable]] connecting South America to Europe, developed commercial transportation via [[steamboats]] on rivers [[Amazon river|Amazon]] and [[Guaíba]], and installed the first [[natural gas|gas]]-fueled [[street lights]] in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], then Brazil's capital. His fortunes turned around with the decay of the Empire after the [[Paraguayan War]], however, and, by the time he died, Mauá had lost most of his wealth.

==Legacy and honors==
At a time in which Brazil was dominated by government-protected landowners who prioritized exports in a slave-based economy, Mauá defended [[free enterprise]], [[liberalism]], [[industrialization]] and the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]]. After his death, he was given several honors and acknowledgements:
*He is the patron of the [[Ministry of Transport (Brazil)|Ministry of Transport]]
*The city of [[Visconde de Mauá]] is named after him
*The [[Baron of Mauá International Bridge]] links the city of [[Jaguarão]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] with [[Río Branco, Uruguay]]

'''Jean Paul Getty''' ({{IPAc-en|'|g|ɛ|t|i}}; December 15, 1892 – June 6, 1976), known widely as J. Paul Getty, was a [[British American]] petrol-industrialist,&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite web|first=Alden|last=Whitman|author-link=Alden Whitman|title=J.

He founded the [[Getty Oil|Getty Oil Company]], and in 1957 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine named him the [[Wealthiest Americans (1957)|richest living American]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Lubar|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1986/03/17/67242/index.htm|title=The Odd Mr. Getty: The possibly richest man in the world was mean, miserly, sexy, fearful of travel and detergents|work=''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 17, 1986|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the 1966 ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' named him as the world's richest private citizen, worth an estimated $1.2 billion (approximately ${{Inflation|US|1.2|1966|r=2}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Norris|last1=McWhirter|first2=Ross|last2=McWhirter|title=Guinness Book of Records|publisher=Jim Pattison Group|location=London, England|year=1966|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his death, he was worth more than $6 billion (approximately ${{Inflation|US|6|1976|r=2}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}).&lt;ref name=Lenzner&gt;Lenzner, Robert. ''The great Getty: the life and loves of J. Paul Getty, richest man in the world''.

Despite his vast wealth, Getty was famously [[Frugality|frugal]], notably [[John Paul Getty III#Kidnapping|negotiating his grandson's Italian kidnapping ransom]] in 1973.

Getty was an avid collector of [[art]] and [[antiquities]]; his collection formed the basis of the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], and over $661 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|0.661|1976|r=1}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) of his estate was left to the museum after his death.&lt;ref name=Lenzner/&gt; He established the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] in 1953. The trust is the world's wealthiest art institution, and operates the J. Paul Getty Museum Complexes: The [[Getty Center]], The [[Getty Villa]] and the [[Getty Foundation]], the [[Getty Research Institute]], and the [[Getty Conservation Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Edward|last=Wyatt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/30/arts/design/30gett.html|title=Getty Fees and Budget Reassessed|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=March 30, 2018|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Getty was born into an Irish-Scots family in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], to Sarah Catherine McPherson (Risher) and [[George Getty]], who was an attorney in the [[insurance]] industry. Paul was raised to be a [[Methodist]] by his parents, his father was a devout [[Christian Scientist]] and both were strict [[teetotalers]]. In 1903, when Paul was 10 years old, George Getty travelled to [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma|Bartlesville]], [[Oklahoma]], and bought the [[mineral rights]] for 1,100 acres of land. Within a few years Getty had established wells on the land which were producing 100,000 barrels of [[crude oil]] a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As newly-minted millionaires, the family moved to [[Los Angeles]] to escape the harsh Minnesota winters. At age 14 Paul attended [[Harvard Military School]] for a year, followed by [[John H. Francis Polytechnic High School|Polytechnic High School]], where he was given the nickname "Dictionary Getty" because of his love of reading.&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1215.html| title=J. Paul Getty Dead at 83; Amassed Billions from Oil| author=Alden Whitman| publisher=New York Times| date=1976-06-06| access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became fluent in [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] - over the course of his business life he would also become conversational in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. A love of the [[Classics]] also led him to acquire reading proficiency in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"/&gt; He enrolled at the [[University of Southern California]], then at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but left both before obtaining a degree. Enamored with Europe after travelling abroad with his parents in 1910, on November 28, 1912, Paul enrolled at the [[University of Oxford]]. A [[letter of introduction]] by then-[[President of the United States]] [[William Howard Taft]] enabled him to gain independent instruction from tutors at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]. Although he did not belong to Magdalen, he claimed that the aristocratic students "accepted me as one of their own", and he would fondly boast of the friends he made, including [[Edward VIII]], the future [[King of the United Kingdom]] and [[Emperor of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Pearson|title=Painfully Rich| year=1995| publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York City| p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his degree in Economics and Political Science in 1914, then spent months travelling throughout Europe and [[Egypt]], before meeting his parents in [[Paris]] and returning with them to America in June 1914.

==Career==
In the autumn of 1914, George Getty gave his son $10,000 to invest in expanding the family's oil field holdings in Oklahoma. The first lot he bought, the Nancy Taylor No. 1 Oil Well Site near [[Haskell, Oklahoma]], was crucial to his early financial success. It struck oil in August 1915 and by the next summer the 40% net production royalty he accrued from it had made him a millionaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Getty returned to business in Oklahoma. During the 1920s, he added about $3 million to his already sizable estate. His succession of marriages and divorces (three during the 1920s, five throughout his life) so distressed his father, however, that J. Paul inherited a mere $500,000 (approximately [[United States dollar|$]]{{Inflation|US|.5|1930|r=2}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) of the $10 million fortune (approximately ${{Inflation|US|10|1930|r=2}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) his father George had left at the time of his death in 1930. He was left with one-third of the stock from George Getty Inc., while his mother received the other two thirds, giving her a controlling interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, his mother convinced him to contribute to the establishment of a $3.368 million (about $62.5 million in 2018) [[investment trust]], called the Sarah C. Getty Trust, to ensure that the family's ever-growing wealth could be channeled into a tax-free, secure income for future generations of the Getty family. The trust enabled J. Paul to have easy access to ready capital, which at the time he was funneling into the purchase of [[Tidewater Petroleum]] stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=63–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shrewdly investing his resources during the [[Great Depression]], Getty acquired [[Pacific Western Oil|Pacific Western Oil Corporation]], and he began the acquisition (completed in 1953) of the Mission Corporation, which included [[Tidewater Petroleum|Tidewater Oil]] and [[Skelly Oil]]. In 1967 the billionaire merged these holdings into Getty Oil.

Beginning in 1949, Getty paid [[Ibn Saud]] $9.5 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|9.5|1949|r=2}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) in cash and $1 million a year for a 60-year concession to a tract of barren land near the border of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]]. No oil had ever been discovered there, and none appeared until four years had passed, and $30 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|30|1953|r=2}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) had been spent. From 1953 onward, Getty's gamble produced {{convert|16000000|oilbbl}} a year, which contributed greatly to the fortune responsible for making him one of the richest people in the world.

Getty increased the family wealth, learning to speak Arabic, which enabled his unparalleled expansion into the [[Middle East]]. Getty owned the controlling interest in nearly 200 businesses, including Getty Oil. Associates identified his overall wealth at between $2 billion and $4 billion. It didn't come easily, perhaps inspiring Getty's widely quoted remark—"The meek shall inherit the earth, but not its mineral rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoughts.forbes.com/thoughts/business-j-paul-getty-the-meek-shall "Thoughts On The Business Of Life"] at [[Forbes magazine|''Forbes'']]&lt;/ref&gt; J. Paul Getty was an owner of [[Getty Oil]], Getty Inc., George F. Getty Inc., Pacific Western Oil Corporation, Mission Corporation, Mission Development Company, [[Tidewater Oil]], [[Skelly Oil]], Mexican Seaboard Oil, Petroleum Corporation of America, [[Spartan Aircraft Company]], Spartan Cafeteria Company, Minnehoma Insurance Company, Minnehoma Financial Company, [[Pierre Hotel]] at Fifth Avenue and East 61st Street (NYC), Pierre Marques Hotel at Revolcadero Beach near Acapulco, Mexico, a 15th-century palace and nearby castle at Ladispoli on the coast northwest of Rome, a Malibu ranch home and [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]], a 72-room mansion near [[Guildford, Surrey]], 35 miles from London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Clyde H.|last=Farnsworth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/30/surrey-estate-seat-of-getty-empire.html|title=Surrey Estate Seat of Getty Empire|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 30, 1964|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[the United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1950s and became a prominent [[Anglophile|admirer]] of England, its people, and its culture. He lived and worked at his 16th-century [[Tudor period|Tudor]] estate, [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]]; the traditional country house became the centre of Getty Oil and his associated companies and he used the estate to entertain his British and Arabian friends (including the [[Rothschild banking family of England|British Rothschild family]] and numerous rulers of Middle Eastern countries). Getty lived the rest of his life in England, dying of [[heart failure]] at the age of 83 on June 6, 1976.

===Art collection===
Getty's first forays into collecting began in the late 1930s, when he took inspiration from the collection of 18th-century French paintings and furniture owned by the landlord of his New York City penthouse, Mrs. Amy Guest, a relation of [[Sir Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fell in love with 18th-century France and began buying furniture from the period at knock-down prices because of the still-depressed art market. He wrote several books on collecting: ''Europe and the 18th Century'' (1949), ''Collector's Choice: The Chronicle of an Artistic Odyssey through Europe'' (1955) and ''The Joys of Collecting'' (1965). The overwhelming goal in his collecting was to buy items at a bargain which would offer a sure return on his investment. His stinginess limited the range of his collecting because he refused to pay full-price: his companion in later life, Penelope Kitson, would comment that "Paul was really too mean ever to allow himself to buy a great painting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, at the time of his death he owned more than 600 items valued at over $4 million (approximately $17.5 million in 2018 USD), including paintings by [[Rubens]], [[Titian]], [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], [[Renoir]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Degas]], and [[Monet]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"/&gt; During the 1950s, Getty's interests shifted to [[Greco-Roman]] sculpture, which led to the building of the [[Getty Villa]] in the 1970s to house the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These items were transferred to the [[Getty Museum]] and the Getty Villa in Los Angeles after his death.

==Marriages, divorces and children==
Getty was a notorious womanizer from the time of his youth, something which horrified his conservative Christian parents. His lawyer Robin Lund once said that "Paul could hardly ever say 'no' to a woman, or 'yes' to a man." &lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Julie|last=Miller|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/fx-trust-john-paul-getty-girlfriends|title= Yes, J.

In 1917, when he was 25, a [[paternity suit]] was filed against Getty in Los Angeles by Elsie Eckstrom, who claimed he was the father of her newborn daughter Paula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Pearson|title=Painfully Rich| year=1995| publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York City| p=36–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eckstrom claimed that Getty had taken her virginity and fathered the child, while his legal team tried to undermine her credibility by claiming that she had a history of [[promiscuity]]. In late 1917 he agreed to a settlement of $10,000, upon which she left town with the baby and was never heard of again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Pearson| title=Painfully Rich| year=1995| publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York City|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-23/books/bk-5461_1_j-paul-getty| title=The Great Getty : THE LIFE AND LOVES OF J.

They eloped to [[Cuernavaca, Mexico]], but the marriage was [[bigamy|bigamous]] as he was not yet divorced from Jeanette.

Helmle was the daughter of a prominent German doctor, who was strongly opposed to her marrying the twice-divorced, 36-year-old Getty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Pearson| title=Painfully Rich| year=1995| publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York City| p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two eloped to Cuernavaca, where he had married Allene Ashby, then settled in Los Angeles. Following the birth of their son, Getty lost interest in her and her father convinced her to return to Germany with their child in 1929. After a protracted and contentious battle, the divorce was finalized in August 1932, with Adolphine receiving a huge sum for [[punitive damage]]s and full custody of Ronald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=48,59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Getty was introduced to Rork when she was 14 years old, but she didn't become his romantic partner until she was 21 in 1930. Because he was in the midst of his divorce from Adolphine, the couple had to wait two years before they married. He was largely absent during their marriage, staying for long stretches of time in Europe. In 1936 she sued him for divorce, alleging emotional abuse and neglect. She also described an incident while the two were abroad in [[Italy]], in which she claimed Getty had forced her to climb to view the crater of [[Mount Vesuvius]] while she was heavily pregnant with their first son.&lt;ref name="autogenerated71"&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided in her favor and she was awarded $2,500 per month [[alimony]] plus $1,000 each in [[child support]] for her sons.&lt;ref name="autogenerated71"/&gt;

At age 99, in 2013, Getty's fifth wife, Louise—now known as Teddy Getty Gaston—published a memoir reporting how Getty had scolded her for spending money too freely in the 1950s on the treatment of their six-year-old son, Timmy, who had become blind from a [[brain tumor]]. Timmy died at age 12, and Getty, living in England apart from his wife and son back in the U.S., did not attend the funeral. Teddy divorced him that year.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite news|first=Judith|last=Newman|title=His Favorite Wife: 'Alone Together,' by Teddy Getty Gaston|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/books/review/alone-together-by-teddy-getty-gaston.html |work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 30, 2013|accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teddy Gaston died in April 2017 at the age of 103.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Miller|url=http://people.com/celebrity/teddy-getty-gaston-dies-j-paul-getty-ex-wife/|title=J.

==Kidnapping of grandson John Paul Getty III==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:As I See It.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''As I See It'', Getty's autobiography{{deletable image-caption|Wednesday, 21 February 2018|PROD}}]] --&gt;
On July 10, 1973, in Rome, [['Ndrangheta]] kidnappers abducted Getty's 16-year-old grandson, [[John Paul Getty III]], and demanded by telephone a $17 million payment (approximately [[United States dollar|$]]{{Inflation|US|17|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) for the young man's safe return. However, "the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather."&lt;ref name=TelegraphPaulObit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1427781/Sir-Paul-Getty.html|title=Sir Paul Getty (obituary)|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=April 17, 2003|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Paul Getty Jr.]] asked his father for the money, but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1386478.stm|title=Profile: Sir John Paul Getty II|publisher=BBC News|location=London, England|date=13 June 2001|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1973, an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike.&lt;ref name=TelegraphPaulObit/&gt; The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid $3.2 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|3.2|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}): "This is Paul's ear. If we don't get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits."&lt;ref name=TelegraphPaulObit/&gt;

When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to $3 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|3|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}), Getty senior agreed to pay no more than $2.2 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|2.2|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) – the maximum that would be tax-deductible. He lent his son the remaining $800,000 (approximately ${{Inflation|US|.8|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in a [[Lauria]] filling station, in the [[province of Potenza]], shortly after the ransom was paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ilpost.it/2013/07/10/paul-getty/2/|work=[[Il Post]]|title=Il rapimento di Paul Getty|language= it|date= July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but, it is claimed, Getty refused to come to the phone.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bruce|last=Weber|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/europe/08gettyobit.html |title=J. Paul Getty III, 54, Dies; Had Ear Cut Off by Captors|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine people associated with 'Ndrangheta were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He died 30 years later on February 5, 2011, at the age of 54.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Getty defended his initial refusal to pay the ransom on two points. First, he argued that to submit to the kidnappers' demands would immediately place his other fourteen grandchildren at the risk of copy-cat kidnappers. He added:

{{quote|The second reason for my refusal was much broader-based. I contend that acceding to the demands of criminals and terrorists merely guarantees the continuing increase and spread of lawlessness, violence and such outrages as terror-bombings, "skyjackings" and the slaughter of hostages that plague our present-day world. (Getty, 1976, p. 139).}}

==Reputation for frugality==
Many anecdotal stories exist of Getty's reputed thriftiness and parsimony, which struck observers as comical, even perverse, because of his extreme wealth.&lt;ref name="Refinery29.com"&gt;{{cite article| first=Elana| last=Nicolaou| url=//www.refinery29.com/2018/03/194296/was-jp-getty-cheap-refused-paying-ransom-trust-drama?bucketed=true| title=Was J Paul Getty Really THAT Cheap?| publisher=[[Refinery29|Refinery29.com]]|location=New York City| date=March 25, 2018| access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most widely known examples are his reluctance to pay his grandson's $17 million Italian kidnapping ransom, and the notorious pay-phone which he had installed at Sutton Place. A darker incident was his fifth wife's claim that Getty had scolded her for spending too much on their terminally ill son's medical treatment, though he was worth tens of millions of dollars at the time.&lt;ref name="Refinery29.com"/&gt; He was well known for bargaining on almost everything to obtain a rock-bottom price, including suites at luxury hotels and virtually all purchases like art work and real estate. Sutton Place, for instance, a 72-room mansion, was purchased from [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 5th Duke of Sutherland]] in 1959 for the extremely low price of ₤60,000, about half of what the Duke had paid when he bought it 40 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*His secretary claimed that Getty did his own laundry by hand, because he didn't want to pay for his clothes to be laundered, and when his shirts would become frayed at the cuffs, he would simply trim off the frayed part instead of purchasing new shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|first=Debbie|last=Jackson|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/throwback-tulsa-billionaire-j-paul-getty-got-his-start-in/article_52fe4523-5205-5022-b612-c053c31312b4.html| title=Throwback Tulsa: Billionaire J. Paul Getty got his start in Tulsa | work=[[Tulsa World]]|publisher=BH Media|location=Tulsa, Oklahoma|date=December 10, 2017| access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Re-using stationery was another obsession of Getty's. He had a habit of writing responses to letters on the margins or back sides and mailing them back, rather than use a new sheet of paper. He also carefully saved and re-used [[manila envelope]]s, rubber bands, and other office supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=69, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When Getty took a group of friends to a dog show in London, he made them walk around the block for 10 minutes until the tickets became half-priced at 5 pm, because he didn't want to pay the full 5 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] per head (about ₤12/$17 in 2018).&lt;ref name="Refinery29.com"/&gt;  
*His decision to move to Sutton Place was made in part because the [[cost of living]] was cheaper than in [[London]], where he had resided at the [[The Ritz Hotel, London|Ritz]]. He once boasted to American columnist [[Art Buchwald]] that it cost 10 cents for a [[rum and coke]] at Sutton Place, whereas at the Ritz it was over a dollar.&lt;ref name="Refinery29.com"/&gt;

Author [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]] attributed part of this extreme penny-pinching to the [[Methodist]] sensibility of Getty's upbringing, which emphasized modest living and personal economy. His business-like attention to the bottom-line was also a major factor: "He would allow himself no self-indulgence in the purchase of a place to live, a work of art, even a piece of furniture, unless he could convince himself that it would appreciate in value."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty himself claimed that his frugality towards others was a response to people taking advantage of him and not paying their fair share: "It's not the money I object to, it's the principle of the thing that bothers me ..."&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"/&gt;

===Coin-box telephone===
Getty famously had a pay phone installed at Sutton Place, helping to seal his reputation as a miser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Julie|last=Miller|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/all-the-money-in-the-world-j-paul-getty|title=The Enigma of J. Paul Getty, the One-Time Richest Man in the World|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date=December 22, 2017|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty placed dial-locks on all the regular telephones, limiting their use to authorized staff, and the coin-box telephone was installed for others. In his autobiography, he described his reasons:

{{quote|Now, for months after [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]] was purchased, great numbers of people came in and out of the house. Some were visiting businessmen. Others were artisans or workmen engaged in renovation and refurbishing. Still others were tradesmen making deliveries of merchandise. Suddenly, the Sutton Place telephone bills began to soar. The reason was obvious. Each of the regular telephones in the house has direct access to outside lines and thus to long-distance and even overseas operators. All sorts of people were making the best of a rare opportunity. They were picking up Sutton Place phones and placing calls to girlfriends in [[Geneva]] or [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and to aunts, uncles and third cousins twice-removed in [[Caracas]] and [[Cape Town]]. The costs of their friendly chats were, of course, charged to the Sutton Place bill.&lt;ref&gt;Getty, 1976, pg.319&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When speaking in a televised interview with [[Alan Whicker]] in February 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Solitary Billionaire J. Paul Getty|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00nw1t5 |work=Talk at the BBC|publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty said that he thought guests would want to use a payphone.&lt;ref&gt;''Talk at the BBC'', BBC Four, April 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After 18 months, Getty explained, "The in-and-out traffic flow at Sutton subsided. Management and operation of the house settled into a reasonable routine. With that, the pay-telephone [was] removed, and the dial-locks were taken off the telephones in the house."&lt;ref&gt;Getty, 1976, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years &amp; death==
On June 30, 1960, Getty threw a 21st birthday party for a relation of his friend, the [[Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk|16th Duke of Norfolk]], which served as a housewarming party for the newly-purchased Sutton Place.&lt;ref name="autogenerated119"&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,200 guests consisting of the cream of British society were invited. Party goers were irritated by Getty's stinginess, such as not providing cigarettes and relegating everyone to using [[creosote]] [[portable toilet]]s outside. At about 10pm the party descended into pandemonium as [[party crasher]]s arrived from London, swelling the already overcrowded halls, causing an estimated ₤20,000 in damages.&lt;ref name="autogenerated119"/&gt; A valuable silver [[ewer]] by the 18th century [[silversmith]] [[Paul de Lamerie]] was stolen, but returned anonymously when the London newspapers began covering the theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-wild-was-j-paul-gettys-notorious-british-party| title=How Wild Was J. Paul Getty's Notorious British Party?| author=Anthony Haden-Guest| publisher=The Daily Beast| date=2015-09-27| access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the event made the newly-arrived Getty the object of ridicule, and he never threw another large party again.

Getty remained an inveterate hard worker, boasting at age 74 that he often worked 16 to 18 hours per day overseeing his operations across the world.&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"/&gt; The Arab-Israeli [[Yom Kippur War]] of October 1973 caused a worldwide oil shortage for years to come. In this period, the value of Getty Oil shares quadrupled, with Getty enjoying personal earnings of $25.8 million in 1975 (appr. $120 million in 2018 USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His insatiable appetite for women and sex also continued well into his 80s. He used an experimental drug, "H3", to maintain his potency.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt; Getty met the English interior designer Penelope Kitson in the 1950s and entrusted her with decorating his homes and the public rooms of the [[oil tanker]]s he was launching. From 1960 she resided in a cottage on the grounds of Sutton Place, and, though she did not have a sexual relationship with him, Getty held her in high respect and trust. Other mistresses who resided at Sutton Place included the married Mary Teissier, a distant cousin of the last [[Tsar of Russia]], [[Lady Ursula d'Abo]], who had close connections to the British Royal Family, and [[Nicaragua]]n-born Rosabella Burch.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of Getty's domestic arrangement that: "[Getty] ended his life with a collection of desperately hopeful women, all living together in his Tudor mansion in England, none of them aware that his favorite pastime was rewriting his will, changing his insultingly small bequests: $209 a month to one, $1,167 to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|first=Jane|last=O'Reilly|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/books/isn-t-it-funny-what-money-can-do.html| title=Isn't It Funny What Money Can Do?| work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=March 30, 1986|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Penelope Kitson received a handsome bequest upon Getty's death: 5,000 Getty Oil shares (appr. $826,500 in 1976), which doubled in value during the 1980s, and a $1,167 monthly income.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

Getty died June 6, 1976, in [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]] near [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; He was buried in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles County, California at the [[Getty Villa]]. The gravesite is not open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=getty&amp;GSfn=j&amp;GSmn=paul&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=6730&amp;df=all&amp;|title=J.

== Media portrayals ==
The 2017 film ''[[All the Money in the World]]''{{spaced ndash}}directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and adapted from the book ''Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty'' by [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]]{{spaced ndash}}is a dramatisation of the abduction of Getty's grandson. [[Kevin Spacey]] originally portrayed Getty. However, after multiple [[Kevin Spacey#Sexual misconduct allegations|sexual assault allegations]] against the actor, his scenes were cut and re-shot with [[Christopher Plummer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/ridley-scott-reveals-how-kevin-spacey-was-erased-all-money-world-1068755|title= Ridley Scott Reveals How Kevin Spacey Was Erased From 'All the Money in the World'|last= Giardina|first=Carolyn|date=December 18, 2017|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/oscar-nominations-2018-complete-list-nominees-1067893 |title=Oscars: 'Shape of Water' Leads With 13 Noms |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=January 23, 2018|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kidnapping is also dramatized in the first season of the American anthology drama series ''[[Trust (U.S. TV series)|Trust]]'', in which Getty is portrayed by [[Donald Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=FX Sets 'Atlanta' &amp; 'The Americans' Return Dates, 'Trust' Premiere – TCA|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/fx-atlanta-the-americans-trust-premiere-dates-1202236211/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation|Penske Business Media, LLC]]|accessdate=January 5, 2018|date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leffmann Behrends''' (or '''Liepmann Cohen''', c. 1630 – January 1, 1714, [[Hanover]]) was the German financial agent of the dukes and princes of [[Hanover]].

== Vita ==
Leffmann Behrens honorable position is lauded by [[Mannasseh ben Israel]] in his ''Hope of Israel''. Behrends frequently used his influence in favor of his coreligionists. His father, '''Issachar Bärmann''' by name (died August 23, 1675), was the son of the [[Talmud]]ic scholar '''Isaac Cohen of Borkum'''; and the name "''Behrends''" was adopted by ''Liepmann'' in honor of his father. His first wife, Jente (died 1695), was a daughter of Joseph Hameln, president of the congregation; his second, Feile (died 1727), a daughter of Judah Selkele Dilmann. Liepmann had the following children by his first marriage: Naphtali Hirz (died 1709), who became president of the congregation; Moses Jacob (died 1697), praised as a Talmudic scholar and philanthropist; Gumpert and Isaac, who, in 1721, were accused of an attempt at fraudulent bankruptcy, in consequence of which they were compelled to leave Hanover (1726). Behrend's daughter Genendel became the wife of the chief [[rabbi]] of [[Prague]], [[David Oppenheim (rabbi)|David Oppenheim]]. She died at Hanover June 13, 1712.

Behrend's services as president of the congregation, in his endeavors to preserve the congregational cemetery, and to secure a special rabbinate and other privileges for Hanover, were valuable in the extreme. In 1683 Duke Rudolph August appointed him chief supervisor of the bleacheries of his community in the Harz. He stood in close relation to a number of princes, assisted Talmudic scholars, and established a "bet ha-midrash" in his own house. The library of his son-in-law David Oppenheimer, which he had himself enlarged, and which his son-in-law, owing to the censorship and other reasons, did not wish to keep at Prague, was removed by Behrends to Hanover, thus enabling the pastor Johann Christian Wolf of Hamburg to avail himself of it in preparing the ''Bibliotheca Hebræa''. Together with his son Naphtali Hirz, Liepmann in 1703 had a new [[synagogue]] erected upon the site of the old one, which, constructed by order of the duke of Hanover in 1609, had been torn down four years after its erection. The fate of Liepmann's two sons Gumbert and Isaac is related in a family "megillah", published by Jost in the second volume of the ''Jahrbuch für die Geschichte der Juden''.

'''Light industry''' is [[industry|industries]] that usually are less [[Capital intensity|capital-intensive]] than [[heavy industry]] and is more [[consumer]]-oriented than [[business]]-oriented, as it typically produces smaller consumer goods. Most light industry products are produced for [[end user]]s rather than as intermediates [[business-to-business|for use by other industries]]. Light industry facilities typically have less [[natural environment|environment]]al impact than those associated with [[heavy industry]]. For that reason [[zoning]] laws are more likely to permit light industry near [[residential area]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

One definition states that light industry is a "[[manufacturing]] activity that uses moderate amounts of partially processed materials to produce items of relatively high value per unit weight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/l/light-industry/|title=Light Industry Law And Legal Definition|publisher=US Legal|accessdate=26 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Characteristics==
Light industries require fewer [[Raw material|raw materials]], space and power. While light industry typically causes little pollution, particularly compared to heavy industry, some light industry can cause significant pollution or risk of contamination. For example, electronics manufacturing, itself often a light industry, can create potentially harmful levels of [[lead]] or [[chemical waste]]s in soil without proper handling of solder and waste products (such as cleaning and degreasing agents used in manufacture).

==Department of Public Enterprises==
The Department of Public Enterprises acts as a nodal agency for all [http://www.archive.india.gov.in/spotlight/spotlight_archive.php?id=78 Public Sector Enterprises] and assists in policy formulation pertaining to the role of PSEs in the economy as also in laying down policy guidelines on performance improvement and evaluation, financial accounting, personnel management and in related areas. It also collects, evaluates, and maintains information on several areas in respect of PSEs. The Department has Five constituent Divisions, viz; the Financial Policy Division, the Management Policy Division, the MOU Division, the Administration &amp; Coordination Division and Permanent Machinery of Arbitration.

===Role of DPE in issuing guidelines / directives to CPSEs===
The role of DPE in issuing guidelines/directives is clearly defined in Report no.-2 of 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_compliance/2013/Commercial/Report_2/Chap_5.pdf Report no.-2 of 2013]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140828084950/http://www.saiindia.gov.in/english/index.html Comptroller and Auditor General of India]&lt;/ref&gt; on Compliance Audit of General Purpose Financial Reports of central public sector enterprises.

The directions/instructions are given to CPSEs through presidential directives as well as guidelines issued by administrative ministries or DPE.

Presidential directives are issued by the administrative ministries to the concerned CPSEs whenever the situation so warrant and are mandatory in nature. For the purpose of maintaining uniformity, such Directives are to be issued in consultation with the DPE if these relate to single CPSE and with the concurrence of the DPE if these are applicable to more than one CPSE.

Guidelines&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141008223741/http://dpe.nic.in/important_links/dpe_guidelines Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; could be issued either by the Administrative Ministries or the DPE as the case may be and are advisory in nature. The Board of Directors of the CPSEs has the discretion not to adopt these guidelines for reasons to be recorded in writing. The Board Resolution on the subject giving the reasons therein is to be forwarded both to the Administrative Ministry concerned as well as to the DPE.

In the above-mentioned report no-2 of 2013 it is also mentioned that though the DPE guidelines are advisory, for good corporate governance, there should be an appropriate mechanism to enforce accountability of the Administrative Ministries and CPSEs to the compliance to DPE guidelines.
An Audit review of the institutional arrangement DPE has in place to ensure compliance with its guidelines revealed that:

*DPE did not maintain the database as to which CPSE's boards adopted its guidelines.
*DPE did not have a mechanism to ensure compliance with all its guidelines.
*DPE did not write to CPSEs for recovery of irregular payments pointed out by an audit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">In the [[United Kingdom]] [[tax]] system, and more specifically for [[United Kingdom corporation tax|UK corporation tax]] purposes, '''PCTCT''' stands for "profits chargeable to corporation tax," a UK term for [[taxable profit]]s.

Since the enactment of 2010's [[Corporation Tax Act 2010|Corporation Tax Act]] (CTA 2010) in March 2010, the profits of a company of an accounting period on which corporation tax is chargeable has been defined as the company's "taxable total profits" of the period ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/4/section/4 section 4(2) CTA 2010]), which is frequently abbreviated to TTP.

A company's taxable total profits are derived from a company's [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] as shown in the [[profit and loss account]] in its [[financial statements|accounts]], with the addition of any disallowed expenditure, and the deduction of any expenditure that is allowed for tax purposes but that has not been deducted in the profit and loss account.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6663">The '''peroxide process''' is a method for the industrial production of [[hydrazine]].

In this process [[hydrogen peroxide]] is used as an [[oxidant]] instead of [[sodium hypochlorite]], which is traditionally used to generate hydrazine. The main advantage of the peroxide process to hydrazine relative to the traditional [[Olin Raschig process|Raschig process]] is that it '''does not coproduce salt'''. In this respect, the peroxide process is an example of [[green chemistry]]. Since many millions of kilograms of hydrazine are produced annually, this method is of both commercial and environmental significance.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;Jean-Pierre Schirmann, Paul Bourdauducq "Hydrazine" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Production==
===Ketazine formation===
In the usual implementation, hydrogen peroxide is used together with [[acetamide]]. This mixture does not react with [[ammonia]] directly but does so in the presence of [[methyl ethyl ketone]] to give the [[oxaziridine]].
:[[File:Pechiney-Ugine-Kuhlmann process.png|506px]]

Balanced equations for the individual steps are as follows. Imine formation through condensation:
:Me(Et)C=O + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Me(Et)C=NH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Oxidation of the imine to the oxaziridine:
:Me(Et)C=NH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Me(Et)CONH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Condensation of the oxaziridine with a second molecule of ammonia to give the hydrazone:
:Me(Et)CONH + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Me(Et)C=NNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The hydrazone then condenses with a second equivalent of ketone to give the [[ketazine]]:
:Me(Et)C=O + Me(Et)C=NNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Me(Et)C=NN=C(Et)Me + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Typical process conditions are 50&amp;nbsp;°C and atmospheric pressure, with a feed mix of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:ketone:NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in a molar ratio of about 1:2:4.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt; Methyl ethyl ketone is advantageous to acetone because the resulting ketazine is [[immiscible]] in the reaction mixture and can be separated by decantation.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt; A similar process based on [[benzophenone]] has also been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Hydrazine Production from Ammonia via Azine |first1 = Hiromu |last1 = Hayashi |first2 = Akihiko |last2 = Kainoh |first3 = Masayoshi |last3 = Katayama |first4 = Kengo |last4 = Kawasaki |first5 = Tatsuya |last5 = Okazaki |journal = Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Dev. |year = 1976 |volume = 15 |issue = 4 |pages = 299–303 |doi = 10.1021/i360060a016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ketazine to hydrazine===
The final stage involves hydrolysis of the purified ketazine:
:Me(Et)C=NN=C(Et)Me + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Me(Et)C=O + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

The [[hydrolysis]] of the azine is [[Acid catalysis|acid-catalyzed]], hence the need to isolate the azine from the initial ammonia-containing reaction mixture. It is also [[endothermic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first = E. C. |last = Gilbert |title = Studies on Hydrazine. The Hydrolysis of Dimethylketazine and the Equilibrium between Hydrazine and Acetone |journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. |year = 1929 |volume = 51 |issue = 11 |pages = 3394–3409 |doi = 10.1021/ja01386a032}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and so requires an increase in temperature (and pressure) to shift the equilibrium in favour of the desired products: ketone (which is recycled) and hydrazine hydrate.&lt;ref name="Atochem"/&gt; The reaction is carried out by simple [[distillation]] of the azeotrope: typical conditions are a pressure of 8&amp;nbsp;bar and temperatures of 130&amp;nbsp;°C at the top of the column and 179&amp;nbsp;°C at the bottom of the column. The hydrazine hydrate (30–45% aqueous solution) is run off from the base of the column, while the methyl ethyl ketone is distilled off from the top of the column and recycled.&lt;ref name="Atochem"/&gt;

The peroxide process, also called the '''Pechiney–Ugine–Kuhlmann process''', was developed in the early 1970s by [[Arkema|Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann]].&lt;ref name="PCUK"&gt;{{citation |inventor1-first = Jean-Pierre |inventor1-last = Schirmann |inventor2-first = Jean |inventor2-last = Combroux |inventor3-first = Serge Yvon |inventor3-last = Delavarenne |assignee = Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann |country-code = US |patent-number = 3972878 |title = Method for preparing azines and hydrazones |issue-date = 1976-08-03}}. {{citation |inventor1-first = Jean-Pierre |inventor1-last = Schirmann |inventor2-first = Pierre |inventor2-last = Tellier |inventor3-first = Henri |inventor3-last = Mathais |inventor4-first = Francis |inventor4-last = Weiss |assignee = Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann |country-code = US |patent-number = 3978049 |title = Process for the preparation of hydrazine compounds |issue-date = 1976-08-31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atochem"&gt;{{citation |inventor1-first = Jean-Pierre |inventor1-last = Schirmann |inventor2-first = Jean |inventor2-last = Combroux |inventor3-first = Serge Y. |inventor3-last = Delavarenne |assignee = Atochem |country-code = US |patent-number = 4724133 |title = Preparation of a concentrated aqueous solution of hydrazine hydrate |issue-date = 1988-02-09}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the process used acetone instead of methyl ethyl ketone.&lt;ref name="PCUK"/&gt; Methyl ethyl ketone is advantageous because the resulting [[ketazine]] is immiscible in the reaction mixture and can be separated by decantation.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"&gt;{{citation |title = Synthetic nitrogen products: a practical guide to the products and processes |first = Gary R. |last = Maxwell |pages = 342–44 |publisher = Springer |year = 2004 |isbn = 0-306-48225-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cotton&amp;Wilkinson5th|pages=317–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The world's largest [[hydrazine hydrate]] plant is in [[Lannemezan]] in France, producing 17,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes of hydrazine products per year.&lt;ref name="brochure"&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.arkema.com/pdf/FR/corporate/SITE_LANNEMEZAN.pdf |title = Site industriel de Lannemezan |publisher = Arkema |accessdate = 2010-07-02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bayer ketazine process===
Before invention of the peroxide process, the Bayer ketazine process had been commercialized. In the Bayer process, the oxidation of ammonia by sodium hypochlorite is conducted in the presence of acetone. The process generates the ketazine but also sodium chloride:&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;
:2 Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + NaOCl → Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NN=CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NaCl
:Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NN=CMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO

He pioneered modern thinking about the economic importance of free [[competition]] and was an uncompromising advocate of [[the republican form of government]].

[[File:Pieter de la Court jr.jpg|thumb|350px|Pieter de la Court.]]

==Biography==

Pieter de la Court was born in [[Leiden]], the son of Pieter de la Court the Elder and Jeanne des Planques. His parents were [[protestant]] immigrants from [[Flanders]], who settled in Leiden around 1613 in order to be able to practise their faith and to profit from the rapid expansion of Leiden as the world centre of cloth manufacturing. Pieter de la Court the Elder was a successful cloth merchant before he arrived in Leiden. His wife also came from a family of wealthy cloth manufacturers. They had established themselves as members of the local economic elite by the time Pieter was born. The couple had three other children; Jacob (born 1617), Johanna (born 1620) and Johan (1622–1660). Johan is generally seen as the author of at least two of the books that have later been ascribed to Pieter.

De la Court studied at [[Leiden University]] and completed his education with a [[Grand Tour]] through Europe in 1641 - 1643. He went to [[London]], [[Saumur]] (France), [[Geneva]] and [[Basle]]. The diary he kept during his journey has been preserved and was published in 1928. After returning to Leiden, De la Court entered his father's profession and set up a cloth trading firm with his brother Johan. By 1650 the firm of the two brothers had evolved into one of the leading cloth operations in.

In spite of his immigrant background De la Court was able to penetrate the social elite of [[Holland]]. He became a close friend of Johan Eleman, who was a member of Leiden's governing council and a relative of [[Johan de Witt|John de Witt]], the de facto leader of the [[Dutch Republic]] between 1653 and 1672. In 1657 De la Court married Eleman's sister in law, Elisabeth Tollenaer, who died only one year later in childbirth. In 1660 death struck again, this time taking De la Court's younger brother and business partner Johan. Pieter was remarried in 1661, this time to Catharina van der Voort, the sister of two wealthy Amsterdam merchants and, again, a relative of John de Witt.

It was in this turbulent period of De la Court's life that he published almost all of his books about the [[political economy]] of [[Holland]] and the larger [[Dutch Republic]]. In the preface to the ''Interest van Holland'', the most renowned of these books, he explicitly ascribed this publishing frenzy to the need to distract his mind from the tragedy that had hit him. The centerpiece of this body of work was the ''Interest of Holland'', published in 1662. It contained a critical analysis of the economic success of the Dutch Republic and demonstrated how this success had been brought about by the combined effects of free competition and free (i.e. republican) government. It became a bestseller overnight. In Holland the ''Interest van Holland'' gained notoriety and infamy as a republican manifesto. Abroad the ''Interest'' was widely translated and read as an explanatory guide to the miraculous economic success of the Dutch.

De la Court's second wife Catharina van der Voort gave him two children, Magdalena (1661) and Pieter (1664), later named Pieter de la Court van der Voort. In 1665 the family moved from Leiden to [[Amsterdam]], by then the undisputed centre of world trade. There De la Court expanded the scope of his business activities by participating in the ventures of his two brothers in law.

De la Court became the leader of a consortium of Amsterdam merchants who sought to break the monopoly of the [[Dutch East India Company]] on all trade with the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The group filed petitions which claimed that the monopoly was limited to the trade route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In 1668 they actually sent an exploratory vessel to the Arctic to find a shipping route around Siberia. The endeavour failed but shows De la Court was an advocate of free trade in theory and practice.

De la Court's publishing activity had made him a well known protagonist of the republican "party" in contemporary Dutch politics. This group, consisting primarily of the wealthy businessmen in the cities of Holland and led by John de Witt, effectively ran the Dutch Republic from 1650 until 1672. They strongly opposed the political powers and ambitions of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] which usually held the office of [[Stadholder]], a pseudo-royal position that somehow survived in the otherwise republican institutions of the [[Dutch Republic]], except during this [[First Stadtholderless Period]]. De la Court was probably never close to John de Witt, but it has been established that De Witt was actively involved in the writing of De la Court's most outspoken and most widely read text, the ''Interest van Holland''.

When the Orangist faction regained control of the country in 1672, John de Witt was lynched by an [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangist]] mob and Pieter de la Court fled to Antwerp where he stayed with his brother in law Guglielmo van der Voort. He returned to Amsterdam in 1673 where he lived as a merchant until his death in 1685. The last book that was published by De la Court appeared in 1669. A final work, the ''Sinryke Fabulen'', was published posthumously in 1685.

==Works==
De la Court's works were published anonymously, but contemporaries immediately identified Pieter de la Court as the author of most of them. It is now generally believed that some of these books were actually written by his brother, Johan, and that at least one other title was the work of his business friend Johan Uytenhage de Mist. It has been established as a fact that John de Witt and a number of other government officials contributed to the ''Interest van Holland''. De la Court's ''oeuvre'' can be divided into three groups of titles.

===Political Economy===
The ''Interest van Holland'' was published in 1662 and immediately became a bestseller in Holland and later also elsewhere. The book contained an analysis of the miraculous economic success of Holland, the leading province of the Dutch Republic, and then set out to establish the economic and political principles on which that success was based. De la Court identified free competition and the republican form of government as the leading factors contributing to the wealth and power of his home country. The book was written in an outspoken and polemic style and went through eight editions in 1662. A revised luxury edition appeared in 1669. It was translated into German in 1665, English in 1702 and French in 1709. A new English translation appeared as late as 1746.

===Political Theory===
In 1660 De la Court published the ''Consideratien van Staet'' (Considerations of State), followed in 1662 by the ''Politike Discoursen''. Both titles seek to establish a theoretical basis for the superiority of the republican form of government. Although the texts share the ''Interest'''s republican penchant, they have an altogether different nature. The tone is subdued and the style philosophical
with extensive references to other political theorists. Both texts are now thought to have been written by De la Court's brother Johan.

===Political Pamphlets===
The third and most extensive part of De la Court's work is the series of republican and anti-monarchist pamphlets he published in 1662 and 1663. The most well-known are the ''Historie der gravelike regering in Holland'' (History of the counts of Holland) and ''De stadthouderlijcke regeeringe in Hollandt ende West-Vrieslandt'' (History of the stadholders of Holland and West-Friesland). Both books contain vivid albeit rather one-sided descriptions of the damage that had been done to the country by monarchical leaders since the Middle Ages.

==Influence==
The ''Interest van Holland'' is one of the preeminent textbooks of economic and political freedom in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The book was an immediate bestseller in the Dutch Republic and went through eleven editions between 1662 and 1671. The Dutch version was read in political circles throughout Europe and translations appeared in German (1665 and 1671), French (1709) and English (1702, 1743 and 1746). The book had a significant influence on political and economic thinking but its primary importance lay in the impact it had on office holders and political reality. The ''Interest van Holland'' was not a philosophical disquisition, but a recipe book for political and economic success.

===Dutch Republic 1662 - 1795===
Within the Dutch Republic the ''Interest van Holland'' became the ''de facto'' government manifesto of the republican oligarchy led by John de Witt until 1672. The ''Interest van Holland'' viciously attacked the pseudo-royal stadtholders. De Witt abolished the office in 1669. The ''Interest'' was wary of war and geographical expansion. The States of Holland neglected the army and sought to evade conflicts with their bigger neighbours. Instead the money was spent on a naval buildup, another ''Interest'' recommendation. At sea the military would not primarily be a cost, but a useful tool in protecting and promoting the commercial interests of the Republic and its rulers. Finally the ''Interest'' was vehemently opposed to monopoly, most notably the Dutch East and West India Companies and the guilds, the closed associations of craftsmen that controlled most manufacturing activity. The two trading companies, huge sovereign entities way beyond the control of the provincial and city governments of Holland, were immune to these attacks and survived all the way to the end of the Dutch Republic. But De la Court did play a role in the demise of the [[guilds]] that were increasingly seen as obstacles to economic innovation and growth. The regime of De Witt ended in 1672. The ''Interest van Holland'' remained a leading source of republican inspiration until the dissolution of the [[Republiek der Zeven Verenigde Nederlanden]] in 1795.

===Europe and United States 1662 - 1789===
The ''Interest van Holland'' was widely read in Europe for a number of reasons. When the book appeared it stirred the curiosity of political rulers throughout the continent because it was seen as a look into the backrooms of the Dutch political and economic machinery. Later the text was espoused by supporters of free trade and republicanism throughout Europe, for whom it remained a source of inspiration until the end of the eighteenth century. It is hard to overestimate the profound influence of the ''Interest van Holland'' on the European and American political elites of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as can be seen from numerous examples. The book was read and used by politicians as diverse as [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[James Madison]] and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]]. It was quoted and discussed by free trade pamphleteers in Britain and [[Physiocrats]] in France. It can be assumed that the book was also one of the sources of inspiration also for [[Adam Smith]]'s ''Wealth of Nations''.

==Literature==
The text of the last English edition of the ''Interest'' can be downloaded from the website of the [[Liberty Fund]]: [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=85&amp;Itemid=99999999  Pieter de la Court, ''The True Interest and Political Maxims, of the Republic of Holland (1662)''].
The leading source on De la Court's life and works is Ivo W. Wildenberg, ''Johan &amp; Pieter de la Court'' (Amsterdam &amp; Maarssen, 1986).

'''Quota Elimination''' is an initiative to eliminate the use of [[Import quota|quotas]] in all [[textile]] and [[clothing]] trade between nations which are members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). Doing so was one of the key commitments undertaken at the  WTO [[Uruguay Round]] in 1994 to retire the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]]. The ATC, that is the WTO [[Multi Fibre Arrangement|Agreement on Textile and Clothing]], is the regulation governing textile and clothing and implements this commitment. 

The agreement established a ten-year period which would eliminate the use of quotas in all textile and clothing trade between WTO nations.  It expired on December 31, 2004. As of January 1, 2005, the garment and fabric trade worldwide is operating without quotas.  To ensure the respect of [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] textile agreements, goods shipped prior to January 1, 2005 and subject to the 2004 quotas will be subject to the import regime of 2004 even if they are presented to [[customs]] before January 1.  

To avoid excessive burdens on trade and customs, as of April 1, 2005, all garments and fabrics will trade freely into the [[European Union]] (EU). Although the quotas have been eliminated, the regulation also sets up a [[Statistics|statistical]] monitoring system for the imports of textiles and clothing into the EU. This system is to provide information regarding the chance of [[Disruptive technology|market disruptions]] and will allow for the governing body to closely follow the trade in this new environment. This regulation is beneficial for [[Canada|Canadian]] clothing and fabric manufacturers because now there are fewer restrictions. It is hoped by some{{Who|date=April 2017}} that this ruling will open up the [[Europe]]an market in the near future.{{When|date=April 2017}} Benefits of the abolition of quotas are also expected to textile companies in India and Pakistan.

A '''registered office''' is the official address of an [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] [[company (law)|company]], association or any other [[Juristic person|legal entity]]. Generally it will form part of the public record and is required in most countries where the registered [[organization]] or legal entity is incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Arthur. ''The European Film Production Guide: Finance, Tax, Legislation''. [[Routledge]], 1996. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_14gq_KsRwMC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Registered+office%22+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1tAuTPSHDcWqlAfJwIyTCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Registered%20office%22%20definition&amp;f=false 21]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on 3 July 2010. {{ISBN|0-415-13665-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-13665-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A registered physical office address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and formal notices from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adirondack|first1=Sandy|last2=Taylor|first2=James Sinclair|title=Voluntary sector legal handbook|date=2008|publisher=Directory of Social Change|location=London|isbn=9781903991879|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209}}

==In the United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] and many other [[List of country legal systems#Common law|common law countries]], the registered office address does not have to be where the organization conducts its actual business or trade, and it is not unusual for [[law firms]], [[accountant]]s or incorporation agents to provide the official registered office address service. In the United Kingdom all statutory correspondence for an incorporated organization (e.g. formal notices, [[service of process]], tax and government communications) is posted or hand delivered to the registered office address as recorded on the [[Companies House]] register. A registered physical office address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and formal notices from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"/&gt;{{rp|209}}

Under regulations implemented in the UK on 1 October 2009, company directors may now also use a registered office address instead of their private home address for contact on the Companies House register.

The company's full registered name must be visible to the public on the premises. The Company's records previously had to be kept at the registered office and available for public inspection. Since 1 October 2009 it has been possible for companies to designate a single alternative inspection location (SAIL) as a place to keep their records which must be available for public inspection.&lt;ref name="A&amp;T"/&gt;{{rp|210}}

==Other countries==
In many other countries the address with which a company is registered must be where its headquarters or [[Seat (legal entity)|seat]] is located, and this will often determine the subnational registry at which the company must be registered.

'''Rodin Alper Bingöl''' (May 22, 1984), is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[creative director]], [[entrepreneur]] and business leader known with his works in [[advertisement]], [[design]], digital campaigns and [[social responsibility]].

==Biography==
Bingöl was born in Istanbul in 1984. He had his first digital experiences in 1996 while he was building amateur web sites and web platforms which were the pioneers of the internet industry in Turkey. During his years in high school, becoming interested in acting, he took acting classes at the Stage of Kadıköy Public Training Center for two years.

In 2002, he graduated from the mechanical department of the Haydarpaşa Anatolian Technical High School.  He worked as a designer and instructor at the Bilge Adam Computer Education Center in his last year at high school. Excelling at his business life by becoming an art director, he decided to leave the Center in 2003.&lt;ref name="RAB - Röportaj" /&gt;

He continued his education at the Faculty of Visual Communication Design at the [[İstanbul Bilgi University]]. In his first year, he established Colors of Bilgi, one of the most active and efficient student clubs of the [[İstanbul Bilgi University]]. As the general coordinator and the art director of the magazine published by the Club, he organized photo shoots and interviews with public figures such as [[Cem Yılmaz]], [[Serdar Erener]], [[Metin Arolat]] ve [[Ali Nesin]] and got the chance to use his passion for photography. As the first student from the Faculty of Communication who participated in the elections, he was the leader and the creative director of the advertising campaigns of the team “Bilgistanbul” in the 2007 Student Union Elections.&lt;ref name="RAB - Röportaj"&gt;{{cite web|title = Sen Sor Rodin Alper Bingöl Yanıtlasın |url= http://www.onedergi.com/2010/04/sen-sor-rodin-alper-bingol-yanitlasin/|website=Onedergi.com|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2004 and 2006 he cofounded Colors of USA, the first online [[Work and Travel]] firm in Turkey. He traveled to many countries, including United States of America, England and Mexico for business and marketing purposes.&lt;ref name="RAB - Röportaj" /&gt;

Besides his education, he took part in many different projects as the art and project director. He worked with artists such as [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]], [[Cem Yılmaz]], [[Çağan Irmak]] and [[Zeki Demirkubuz]]; he designed and executed web sites, movie posters and advertising campaigns by creating unique concepts. He contributed to the projects of some of the biggest companies including Swiss Hotel, Bilge Adam, Aviva, [[TÜPRAŞ]] and [[Ülker]]. The official movie posters for [[Çağan Irmak]]’s [[Issız Adam]], [[Zeki Demirkubuz]]’s [[Envy (2009 film) Envy]] and [[Tuna Kiremitçi]]’s [[Adını Sen Koy]] were some of the creative works done by Bingöl in this period of time.&lt;ref name="RAB - IMDb"&gt;{{cite web|title = Rodin Alper Bingöl's IMDb Title |url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3648099/|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was still a student, he gave lectures at the Marmara University in the 2008-2009 academic year, focusing on Digital Marketing and Media Technologies. Described as a “Young Talent” by various media organizations, Bingöl gave interviews to widely read magazines such as Trensetter, Marketing Türkiye, Boxer and Cosmogirl.&lt;ref name="EKH Sabancı Vakfı"&gt;{{cite web|title = Engelleri Kaldır Hareketiyle Fark Yaratan Rodin Alper Bingöl |url= http://www.sabancivakfi.org/haber/engelleri-kaldir-hareketiyle-fark-yaratan-rodin-alper-bingol|website=Sabancivakfi.org|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from the [[İstanbul Bilgi University]] in 2009 by setting up and executing a social responsibility project, [[Removing Barriers Movement]] as his  thesis. The project gathered a lot of public attention. Celebrities including [[Ahmet Mümtaz Taylan]], [[Ali Poyrazoğlu]], [[Ali Sunal]], Aslıgül Atasagun, [[Ayçin İnci]], [[Ayşenur Yazıcı]], [[Barış Falay]], [[Bengü]], [[Bora Cengiz]], [[Burcu Kara]], [[Bülent Şakrak]], [[Doğa Rutkay]], [[Ebru Akel]], [[Emre Altuğ]], [[Erdem Yener]], [[Hayko Cepkin]], [[Lale Mansur]], [[Mert Fırat]], [[Mustafa Üstündağ]], [[Müşfik Kenter]], Özge Uzun, Pit10, [[Saba Tümer]], [[Taner Birsel]], [[Tülin Özen]], [[Yetkin Dikinciler]] acted voluntarily in the promotional clips of the Project.&lt;ref name="EKH - 1 Nisan"&gt;{{cite web|title = EKH – 1 Nisan Farkındalık Kampanyası |url= http://www.engellerikaldir.com/projeler/kampanyalar/1-nisan-farkindalik-kampanyasi|website=Engellerikaldir.com|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EKH - Şaka"&gt;{{cite web|title = Turkey's Changemakers: Rodin Alper Bingol campaigns to help people with disabilities participate in social life |url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=turkeys-changemakers-rodin-alper-bingol-campaigns-to-help-people-with-disabilities-participate-2010-03-15|website=Hurriyetdailynews.com|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his prior achievements, he was awarded first place by JCI Turkey at the “Turkey’s The Most Successful Young Persons of the Year Contest”.&lt;ref name="RAB - JCI"&gt;{{cite web|title = Web World Gets 4 Awards from Turkey’s The Most Successful Young Persons of the Year Contest |url= http://en.webrazzi.com/2009/10/20/in-turkey%E2%80%99s-must-successful-10-young-persons-contest-web-world-gets-4-awards/|website=En.webrazzi.com|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RAB - Empati Ödülü"&gt;{{cite web|title = 2010 Yılı Empati Ödülü Sahibini Buldu |url= http://www.aktuelegitim.com/2010-yili-empati-odulu-sahibini-buldu.html|website=Aktuelegitim.com|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fark Yaratanlar]], [[CNN Türk]]’s TV show which is hosted by [[Cüneyt Özdemir]], defined Bingöl as “a real hero”.&lt;ref name="RAB - Sabancı Vakfı"&gt;{{cite web|title = Turkey's Changemakers - Rodin Alper Bingol |url= http://www.sabancivakfi.org/media/rodin-alper-bingol-sezon-01-bolum-22-2|website=Sabancivakfi.org|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, with the help of his former business experiences, he founded [[Elmalma Brand Communication]]. As the creative director and the manager of the Agency, he developed many projects contributing to the progress of the digital opportunities and efficient use of the social media both in Turkey and the World.

'''SREDIM''' is a method of [[task analysis]], which stands for: words select, record, examine, develop, install/implement and maintain. This methods analysis system can be used to analyse any process to determine parts of the process which are inefficient, or can be improved.

==Select==
Choose the parts of the process to study, identifying [[bottleneck (production)|bottleneck]]s, and data to collect etc.
The "bottleneck" is not necessarily just a pinch point in the work flow typically found in [[production process]]es. It can also be identified as any task or part of the process that falls below the anticipated or predetermined standard.

Therefore we must also consider, poor quality, imbalance in work content between processes (typical on [[textile]] [[production line]]s), lack of [[raw material]] supply, machine malfunction, lack of meaningful [[standard operating procedure]]s or adequate training.

We need to consider all of the above in the "selection" process, i.e. something that is affecting the normal function of the system or task under review.

==Record==
This part of the process is based around taking details of the different parts of the process which is to be studied, as defined in part 1.

==Examine==
Analyse the data that you have collected and apply another [[acronym]] to it, PPSPM:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Purpose || What and why is each thing being done?
|-
| Place || Why is this process being done there, could it be done elsewhere?
|-
| Sequence || When is this process being done, and why then?
|-
| Person || Who does this process?  What training do they require, could someone else do it more [[Efficiency|efficiently]]?
|-
| Means || How is it done, and could the process itself be done more efficiently?
|}

==Develop==
When you have identified the problems and issues, this is the stage to create a new method or process based on data collected.

==Install or Implement==
The new method which has been put together must be costed and installed for it to work

==Maintain==
While it takes a lot of effort to create a new method, for it to continue working, processes must be put in place to ensure that the system continues working.

'''Safika Holdings (PTY)''' Limited [http://www.safika.co.za/ www.safika.co.za] is a [[South Africa]]n investment [[holding company]] headed by [[Nelson Mandela]]'s fellow political prisoners Sakumzi 'Saki' Macozoma and Moss Ngoasheng.  The company was founded in 1995.
 
In 2003, when the South African government decreed that major businesses must ensure a certain percentage of their shareholding be held by black people&lt;ref name="Act No 53 of 2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act|publisher=South African Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safika became the preferred Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) partner for a number of prominent South African companies. Their head office is in Johannesburg.

Safika has interests in financial services, mining, transport, manufacturing, human resources, media, gaming and technology. The company has close ties with the Standard Bank Group, Africa's largest banking group by assets and earnings and with Liberty Holdings, a leading South African-based assurance conglomerate that has operations in 15 African countries. In 2004 Standard and Liberty took shares in Safika which in turn acquired stakes in Standard and Liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liberty.investoreports.com/liberty_iar_2011/financial-reports/group-financial-statements-and-notes/notes-to-the-group-financial-statements/notes-to-the-group-financial-statements-note-41/] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Standard increased its shareholding in Safika to 20 per cent.

On October 1, 2005, Safika bought a stake in Oosthuizens Transport, a major short-haul trucking company based in Mpumulanga that is heavily involved in the transport of coal to power stations. It subsequently acquired an effective 75 per cent stake after which the company was renamed Safika Oosthuizens Transport.

Safika holds a significant interest in Spartan Truck Hire, a South African national truck and crane rental company based in Kempton Park near Johannesburg. It is active in the packaged cement market through Castle Cement Holdings.

In 2010 Safika expanded its operations to Australia taking a stake in the Wingate Group, a privately held investment company.

Safika is the controlling shareholder in Ntsimbintle Mining (PTY) Ltd. which, through its subsidiary Tshipi Manganese Mining (PTY) Limited, is creating a multi-billion rand manganese mine called Tshipi Borwa in South Africa's Northern Cape. Production started in late 2012.

==Key personnel==
Sakumzi 'Saki' Macozoma and Moss Ngoasheng, leading South African businessmen, are Safika's controlling shareholders. 

===Sakumi 'Saki' Macozoma [[Saki Macozoma]]===
Safika's non-executive chairman, is one of the best known business people in South Africa. He is chairman of financial institutions STANLIB and Liberty Life, deputy chairman of the Standard Bank of South Africa and a director of the Liberty Group and Volkswagen SA.

He is the chairman of the Kwazulu–Natal Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2008 he was appointed deputy chairman of Standard Bank.

Macozoma served five years as a political prisoner on Robben Island alongside [[Nelson Mandela]] and later became a prominent figure in the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) serving as a member of parliament and as a member of the ANC's executive committee. In 2009 Macozoma left the ANC saying the ruling party could no longer carry the hopes of the South African people &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2009-03-01-phumzile-macozoma-throw-lot-in-with-cope|title=Phumzile, Macozoma defect to Cope|work=The M&amp;G Online|access-date=2017-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a short time joined the opposition political grouping, [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|Congress of the People]] (COPE). He is now politically unaffiliated.

===Moss Ngoasheng===
Moss Ngoasheng served eight years as a political prisoner alongside Nelson Mandela. After his release in 1985 he obtained a scholarship to study at the University of Sussex in England and then returned to South Africa to teach at the University of Natal. 

From 1995 to 2000 he served as economic advisor in the South African Presidency. For a number of years he also served on the African National Congress's (ANC's) economic policy unit. He consulted to the World Bank and National Housing Forum (South Africa) on aspects of economic policy in South Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60933">{{About|salience in the field of semiotics and communication||Salience (disambiguation)}}

'''Salience''' is the state or condition of being prominent. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines salience as "most noticeable or important." The concept is discussed in [[communication]], [[semiotics]], [[linguistics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[political science]]. It has been studied with respect to [[interpersonal communication]], [[persuasion]], [[politics]], and its influence on [[mass media]].

==Semiotics==

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]] (the study of signs or symbolism), ''salience'' refers to the relative importance or prominence of a part of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]. The salience of a particular sign when considered in the context of others helps an individual to quickly rank large amounts of information by importance and thus give attention to that which is the most important. This process keeps an individual from being overwhelmed with [[information overload]].

===Discussion===

Meaning can be described as the "system of mental representations of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] or [[phenomenon]], its properties and associations with other objects and/or phenomena. In the [[consciousness]] of an individual, meaning is reflected in the form of sensory information, [[image]]s and [[concept]]s."&lt;ref name="Bedny" /&gt; It is [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] or [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]], but the sign system for transmitting meanings can be uncertain in its operation or conditions may disrupt the communication and prevent accurate meanings from being decoded.

Further, meaning is socially constructed and dynamic as the [[culture]] evolves. That is problematic because an individual's frame of reference and experience may produce some divergence from some of the prevailing social [[norm (sociology)|norms]]. So the salience of data will be determined by both situational and emotional elements in a combination relatively unique to each individual. For example, a person with an interest in [[botany]] may allocate greater salience to visual data involving plants, and a person trained as an [[architect]] may scan buildings to identify features of interest. A person's [[world view]] or ''Weltanschauung'' may predispose salience to data matching those views. Because people live for many years, responses become [[convention (philosophy and social sciences)|conventional]]. At a group or community level, the conventional levels of significance or salience are slowly embedded in the sign systems and culture, and they cannot arbitrarily be changed.
For example, the first thing seen in a poster may be the title or picture of a face.

==Communication studies==
The noun “salience” derives from the Latin word ''saliens -'' ‘leaping, or bounding’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, Vol. XIV|last=|first=|publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford.|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Latin Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a human embryo, the heart tissue is beating and leaping.  A Native American may pay no attention to Columbus Day protests until after instruction in tribal and historical Indian traditions (priming).  After gaining new cultural insights, these protests may become “salient.”

Salience, as a component of Communication and Social Psychology studies, asks the question of why something captures and holds our attention and why it is more readily available as a cognition than other facts, feelings, and emotions?  When a person perceives and reacts, they use the information and emotions most readily accessible.  This information is understood to be the most salient information. 
 
Social Influence is an area of intense study for Social Psychologists and Communication theorists.  Social Influence asks how and why, are people influenced to weaken a strongly held position, adopt a new position, change an attitude, or persuade someone?  The extent that the communicator can understand and harness the power of Social Influence is the extent that they can succeed in their goal.

Salience has been identified as one of the key ideas that guides our understanding of how to make a point of view stand out from among others and draw the receivers attention to the salient points of the encoded message.  Salience is then an important concept in several theories relating to Social Influence. Some areas of Communication and Social Psychology research that include the concept of salience as a component of their theory are: Persuasion Theory, Vested Interest, Summation Theory of Attitude Change, Group Salience, and Social Presence Theory.  The use of salience in these theories is summarized below:

'''Persuasion theory:''' Salience is the critical concept, along with agenda and spin, for the Persuasion theory of Professor Richard E. Vatz of Towson University as articulated in his book, /The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion/, (Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013).  Salience, in his book and articles, is used as a measure of how reality is created for chosen audiences.  He claims (1973) (2013) that the struggle for salience (and agenda and meaning and spin) is the sine qua non of the persuasive process.&lt;ref name="Vatz" /&gt;

'''[[Vested interest (communication theory)]]''':  William Crano's states that, “Vested Interest refers to the extent to which an attitude object is hedonically relevant for the attitude holder” (Crano, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;131).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Article In:  Attitude strength: Antecedents and Consequences|last=Crano|first=William|publisher=Erlbaum|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=131–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for someone to have a vested interest in something, it must be perceived to affect their lives personally.  Things that in which we are highly vested also bear on our behavior (Crano, 1995), and it must be salient or leap out.  Vivid cues are more likely to grab our attention (McArthur &amp; Post, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McArthur|first=Leslie|last2=Post|first2=David|date=1976|title=Figural emphasis and person perception|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=13|pages=520–536|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If an attitude object is salient to us, our vested interest will be increased as well as the likelihood that our behavior and attitudes will be consistent (Sears &amp; Citrin, 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tax revolt: Something for nothing in California|last=Sears|first=David|last2=Citrin|first2=Jack|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crano states, “Apparently, making an attitude object more salient enhances the salience of attitude-relevant outcomes as well. Vividness, priming, and similar operations may all enhance the salience of the self-interest implications of a position.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Crano, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;131). The stronger the salience of our attitude, the stronger will be the connection between our attitude object and our behavior.

'''Attitude Summation Theory''':  Fishbein posited that we have many beliefs about an attitude object (characteristics, attributes, values, and etc.).  Each belief held is argued to have an affective (feeling) and evaluative (value determining) component.  An attitude is then a mediated evaluative response (Fishbein, 1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fishbein|first=Martin|date=1963|title=An Investigation of the Relationships between Beliefs about an Object and the Attitude toward that Object|url=|journal=Human Relations|volume=16|issue=3|pages=233–239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These attitudes sum together to form our overall view of the attitude object and comes to the forefront (made salient) when we engage the attitude object.

Fishbein indicates that we can hold six to nine salient beliefs at a time (Cronen, 1973).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cronen |first1=V. E. |title=Belief, Salience, Media Exposure and Summation Theory |journal=The Journal of  Communication |date=1973 |volume=23 |pages=86–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those manifested during the attitude object encounter determine the prevailing attitude. Fishbein believed that the strongest held beliefs would be the most salient and come to the fore.  Cronen argued that salience is not intrinsically tied to strength, but is an independent attribute of attitude change, as some strongly held beliefs are non-salient (Cronen, 1973).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Group Salience''':  Group salience is a person's cognizance of fellow group members similarities and differences within a group interaction (Harwood et al., 2006).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harwood |first1=J. |last2=Hewstone |first2=M. |title=The Family and Communication Dynamics of  Group Salience |journal=The Journal of Family Communication |date=2006 |volume=6 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a group, communication is the primary way that we determine salience of attitudes. Other things such as physical attributes can be observed, but deeper feelings will have to be communicated within the group to make them salient (Harwood et al., 2006).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Coupland et al., suggest that communication processes represent an individual's identity within the group (Coupland et al., 1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coupland |first1=J. |last2=Coupland |first2=N. |last3=Giles |first3=H. |last4=Henwood |first4=K. |title=Formulating age: Dimensions of  age identity in elderly talk |journal=Discourse Processes |date=1991 |volume=14 |issue=14 |pages=87–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Social presence theory]] (SPT)''': SPT can be defined as, “The degree to which a person is perceived to be a real person in mediated communication.” (Gunwadena, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gunawardena |first1=C. N. |title=Social presence theory and implications for interaction collaborative  learning in computer conferences |journal=International Journal of Educational Telecommunications |date=1995 |volume=1 |issue=2/3 |pages=147–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an update on the original definition, developed by Short, Williams and Christie (1976),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Short |first1=J. |last2=Wiliams |first2=E. |last3=Christy |first3=B. |title=The social psychology of telecommunications |date=1976 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which stated, “The degree of salience of the other person in an interaction.”

'''What makes something salient?'''  How does the mind select, structure and impart meaning to stimuli?  People “develop and stabilize” cognitions about stimuli by an “examination of action, intention, ability and environment.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taytlor |first1=Shelly E. |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |title=Salience, Attention, and Attribution: Top of the Head  Phenomena |journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |date=1978 |volume=11 |issue=249–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978, citing Heider, 1934, as their source, p.&amp;nbsp;250).  Individuals have limited cognitive resources and abilities to process and comprehend information and situational complexity.  A person cannot grasp every nuance of a stimuli required to assign its full and complete meaning.  Salience is the way researchers understand what information will most likely capture one's attention in a given situation and have the greatest influence on one's cognitions about the stimuli. Research has shown that the most salient information is not always the most accurate or important, but a “Top of the Head Phenomenon” (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;   People are not fully conscious of the extent to which salience affects them.  In experimental studies, individuals generated strong cognitions with only slight manipulation of stimuli.  When shown this fact, the participant reacted strongly to the idea that they made choices based on “trivial” information (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

“Salience has generally been treated as a propriety [conforming to standard norms of morality and behavior] of a stimulus which allows it to stand out and be noticed” (Guido, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;114).&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guido |first1=Gianluigi |title=The Dichotic Theory of Salience: A Framework for Assessing  Attention and Memory |journal=European Advances in Consumer Research |date=1998 |volume=3 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guido developed the Theory of Dichotic Salience after a review of some 1,200 studies, which pointed to a “common origin among salience instances, by emphasizing the nature of prominence which is intrinsic to any salience construct” (Guido, 1998, Abstract, p.&amp;nbsp;114).&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;  According to this theory, a stimulus is “in-salient” if it is not in harmony with perceiver's worldview.  It is “re-salient” if it is in harmony with the perceiver's goals (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guido |first1=Gianluigi |title=The Dichotic Theory of Salience: A Framework for Assessing  Attention and Memory |journal=European Advances in Consumer Research |date=1998 |volume=3 |pages=114–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salience is a construct that depends on the ability of the mind to access the feelings or emotions (affect) generated by the salient stimulus.  The activation in memory of cognitions that relate to and evaluate the stimulus.  And finally, the availability of these mental resources to engage the stimulus (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

A [[schema (psychology)]] is a cognitive framework or concept through which one organizes and interprets information. Schemas provide shortcuts in sorting and interpreting the enormous quantity of information generated in one's environment.  The limitation of such a construct, is that it may cause one to exclude pertinent facts and feelings about a situation.  Instead one may focus on only those that harmonize with one's biases, beliefs and ideations.

Schemas are very useful as they help one to decide about things with very little information.  This simplification filters how one allocates cognitive resources.  It also allows one to learn more readily and rapidly, if the learning fits within an already established schema.  A schema allows for quick access to stored cognitions and filtering through pre-established algorithms, which saves time in processing and retrieving information.  Because they are so useful and reliable in helping one make sense of the world, schemas can be hard to change.   Thomas Kuhn (1962), in his book, [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]], talks about how scientists, considered the most rationale and fact driven professionals, can be so committed to their schemas that they ignore or misinterpret relevant data gathered from experiments that is contrary to their notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kuhn |first1=Thomas S. |title=The structure of scientific revolutions |date=1962 |publisher=University of Chicago  Press |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One challenge for communicators is to find a way to break through these hardened perceptions in order to persuade.  Making an idea salient is one of the keys.

Guido's Principle one is [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure-ground]], which is the means the perceptual field from which people direct their attention towards something that stands out.  Figurality is the brightness, [[complexity]], and energy (movement) of a stimulus.  It is thought that these aspects trigger cognitions and thought processes in the brain that lead to salience.  Brightness includes the magnitude and the colors of the object.  Studies have shown that bright, vibrant colors more easily capture the attention and are easier to remember (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;
 
Complexity builds upon the contextual factors (the number of perceptible qualities about the stimulus object that one can distinguish) and learning (what we perceive as unfamiliar).  Complexity is the interaction of the familiarity, unfamiliarity, and the number of aspects of the stimulus object that we can resolve.  Complexity is the interaction of these stimuli interact to engage affect and cognitions developed about the object (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;  Movement of an object engages sensory receptors, which when sparked, send stimuli to the body and brain.  Moving pictures, signs and eyes are used to capture our attention and make us pay attention (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

Novelty is the “isolation” of the stimulus from other stimuli (objects).  This isolation or uniqueness sets it apart from other objects in the background, so that it can be noticed (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;  This can also be expressed as comparative distinctiveness (Higgins, 1996).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Higgins |authorlink1=E. Tory Higgins |editor1-last=Higgins |editor1-first=E. Tory |editor2-last=Kruglanski |editor2-first=Arie W. |title=Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles |date=1996 |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |pages=133–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guido's Principle two is Unusuality, which can be broken down into statistical novelty (unique and unfamiliar), unexpectancy, out of role behaviors, negativity and extremity (emotional impact).  Novelty is the degree that one has no experience with the stimuli.  Unexpectancy is a result of learning.  We have developed an expectation that is violated (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;  Negativity is our gut reaction.  Extremity is the emotional impact of the Negativity. Each of these contributes to making something salient.

'''Accessibility and Salience'''.  When we evaluate a situation, what comes first to our minds?  The things that come to mind are those that are most accessible (most readily recalled and those that are most salient (Kreech and Crutchfield, 1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kreech |first1=D. |last2=Crutchefield |first2=R. S. |title=Theory and Problems of Social Psychology |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Our beliefs and thoughts vary in salience. Salient beliefs are most easily activated in the cognitive processes and are more easily recalled, and are therefore more accessible (Higgins, 1996).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;

Salience is determined by stimuli, such as brightness, contract, situational properties, schemas, expectations, arousal, and properties of the interpreter (e.g., need state, enduring beliefs, and motivations).   The interconnectedness of these stimuli causes the brain to be activated and information salient to the situation recalled and acted upon.

Information stored in memory, that is accessible, can be recalled either by a cue or free association.  Information that is not accessible, cannot be recalled and therefore is not available for use in interpreting a situation.  Higgins (1996) defines a memory's [[activation potential]] as having three properties: 1. the possibility that the knowledge can be recalled (not repressed or lost), 2. how easily accessible is it, and 3.the intensity or the energy of the memory.&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;  To the extent that memories are available, accessible, and have sufficient effect is the extent that these memories will be activated and that knowledge is brought to bear on the situation at hand.

Cramer (1968, p.&amp;nbsp;82) defines [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] as "a change in antecedent conditions which is specifically designed to increase the probability of a particular response given to a particular stimulus".  The process of priming can activate a particular memory to bring it to the fore so that it can be engaged in a communication or social influence situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cramer |first1=P. |title=Word Association |date=1968 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Priming has been shown to increase accessibility of relevant knowledge (Higgins, 1996).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;  Priming is, then, any event that causes increased accessibility and availability of a framework of knowledge (schema) useful for that particular situation.

In journalism, priming is associated with framing.  When an author writes an article to persuade, he or she frames certain information so that it is more salient to the reader (Weaver, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weaver |first1=David H. |title=Thoughts on Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming |journal=Journal of Communication |date=2007 |volume=57 |pages=142–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Framing including writing decisions about definitions of words and events, causal linkages, moral implications, and solution sets for the problem area (McCombs, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCombs |first1=M. |title=New frontiers in agenda setting: Agendas of attributes and frames |journal=Mass  Communication Review |date=1997 |volume=24 |issue=1–2 |pages=32–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Our minds sort information available using our agenda (framing) and stimulus (priming) for that situation and activate it to accomplish our purpose.

When one encounters a stimulus for the first time, the initial reaction is characterized as [[unconditioned response]].  An unconditioned response is one that “elicits a national, reflexive response.”  (Weseley &amp; McEntarffer, 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;136).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weseley |first1=Alison J. |title=Barron's AP Psychology |date=2014 |publisher=Barron’s  Educational Series, Inc |location=New York |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent encounters will elicit a [[conditioned response]] has been developed through the learning that occurred with the intervening encounters with the stimulus.  This learning is bedrock knowledge on which one draws when responding to a given situation.  (Weseley &amp; McEntarffer, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weseley |first1=Alison J. |title=Barron's AP Psychology |date=2014 |publisher=Barron’s  Educational Series, Inc |location=New York |pages=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the first time one ate ice cream the experience was pleasant, the second experience will be informed from the firs.  The second experience will generate salient pleasant cognitions, salivation, and other biological responses that will reinforce the pleasant salience of the experience.  If on the other hand, the first encounter was negative (disgust, pain or nausea), the second encounter will generate the feeling of pain in the stomach awful memories of the first encounter. which will reinforce the negative salience of the first and second experience.

Another key aspect of whether a particular memory or knowledge will be activated is whether it is applicable to the situation.  If it is not applicable, it will not be salient and is unlikely to be activated for that situation.  “According to the synapse model…, the process begins with the stimulus, which increases the excitation level of stored knowledge as a function of the features of the match between the attended features of the stimulus and the features of the stored knowledge.” (Higgins, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;137).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;  The stimulus information creates a pathway to the knowledge, which is then evaluated for a salience match to the stimulus.  If there is a match, then the knowledge will be activated.

Our minds and bodies are bombarded by relevant and irrelevant knowledge and experiences every day.  We will tune into salient ones (crane the ears to more fully hear enjoyable music) and tune-out non-salient ones (cover our ears from jackhammer noise).  There is difference between seeing something and looking at it.  In seeing, the capacity of our retina to take in the light energy is engaged and the brain processes that information into an image.  When one looks at an object, not only are visual perceptive capacities engaged, but other mental processes for evaluation and ordering of the object are activated (Skinner, 1974).&lt;ref name="About Behaviorism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skinner |first1=B. F. |title=About Behaviorism |date=1974 |publisher=Vintage Books a Division of Random House |location=New York |pages=113–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have gatekeeper mental mechanisms that allow certain information in and keeps others out. This discrimination process can be viewed a defensive mechanism the protects and enhances our life experience.  Our processes of making cognitions “also involve contingencies of reinforcement.” (Skinner, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;117).&lt;ref name="About Behaviorism"/&gt;  Skinner implies that reinforcement as “a special kind of stimulus control.”  (Skinner, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;119).&lt;ref name="About Behaviorism"/&gt;  Salience can be thought of as a reinforcement mechanism that make certain thoughts, feelings and emotions available, accessible, applicable and actionable within the context of the situation.

Esber and Haselgrove (2011) looked at the use of predictiveness and uncertainty on stimulus salience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Esber |first1=G. |last2=Haselgrove |first2=M. |title=Reconciling the influence of predictiveness and uncertainty  on stimulus salience: A model of attention in associative learning |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=2011 |volume=278 |issue=1718 |pages=2553–2561}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They cite the example of a bird watching the water for the presence of fish.  Through learning, the bird associates the ripples with the closeness of the fish, but they must be careful of the uncertainty that ripple is not caused by a crocodile.  The ripples are very salient, if they are caused by fish suitable for use as food.  The likelihood increases that the ripples will catch the attention of the bird and improve its probability of eating the fish, if the ripple cue is a predictor of fish behavior and presence.  The predictiveness of ripples reinforces its salience.  The Esber–Haselgrove model argues that (1) “stimuli acquire added salience to the degree that they predict motivationally relevant consequences”, and  (2) “a predictor of multiple reinforcers should have more salience than a predictor of just one.” (Esber &amp; Haselgrove, 2011, 2555-25557).&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;  So, for example, if ripples predict both the presence of fish and the increased likelihood that the fish can be caught, they will be much more salient to the bird, than if the ripples only predict the presence of the fish, but tell the bird nothing about the probability of making a catch.

Salience is a broad concept in the social sciences, that can cause confusion.  Part of the confusion lies in that different researchers use the same term to posit different ideas of what makes a particular stimulus salient.  When we encounter an object or idea, we may be draw to it for a variety of reasons.  It may be its brightness or intensity, its predictive capacity, or other features such as uniqueness or enormity that catches one's attention.

Once the attention is engaged, our brain will begin to process this information and make assessments and judgements about the encounter.  Our minds and bodies will activate useful memories, biological responses and feelings that were generated from prior encounters with the object of similar objects.  These memory-evaluative-feeling-biology responses will determine if the object is salient.  If it is salient, we will devote more cognitive processing resources to the encounter and it will enhance or protect us in that moment.

===Axioms of salience===
[[Communication]] scholars have found that a number of different factors have a direct effect on the salience of attitude objects.

====Direct experience====
[[William Crano]] posits that one's direct experience with an issue or attitude object increases the salience and consequently the [[wikt:potency|potency]] of that [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], and the level of consistency between attitude and [[behavior]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

:For example: Consider two people: one with emphysema, one without. Both of whom share a negative attitude toward cigarette smoking. The person with emphysema would have a stronger attitude than his counterpart, and consequently would show greater consistency between his relevant attitude and behavior. It is posited by Crano that the attitude toward smoking of the person with emphysema may be more salient due to his direct experience with the consequence of smoking.

====Self-Interest====

The concept called ''[[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]]'' by Crano is called ''self-interest'' by Sears (1997). It seems that "self-interest" is the more widely recognized term. Self-interest involves either perceived or actual personal consequences. That is, Crano (1997) argues that vested interest involves perceived personal consequences (p.&amp;nbsp;490), while Sears (1997, a critique of Crano) counter-argues that Crano's survey experiments define it objectively. Crano argues that vested interest should have a moderating effect on attitudes. Sears argues that, actually, evidence for this is conflicting: The survey literature has rarely found significant effects of self-interest, while the experimental literature finds significant effects. The literature is concerned with salience only marginally; it is actually about strength of attitudes (i.e. how well they correlate with behavior). It is about salience inasmuch as anything "strong" is "salient".

====Needs and aspirations====
The salience (prominence) of an [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] can also be measured by the [[relevance]] of an [[idea]] to that person's [[needs]] or aspirations.&lt;ref name="Tacos" /&gt; As ideals become more salient they become more [[accessible]], the more [[accessible]] the attitude object is the stronger the attitude toward the object. As [[accessibility]] increases, so does the likelihood of self-interested [[voting]] (Young).

:For example: In times of elections, issue relevant events are the focus of attention. Therefore, candidates, due to their aspiration for a certain political position are interest driven toward the salient events since they are favorable to their party.

===Policy making===
{{Confusing|section|date=August 2008}}

Political scientists agree that salience is relatively important in examining political [[policy]], because policies are not only determined by what issues are important to people but also by how important they are. This involves examining what issues are ignored and which are made "important." One research agenda that political scientists are concerned with understanding is "when and how salience and changes in salience matter for political action."

There are three related understandings of salience.

#The first ("classical") interpretation considers salience to be independent of the "[[status quo]]" and politicians’ ideal policies and programs. Although it says salience is independent of ideals, it does not say that salience is independent of preferences. This means, where there is a change in salience there is also a change in preferences. Often a player or policymaker's ideals may not be known but their preferences are usually revealed in their party's manifestos. Often policymakers cannot achieve their ideals but rather must choose between the offers on the table. They may prefer one over the other and this is where salience affects a party or a politician's position on an issue.
#The second ("[[valence (psychology)|valence]]") interpretation proposes that for certain issues salience is a very important factor. In other words, when there is a general [[consensus]] of [[principle]]s, the relative salience of various issues amongst the public determines the policy position of policy makers. This is due to constraints in policy making, where ideals are often induced, which policy makers view as the tradeoff space. For example, although "ideally" they may like to see low [[unemployment]] and low [[inflation]], they are usually constrained to pick a position on the "tradeoff" line. Thus, their ideal has been induced due to constraints. In these situations salience and policy position are almost interchangeable, because their "induced ideal" is their "favored allocation."{{Clarify|date=August 2008}} In the classical interpretation, salience would be used to describe the different levels of preference between positions on [[policies]].
#The third ("price") interpretation assumes that salience is not separate from ideals, as the classical view states, but that it is also not the same as ideals, as the valence view claims. This interpretation assumes that although a group of players, sharing benevolent preferences, all dissatisfied with the [[status quo]], may still value different aspects differently when considering policy change. The price interpretation is favored over the other two for three reasons. First, it is more applicable. Unlike the classical view, the price interpretation can be applied to a more wide-ranging set of situations. Second, the price interpretation uses both the classical point of view and ideals in its evaluation of salience. Not only do you need to know a player's weighted preferences but also their connection to their ideal point and the [[status quo]]. Therefore, a change in salience can reflect a change in ideal point, [[status quo]], or their weighted preferences. Third, this interpretation can be used to determine the elements stand in importance or worth. For example, players may organize and focus their time and energy into options with the biggest pay off. "That is they may look to see where they get the greatest ‘bang for their buck.’"&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

==Public opinion==
McCombs and Shaw’s seminal “Chapel Hill study”, which researched salience and public opinion examined most of the agenda-setting research since the [[United States presidential election, 1968]] which has been concerned with how the public salience of the issue is related to [[mass media]]’s ranking of these issues in terms of frequency of coverage and news play. The main [[hypothesis]] examined in this study is the ranking of certain issues by the [[Mass media|media]], which, in time, becomes the public agenda. More importantly, the article searched whether the perceived public salience of the federal budget deficit is significantly related "to the amount of public knowledge about the issue, direction of public opinion regarding one possible solution to the issue, the strength of that opinion and political behavior such as writing letters, signing petitions, voting, etc." The result of this study concluded that "even though the federal deficit issue was one of the more salient to newspaper and voters during the 1988 [[election]], it (the federal budget deficit) was not as emotional or [[drama]]tic as some of the other highly salient issues such as [[drug abuse]] or [[environmental pollution]]. Thus it seemed likely that public opinion regarding a solution to the federal budget deficit might be rather evenly split and would likely be more stable during the month of interviewing than would opinion on some of the other more dramatic issues being emphasized in news media coverage and political advertisements." In other words, issues that directly involve subjects, in this study, would conclude to be more salient than issues that do not involve them directly.

==Marketing stimuli==

Although salience is a stimulus response, is it a stimulus quality or an absolute quality?&lt;ref name="Guido" /&gt; Salience plays an important role in intergroup communication. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, "Group salience is a key variable both in influencing quality of intergroup contact and in moderating the effects of intergroup contact on prejudicial attitudes."

In their study of family communication and intergroup relationships, "Group salience is an individual’s awareness of group memberships and respective group differences in an intergroup encounter (e.g., the salience of race in an interracial conversation)."&lt;ref name="Harwood" /&gt; This study carefully examines the dynamics of intergroup relationships with respect to communication in a family context. Their study involved communicative aspects associated with age salience in the grandparent&amp;nbsp;– grandchild relationship, the extent to which various dimension of communication predicts measures of salience, relational or inter-family proximity, and attitudes towards aging. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, "Communication phenomena that were positively correlated with measures of age salience were negatively related to relational closeness. Only one communication measure (grandparents talking about the past) moderated the relationship between quality of contact with grandparent and attitudes toward older people. Specific communicative dimensions emerged that warrant further investigation in this and other intergroup contexts."&lt;ref name="Harwood" /&gt;

Salience also from an applied communicative perspective plays an important role in our [[Consumer]]- [[Marketing]] world. In Gianluigi Guido's book, ''The Salience of Marketing Stimuli: an incongruity&amp;nbsp;– salience hypothesis on consumer awareness'', "salience triggered by an external physical stimuli, like all marketing stimuli are before being internalized by consumers&amp;nbsp;– to explain and predict the conditions under which a marketing stimulus, is able to achieve its communication outcomes in term of processing and memory."&lt;ref name="Guido" /&gt; The book clearly defines the history of the definition of salience and the ambiguities of arriving at an accurate definition. It also utilizes various theories to best define salience in our marketing world. Of the many theories, Guido uses aspects of Incongruity theory, [[Schema (psychology)|Schema]] theory and an information processing model referred to as the In-salience hypothesis emphasizes the nature of prominence of salience.

Marketing plans have become quite intricate and detailed in many ways.  Analysts and industry experts used a myriad of tools to collect information from would be customers, previous customers and others in order to fashion the sales message of a particular product.  This level of detailed work has evolved over time, but in many ways the same resources and information are gathered and used to achieve result of a sale.  The marketing strategy feeds into one of the final products most people get to experience: the commercial.  The commercial embodies the elements of the marketing strategy in language, affective response, and attitude change.  Marketing plans in the modern age also look at the international customer when creating plans and formulating strategy.  “An evolutionary perspective of internationalization of the firm has been adopted by a number of authors in the areas of international economics and international management. The theory of the international product lifecycle, propounded by Vernon and others, identifies a number of phases in the internationalization process based on the location of production. In the initial phase, a firm exports to overseas markets from a domestic production base. As market potential builds up, overseas production facilities are established. Low cost local competition then enters the market, and ultimately exports to the home market of the initial entrant, thus challenging its international market position.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Craig |first=C.Samuel |last2=Douglas |first2=Susan P. |date=December 1996 |title=Responding to the challenges of global markets: Change, complexity, competition and conscience |journal=The Columbia Journal of World Business |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=6–18 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5428(96)90028-9 |issn=0022-5428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"This model is part of wider Dichotic theory of salience, according to which a stimulus is salient either when it is incongruent in a certain context to a perceiver's schema, or when it is congruent in a certain context to a perceiver's goal. According to the four propositions of the model, in-salient stimuli are better recalled, affect both attention and interpretation, and are moderated by the degree of perceivers' comprehension (i.e., activation, accessibility, and availability of schemata), and involvement (i.e., personal relevance of the stimuli). Results of two empirical studies on print advertisements show that in-salient ad messages have the strongest impact in triggering ad processing which, in turn, leads to consumer awareness."&lt;ref name="Guido" /&gt;

The field of marketing is continually being studied and researched.  Anshular &amp; Kumar, Williams &amp; Schmidt, Holden, Kuznetsov &amp; Whitelock, and Huang &amp; Chan have researched and published works regarding the language of marketing.  Although the research is ongoing and adaptive to the customer, the research has been able to study points of importance to the consumer.  Marketing requires an approach that carefully designs messages (commercials), utilizing  signs and symbols to resonate with a potential buyer or customer.  Nike's swoosh, Michael Jordan's jump-man image, Ford/GMC Cadillac logos are all signs that most people can quickly grab and discern the message being laid out.  In the world of marketing having this power and ability gives you a significant edge in comparison to the competition.  Van Der Lans, Pieters, and Wedel write based on their research “we estimate brand salience at the point of purchase, based on perceptual features (color, luminance, edges) and how these are influenced by consumers’ search goals. We show that the salience of brands has a pervasive effect on search performance, and is determined by two key components: The bottom-up component is due to in-store activity and package design. The top-down component is due to out-of-store marketing activities such as advertising.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Lans|first=Ralf|last2=Pieters|first2=Rik|last3=Wedel|first3=Michel|date=September 2008|title=Research Note—Competitive Brand Salience|journal=Marketing Science|volume=27|issue=5|pages=922–931|doi=10.1287/mksc.1070.0327|issn=0732-2399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using computer based langue to design extraction tools as part of the user experiences.

Internet Alcohol Vendors unlike traditional brick and mortar stores are established to reach a wider market.  With this intent state officials and competitors have both started cases in court as further regulating the practice of internet alcohol sales.  Internet sales give buyers reduced discounts in many forms while offering very little in security and accountability.  The case brought against the industry favored further regulation keying in on individuals underage age having access to and buying alcohol online.  The courts pushed back against the plaintiff lacking substantial information to make the case.  The marketing language used was focused on reduced taxes based on quantity purchased and reduced or zero fees for shipping.  Customers were connected to this message and therefore drawn to the product and made significant purchases.

Russian viewpoint of marketing focused on the battle against capitalism, the west and specifically USA.  Marketing language focused on the economics of each nation and how to improve it in an ever-changing world.  Marketing was studied in the west by Russian students and translated for Russians to understand. Bad language came from translators who took artistic leisure with the material.  Based on this context things were changed and missed when information was being relayed created huge shifts in understanding of the original material.

The difference between the English alphabet and Chinese logographical system offer a unique challenge in brand creation, marketing and language.

Therefore, to define salience as appropriate as possible using the information, it would be apt to define it such that, salience is that [[intrinsic]] concept of the perceived or interpreted prominence of an attitude, and its manifestation on our choices.

Salience in marketing based on the research reviewed, can be categorized as a stimulus quality. What that means is the customers’ needs have to be calculated and adjusted towards through the entire planning and execution of the plan.  The overall goal of the messenger should be to create a message which adapts to the customer's affective responses, rewarding it with more info, then finally providing a product which would best arrive at the predetermined feel.  Most consumers when asked about a marketing campaign are able to identify it clearly from the point of view of a commercial. These commercials capture the essence of the message being sent to all recipients.  Products such as make up, cars, clothing, coffee, food, shoes etc. are all designed to create and provide an affective reaction from the recipient. The process of engaging with the customer seeks a cognitive connection.  Customers will have to be grouped based on the item in order to predict affective responses.  With this in mind, the focus is placed on imagery, affective responses from the consumer. How does this make you feel, do you empathize, how would you feel about using this product, etc.  Marketing messages that have a significant affective component are able to connect better with people and yield greater outcome.

Identity salience can affect the consumer.  This display can be explain using “Identity theory posits that identities are arranged hierarchically and that salient identities are more likely to affect behavior than those that are less important. We propose that identity salience may play an important role in relationships that are distinguished by a minimum of two characteristics. First, though most theoretical and empirical research in relation-ship marketing focuses on characteristics of successful business-to-business relationships, such as trust and commitment (Morgan and Hunt 1994), many exchange relationships involve individuals. It is not unusual for organizations to attempt to develop long-term relationships with consumers on an individual basis. We argue that in contexts in which one partner is an individual, for example, business-to consumer marketing, identity salience may be an important construct that mediates relationship-inducing factors, such as reciprocity and satisfaction, and relationship marketing success."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnett|first=Dennis B.|last2=German|first2=Steve D.|last3=Hunt|first3=Shelby D.|date=April 2003|title=The Identity Salience Model of Relationship Marketing Success: The Case of Nonprofit Marketing|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=67|issue=2|pages=89–105|doi=10.1509/jmkg.67.2.89.18614|issn=0022-2429|citeseerx=10.1.1.659.532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity gets tied to brands, products and places for some people.  There are generations of family sports team supporters, airline users, vacation goings and even restaurant patrons.  These key items become a foundation block of self-identification and perception.

The vehicle industry uses certain symbols as part of its marketing campaign. Most of these are touched on from different manufacturers in their efforts to win over customers.  These are also common messages points that are used to make the sale and acquire the vested interest of the customer.  For e.g. comfort (leather seating), roominess (cabin space), reliability, safety, performance, on/off-road handling, award winner by category, insurance companies or other entity.  The best part of all the campaign is the dealership experience.  This experience is the affective piece of the process.  The initial being cognitive and schema connection, followed by the affective which aims at nudging the customer towards affirming the purchase.  Customer attitudes can be influenced by a myriad of variables, therefore the marketing campaign is aimed at skewing enough of those variables towards to nearest dealer or once most capable of making the sale. “Specifically, research on behavioral synchrony suggests that people express greater feelings of attraction when they share their visual gazes, body postures (Chartrand &amp; Lakin,2013), and more recently, their language style in writing or speech (Ireland &amp; Pennebaker,2010)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Cathy R.|last2=Kersten|first2=Mike|date=2016-03-15|title=Mortality salience increases language style matching and well-being|journal=Self and Identity|volume=15|issue=4|pages=452–467|doi=10.1080/15298868.2016.1154888|issn=1529-8868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salience as a stimulus quality is a significant piece of the marketing, sales and commercial strategy.  Manufacturers use celebrities, athletes, and other professionals as a way of drawing your attention to their product through stimulus.  When it comes to car buying, many people refer to a past memory, this stimuli is different with each person but overall the quality and richness of that response is what connects to the brand in a way nothing else does.  Care makers go through periods of recycling pieces of nostalgia to connect new drivers to those of yesteryear.  Granpa is able to drive his mustang next to a grandson who favors the new model with a few modifications.  A suit maker is able to dress members of the same family for 3 generations and just as many weddings and formal events.

The stimulus quality is the strongest connection between all these events and the company or product creator able to take advantage of this, is most likely to achieve success.  “Research concerning stimulus characteristics, which include information content and format, suggests that consumers utilize more nutrition information when it Is presented in an easily processed form (Levy et al. 1985; Muller 1985; Russo et al. 1986; Scammon 1977).(Moorman, 1990)”  Stimulus qualities continually change and therefore needs to be studied and adaptations made in order to attain the best marketing end results.  Cultural viewpoints of marketing and advertising is important across industries in many parts of the world.  In the US alcohol sales are restricted to individuals ages 21 and greater, that rule isn’t universal and some in nations around the world are trying to cope with the effects of marketing and ad campaigns (O’Brian &amp; Carr 2016).”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Kerry S.|last2=Carr|first2=Sherilene M.|date=2016-09-07|title=Commentary on de Bruijnet al.(2016): Effective alcohol marketing policymaking requires more than evidence on alcohol marketing effects-research on vested interest effects is needed|journal=Addiction|volume=111|issue=10|pages=1784–1785|doi=10.1111/add.13489|pmid=27605080|issn=0965-2140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marketing messages are important based on the roles of the recipient.  In the example of a mom she’s expected to judge the quality of goods and purchase based on the needs of children even though the good may not directly be marketed to and for her.  “Noting the incongruence between the self-interested, utility maximizing persona one is expected to portray in the workforce, and the selﬂess, nurturing persona widespread among mothers, Hays argues that the latter identity in fact reveals a deep-seated cultural ambivalence towards economistic principles and behaviours.”&lt;ref&gt;de Laat, K., &amp; Baumann, S. (2016). Caring consumption as marketing schema: representations of motherhood in an era of hyperconsumption. Journal Of Gender Studies, 25(2), 183-199. doi:10.1080/09589236.2014.927353&lt;/ref&gt;

le form schema based on social norms and roles.  These roles are enforced individual beliefs and boosts perceptions is supposed to be doing, sometimes those expectations hold true and in others it doesn’t.  Social identity theory has been used while creating marketing strategies regarding women. Marketing strategies with products aimed at women should have like minds as part of the planning and creative process. Women across cultures and backgrounds experience similar stimuli but not on the same wave.  Products like shoes, makeup, clothing and others geared specifically for women have messages focused on stimuli response of “feel good”.  Moms receive and are sent messages of safety and security of their children, a measure of style and the look and presentation of a strong woman.  Marketing towards men are designed to inspire the feel of strength, leadership, vision, connection to nature, and feeling of ruggedness.

The Language used in marketing is important because it is potentially the most important reason why someone makes a purchase/acquires a product.  Research has shown that analytics aren’t always the best predictor of sales or consumer connection with a product. Social identity theory can be used to evaluate the roles of individuals while creating the strategy.  Depending on this solely will lead one astray without the addition of other pieces of information.  Shema allows the consumer to receive each detail of a commercial/ad campaign in a way that energizes particular stimuli and therefore puts each person into the “driver seat” of an experience.

The cognitive perspective spells out information which must be received, processed and analyzed and solutions south.  Salience in marketing searches for the affective or stimulus response.  A combination of efforts which both harvests information and processes it carefully if very important.  Things such as age group, buying power, shopping frequency, socioeconomic status are all important.  Once a product is created and during its testing phase the response which users and customers alike will be its feel.  In the new age of tech data, appliances and complex machinery, marketing will still need to focus its efforts on such products and how consumer stimuli reacts to the product.  The best engineers can create something that's amazing with all its bells and whistles, but its up to the perception of the customer to evaluate its usefulness and fit into his/her lifestyle.

The growing tech industry with the power of achievement is quickly advancing virtual reality.  VR can be experienced in the home without leaving to try or test any product prior to purchase.  "The mural isn't just about aesthetics. Visitors will be instructed via signs to download an app to view the mural's augmented reality features. Downloading the app will also unlock a special coupon at The Elephant Room. It's a marketing tactic that Moody believes can drive foot traffic to the bar."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tschanz|first=Dirk Schart, Nathaly|title=Kapitel 6  Praxiswissen: Von der Idee zur App|date=2017|work=Augmented und Mixed Reality|pages=153–172|publisher=UVK Verlagsgesellschaft mbH|isbn=9783739803845|doi=10.24053/9783739803845-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this power marketing analysts and executives can craft messages and commercial aimed at each person with a unique and authentic feel.  Information and data points are being collected and tested now. Video games offer a chance into the virtual world medical training and some groups in government and the military are adopting the technology to better achieve results.  Crafting the message and spreading it out the masses will take less effort in the future, messages can be adapted to fit all manner of permutations each person may have.  There may finally be an era of error free messaging with a direct link into the internet, show rooms of fashion designers, engineers at car factories and all other sorts of products.  Testing in the virtual world would be far less tasking on legions of people.

Humans in general respond greatly to stimuli and we offer this through the reactions generated. Marketing lends help in this manner by studying the patterns of behavior and crafting products for sale.  The messaging is not always clear, succinct, and wide reaching.  Research is still ongoing regarding how best to reach the customer in order to pitch and complete a sale.  Those who are successful have crafted tools to help measure key things like salience in messaging and reaction to products.  In the new age, the data collected will be very important while outfitting each member of the consuming public.  Being able to craft a message or medium that can quickly adapt to each person virtually is of great importance.  Online markets are gaining followership daily as more money spending moves to the digital realm.  Perception and reception of the message is still the single most important part of any marketing strategy and should not be treated lightly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14410">'''Sustainable capitalism''' is a conceptual form of [[capitalism]] based upon [[Sustainability|sustainable]] practices that seek to preserve humanity and the planet, while reducing [[Externality|externalities]] and bearing a resemblance of capitalist [[economic policy]]. A capitalistic economy must expand to survive and find new markets to support this expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261454998_The_convergence_of_sustainable_capitalism|title=The convergence of sustainable capitalism|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalist systems are often thought to be destructive to the environment as well as certain individuals without access to proper representation. However, sustainability provides quite the opposite; it implies  not only a continuation, but a replenishing of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233707282_Is_Sustainable_Capitalism_an_Oxymoron|title=Is Sustainable Capitalism an Oxymoron?|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability is often thought of to be related to [[environmentalism]], and sustainable capitalism applies sustainable principles to economic governance and social aspects of capitalism as well.

The importance of sustainable capitalism has been more recently recognized, but the concept is not new. Changes to the current economic model would have heavy social environmental and economic implications and require the efforts of individuals, as well as compliance of local, state and federal governments. Controversy surrounds the concept as it requires an increase in sustainable practices and a marked decrease in current consumptive behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/866837827|title=Sustainable Capitalism and the Pursuit of Well-Being.|last=E.|first=Harrison, Neil|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781306218047|oclc=866837827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a concept of [[capitalism]] described in [[Al Gore]] and [[David Blood]]’s manifesto for the [[Generation Investment Management]] to describe a long-term political, economic and social structure which would mitigate current threats to the planet and society.&lt;ref name="genfound"&gt;https://www.genfound.org/media/pdf-wsj-manifesto-sustainable-capitalism-14-12-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to their manifesto, sustainable capitalism would integrate the environmental, social and governance ([[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG]]) aspects into risk assessment in attempt to limit externalities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.generationim.com/media/pdf-generation-sustainable-capitalism-v1.pdf|title=Sustainable Capitalism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ideas they list are related to economic changes, and social aspects, but strikingly few are explicitly related to any environmental policy change.&lt;ref name="genfound" /&gt;

== Governance and economic aspects ==

Economic aspects are clearest, perhaps because the economy is most easily associated with capitalism. Sustainable capitalism, as a policy outline, is an attempt to address and tackle the use of [[Gross domestic product#Limitations and criticisms|admittedly insufficient tools]] used today to measure the economic growth and the real value of countries, such as [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] or [[Gross output|GO]]. Criticism of this form of growth measurement is centered on the fact that GDP fails to account for labor conditions and other environmental factors which have a long-term influence on the value which it measures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/macroeconomics/limitations-gdp-alternative.asp?header_alt=c
&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept follows recent trends that see forms of [[sustainable business]] as the preferred method for development, because of the way that these types of businesses offer a positive influence to their environment. Many of these stem from business-led corporate responsibility coalitions which aim to mitigate ESG impacts through mobilization of resources.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/815044298|title=Corporate responsibility coalitions : the past, present, and future of alliances for sustainable capitalism|last=1960-|first=Nelson, Jane,|isbn=9780804787109|oclc=815044298}}&lt;/ref&gt; These business are not limited to the traditional non-profits we associate with corporate responsibility, but also can be independent, non-profit, for-profit, led by a board of directors or core-funded.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The wide spectrum of business types shows the gradual turn towards socially and environmentally responsible corporate governance.

Sustainable capitalism challenges the common model of the capitalist economy by its linear frame. [[Raw material]]s, either natural resources or intellect, when combined with a capital increasing mechanism, like worker power, create marketable products that are sold for money and waste. In the concept of sustainable capitalism, it appears to be necessary to shift to a more circular economy where the end product would be reinvested not only to the capitalist business or financial institution but into the basis for raw materials, and people who support this business.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931609928|title=Greening of capitalism how Asia is driving the next great transformation|last=Alwyn,|first=Mathews, John|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Stanford Economics and Finance|isbn=9780804793162|oclc=931609928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of circular economy would require more responsibility on corporate governance to reduce externalities. China has made advances in this area, increasing renewable energy industries, with an estimate that fossil fuels will no longer be the main source of energy by 2030; these steps toward change were forced in part by high pollution and population.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In their manifesto, Gore and Blood propose key economic measures to change from the current form of capitalism:.
# Identify and incorporate risks from stranded assets.
# Mandate integrated reporting.
# End the default practice of issuing quarterly earnings guidance.
# Align compensation structures with long-term sustainable performance.
# Encourage long-term investing with loyalty-driven securities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Reinforce sustainability as a fiduciary issue.
# Create advisory services for sustainable asset management.
# Expand the range and depth of sustainable investment products.
# Reconsider the appropriate definition for growth beyond GDP.
# Integrate sustainability into business education at all levels.&lt;ref name="genfound" /&gt;
The first five items are most related to economic changes, while the last five are actions more related to social aspects. Of these ten, only two are directly related to environmental aspects, and none explicitly suggest environmental policy changes.

== Environmental aspects ==

As explained by Bruce Ledewitz, sustainable capitalism is the adoption and development of sustainable practices that protect natural resources, instead of spending it as capital. Ledewitz claims that in traditional capitalism, “[[natural capital]],” meaning natural resources, will continue to decline and will limit monetary capital success, lifting the value of natural resources and replacing the definition of prosperity. He proposes that sustainable capitalism would institute policies and regulations to protect natural resources in addition to investing back into the environment in attempt to reverse the degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledewitz|first=Bruce|year=2002|title=The Constitutions of Sustainable Capitalism and beyond|url=|journal=Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review|volume=29|pages=234–239|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social aspects ==
Social aspects of sustainable capitalism involve a positive reception toward climate change. Author Mohan Munasinghe explains that two specific ways that humans can respond to climate change are through adaptation and mitigation. First, adaptation is aimed at reducing the vulnerability of human and natural systems in the face of climate change stresses, while mitigation is aimed at lowering or removing GHG emissions to reduce radiative forcing of the atmosphere and the intensity of future climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munasinghe|first=Mohan|year=2008|title=Addressing the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Challenges Together: Applying the Sustainomics Framework|url=http://zp9vv3zm2k.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fsummon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=proceeding&amp;rft.title=Procedia+-+Social+and+Behavioral+Sciences&amp;rft.atitle=Is+sustainable+capitalism+possible%3F&amp;rft.au=Schweickart%2C+David&amp;rft.date=2010-01-01&amp;rft.issn=1877-0428&amp;rft.eissn=1877-0428&amp;rft.volume=2&amp;rft.issue=5&amp;rft.spage=6739&amp;rft.epage=6752&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.sbspro.2010.05.020&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=359290654&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|volume=2|pages=6634–6640|via=ScienceDirect|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist John Ikerd claims that environmental degradation happens under modern capitalism because the economy is divorced from ethics.&lt;ref name="ikerd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=882123066117006086075027001020000104017037064079033004076089084068090120087007124000036041017035040124044003124077000065006068038045044040053069026005111116116122102002081037125066127026115102084091008101118011088126097110109019102029118068109105025067&amp;EXT=pdf|title=Sustainable Capitalism: A Matter of Ethics and Morality|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, [[Classical economics|classical economists]] like [[Adam Smith]] had always intended for market economics to be tempered by property owners' moralities, and [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]] put undue faith in the ability of markets to automatically adjust to physical and moral imperatives. Ikerd concludes that a system of [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]] founded on a popular, ethical consensus is necessary and sufficient to prevent excessive [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="ikerd" /&gt;

Sustainable capitalism is also viewed as a non-transcendent, regulated commodity to humanity due to the ever-increasing demands of environmental regulation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strickland|first=Geoffrey|year=2013|title=True Development and the Human Person: Transcending Contradiction in Discerning a Sustainable Capitalism|url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy4.library.arizona.edu/docview/1438853641?pq-origsite=summon&amp;accountid=8360|journal=Journal of Markets and Morality|volume=16.1|pages=17|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey Strickland emphasizes that current discussions on economic development are led by the notion that human reproduction is a commodity that must be regulated and improved in order to encourage market efficiency, which is a phenomenon that counteracts the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Capitalism without growth }}

=== Marxist view ===

According to the Marxist understanding of capitalism as production for profit, it is impossible to prioritize environmental sustainability without abolishing capitalism. [[Ernest Mandel]] claims that when [[profit maximization]] requires a business to pollute the air, "the simple right to clean air is abolished".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Late Capitalism|last=Mandel|first=Ernest|publisher=Verso|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his conception of capitalism, profit necessarily subjugates the environment, and properly accounting for the social costs of production requires some form of [[Planned economy|socialist planning]]. Any attempt to adequately protect the environment within such a capitalist framework is doomed to fail, so the argument goes, because society simply is not structured to be willing to sacrifice private profits for public endeavors on this scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Late Capitalism|last=Mandel|first=Ernest|publisher=Verso|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=577–578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainable capitalism as an oxymoron ===

The Capital Institute describes the concept of sustainable capitalism as an [[oxymoron]].&lt;ref name=oxymoron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitalinstitute.org/blog/guest-post-sustainable-capitalism-oxymoron/|title=Guest Post: Is Sustainable Capitalism an Oxymoron?|work=Capital Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that modern capitalism is not designed for cooperation and much of the proposed measures in the manifesto are insufficient.&lt;ref name="oxymoron" /&gt; Regeneration, cooperation, and well-being are aspects of sustainability that do not coincide with what capitalism has evolved to be. Efforts may be made to reform current capitalistic practices, but mass movements focusing on environmental concerns that do not create a radical change of the system are not likely to succeed as they go against what capitalism was designed to achieve. Capitalism and sustainability are mutually exclusive ideas given the current model.&lt;ref name="oxymoron" /&gt;

=== Government reluctance ===
Critics such as Neil E. Harrison argue that the government would likely be resistant to sustainable changes for the current capitalist model. Since the capitalist government was built upon capitalist ideals and business interests, he argues, the government is dependent on the system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Often, the government is most focused on overt crises rather than long-term solutions to problems that are not readily apparent. His main argument is that beyond the current structure, authority is not enough to control the social and economic aspects enough to truly impact the environmental needs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Tippu Tip''', or '''Tippu Tib''' (1832 &amp;ndash; June 14, 1905), real name '''Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi'''  ({{lang-ar|حمد بن محمد بن جمعة بن رجب بن محمد بن سعيد المرجبي}}), was a [[Swahili people|Swahili]]–[[Zanzibar]]i slave trader, ivory trader, explorer, plantation owner and governor. He worked for a succession of the [[Sultan of Zanzibar|sultans of Zanzibar]]. Tippu Tip traded in slaves for Zanzibar's [[clove]] plantations. As part of the large and lucrative [[ivory trade]], he led many trading expeditions into [[Central Africa]] by constructing profitable trading posts that reached deep into the region. He bought the ivory from local suppliers and resold it for a profit at coastal ports.

==Early life==
[[File:Tippu Tip 1889.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Tippu Tip in [[The Illustrated London News]]. Front cover of 7 December 1889 issue.]]
It is believed that Tippu Tip was born around 1832 on Zanzibar, based on descriptions of his age at points in his life.&lt;ref name= Hinde8/&gt; Tippu Tip's mother, Bint Habib bin Bushir, was a [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] [[Arab people|Arab]] of the ruling class. His father and paternal grandfather were coastal [[Swahili people|Swahili]] who had taken part in the earliest trading expeditions to the interior. His paternal great-grandmother, wife of Rajab bin Mohammed bin Said el Murgebi, was the daughter of Juma bin Mohammed el Nebhani, a member of a respected Muscat ([[Oman]]) family, and a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] woman from the village of Mbwa Maji, a small village south of what would later become the German capital of [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref&gt;Brode, 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Tip himself was purportedly of well-bred carriage, with a "[[Negroid]]" countenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deckera|first1=Michelle|title=The 'Autobiography' of Tippu Tip|journal=International Journal of Postcolonial Studies|date=2015|volume=17|issue=5|pages=744–758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his lifetime Hamad bin Muhammad bin Juma bin Rajab el Murjebi was more commonly known as ''Tippu Tib'', which translates to "the gatherer together of wealth".&lt;ref name= Hinde8/&gt; According to him, he was given the nickname Tippu Tip after the "tiptip" sound that his guns gave off during expeditions in Chungu territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferant|first1=Leda|title=Tippu Tip and the East African slave trade|date=1972|publisher=Hamilton|page=42|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=McO4AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 November 2017|quote=For two months Tippu Tip's caravan camped in Chungu's territory and punitive parties were sent out looking for Samu and his men. According to Tippu Tip this was the time he was given his nick-name because guns went 'tiptip, in a manner too terrible to listen to'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a relatively young age, Tippu Tip led a group of about 100 men into Central Africa seeking slaves and ivory.&lt;ref name= Hinde8&gt;{{harvnb|Hinde|1897|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After plundering several large swathes of land he returned to Zanzibar to consolidate his resources and recruit for his forces. Following this he returned to mainland Africa.&lt;ref name= Hinde9&gt;{{harvnb|Hinde|1897|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:TipputipPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Tippu Tip, [[House of Wonders]] Museum, [[Stone Town]], [[Zanzibar]].]]
Tippu Tip built himself a trading empire that he then translated into [[clove]] plantations on [[Zanzibar]]. [[Abdul Sheriff]] reported that when he left for his twelve years of "empire building" on the mainland, he had no plantations of his own. By 1895, he had acquired "seven 'shambas' [plantations] and 10,000 slaves".&lt;ref&gt;Sheriff, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

He met and helped several famous western explorers of the [[Africa|African continent]], including [[David Livingstone]] and [[Henry Morton Stanley]].&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;Stanley, H. M., 1899, ''Through the Dark Continent'', London: G. Newnes, Vol. One {{ISBN|0486256677}}, Vol. Two {{ISBN|0486256685}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Vol. Two,91–97}} Between 1884 and 1887 he claimed the [[Congo (area)|Eastern Congo]] for himself and for the Sultan of Zanzibar, [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Bargash bin Said el Busaidi]]. In spite of his position as protector of Zanzibar's interests in [[Congo (area)|Congo]], he managed to maintain good relations with the Europeans. When, in August 1886, fighting broke out between the Swahili and the representatives of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] at [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]], al-Murjabī went to the Belgian consul at [[Zanzibar]] to assure him of his "good intentions". Although he was still a force in Central African politics, he could see by 1886 that power in the region was shifting. 

===Governor of the Stanley Falls District===

In early 1887, Stanley arrived in Zanzibar and proposed that Tippu Tip be made governor of the Stanley Falls District in the [[Congo Free State]]. Both Leopold and Sultan [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar]] agreed and on February 24, 1887, Tippu Tip accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett and Brode&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he agreed to man the expedition which Stanley had been commissioned to organize for the purpose of rescuing [[Emin Pasha]] (E. Schnitzer), the German governor of [[Equatoria]] (a region of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Egypt]], today in South Sudan) who had been stranded in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] area as a result of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdi]] uprising in Sudan.{{citation needed|date= January 2016}}

[[File:ZanzibarTipputip.jpg|thumb|upright|Home of Tippu Tip in [[Stone Town]], [[Zanzibar]].]]
Tippu Tip traveled back to the Upper Congo in the company of Stanley, but this time by way of the Atlantic coast and up the Congo River. Aside from its doubtful usefulness, the relief expedition was marred by the near annihilation of its rearguard, a disaster for which Stanley attempted to place the blame on Tippu Tip.

===Congo Arab War===

During his tenure as governor, the [[Congo Arab War|Congo-Arab War]] broke out.  

In 1886, while Tippu Tip was in Zanzibar, a dispute arose between his fort at [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]] and a smaller, nearby [[Congo Free State]] fort led by Captain Walter Deane and Lt. Dubois. Tip's men at the Stanley Falls fort alleged that Deane had stolen a slave woman from an Arab officer there. Deane asserted that the girl had fled after being badly beaten by her master and that he had only offered her refuge. Tip's men attacked the fort and after a four-day siege, the defenders ran out of ammunition and fled, abandoning the fort. The Free State made no counterattack and Tip began to move more men into the Congo, including several Arab slave captains as well as some Congolese leaders, such as [[Gongo Lutete]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton&lt;/ref&gt;
Around 1890/91, he returned to Zanzibar where he retired. His son, [[Sefu bin Hamid|Sefu]], carried on the war in his stead. Tippu Tip wrote his autobiography, which is the first example of this literary genre in the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]]. Dr. Heinrich Brode, who knew him in Zanzibar, transcribed the manuscript into Roman script and translated it into German. It was subsequently translated into English and published in Britain in 1907.

===Death===

Tippu Tip died June 13, 1905, of [[malaria]] (according to Brode) in his home in [[Stone Town]], the main town on the island of Zanzibar.

[[File:PortraitCowie.png|thumb|right|William Clark Cowie.]]
'''William Clark Cowie''' (8 April 1849 in [[Friockheim]], [[Angus, Scotland|Forfarshire]]; – 14 September 1910 in [[Bad Nauheim]]) was a Scottish engineer, mariner, and businessman who helped establish [[North Borneo|British North Borneo]] and was Chairman of the [[North Borneo Chartered Company|British North Borneo Company]].&lt;ref name="cowie chairman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19091015-1.2.49?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=W.%20C.%20COWIE&amp;QT=w,c,cowie&amp;oref=article|title=NORTH BORNEO COMPANY.|work=[[The Straits Times]]|publisher=[[National Library Board, Singapore]]|date=15 October 1909|accessdate=11 May 2017|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Born on 8 April 1849, Cowie was the oldest of four children of the [[flax]] producer David Cowie (1825–1896) and Ann Cowie (1819–1906) in [[Scotland]], where his mother ancestors had lived for generations. His three siblings were Mary, Andson and Edward.&lt;ref name="genealogy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://keldine.ca/phpGedView/individual.php?pid=I2919|title=William Clark Cowie (I2919)|publisher=Kroll &amp; FitzGerald Family Tree|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFMPA1895"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singfreepressb18950809-1.2.20?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=william%20clark%20cowie&amp;QT=william,clark,cowie&amp;oref=article|title=MR. W. CLARK COWIE.|work=The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser|publisher=National Library Board|date=9 August 1895|accessdate=11 May 2017|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moves to [[Arbroath]] on the Scottish east coast. His father was a director in the Wardmill Works of M.C. Thomson &amp; Co., and Cowie trained as an engineer.&lt;ref name="Cowie life"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19020130-1.2.58?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=Cowie%20engineer&amp;QT=cowie,engineer&amp;oref=article|title=MR. W. C. COWIE. (Romantic Tale of the Founder of B. N. B. Co.)|work=The Straits Times|publisher=National Library Board|date=30 January 1902|accessdate=21 May 2017|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received private lessons with the aim of following his grandfather, an engineer in one of the first mills in Scotland.&lt;ref name="SFMPA1895"/&gt;

Around 1873, Cowie married Flora Davidson. They had two children; Flora de Cruz (born 1874) and William Anson Edward Cowie de Cruz (born 1875).&lt;ref name="genealogy"/&gt; His wife died suddenly, aged 25, shortly after the birth of their second child. Cowie then married Amy Constance Pead, and they had two children; Muara Gladys (born 1888) and Andson Gordon (born 1891).&lt;ref name="genealogy"/&gt;

==Career until 1878==
[[File:W.C.Cowie and A.Cook-SultanOfSulu.png|thumb|right|Cowie with the Sultan of Sulu.]]
From April 1870, Cowie was hired as the chief engineer of ''Argyle'' under Captain Peter Orr and left Glasgow for Singapore on his 21st birthday.&lt;ref name="Cowie life"/&gt; He then began to lead life as an adventurer in the [[piracy|pirate]]-infested waters of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. His career as chief engineer for ''Argyle'' ended at the end of 1872 when he was hired by Carl Schomburgk as captain of the Far East, and was commissioned to break the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish]] naval blockade to deal with the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]], who ruled parts of the northern Borneo. His successful efforts forged a deep friendship with the Sultan of Sulu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023151933|title=British North Borneo - An Account of its History, Resources and Native Tribes|author=Owen Rutter|work=Constable &amp; Company Ltd, London|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|year=1922|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,803760,00.html|title=BORNEO: Sunset on the Sulu Sea|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1 July 1946|accessdate=11 May 2017}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cowie convinced the Sultan that to achieve a lasting success in overcoming the Spanish blockade he would need access to a safe harbour; from there he could wait until the shipping route to Sulu was free from Spanish warships. The Sultan permitted Cowie to build a port for his goods at [[Timbang Island]] in Sandakan, creating a British presence in [[Borneo]]. Cowie, along with two friends - Carl Schomburgk and John Dill Ross - founded the [[Labuan Trading Company]], whose main task was to evade the Spanish naval blockade and bring weapons, [[opium]], [[tobacco]] and goods to Sulu. No company ships were ever caught by the Spaniards.

==North Borneo Chartered Company==
[[File:W.C.Cowie and party travelling beyond Railway limit.PNG|thumb|right|Cowie and party travelling beyond the railway limit in [[North Borneo]].]]
[[File:BritishNorthBorneoCharteredCompany.png|thumb|Cowie with officials of the [[British North Borneo Company]].]]
In 1878, [[Baron von Overbeck]] and [[Alfred Dent]] approached Cowie knowing he has friendly with the Sultan of Sulu, asking for help in arranging land concessions in Borneo. Cowie agreed as he had plans to occupy territory as part of the [[British Empire]]. As the political situation was favourable to unilateral treaties, Cowie told the Sultan to leave the Spaniards to his country, helping foreign powers to take parts of the Sultan territory while expecting the Spanish would wish to avoid diplomatic involvement with the interests of other colonial powers. Cowie managed to get the Sultan to surrender his lands in north-eastern Borneo on 22 January 1878 for an annual payment of [[Pound sterling|£]]1,000; which was later given to Overbeck and Dent as they received the full power of government and territorial rights to the possessions in Borneo, including the islands. The rights from this treaty were then transferred to the newly-founded British North Borneo Company in 1881.

In March 1882, Cowie purchased a 40 year-concession for the exploitation of coal fields in [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] in Brunei and founded Cowie Brothers, based in Singapore. From Labuan, he rented a shipyard for 99 years from which he shipped his coal. On 12 July 1887, Cowie handed over his franchise rights to the British North Borneo Company and returned with his family to [[England]]. [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Charles Brooke]], who later acquired the mine, renamed it as "[[Brooketon Colliery|Brooketon]]" (today's Brooke Town).

In 1887, Cowie, together with Edmund Ernest Everett, was commissioned to conduct the company's business in Borneo. Due to the lack of transportation to move goods in the island, Cowie sought a concession to build a rail network from the [[West Coast Division]] to Sandakan. The company initially agreed and appointed Cowie as the Supervisory Board in 1894. In 1896 construction of the [[North Borneo Railway]] began but financial difficulties prevented the company fully connecting to northern Borneo; Cowie was unable to raise the necessary funds especially after company officials refused to borrow more money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/trains/borneo.htm|title=The North Borneo Railway Project|author=Rob Dickinson|publisher=The International Steam Pages|accessdate=11 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328052920/http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/trains/borneo.htm|archivedate=28 March 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, under the patronage of Cowie and his brother Andson, a dictionary for the [[Tausug language|Sulu]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] languages was created.&lt;ref&gt;Andson Cowie, William Clark Cowie: "English-Sulu-Malay Vocabulary: With Useful Sentences, Tables, Etc." Kessinger Publishing's Photocopy Edition, 1893&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appreciated for his extensive knowledge of the territory and the people of Borneo. He rose to the position of Director General in 1897. In [[North Borneo]] in 1898 he met with Mat Salleh to bring an indefinite solution of the so-called [[Mat Salleh Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes18981201-1.2.4?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=W.%20C.%20COWIE&amp;QT=w,c,cowie&amp;oref=article|title=FUTURE OF BORNEO.|work=The Straits Times|publisher=National Library Board|date=1 December 1898|accessdate=11 May 2017|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October 1909, after the retirement of [[Charles Jessel]], he became Chairman of the Supervisory Board.&lt;ref name="cowie chairman"/&gt;

== Death ==
[[File:Memorial to William Clark Cowie.jpg|thumb|Memorial to William Clark Cowie, in Charlton cemetery.]]
Toward the end of his life, Cowie suffered from [[heart disease]]. In July 1910, he travelled to [[German Empire|Germany]] to undergo surgery. After his condition worsened, Cowie died on 14 September 1910 in [[Bad Nauheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19100917-1.2.67?ST=1&amp;AT=search&amp;k=W.%20C.%20COWIE&amp;QT=w,c,cowie&amp;oref=article|title=THE LATE MR. W. C. COWIE.|work=The Straits Times|publisher=National Library Board|date=17 September 1910|accessdate=11 May 2017|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was returned to England and he was buried on 23 September in [[Charlton cemetery]], near to his home, Mayfield, in Blackheath Park, [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]. His gravestone reads:

&lt;center&gt;
{| cellpadding="4" style="border:1px solid #999; border-collapse:collapse; margin:1em 0"
|
''By his instrumentality 31,000 square miles of territory in British North Borneo were added to the British Empire. His indomitable zeal and enthusiasm displayed in the interests of the British North Borneo Company, were the means of raising it to prosperity.''
