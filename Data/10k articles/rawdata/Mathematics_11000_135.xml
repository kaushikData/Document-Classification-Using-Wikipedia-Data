==Definition==
An ''alternant code'' over GF(''q'') of length ''n'' is defined by a parity check matrix ''H'' of [[alternant matrix|alternant]] form ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = α&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, where the α&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct elements of the extension GF(''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;), the ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are further non-zero parameters again in the extension GF(''q''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;) and the indices range as ''i'' from 0 to δ&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, ''j'' from 1 to ''n''.

==Properties==
The parameters of this alternant code are length ''n'', dimension ≥ ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''m''δ and minimum distance ≥&amp;nbsp;δ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

In [[mathematics]], '''ancient Egyptian multiplication''' (also known as '''Egyptian multiplication''', '''Ethiopian multiplication''', '''Russian multiplication''', or '''peasant multiplication'''), one of two multiplication methods used by scribes, was a systematic method for multiplying two numbers that does not require the [[multiplication table]], only the ability to multiply and [[division by 2|divide by 2]], and to [[addition|add]]. It decomposes one of the [[multiplicand]]s (preferably the smaller) into a sum of [[powers of two]] and creates a table of doublings of the second multiplicand. This method may be called '''mediation and duplation''', where [[division by two|mediation]] means halving one number and duplation means doubling the other number. It is still used in some areas.

The second Egyptian multiplication and division technique was known from the [[hieratic]] [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus|Moscow]] and [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus|Rhind Mathematical Papyri]] written in the seventeenth century B.C. by the scribe [[Ahmes]].

Although in ancient Egypt the concept of base 2 did not exist, the algorithm is essentially the same algorithm as [[long multiplication]] after the multiplier and multiplicand are converted to [[Binary numeral system|binary]]. The method as interpreted by conversion to binary is therefore still in wide use today as implemented by [[binary multiplier|binary multiplier circuits]] in modern computer processors.

== The decomposition ==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ians had laid out tables of a great number of powers of two, rather than recalculating them each time.  The decomposition of a number thus consists of finding the powers of two which make it up.  The Egyptians knew empirically that a given power of two would only appear once in a number.  For the decomposition, they proceeded methodically; they would initially find the largest power of two less than or equal to the number in question, subtract it out and repeat until nothing remained.  (The Egyptians did not make use of the number zero in mathematics.)

To find the largest power of 2 keep doubling your answer starting with number 1, for example
:{| style="text-align:right;"
|  1 &amp;times; 2 = ||  '''2'''
|-
|  2 &amp;times; 2 = ||  '''4'''
|-
|  4 &amp;times; 2 = ||  '''8'''
|-
|  8 &amp;times; 2 = || '''16'''
|-
| 16 &amp;times; 2 = || '''32'''
|}

Example of the decomposition of the number 25:
:{|
| The largest power of two less than or equal to 25 || is 16: || style="text-align:center;"| '''25 − 16''' || '''= 9'''.
|-
| The largest power of two less than or equal to  9 || is  8: || style="text-align:center;"|  '''9 −  8''' || '''= 1'''.
|-
| The largest power of two less than or equal to  1 || is  1: || style="text-align:center;"|  '''1 −  1''' || '''= 0'''.
|-
| colspan="3" | 25 is thus the sum of: 16, 8 and 1.
|}

== The table ==
After the decomposition of the first multiplicand, it is necessary to construct a table of powers of two times the second multiplicand (generally the smaller) from one up to the largest power of two found during the decomposition.  In the table, a line is obtained by multiplying the preceding line by two.

For example, if the largest power of two found during the decomposition is 16 (as in the case of the decomposition of 25, see example above), and the second multiplicand is 7,  the table is created as follows:
{| style="text-align:right;width:8em;"
|  1 ||   7
|-
|  2 ||  14
|-
|  4 ||  28
|-
|  8 ||  56
|-
| 16 || 112
|}

== The result ==
The result is obtained by adding the numbers from the second column for which the corresponding power of two makes up part of the decomposition of the first multiplicand.

The main advantage of this technique is that it makes use of only addition, subtraction, and multiplication by two.

== Example ==
Here, in actual figures, is how 238 is multiplied by 13.  The lines are multiplied by two, from one to the next.  A check mark is placed by the powers of two in the decomposition of 238.

{| style="text-align:right;width:8em;border:none;"
|-----
|   || 1 ||  &lt;s&gt;13&lt;/s&gt;
|-----
| ✓ || 2 ||  '''26'''
|-----
| ✓ || 4 ||  '''52'''
|-----
| ✓ || 8 || '''104'''
|-----
|   || 16 || &lt;s&gt;208&lt;/s&gt;
|-----
| ✓ || 32 || '''416'''
|-----
| ✓ || 64 || '''832'''
|-----
| ✓ || 128 || '''1664'''
|-----
|    || colspan="7" | &lt;hr /&gt;
|-----
|    || 238 || '''3094'''
|}

Since 238 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 32 + 64 + 128, distribution of multiplication over addition gives:
{| style="text-align:left;border:none;"
|-----
|238 × 13 ||= (128 + 64 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2) × 13
|-----
|   ||= 128 × 13 + 64 × 13 + 32 × 13 + 8 × 13 + 4 × 13 + 2 × 13
|-----
|   ||= 1664 + 832 + 416 + 104 + 52 + 26
|-----
|   ||= 3094
|}

== Russian peasant multiplication ==
In the Russian peasant method, the powers of two in the decomposition of the multiplicand are found by writing it on the left and progressively halving the left column, discarding any remainder, until the value is 1 (or −1, in which case the eventual sum is negated), while doubling the right column as before. Lines with even numbers on the left column are struck out, and the remaining numbers on the right are added together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Algebra/PeasantMultiplication.shtml Cut the Knot - Peasant Multiplication]&lt;/ref&gt;

{| style="text-align:right;border-collapse:collapse;"
|  style="text-align:left;" colspan="5"|For example, to multiply 238 by 13, the smaller of the numbers (to reduce the number of steps), 13, is written on the left and the larger on the right. The left number is progressively halved (discarding any remainder) and the right one doubled, until the left number is 1:
|-
| || &amp;nbsp;'''13'''&amp;nbsp; ||                            ||  '''238''' ||
|-
| ||  &amp;nbsp;'''6'''&amp;nbsp; || (remainder&amp;nbsp;discarded) ||  '''476''' ||
|-
| ||  &amp;nbsp;'''3'''&amp;nbsp; ||                            ||  '''952''' ||
|-
| ||  &amp;nbsp;'''1'''&amp;nbsp; || (remainder&amp;nbsp;discarded) || '''1904''' ||
|-
|  style="text-align:left;" colspan="5"|Lines with even numbers on the left column are struck out, and the remaining numbers on the right are added, giving the answer as 3094:

|-

==Background information==

Since the 1880s, as formalized in the 1920s, an incomplete view has defined Egyptian multiplication. Springer's on-line encyclopedia summarizes the 1920s view:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Arithmetic |title=Arithmetic |authors=A. A. Bukhshtab, V. I. Pechaev |date= |website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics |publisher= Springer | access-date=5 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004230123/http://eom.springer.de/a/a013260.htm |archive-date=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The art of computation arose and developed long before the times of the oldest written records extant. The oldest mathematical records are the Cahoon papyri and the famous Rhind papyrus, which is believed to date back to about 2000 B.C.. An additive hieroglyphic system for the representation of numbers (cf. Numbers, representations of) enabled the ancient Egyptians to perform addition and subtraction operations on natural numbers in a relatively simple manner. Multiplication was carried out by doubling, i.e. the factors were decomposed into sums of powers of two, the individual summands were multiplied, and the components added. Operations on fractions (cf. Fraction) were reduced in Ancient Egypt to operations on aliquot fractions, i.e. on fractions of the type &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;. More complicated fractions were decomposed with the aid of tables into a sum of aliquot fractions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 1920s conclusions properly decoded an incomplete additive version of Egyptian multiplication. The 1920s historians had not followed up an 1895 report that suggested a second form of multiplication method was present in Ahmes' [[RMP 2/n table]] and RMP 36. The second method included [[aliquot part]]s, as Springer suggested. Aliquot part were reported by F. Hultsch in 1895. Hultsch parsed Ahmes' 2/n table revealing aliquot part patterns. Yet, Springer's Egyptian multiplication encyclopedia entry did not specify critical aliquot part operational details that are required to translate the information into modern arithmetic statements. Sadly, 1920s math historians had skipped over several operational details, such as of F. Hultsch's 1895 aliquot part discussion points, thereby improperly concluding that aliquot part patterns had not been seen in [[Ahmes]]' 2/n table.

The aliquot part story line remained an unsolved issue until the 21st century. Shortly after 2002 the [[Kahun Papyrus]] and the RMP 2/n table revealed two aliquot part operational methods: (1) new inverse multiplication and division methods, and (2) a [[Least common multiple|LCM]] number method written in red (RMP 38). The multiplication and division methods had been hidden Hultsch's aliquot part operational steps, including red auxiliary numbers steps that selected 'optimized' divisors of the LCM. In 2006, the 1895 Hultsch-Bruins method was confirmed from a second direction, detailing a common aliquot method used in the RMP and [[Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll]]. This method scaled the conversion of 1/p, 1/pq, 2/p, 2/pq, n/p and n/pq rational numbers by an LCM m, written as m/m.

Ahmes' aliquot part division steps, sensed in the 19th century, not decoded during the 20th century began to release its secrets after 2001, increasingly by 2006 and 2009 (by RMP 36). Two reasons had misdirected 1920s math historians. The first prematurely closed the subject of Egyptian fraction arithmetic operations by concluding Egyptian multiplication contained only additive steps. Second, scribal division was suggested have followed a non-inverse process called 'single false position'.

Moreover, Springer followed the traditional 1920s definition of Egyptian division by suggesting: "Division was carried out by subtracting from the number to be divided the numbers obtained by successive doubling of the divisor." Math historians call the 1920s proposed Egyptian division method 'single false position', although it was first documented in 800 AD. Later Arab texts improved its root finding 'double false position' method.

Springer's definition of Egyptian division was historically incomplete. To complete a definition of Egyptian division the first six RMP problems, a division by 10 labor rate (defined earlier in the [[Reisner Papyrus]]) set of problems are consulted. In addition, RMP algebra problems and methods are consulted. For example, Ahmes divided 28 by 97, in RMP 31 (confirmed in RMP 34) by solving: x + (2/3 + 1/2 + 1/7) x = 33 and x + (2/3 + 1/2 + 1/7) x = 37 as other vulgar fraction problems were solved in the Kahun Papyrus and [[Rhind Papyrus]] 2/n tables. Aliquot part steps were hidden in theoretical multiplication and division operations for over 100 years.

Ahmes did not mention 'single [[false position]]' in algebra problems, a valid point made by Robins-Shute in 1987. The inaccurate 1920s supposition has been replaced by parsing large vulgar fractions by stripping away the unit fraction notation. For example, 28/97, in RMP 31, and RMP 23 expose Ahmes' LCM multiplication method. In RMP 23 where a 45 multiplier was introduced to solve most of the problem. Yet, to read the complete problem LCM 360 was needed as other RMP algebra problems were solved.

In the 21st century, Ahmes is becoming clearly reported by converting vulgar fractions into optimized unit fractions series within a LCM  method. The LCM method also applied aliquot parts of the denominator to solve 2/97 in RMP 31, and in 2/n table. Ahmes converted 28/97 into two problems, 2/97 and 26/97, selecting two LCM multipliers such that:

# To convert 2 by 97: Ahmes' 2/n table wrote 2/n conversions less than 2/101, he selected a highly divisible number m as an optimizing multiplier m/m. In the 2/97 case 56 was selected, creating a multiplier 56/56 such that the aliquot parts of 56 (28, 14, 8, 7, 4, 2, 1) were introduced into the solution by writing:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{97}*\frac{56}{56} = \frac{112}{56*97} = \frac{97 + 8 + 7}{56*97}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;and,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{97} = \frac{1}{56} + \frac{1}{679} + \frac{1}{776}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
# To convert 26/97 to a unit fraction series Ahmes looked for a multiplier m/m that would increase the numerator to greater than 97. Ahmes found 4/4. By considering the aliquot parts of 4 (4, 2, 1) Ahmes wrote out:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{26}{97}*\frac{4}{4} = \frac{104}{4*97} = \frac{97 + 4 + 2 + 1}{4 * 97}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

such that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{26}{97} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{97} + \frac{1}{194} + \frac{1}{388}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and,
# Ahmes combined steps 2/97 and 26/97 into one Egyptian fraction series by writing:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{28}{97} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{56} + \frac{1}{97} + \frac{1}{194} + \frac{1}{388} + \frac{1}{679} + \frac{1}{776}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

as RMP 36 converted 30/53 by 2/53 + 28/53 with 2/53 scaled by (30/30) and 28/53 scaled by (2/2).
# Egyptian multiplication was an inverse operation to the Egyptian division operation, and vice versa. The modern looking multiplication and division operations had been hidden within the Egyptian fraction notation.

One implication is that 'single false position' represented a 20th-century supposition that failed to historically read Ahmes' additive numerators written in [[multiplication]] problems. Ahmes division operations, described by aliquot part steps in over 20 algebra problems, embed ancient and modern division methods, as inverse to Egyptian multiplications. Egyptian scribes applied several modern theoretical ideas, mostly arithmetic ones, as recorded in Ahmes math tool box.

A second implication is contained in RMP 38. It details Ahmes multiplying 320 ro, one hekat, by 35/11 times 1/10 = 7/22, obtaining 101 + 9/11. Ahmes proved that 101 + 9/11 was correct by multiplying by the inverse of 7/22, or 22/7. Egyptian division generally applied an inverse of Egyptian multiplication in the 1900 BCE [[Akhmim Wooden Tablet]] (AWT) and all other Middle Kingdom mathematical texts. The AWT, for example. divided one hekat, (64/64), by n = 3, 7, 10, 11 and 13. [[Quotient]] and [[remainder]] answers were multiplied by divisor inverses, 1/3, 1/7, 1/10, 1/11 and 1/13, exactly returning the beginning rational number (64/64).

Finally, the red numerator numerators implied by the 2/n table were directly discussed in RMP 36. Ahmes converted, 2/53, 3/53, 5/53, 15/53, 28/53 and 30/53 by two rules. The first rule scaled 2/53*(30/30) = 60/1590, 3/53(20/20) = 60/1060, 5/53*(12/12) = 60/636, 15/53*(4/4) = 60/212, 28/53*(2/2) = 56/106. The second rule converted 30/53 by parsing 30/53 into 2/53 + 28/53. as Ahmes has converted 28/97 by parsing 29/97 into 2/97 + 26/97.

Conclusion: To understand ancient Egyptian multiplication and division, Ahmes' 2/n table aliquot part arithmetic operational steps must be translated into modern arithmetic statements. Ahmes multiplication and division methods were inverse to each other, with RMP 38, and the AWT provided vivid examples of the arithmetic relationships.{{Clarify|date=March 2018}} RMP 36 the details of two rational number conversion methods were detailed, one for n/p, n/pq, 2/p and 2/pq and another for hard to convert n/p rational numbers that were parsed into solvable 2/p and (n-2)/p statements.

Egyptian multiplication contained two aspects, a theoretical side, and a practical side. Egyptian division by a rational number was Egyptian multiplication by an inverse of the rational number. Early Egyptian scholars had not considered the theoretical aspects of the RMP and other Egyptian texts until the 21st century. Theoretical definitions had been hidden in conversion of rational numbers by scaled multipliers applied in an aliquot part rule. RMP 38 multiplied a hekat, stated as 320 ro, by 7/22, and returned 320 ro by multiplying the answer by 22/7. Egyptian division was quotient and remainder based, theoretical aspects that scholars are increasingly studying in terms of aliquot parts, 2/n tables, and other ancient scribal applications after 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19473">In [[mathematics]], an '''Apollonian gasket''' or '''Apollonian net''' is a [[fractal]] generated starting from a triple of circles, each tangent to the other two, and successively filling in more circles, each [[tangent]] to another three. It is named after [[Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]] [[Apollonius of Perga]].&lt;ref&gt;Satija, I. I., ''The Butterfly in the Quantum World: The story of the most fascinating quantum fractal'' ([[Bristol]]: [[IOP Publishing]], 2016), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=toIRDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR63 p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

[[Image:Apollonian gasket.svg|thumb|An example of an Apollonian gasket]]
[[File:Descartes Circles.svg|thumb|Mutually tangent circles. Given three mutually tangent circles ({{color|black|'''black'''}}), there are in general two other circles mutually tangent to them ({{color|red|'''red'''}}).]]
An Apollonian gasket can be constructed as follows. Start with three circles ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, each one of which is tangent to the other two (in the general construction, these three circles can be any size, as long as they have common tangents). Apollonius discovered that there are two other non-intersecting circles, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which have the property that they are tangent to all three of the original circles&amp;nbsp;– these are called ''Apollonian circles''. Adding the two Apollonian circles to the original three, we now have five circles.

Take one of the two Apollonian circles&amp;nbsp;– say ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It is tangent to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so the triplet of circles ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has its own two Apollonian circles. We already know one of these&amp;nbsp;– it is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;– but the other is a new circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.

In a similar way we can construct another new circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; that is tangent to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and another circle ''C''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; from ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This gives us 3 new circles. We can construct another three new circles from ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, giving six new circles altogether. Together with the circles ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''C''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, this gives a total of 11 circles.

Continuing the construction stage by stage in this way, we can add 2·3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; new circles at stage ''n'', giving a total of 3&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 circles after ''n'' stages. In the limit, this set of circles is an Apollonian gasket.

The sizes of the new circles are determined by [[Descartes' theorem]].  Let ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;4) denote the [[curvature]]s of four mutually tangent circles.  Then Descartes' Theorem states

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(k_1 + k_2 + k_3+k_4)^2=2\,(k_1^2+k_2^2+k_3^2+k_4^2).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

The Apollonian gasket has a [[Hausdorff dimension]] of about 1.3057.&lt;ref&gt;McMullen, Curtis T. (3 October 1997). "[http://abel.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/papers/home/text/papers/dimIII/dimIII.pdf Hausdorff dimension and conformal dynamics III: Computation of dimension]", ''Abel.Math.Harvard.edu''. Accessed: 27 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curvature==
The curvature of a circle (bend) is defined to be the inverse of its radius.

* Negative curvature indicates that all other circles are internally tangent to that circle. This is bounding circle.
* Zero curvature gives a line (circle with infinite radius).
* Positive curvature indicates that all other circles are externally tangent to that circle. This circle is in the interior of circle with negative curvature.

==Variations==
[[Image:ApollonianGasket-0_0_1_1-Labels.png|300px|thumb|In the limiting case (0,0,1,1), the two largest circles are replaced by parallel straight lines.  This produces a family of [[Ford circle]]s.]]

[[Image:Apollonian spheres.jpg|thumb|Apollonian sphere packing]]

An Apollonian gasket can also be constructed by replacing one of the generating circles by a straight line, which can be regarded as a circle passing through the point at infinity.

Alternatively, two of the generating circles may be replaced by parallel straight lines, which can be regarded as being tangent to one another at infinity. In this construction, the additional circles form a family of [[Ford circle]]s.

The three-dimensional equivalent of the Apollonian gasket is the [[Apollonian sphere packing]].

==Symmetries==
If two of the original generating circles have the same radius and the third circle has a radius that is two-thirds of this, then the Apollonian gasket has two lines of reflective symmetry; one line is the line joining the centres of the equal circles; the other is their mutual tangent, which passes through the centre of the third circle. These lines are perpendicular to one another, so the Apollonian gasket also has rotational symmetry of degree 2; the symmetry group of this gasket is ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

If all three of the original generating circles have the same radius then the Apollonian gasket has three lines of reflective symmetry; these lines are the mutual tangents of each pair of circles. Each mutual tangent also passes through the centre of the third circle and the common centre of the first two Apollonian circles. These lines of symmetry are at angles of 60 degrees to one another, so the Apollonian gasket also has rotational symmetry of degree 3; the symmetry group of this gasket is ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Links with hyperbolic geometry==
The three generating circles, and hence the entire construction, are determined by the location of the three points where they are tangent to one another. Since there is a [[Möbius transformation]] which maps any three given points in the plane to any other three points, and since Möbius transformations preserve circles, then there is a Möbius transformation which maps any two Apollonian gaskets to one another.

Möbius transformations are also isometries of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]], so in hyperbolic geometry all Apollonian gaskets are congruent. In a sense, there is therefore only one Apollonian gasket, up to (hyperbolic) isometry.

The Apollonian gasket is the limit set of a group of Möbius transformations known as a [[Kleinian group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.brown.edu/~heeoh/AMSKMS.pdf Counting circles and Ergodic theory of Kleinian groups by  Hee Oh Brown.  University Dec 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

If any four mutually tangent circles in an Apollonian gasket all have integer curvature  then all circles in the gasket will have integer curvature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/15837/http:zSzzSzwww.math.tamu.eduzSz~catherine.yanzSz.zSzFileszSzPart4_10.pdf/apollonian-circle-packings-number.pdf Ronald L. Graham, Jeffrey C. Lagarias, Colin M. Mallows, Alan R. Wilks, and Catherine H. Yan; "Apollonian Circle Packings: Number Theory" J. Number Theory, 100 (2003), 1-45]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the equation relating curvatures in an Apollonian gasket, integral or not, is
:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 2ab + 2 a c + 2 a d + 2 bc+2bd+2cd,\,&lt;/math&gt;
it follows that one may move from one quadruple of curvatures to another by [[Vieta jumping]], just as when finding a new   [[Markov number]].
The first few of these integral Apollonian gaskets are listed in the following table. The table lists the curvatures of the largest circles in the gasket. Only the first three curvatures (of the five displayed in the table) are needed to completely describe each gasket&amp;nbsp;– all other curvatures can be derived from these three.

===Symmetry of integral Apollonian circle packings===

====No symmetry====
If none of the curvatures are repeated within the first five, the gasket contains no symmetry, which is represented by symmetry group ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; the gasket described by curvatures (−10,&amp;nbsp;18,&amp;nbsp;23,&amp;nbsp;27) is an example.

====''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry====
Whenever two of the largest five circles in the gasket have the same curvature, that gasket will have ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, which corresponds to a reflection along a diameter of the bounding circle, with no rotational symmetry.

====''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry====
If two different curvatures are repeated within the first five, the gasket will have D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry; such a symmetry consists of two reflections (perpendicular to each other) along diameters of the bounding circle, with a two-fold rotational symmetry of 180°. The gasket described by curvatures (−1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3) is the only Apollonian gasket (up to a scaling factor) to possess D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry.

====''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry====
There are no integer gaskets with ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry.

If the three circles with smallest positive curvature have the same curvature, the gasket will have ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, which corresponds to three reflections along diameters of the bounding circle (spaced 120° apart), along with three-fold rotational symmetry of 120°. In this case the ratio of the curvature of the bounding circle to the three inner circles is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 2\sqrt{3}-3&lt;/math&gt;. As this ratio is not rational, no integral Apollonian circle packings possess this ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, although many packings come close.

====Almost-''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry====
[[Image:ApollonianGasket-15_32_32_33.svg|thumb|left|(−15,&amp;nbsp;32,&amp;nbsp;32,&amp;nbsp;33)]]
[[Image:ApollonianGasket-15_32_32_33-Labels.png|thumb|right|(−15,&amp;nbsp;32,&amp;nbsp;32,&amp;nbsp;33)]]
The figure at left is an integral Apollonian gasket that appears to have ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. The same figure is displayed at right, with labels indicating the curvatures of the interior circles, illustrating that the gasket actually possesses only the ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry common to many other integral Apollonian gaskets.

The following table lists more of these ''almost''-''D''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; integral Apollonian gaskets. The sequence has some interesting properties, and the table lists a factorization of the curvatures, along with the multiplier needed to go from the previous set to the current one. The absolute values of the curvatures of the "a" disks obey the [[recurrence relation]] {{math|1=''a''(''n'') = 4''a''(''n'' − 1) − ''a''(''n'' − 2)}} {{OEIS|A001353}}, from which it follows that the multiplier converges to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\sqrt{3}+2 \approx 3.732050807\dots&lt;/math&gt;

===Sequential curvatures===
[[Image: ApollianGasketNested_2-20.svg|thumb|right|Nested Apollonian gaskets]]
For any integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists an Apollonian gasket defined by the following curvatures: &lt;br /&gt;(−''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1),&amp;nbsp;''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1).  &lt;br /&gt;For example, the gaskets defined by (−2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;7), (−3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;13), (−8,&amp;nbsp;9,&amp;nbsp;72,&amp;nbsp;73), and (−9,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;90,&amp;nbsp;91) all follow this pattern.  Because every interior circle that is defined by ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 can become the bounding circle (defined by&amp;nbsp;−''n'') in another gasket, these gaskets can be [[Hereditarily finite set|nested]].  This is demonstrated in the figure at right, which contains these sequential gaskets with ''n'' running from 2 through 20.

The '''British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science''' ('''BCTCS''') is an organisation that hosts an annual event for [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based researchers in [[theoretical computer science]]. A central aspect of BCTCS is the training of [[PhD]] students.

The purpose of BCTCS is:

# to offer a regular forum in which UK-based researchers in all aspects of theoretical computer science can meet, present research findings, and discuss recent developments in the field;
# to foster an environment within which PhD students undertaking research in theoretical computer science may gain experience in presenting their work in a formal arena, broaden their outlook on the subject, and benefit from contact with established researchers in the community; and
# to provide a platform by which the interests and future well-being of British theoretical computer science may be advanced.

The scope of BCTCS includes all aspects of theoretical computer science, including [[algorithm]]s, [[complexity]], [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]], [[Formal language|formal methods]], [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]], [[Type theory|types]], [[Formal language|languages]] and [[Mathematical logic|logics]].  An emphasis on breadth, together with the inherently mathematical nature of theoretical computer science, means that BCTCS always actively solicits both [[computer scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s as participants, and offers an environment within which the two communities can meet and exchange ideas.

BCTCS is primarily for the benefit of UK-based researchers.  However, to help promote British theoretical computer science in the wider community, BCTCS is also advertised at the international level; participants from outside of the UK are welcome to attend the annual meeting, and the programme of invited talks regularly includes high-profile researchers from outside of the UK.

The first BCTCS meeting was organised in 1985 by [[John V. Tucker]] at the [[University of Leeds]].

The BCTCS operates under the direction of an Organising Committee, with an Executive consisting of a President, Secretary and Treasurer. The current President is [[Faron Moller]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7065">'''Business Process Validation''' (BPV) is the act of verifying that a set of end-to-end business processes function as intended. If there are problems in one or more business applications that support a business process, or in the integration or configuration of those systems, then the consequences of disruption to the business can be serious. A company might be unable to take orders or ship product – which can directly impact company revenue, reputation, and customer satisfaction.  It can also drive additional expenses, as defects in production are much more expensive to fix than if identified earlier. For this reason, a key aim of Business Process Validation is to identify defects early, before new enterprise software&lt;ref&gt;[[Enterprise software]]&lt;/ref&gt; is deployed in production so that there is no business impact and the cost of repairing defects is kept to a minimum.

Note: BPV is unrelated to [[Validation (drug manufacture)]] by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].

During Business Process Validation (BPV), the business process is checked step-by-step using representative data to confirm that all business rules are working correctly and that all underlying transactions are performing properly across every enterprise application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is enterprise application?|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/enterprise_application.html|publisher=Quinstreet Enterprise|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the business process.  When defects are identified, these problems are logged for repair by IT personnel, business analysts or the software vendor, as appropriate.

Business Process Validation can be performed on various timescales, including the following:
* ''Project basis'', when new enterprise software systems (such as [[SAP HANA]]®, mobile, cloud, or web applications) are being deployed for the first time
* ''Periodic basis'', when there are regular monthly, quarterly, or annual updates to enterprise software, such as [[SAP AG|SAP]]®
* ''Continuous basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lights-out Testing for End-to-end Business Process Validation.|url=http://www.worksoft.com/files/resources/Worksoft-Paper-Lights-Out-Testing-For-Business-Process-Validation.pdf|publisher=Worksoft|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', when companies want to validate the readiness of their processes and enterprise systems 24/7/365

== Business Process Validation Methods ==

=== Manual ===
Manual Business Process Validation is where one or more people (typically a cross-functional team) work at keyboards or mobile devices to execute the various business process steps directly in the enterprise software by hand. Defects are manually noted and typically logged in a defect tracking system.

There are several shortcomings to the manual approach. First, since all data is entered by hand, it can be time consuming for subject matter experts and business analysts. These are expensive staff resources that could be deployed on other higher value activities.  Second, manual testing extends project timelines.  This slows the deployment of innovation and makes business users wait longer for cost saving and revenue generating new technology. Third, the manual process is often incomplete, since the time-intensive nature means that IT teams cannot test all business processes,{{cn|date=January 2015}} given their resource constraints.  This lack of coverage introduces technology risk in a company’s business processes.  Finally, if business process validation is done manually by IT teams, then business requirements and processes have to be unambiguously documented in advance, which is a time-consuming task.

=== Automated ===
Automated Business Process Validation relies on software to execute the various business process steps directly in the enterprise software systems in an automated fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Linda|title=The Automated Testing Handbook|url=http://www.softwaretestpro.com/itemassets/4772/automatedtestinghandbook.pdf|publisher=Software Testing Institute|accessdate=9 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907235351/http://www.softwaretestpro.com/ItemAssets/4772/AutomatedTestingHandbook.pdf#|archive-date=2012-09-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BPV software automatically uses standard business process data during the validation, and interprets the correctness of each transaction and result. Defects are automatically noted and logged.

With [[Worksoft|BPV software]], the business process must first be "captured" in the BPV software system so that it can be automatically executed. This amounts to performing the business process once in the enterprise system with the BPV software running in the background to capture the process. Once the business process is captured, BPV software allows the business process automation to be modified with very little effort.  Some BPV software have object-oriented designs that allow sub-processes to be shared among different end-to-end business processes, and business process automation can be easily copied and modified. This last feature is particularly helpful when companies have variations of business processes across geographies or business units.  For example, an order shipment process in Europe may differ slightly from the same process in North America because there are differences in compliance requirements and Bills of Lading.  There is no need to capture the second process end-to-end&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End to End Business Scenarios|url=http://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BPX/End+to+End+Business+Scenarios|publisher=SAP|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for automation purposes. The first process can easily be copied and modified in the BPV software. This enables companies to efficiently and quickly build their portfolio of business processes for automated validation.

An ancillary benefit is that once the business process is correctly captured, BPV software allows a complete and accurate description of the business process to be printed. This documentation is generated automatically with no additional effort and is useful for training, regulatory compliance, and other purposes. It is available on-demand and is typically very accurate because it is based on the most recent versions of systems and business practices. 
BPV software largely avoids the shortcomings of manual business process validation. The automation software can be configured to validate business processes on a 24/7/365 basis, if desired by the user. The frequency of automation enables any defects in underlying business systems and interfaces to be detected and repaired quickly, before business users are impacted.

Automated business process validation is a way to ensure that a company’s business processes continue to work, even when mission critical enterprise systems change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35886">In [[mathematics]], '''Capelli's identity''', named after {{harvs|first=Alfredo|last=Capelli|authorlink=Alfredo Capelli|year=1887|txt}}, is an analogue of the formula det(''AB'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;det(''A'')&amp;nbsp;det(''B''), for certain matrices with noncommuting entries, related to the [[Lie algebra representation|representation theory of the Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_n&lt;/math&gt;. It can be used to relate an invariant ''ƒ'' to the invariant Ω''ƒ'', where Ω is [[Cayley's Ω process]].

==Statement==
Suppose that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; for  ''i'',''j'' = 1,...,''n'' are commuting variables. Write  ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; for the polarization operator 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{ij} = \sum_{a=1}^n x_{ia}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{ja}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The  Capelli identity states that the following differential operators, expressed as determinants, are equal:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{vmatrix}  E_{11}+n-1 &amp; \cdots &amp;E_{1,n-1}&amp; E_{1n} \\ \vdots&amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots&amp;\vdots\\  E_{n-1,1} &amp; \cdots &amp; E_{n-1,n-1}+1&amp;E_{n-1,n} \\  E_{n1} &amp; \cdots &amp; E_{n,n-1}&amp; E_{nn} +0\end{vmatrix} =
\begin{vmatrix}  x_{11} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{1n} \\ \vdots&amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\  x_{n1} &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{nn} \end{vmatrix}
\begin{vmatrix} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{11}} &amp; \cdots &amp;\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1n}} \\ \vdots&amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\ \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n1}} &amp; \cdots &amp;\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{nn}}  \end{vmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Both sides are differential operators. The determinant on the left has non-commuting entries, and is expanded with all terms preserving their "left to right" order. Such a determinant is often called a ''column-determinant'', since it can be obtained by the column expansion of the determinant starting from the first column. It can be formally written as

:&lt;math&gt;\det(A) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma)  A_{\sigma(1),1}A_{\sigma(2),2}\cdots A_{\sigma(n),n},&lt;/math&gt;

where in the product first come the elements from the first column, then from the second and so on.  The determinant on the far right is [[Cayley's omega process]], and the one on the left is the Capelli determinant.

The operators ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; can be written in a matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt;E = X D^t,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E, X, D&lt;/math&gt; are matrices with elements ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; respectively. If all elements in these matrices would be commutative then  clearly &lt;math&gt;\det(E) = \det(X) \det(D^t)&lt;/math&gt;. The Capelli identity shows that despite noncommutativity there exists a "quantization" of the formula above. The only price for the noncommutativity is a small correction: &lt;math&gt;(n-i)\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; on the left hand side. For generic noncommutative matrices formulas like

:&lt;math&gt;\det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)&lt;/math&gt;
do not exist, and the notion of the 'determinant' itself does not make sense for generic noncommutative matrices. That is why the Capelli identity still holds some mystery, despite many proofs offered for it. A very short proof does not seem to exist. Direct verification of the statement can be given as an exercise for ''n'' = 2, but is already long for ''n'' = 3.

==Relations with representation theory==

Consider the following slightly more general context. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are two integers and &lt;math&gt;x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;i = 1, \dots, n, \ j = 1, \dots, m&lt;/math&gt;, be commuting variables. Redefine  &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; by almost the same formula:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{ij} = \sum_{a=1}^m x_{ia}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{ja}}.&lt;/math&gt;

with the only difference that summation index &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; ranges from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. One can easily see that such operators satisfy the commutation relations:

:&lt;math&gt;[ E_{ij}, E_{kl}] = \delta_{jk}E_{il}-  \delta_{il}E_{kj}.~~~~~~~~~&lt;/math&gt;

Here  &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[commutator]] &lt;math&gt;ab-ba&lt;/math&gt;. These are the same commutation relations which are satisfied by the matrices &lt;math&gt;e_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; which have zeros everywhere except the position &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt;, where 1 stands. (&lt;math&gt;e_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes called ''matrix units''). Hence we conclude that the correspondence &lt;math&gt;\pi : e_{ij} \mapsto E_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; defines a [[Lie algebra representation|representation of the Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_n&lt;/math&gt; in the vector space of polynomials of &lt;math&gt;x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Case ''m'' = 1 and representation ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ===

It is especially instructive to consider the special case ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1; in this case we have ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i1''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is abbreviated as ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{ij} =  x_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for the polynomials of the first degree it is seen that:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{ij} x_k =  \delta_{jk} x_i. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the action of &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; restricted to the space of first-order polynomials is exactly the same as the action of ''matrix units''  &lt;math&gt;e_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; on vectors in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. So, from the representation theory point of view, the subspace of polynomials of first degree is a [[Representation theory|subrepresentation]] of the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_n&lt;/math&gt;, which we identified with the standard representation in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Going further, it is seen that the differential operators &lt;math&gt;E_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; preserve the degree of the polynomials, and hence the polynomials of each fixed degree form a  [[Representation theory|subrepresentation]] of the Lie algebra  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_n&lt;/math&gt;. One can see further that the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree ''k'' can be identified with the symmetric tensor power &lt;math&gt;S^k \mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; of the standard representation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C^n&lt;/math&gt;.

One can also easily identify the [[highest weight]] structure of these representations. The monomial &lt;math&gt;x^k_1&lt;/math&gt; is a [[highest weight vector]], indeed: &lt;math&gt;E_{ij} x^k_1=0&lt;/math&gt; for ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''j''. Its highest weight equals to (''k'',&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;,0), indeed: &lt;math&gt;E_{ii} x^k_1= k \delta_{i1}x^k_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Such representation is sometimes called bosonic representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Similar formulas &lt;math&gt;E_{ij} =  \psi_{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial \psi_{j}} &lt;/math&gt; define the so-called fermionic representation, here &lt;math&gt;\psi_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are anti-commuting variables. Again polynomials of ''k''-th degree form an irreducible subrepresentation which is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k \mathbb{C}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. anti-symmetric tensor power of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Highest weight of such representation is (0,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;0). These representations for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'' are [[fundamental representation]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Capelli identity for ''m'' = 1 ====

Let us return to the Capelli identity. One can prove the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\det(E+(n-i)\delta_{ij}) = 0, \qquad  n&gt;1  &lt;/math&gt;

the motivation for this equality is the following: consider &lt;math&gt; E^c_{ij} =  x_i p_j&lt;/math&gt; for some commuting variables &lt;math&gt;x_i, p_j&lt;/math&gt;. The matrix &lt;math&gt; E^{c} &lt;/math&gt; is of rank one and hence its determinant is equal to zero. Elements of matrix &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; are defined by the similar formulas, however, its elements do not  commute. The Capelli identity shows that the commutative identity: &lt;math&gt; \det(E^{c})=0 &lt;/math&gt; can be preserved for the small price of correcting matrix &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; (n-i)\delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;.

Let us also mention that similar identity can be given for the characteristic polynomial:

:&lt;math&gt;\det(t+E+(n-i)\delta_{ij}) =  t^{[n]}+ \mathrm{Tr}(E)t^{[n-1]}, ~~~~  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t^{[k]}=t(t+1) \cdots (t+k-1)&lt;/math&gt;.  The commutative counterpart of this is a simple fact that for rank&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 matrices the characteristic polynomial contains only the first and the second coefficients.

Let us consider an example for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; \begin{vmatrix} t+ E_{11}+1 &amp; E_{12} \\
E_{21}  &amp; t+ E_{22} 
\end{vmatrix}
=\begin{vmatrix} t+ x_1 \partial_1+1 &amp; x_1 \partial_2 \\
x_2 \partial_1  &amp; t+ x_2 \partial_2
\end{vmatrix} \\[8pt]
&amp; = (t+ x_1 \partial_1+1 ) ( t+ x_2 \partial_2)- x_2 \partial_1 x_1 \partial_2 \\[6pt]
&amp; = t(t+1)+ t( x_1 \partial_1 + x_2 \partial_2) 
+x_1 \partial_1 x_2 \partial_2+x_2 \partial_2 -
 x_2 \partial_1 x_1 \partial_2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using

: &lt;math&gt;\partial_1 x_1= x_1\partial_1+1,\partial_1 x_2= x_2\partial_1, x_1x_2=x_2x_1 &lt;/math&gt;

we see that this is equal to:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; {} \quad t(t+1)+ t( x_1 \partial_1 + x_2 \partial_2) 
+x_2 x_1 \partial_1  \partial_2+x_2 \partial_2 -
 x_2  x_1 \partial_1 \partial_2 - x_2   \partial_2 \\[8pt]
&amp; = t(t+1)+ t( x_1 \partial_1 + x_2 \partial_2)=t^{[2]}+ t\,\mathrm{Tr}(E).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The universal enveloping algebra  &lt;math&gt;U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)&lt;/math&gt;  and its center  ===
An interesting property of the Capelli determinant is that it commutes with all operators ''E&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', that is, the [[commutator]] &lt;math&gt;[ E_{ij}, \det(E+(n-i)\delta_{ij})]=0&lt;/math&gt; is equal to zero. It can be generalized:

Consider any elements ''E&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' in any ring, such that they satisfy the commutation relation &lt;math&gt;[ E_{ij}, E_{kl}] = \delta_{jk}E_{il}-  \delta_{il}E_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;, (so they can be differential operators above, matrix units ''e&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' or any other elements) define elements ''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\det(t+E+(n-i)\delta_{ij}) =  
t^{[n]}+\sum_{k=n-1,\dots,0} t^{[k]} C_k, ~~~~~ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t^{[k]}=t(t+1)\cdots(t+k-1),&lt;/math&gt;

then:

* elements ''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' commute with all elements ''E&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''
* elements ''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be given by the formulas similar to the commutative case:
:&lt;math&gt;C_k=\sum_{I=(i_1&lt;i_2&lt;\cdots&lt;i_k)} \det(E+(k-i)\delta_{ij})_{II},&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. they are sums of principal  minors of the matrix ''E'', modulo the ''Capelli correction''  &lt;math&gt;+(k-i)\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular element ''C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the Capelli determinant considered above.

These statements are interrelated with the Capelli identity, as will be discussed below,  and similarly to it the  direct few lines short proof does not seem to exist, despite the simplicity of the formulation.

The [[universal enveloping algebra]]

:&lt;math&gt;U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)&lt;/math&gt;

can defined as an algebra generated by

:''E&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''

subject to the relations

:&lt;math&gt;[ E_{ij}, E_{kl}] = \delta_{jk}E_{il}-  \delta_{il}E_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;

alone. The proposition above  shows that elements ''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''belong to the  [[Center (algebra)|center]] of &lt;math&gt;U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown that they actually are free generators of the center of &lt;math&gt;U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)&lt;/math&gt;. They are sometimes called ''Capelli generators''. The Capelli identities for them will be discussed below.

Consider an example for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{}\quad \begin{vmatrix} t+ E_{11}+1 &amp; E_{12} \\
E_{21}  &amp; t+ E_{22} 
\end{vmatrix}
&amp; = (t+ E_{11}+1)(t+ E_{22})-E_{21}E_{12} \\
&amp; = t(t+1)+t(E_{11}+E_{22})+E_{11}E_{22}-E_{21}E_{12}+E_{22}. 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is  immediate to check that element  &lt;math&gt;(E_{11}+E_{22})&lt;/math&gt; commute with &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. (It corresponds to an obvious fact that the identity matrix commute with all other matrices). More instructive is  to check commutativity of the second element  with  &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. Let us do it for &lt;math&gt;E_{12}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
[E_{12}, E_{11}E_{22}-E_{21}E_{12}+E_{22}]
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
=[E_{12}, E_{11}] E_{22} + E_{11} [E_{12}, E_{22}] -
[E_{12}, E_{21}] E_{12} - E_{21}[E_{12},E_{12}] +[E_{12},E_{22}]
 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
=-E_{12} E_{22} + E_{11} E_{12} -
(E_{11}- E_{22}) E_{12} - 0 +E_{12}
 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
=-E_{12} E_{22} + E_{22} E_{12}  +E_{12}= -E_{12} + E_{12}=0.
 &lt;/math&gt;

We see that the naive determinant &lt;math&gt; E_{11}E_{22}-E_{21}E_{12}&lt;/math&gt; will not commute with &lt;math&gt;E_{12} &lt;/math&gt; and the Capelli's correction &lt;math&gt; +E_{22}&lt;/math&gt; is essential to ensure the centrality.

===General ''m'' and  dual pairs ===

Let us return to the general case:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{ij} = \sum_{a=1}^m x_{ia}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{ja}},&lt;/math&gt;
for arbitrary ''n'' and ''m''. Definition of operators ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; can be written in a matrix form: &lt;math&gt;E = X D^t&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n \times n &lt;/math&gt; matrix  with elements  &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;;  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n \times m &lt;/math&gt; matrix  with elements  &lt;math&gt;x_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;;  &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n \times m &lt;/math&gt; matrix  with elements  &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Capelli–Cauchy–Binet identities'''

For general ''m'' matrix ''E'' is given as product of the two rectangular matrices: ''X'' and transpose to ''D''. If all elements of these matrices would commute then one knows that the determinant of ''E'' can be expressed by the so-called [[Cauchy–Binet formula]] via [[major and minor|minor]]s of ''X'' and ''D''. An analogue of this formula also exists for matrix ''E'' again for the same mild price of the correction &lt;math&gt; E \rightarrow (E+(n-i)\delta_{ij}) &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\det(E+(n-i)\delta_{ij}) = \sum_{I=(1\le i_1&lt;i_2&lt;\cdots &lt;i_n \le m)} \det(X_{I}) \det(D^t_{I})&lt;/math&gt;,

In particular (similar to the commutative case): if ''m&lt;n'', then &lt;math&gt;\det(E+(n-i)\delta_{ij}) =0 &lt;/math&gt;; if ''m=n'' we return to the identity above.

Let us also mention that similar to the commutative case (see [[Minor (linear algebra)#Applications|Cauchy–Binet for minors]]), one can express not only the determinant of ''E'', but also its minors via minors of ''X'' and ''D'':

:&lt;math&gt;\det(E+(s-i)\delta_{ij})_{KL} = \sum_{I=(1\le i_1&lt;i_2&lt; \cdots &lt;i_s \le m)} \det(X_{KI}) \det(D^t_{IL})&lt;/math&gt;,

Here ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''l''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;), are arbitrary multi-indexes; as usually  &lt;math&gt;M_{KL} &lt;/math&gt; denotes a submatrix of ''M'' formed by the elements ''M&lt;sub&gt; k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;l&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''. Pay attention that the Capelli correction now contains ''s'', not ''n'' as in previous formula.  Note that for ''s=1'', the correction (''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''i'') disappears and we get just the definition of ''E'' as a product of ''X'' and transpose to ''D''. Let us also mention that for generic ''K,L'' corresponding minors do not commute with all elements ''E&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', so the Capelli identity exists not only for central elements.

As a corollary of this formula and the one for the characteristic polynomial in the previous section let us mention the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\det(t+E+(n-i)\delta_{ij}) = t^{[n]}+\sum_{k=n-1,\dots,0}t^{[k]} \sum_{I,J}  \det(X_{IJ}) \det(D^t_{JI}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; I=(1\le i_1&lt;\cdots &lt;i_k \le n),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; J=(1\le j_1&lt; \cdots &lt;j_k \le n) &lt;/math&gt;. This formula is similar to the commutative case, modula &lt;math&gt;+(n-i)\delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; at the left hand side and ''t&lt;sup&gt;[n]&lt;/sup&gt;'' instead of ''t&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' at the right hand side.

'''Relation to dual pairs'''

Modern interest in these identities has been much stimulated by  [[Roger Evans Howe|Roger Howe]] who considered them in his theory of [[Howe duality|reductive dual pairs]] (also known as Howe duality). To make the first contact with these ideas, let us look more precisely on operators  &lt;math&gt;E_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;.  Such operators preserve the degree of polynomials. Let us look at the polynomials of degree 1: &lt;math&gt;E_{ij} x_{kl} = x_{il} \delta_{jk} &lt;/math&gt;, we see that index ''l'' is preserved. One can see that from the representation theory point of view  polynomials of the first degree can be identified with direct sum of the representations &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{C}^n &lt;/math&gt;, here  ''l''-th subspace (''l=1...m'') is spanned by &lt;math&gt; x_{il} &lt;/math&gt;, ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''.  Let us give another look on this vector space:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n \oplus \cdots \oplus \mathbb{C}^n = \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^m  .&lt;/math&gt;

Such point of view gives the first hint  of symmetry between ''m'' and ''n''. To deepen this idea let us consider:

:&lt;math&gt;E_{ij}^\text{dual} = \sum_{a=1}^n x_{ai}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{aj}}.&lt;/math&gt;

These operators  are given by the same formulas as  &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; modula renumeration &lt;math&gt;i \leftrightarrow j&lt;/math&gt;, hence by the same arguments we can deduce that &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}^\text{dual} &lt;/math&gt; form a [[Lie algebra representation|representation of the Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_m&lt;/math&gt; in the vector space of polynomials of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;. Before going further we can mention the following property: differential operators &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}^\text{dual} &lt;/math&gt; commute with differential operators &lt;math&gt;E_{kl} &lt;/math&gt;.

The Lie group  &lt;math&gt;GL_n \times  GL_m &lt;/math&gt; acts on the vector space &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^m  &lt;/math&gt; in a natural way. One can show that the corresponding action of Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}_n \times \mathfrak{gl}_m&lt;/math&gt; is given by the differential operators &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}~~~~&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; E_{ij}^\text{dual} &lt;/math&gt; respectively. This explains the commutativity of these operators.

The following deeper properties actually hold true:

* The only differential operators  which commute with &lt;math&gt;E_{ij}~~~~&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials in &lt;math&gt; E_{ij}^\text{dual} &lt;/math&gt;, and vice versa.
* Decomposition of the vector space of polynomials into a direct sum of tensor products of irreducible representations of &lt;math&gt;GL_n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;  GL_m &lt;/math&gt; can be given as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} [x_{ij}] = S(\mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^m) = \sum_D \rho_n^D \otimes\rho_m^{D'}. &lt;/math&gt;

The summands are indexed by the [[Young diagram]]s ''D'', and representations &lt;math&gt;\rho^D&lt;/math&gt; are mutually non-isomorphic. And diagram &lt;math&gt;{D} &lt;/math&gt; determine &lt;math&gt; {D'} &lt;/math&gt; and vice versa.

* In particular the representation of the big group  &lt;math&gt; GL_n \times  GL_m &lt;/math&gt;  is multiplicity free, that is each irreducible representation occurs only one time.

One easily observe the strong similarity to [[Schur–Weyl duality]].

==Generalizations==

Much work have been done on the identity and its generalizations. Approximately two dozens of mathematicians and physicists contributed to the subject, to name a few: [[Roger Evans Howe|R. Howe]], [[Bertram Kostant|B. Kostant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |  title=The Capelli Identity, tube domains, and the generalized Laplace transform | year=1991 | first1=B. | last1=Kostant |author1-link=Bertram Kostant | first2=S. | last2=Sahi |journal=Advances in Mathematics | volume=87 | pages=71–92 |  doi=10.1016/0001-8708(91)90062-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |doi=10.1007/BF01232451|  title=Jordan algebras and Capelli identities| year=1993 | first1=B. | last1=Kostant |author1-link=Bertram Kostant

It seems  historically the first generalizations were obtained by [[Herbert Westren Turnbull]] in 1948,&lt;ref name="Turnbull48"&gt;{{citation |  title=Symmetric determinants and the Cayley and Capelli operators | year=1948 | first1= Herbert Westren | last1=Turnbull |journal=[[Proc.

The other generalizations can be divided into several patterns. Most of them are based on the Lie algebra point of view.

still the list of references is incomplete. It has been believed for quite a long time that the identity is intimately related with semi-simple Lie algebras. Surprisingly a new purely algebraic generalization of the identity have been found in 2008&lt;ref name="Sokal" /&gt; by S. Caracciolo, A. Sportiello, A. D. Sokal  which has nothing to do with any Lie algebras.

=== Turnbull's identity for symmetric matrices ===
Consider ''symmetric'' matrices 
:&lt;math&gt;
X=\begin{vmatrix}  
x_{11} &amp; x_{12} &amp;   x_{13} &amp;\cdots &amp; x_{1n} \\ 
x_{12} &amp; x_{22} &amp;   x_{23} &amp;\cdots &amp; x_{2n} \\
x_{13} &amp; x_{23} &amp;   x_{33} &amp;\cdots &amp; x_{3n} \\
\vdots&amp; \vdots  &amp; \vdots   &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots \\
x_{1n} &amp; x_{2n} &amp;   x_{3n} &amp;\cdots &amp; x_{nn}
\end{vmatrix},
D=\begin{vmatrix}  
2 \frac{\partial} { \partial x_{11} } &amp; \frac{\partial} {\partial x_{12}} &amp; \frac{\partial} { \partial x_{13}} &amp;\cdots &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1n} } \\[6pt]
\frac{\partial} {\partial x_{12} } &amp; 2 \frac{\partial} {\partial x_{22}} &amp; \frac{\partial} { \partial x_{23}} &amp;\cdots &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2n} } \\[6pt]
\frac{\partial} {\partial x_{13} } &amp; \frac{\partial} {\partial x_{23}} &amp; 2\frac{\partial} { \partial x_{33}} &amp;\cdots &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{3n} } \\[6pt]
\vdots&amp; \vdots  &amp; \vdots   &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{\partial} {\partial x_{1n} } &amp; \frac{\partial} {\partial x_{2n}} &amp; \frac{\partial} { \partial x_{3n}} &amp;\cdots &amp; 2 \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{nn} }
\end{vmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Herbert Westren Turnbull]]&lt;ref name="Turnbull48"/&gt; in 1948 discovered the following identity:
:&lt;math&gt;\det(XD+(n-i)\delta_{ij}) = \det(X) \det(D) &lt;/math&gt;

Combinatorial proof can be found in the paper,&lt;ref name="FoataZeilberger"/&gt; another proof and amusing generalizations in the paper,&lt;ref name="Sokal"/&gt; see also discussion below.

=== The Howe–Umeda–Kostant–Sahi identity  for antisymmetric matrices ===
Consider ''antisymmetric'' matrices 
:&lt;math&gt;
X=\begin{vmatrix}  
0       &amp; x_{12} &amp;   x_{13} &amp;\cdots &amp; x_{1n} \\ 
-x_{12} &amp; 0      &amp;   x_{23} &amp;\cdots &amp; x_{2n} \\
-x_{13} &amp; -x_{23} &amp;   0     &amp;\cdots &amp; x_{3n} \\
\vdots&amp; \vdots  &amp; \vdots   &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots \\
-x_{1n} &amp; -x_{2n} &amp;   -x_{3n} &amp;\cdots &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix},
D=\begin{vmatrix}  
0 &amp; \frac{\partial} {\partial x_{12}} &amp; \frac{\partial} {\partial  x_{13}} &amp;\cdots &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1n} } \\[6pt]
-\frac{\partial} { \partial x_{12} } &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{\partial} { \partial x_{23}} &amp;\cdots &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2n} } \\[6pt]
-\frac{\partial} {\partial x_{13} } &amp; -\frac{\partial} {\partial x_{23}} &amp; 0 &amp;\cdots &amp; \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{3n} } \\[6pt]
\vdots&amp; \vdots  &amp; \vdots   &amp;\ddots &amp; \vdots \\[6pt]
-\frac{\partial} {\partial x_{1n} } &amp; -\frac{\partial} {\partial x_{2n}} &amp; -\frac{\partial} {\partial  x_{3n}} &amp;\cdots &amp; 0 
\end{vmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Then
:&lt;math&gt;\det(XD+(n-i)\delta_{ij}) = \det(X) \det(D). &lt;/math&gt;

=== The Caracciolo–Sportiello–Sokal identity  for Manin matrices ===
Consider two matrices ''M'' and ''Y'' over some associative ring which satisfy the following condition

:&lt;math&gt;
[M_{ij}, Y_{kl}]= -\delta_{jk} Q_{il} ~~~~~
&lt;/math&gt;

for some elements ''Q&lt;sub&gt;il&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Or ”in words”: elements in ''j''-th column of ''M'' commute with elements in ''k''-th row of Y unless ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'', and in this case commutator of the elements ''M&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Y&lt;sub&gt;kl&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends only on ''i'', ''l'', but does not depend on ''k''.

Assume that ''M'' is a [[Manin matrix]] (the simplest example is the matrix with commuting elements).

Then for the square matrix case

:&lt;math&gt;\det(MY+ Q \,\mathrm{diag}(n-1, n-2, \dots , 1,0) ) = \det(M) \det(Y). 
 ~~~~~~~  &lt;/math&gt;

Here ''Q'' is a matrix with elements ''Q&lt;sub&gt;il&lt;/sub&gt;'', and diag(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0) means the diagonal matrix with the elements ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0 on the diagonal.

See &lt;ref name="Sokal" /&gt; proposition 1.2' formula (1.15) page 4, our ''Y'' is transpose to their&amp;nbsp;''B''.

Obviously the original Cappeli's identity the particular case of this identity. Moreover from this identity one can see that in the original Capelli's identity one can consider elements

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{\partial} {\partial x_{ij} } + f_{ij}(x_{11},\dots,x_{kl},\dots)
&lt;/math&gt;

for arbitrary functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the identity still will be true.

=== The Mukhin–Tarasov–Varchenko identity and the Gaudin model ===

==== Statement ====
Consider matrices ''X'' and ''D'' as in Capelli's identity, i.e. with elements &lt;math&gt; x_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \partial_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; at position&amp;nbsp;(''ij'').

Let ''z'' be another formal variable (commuting  with ''x'').  Let ''A'' and ''B'' be some matrices which elements are  complex numbers.

:&lt;math&gt;
\det\left(  \frac{\partial}{\partial_z} - A  - X \frac{1}{z-B} D^t   \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;
={\det}^\text{calculate as if all commute}_{\text{Put all }x\text{ and }z\text{ on the left, while all derivations on the right}}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(  \frac{\partial}{\partial_z} - A  - X \frac{1}{z-B} D^t   \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the first determinant is understood (as always) as column-determinant of a matrix with non-commutative entries. The determinant on the right is calculated as if all the elements commute, and putting all ''x'' and ''z'' on the left, while derivations on the right. (Such  recipe is called a [[Wick ordering]] in the [[quantum mechanics]]).

==== The Gaudin quantum integrable system and Talalaev's theorem  ====
The matrix

:&lt;math&gt;
L(z) =  A  + X \frac{1}{z-B} D^t   
&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[Lax pair|Lax matrix]] for the Gaudin quantum integrable spin chain system. D. Talalaev solved the long-standing problem of the explicit solution for the full set of the quantum commuting conservation laws for the Gaudin model, discovering the following theorem.

Consider
:&lt;math&gt;
\det\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial_z} - L(z) \right) =\sum_{i=0}^n H_i(z) \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial_z}\right)^i. 
&lt;/math&gt;

Then for all ''i,j,z,w''

:&lt;math&gt;
[ H_i(z), H_j(w) ]= 0, ~~~~~~~~
&lt;/math&gt;
i.e.  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') are generating functions in ''z'' for the  differential operators in ''x'' which all commute. So they provide quantum commuting conservation laws for the Gaudin model.

=== Permanents, immanants, traces – "higher Capelli identities" ===

The original Capelli identity is a statement about determinants. Later, analogous identities were found for [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]]s, [[immanant]]s and traces.
Based on the  combinatorial approach paper by S.G. Williamson &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |  title= Symmetry operators, polarizations, and a generalized Capelli identity | year=1981 | first1=S. | last1=Williamson |journal=Linear &amp; Multilinear Algebra | volume=10 | pages=93–102 |  doi=10.1080/03081088108817399 |  issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was one of the first results in this direction.

==== Turnbull's identity for permanents of  antisymmetric matrices ====
Consider the antisymmetric matrices ''X'' and ''D'' with elements ''x&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' and corresponding derivations, as in the case of the HUKS identity above.

Then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{perm}(X^tD -(n-i)\delta_{ij}) = \mathrm{perm}^\text{Calculate as  if all commute}_{\text{Put all }x\text{ on the left, with all derivations on the right}}
( X^t D). 
  &lt;/math&gt;

Let us cite:&lt;ref name="FoataZeilberger"/&gt;  "...is stated without proof at the end of Turnbull’s paper".   The authors themselves follow Turnbull – at the very end of their
paper they write:

"Since the proof of this last identity is very similar to the proof of Turnbull’s symmetric analog (with a slight twist), we leave it as an instructive and pleasant exercise for the reader.".

The identity is deeply analyzed in paper

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">In [[network science]], a '''critical point''' is a value of [[average degree]], which separates random networks that have a  [[giant component]] from those that do not (i.e. it separates a network in a subcritical regime from one in a supercritical regime).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barabási|first1=Albert-László|title=Network Science|url=http://barabasi.com/networksciencebook/|chapter= Ch. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering a random network with an average degree &lt;math&gt;&lt;k&gt;&lt;/math&gt; the critical point is

&lt;math&gt;&lt;k&gt; = 1&lt;/math&gt;

where the average degree is defined by the fraction of the number of edges (&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;) and nodes (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) in the network, that is &lt;math&gt;&lt;k&gt;=\frac{2e}{N}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Stochastic Processes in Random Graphs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puhalskii|first1=Anatolii A.|title=Stochastic Processes in Random Graphs|journal=The Annals of Probability|date=2005|volume=33|pages=337–412|doi=10.1214/009117904000000784|arxiv=math/0402183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subcritical regime ==

In a subcritical regime the network has no [[giant component]], only small clusters. In the special case of &lt;math&gt;&lt;k&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt; the network is not connected at all. A random network is in a subcritical regime until the average degree exceeds the critical point, that is the network is in a subcritical regime as long as

&lt;math&gt;&lt;k&gt; &lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="remco"&gt;{{cite book|last1=van der Hofstad|first1=Remco|title=Random Graphs and Complex Networks|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~rhofstad/NotesRGCN2011.pdf|chapter= Ch. 4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supercritical regime ==

In a supercritical regime, in contrary to the subcritical regime the network has a [[giant component]]. In the special case of &lt;math&gt;&lt;k&gt;=N-1&lt;/math&gt; the network is complete (see [[complete graph]]). A random network is in a supercritical regime if the average degree exceeds the critical point, that is if

&lt;math&gt;&lt;k&gt; &gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="remco" /&gt;

== Example on different regimes ==

[[File:Network in different regimes.png|thumb|An illustration on the network evolution of a speed dating event]]
Consider a [[speed dating]] event as an example, with the participants as the nodes of the network. At the beginning of the event, people do not know anyone else. In this case the network is in a '''subcritical regime''', that is, there is no [[giant component]] in the network (even if there are a couple of people, who know each other). After the first round of dates, everyone knows exactly one other person. There is still no giant component in the network, the average degree is &lt;math&gt;&lt;k&gt; = 1&lt;/math&gt;, that is, everyone knows one other person on average, meaning that the network is at the '''critical point'''. After the second round, the [[average degree]] of the network exceeds the critical point, and the [[giant component]] is present. In this specific case, the average degree is &lt;math&gt;&lt;k&gt; = 2&lt;/math&gt;. The network is in a '''supercritical regime'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6539">In [[mathematics]], the problem of '''differentiation of integrals''' is that of determining under what circumstances the [[average|mean value]] [[integral]] of a suitable [[function (mathematics)|function]] on a small [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]] of a point approximates the value of the function at that point.  More formally, given a space ''X'' with a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] ''μ'' and a [[metric space|metric]] ''d'', one asks for what functions ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' does

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r \to 0} \frac1{\mu \big( B_{r} (x) \big)} \int_{B_{r} (x)} f(y) \, \mathrm{d} \mu(y) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for all (or at least ''μ''-[[almost all]]) ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''?  (Here, as in the rest of the article, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') denotes the [[open ball]] in ''X'' with ''d''-[[radius]] ''r'' and centre ''x''.)  This is a natural question to ask, especially in view of the heuristic construction of the [[Riemann integral]], in which it is almost implicit that ''f''(''x'') is a "good representative" for the values of ''f'' near ''x''.

== Theorems on the differentiation of integrals ==

=== Lebesgue measure ===

One result on the differentiation of integrals is the [[Lebesgue differentiation theorem]], as proved by [[Henri Lebesgue]] in 1910.  Consider ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[Lebesgue measure]] ''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; on ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then, for any [[locally integrable function]] ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', one has

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r \to 0} \frac1{\lambda^{n} \big( B_{r} (x) \big)} \int_{B_{r} (x)} f(y) \, \mathrm{d} \lambda^{n} (y) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-almost all points ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is important to note, however, that the measure zero set of "bad" points depends on the function ''f''.

=== Borel measures on R&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ===

The result for Lebesgue measure turns out to be a special case of the following result, which is based on the [[Besicovitch covering theorem]]: if ''μ'' is any [[locally finite measure|locally finite]] [[Borel measure]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is locally integrable with respect to ''μ'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r \to 0} \frac1{\mu \big( B_{r} (x) \big)} \int_{B_{r} (x)} f(y) \, \mathrm{d} \mu (y) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''μ''-almost all points ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Gaussian measures ===

The problem of the differentiation of integrals is much harder in an infinite-dimensional setting.  Consider a [[separable space|separable]] [[Hilbert space]] (''H'',&amp;nbsp;〈&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;〉) equipped with a [[Gaussian measure]] ''γ''.  As stated in the article on the [[Vitali covering theorem]], the Vitali covering theorem fails for Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.  Two results of David Preiss (1981 and 1983) show the kind of difficulties that one can expect to encounter in this setting:
* There is a Gaussian measure ''γ'' on a separable Hilbert space ''H'' and a Borel set ''M''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''H'' so that, for ''γ''-almost all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''H'',
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r \to 0} \frac{\gamma \big( M \cap B_{r} (x) \big)}{\gamma \big( B_{r} (x) \big)} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
* There is a Gaussian measure ''γ'' on a separable Hilbert space ''H'' and a function ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''H'',&amp;nbsp;''γ'';&amp;nbsp;'''R''') such that
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r \to 0} \inf \left\{ \left. \frac1{\gamma \big( B_{s} (x) \big)} \int_{B_{s} (x)} f(y) \, \mathrm{d} \gamma(y) \right| x \in H, 0 &lt; s &lt; r \right\} = + \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

However, there is some hope if one has good control over the [[covariance]] of ''γ''. Let the covariance operator of ''γ'' be ''S''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''H'' given by

:&lt;math&gt;\langle Sx, y \rangle = \int_{H} \langle x, z \rangle \langle y, z \rangle \, \mathrm{d} \gamma(z),&lt;/math&gt;

or, for some [[countable set|countable]] [[orthonormal basis]] (''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''H'',

:&lt;math&gt;Sx = \sum_{i \in \mathbf{N}} \sigma_{i}^{2} \langle x, e_{i} \rangle e_{i}.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1981, Preiss and Jaroslav Tišer showed that if there exists a constant 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i + 1}^{2} \leq q \sigma_{i}^{2},&lt;/math&gt;

then, for all ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''H'',&amp;nbsp;''γ'';&amp;nbsp;'''R'''),

:&lt;math&gt;\frac1{\mu \big( B_{r} (x) \big)} \int_{B_{r} (x)} f(y) \, \mathrm{d} \mu(y) \xrightarrow[r \to 0]{\gamma} f(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where the convergence is [[convergence in measure]] with respect to ''γ''.  In 1988, Tišer showed that if

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i + 1}^{2} \leq \frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}}{i^{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''α''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;⁄&amp;nbsp;2, then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac1{\mu \big( B_{r} (x) \big)} \int_{B_{r} (x)} f(y) \, \mathrm{d} \mu(y) \xrightarrow[r \to 0]{} f(x),&lt;/math&gt;

for ''γ''-almost all ''x'' and all ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''H'',&amp;nbsp;''γ'';&amp;nbsp;'''R'''), ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

As of 2007, it is still an open question whether there exists an infinite-dimensional Gaussian measure ''γ'' on a separable Hilbert space ''H'' so that, for all ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''H'',&amp;nbsp;''γ'';&amp;nbsp;'''R'''),

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r \to 0} \frac1{\gamma \big( B_{r} (x) \big)} \int_{B_{r} (x)} f(y) \, \mathrm{d} \gamma(y) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''γ''-almost all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''H''.  However, it is conjectured that no such measure exists, since the ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; would have to decay very rapidly.

{{redirect|Domain (mathematics)|other uses of "domain"|Domain (disambiguation)#Mathematics{{!}}Domain (disambiguation)}}
[[Image:Codomain2.SVG|right|thumb|280px|Illustration showing ''f'', a function from the pink domain ''X'' to the blue codomain ''Y''. The yellow oval inside ''Y'' is the [[Image (mathematics)|image of ''f'']]. Both the image and the codomain are sometimes called the [[range (mathematics)|range of ''f'']].]]

In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[naive set theory]], the '''domain of definition''' (or simply the '''domain''') of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is the set of "input" or [[Argument of a function|argument]] values for which the function is defined.  That is, the function provides an "output"  or [[Value (mathematics)|value]] for each member of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paley |first=Hiram |authorlink=Hiram Paley |first2=Paul M. |last2=Weichsel |title=A First Course in Abstract Algebra |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |year=1966 |page=16 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, the set of values the function takes on as output is termed the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the function, which is sometimes also referred to as the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of the function.

For instance, the domain of [[cosine]] is the set of all [[real numbers]], while the domain of the [[square root]] consists only of numbers greater than or equal to 0 (ignoring [[complex numbers]] in both cases).

If the domain of a function is a subset of the real numbers and the function is represented in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], then the domain is represented on the ''X''-axis.
[[Image:Square_root_0_25.svg|thumb|250px|Graph of the real-valued [[square root]] function, ''f''(''x'') = {{radic|''x''}}, whose domain consists of all nonnegative real numbers]]

== Formal definition ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Complex analysis]] --&gt;
Given a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f \colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the '''domain''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;; the set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is the [[codomain]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  In the expression &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the '''argument''' and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''value'''.  One can think of an argument as a member of the domain that is chosen as an "input" to the function, and  the value as the "output" when the function is applied to that member of the domain.

The [[image (mathematics)|image]] (sometimes called the [[range (mathematics)|range]]) of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all values assumed by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for all possible &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;; this is the set &lt;math&gt;\left\{ f(x) | x \in X \right\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The image of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be the same set as the codomain or it can be a [[proper subset]] of it.  It is, in general, smaller than the codomain; it is the whole codomain if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[surjective function]].

A well-defined function must map every element of its domain to an element of its codomain. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined by
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
has no value for &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the set of all [[real number]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be its domain. In cases like this, the function is either defined on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; or the "gap is plugged" by explicitly defining &lt;math&gt;f(0)&lt;/math&gt;.
If we extend the definition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
1/x&amp;x\not=0\\
0&amp;x=0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
then ''f'' is defined for all real numbers, and its domain is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Any function can be restricted to a [[subset]] of its domain. The [[Restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of &lt;math&gt;g \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, is written &lt;math&gt;\left. g \right|_{S} \colon S \to B&lt;/math&gt;.

== Natural domain ==
The '''natural domain''' of a function is the maximum set of values for which the function is defined, typically within the reals but sometimes among the integers or complex numbers. For instance the natural domain of square root is the non-negative reals when considered as a real number function. When considering a natural domain, the set of possible values of the function is typically called its range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Calculus: basic concepts and applications|first1=Robert A.|last1=Rosenbaum|first2=G. Philip|last2=Johnson|page=60|year=1984|isbn=0-521-25012-9|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Domain of a partial function ==
{{further|Partial function#Domain of a partial function}}
There are two distinct meanings in current mathematical usage for the notion of the domain of a [[partial function]] from ''X'' to ''Y'', i.e. a function from a subset ''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; of ''X'' to ''Y''. Most mathematicians, including [[recursion theory|recursion theorists]], use the term "domain of ''f''" for the set ''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; of all values ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') is defined. But some, particularly [[category theory|category theorists]], consider the domain to be ''X'', irrespective of whether ''f''(''x'') exists for every ''x'' in&amp;nbsp;''X''.

== Category theory ==

In [[category theory]] one deals with [[morphisms]] instead of functions.  Morphisms are arrows from one object to another.  The domain of any morphism is the object from which an arrow starts.  In this context, many set theoretic ideas about domains must be abandoned or at least formulated more abstractly.  For example, the notion of restricting a morphism to a subset of its domain must be modified.  See [[subobject]] for more.

== Real and complex analysis ==

In [[calculus|real]] and [[complex analysis]], a domain is an [[open set|open]] [[connected space|connected]] subset of a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] vector space.

In [[partial differential equation]]s, a domain is an open connected subset of the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, where the problem is posed, i.e., where the unknown function(s) are defined.

== More examples ==
* As a partial function  from the real numbers the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* If one defines the square root of a negative number ''x'' as the [[complex number]] ''z'', with positive imaginary part, such that ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', the function &lt;math&gt; x\mapsto \sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all real numbers ''x''.
* Function &lt;math&gt;\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}&lt;/math&gt; is defined for all &lt;math&gt;x \neq \frac{\pi}{2} + k \pi, k = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:ExpIPi.gif|thumb|right|The [[exponential function]]  {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;''}} can be defined as the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''z''|''N''}})&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, as {{mvar|N}} approaches infinity, and thus {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iπ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the limit of {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''iπ''|''N''}})&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

It can be seen that as {{mvar|N}} gets larger {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''iπ''|''N''}})&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} approaches a limit of −1.]]

In mathematics, '''Euler's identity'''{{#tag:ref | The term "Euler's identity" (or "Euler identity") is also used elsewhere to refer to other concepts, including the related general formula {{math|e&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} cos ''x'' + ''i'' sin ''x''}},&lt;ref&gt;Dunham, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uKOVNvGOkhQC&amp;pg=PR24 p. xxiv].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Riemann zeta function#Euler product formula|Euler product formula]].&lt;ref name=EOM&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Stepanov | first=S.

where
:{{mvar|e}} is [[E (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]], the base of [[natural logarithm]]s,

:{{mvar|&amp;pi;}} is [[pi]], the [[ratio]] of the circumference of a [[circle]] to its diameter.  
Euler's identity is named after the Swiss mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]]. It is considered to be an example of [[mathematical beauty]], perhaps a supreme example as it shows a profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics.

==Mathematical beauty==
Euler's identity is often cited as an example of deep [[mathematical beauty]].&lt;ref name=Gallagher2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=Mathematics: Why the brain sees maths as beauty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26151062|accessdate=26 December 2017|website=''[[BBC News Online]]''|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the basic [[arithmetic]] operations occur exactly once each: [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]]. The identity also links five fundamental [[mathematical constant]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Paulos, 1992, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[0 (number)|number 0]].
* The [[1 (number)|number 1]].
* The [[pi|number {{mvar|&amp;pi;}}]] ({{mvar|&amp;pi;}} = 3.141...).
* The [[e (mathematical constant)|number {{math|''e''}}]] ({{math|''e''}} =  2.718...), which occurs widely in [[mathematical analysis]].
* The [[imaginary unit|number {{math|''i''}}]], the imaginary unit of the [[complex number]]s.

Furthermore, the equation is given in the form of an expression set equal to zero, which is common practice in several areas of mathematics.

[[Stanford University]] mathematics professor [[Keith Devlin]] has said, "like a Shakespearean sonnet that captures the very essence of love, or a painting that brings out the beauty of the human form that is far more than just skin deep, Euler's equation reaches down into the very depths of existence".&lt;ref&gt;Nahin, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GvSg5HQ7WPcC&amp;pg=PA1 p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  And [[Paul Nahin]], a professor emeritus at the [[University of New Hampshire]], who has written a book dedicated to [[Euler's formula]] and its applications in [[Fourier analysis]], describes Euler's identity as being "of exquisite beauty".&lt;ref&gt;Nahin, 2006, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics writer [[Constance Reid]] has opined that Euler's identity is "the most famous formula in all mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;Reid, chapter ''e''.&lt;/ref&gt;  And [[Benjamin Peirce]], a noted American 19th-century [[philosopher]], mathematician, and professor at [[Harvard University]], after proving Euler's identity during a lecture, stated that the identity "is absolutely paradoxical; we cannot understand it, and we don't know what it means, but we have proved it, and therefore we know it must be the truth".&lt;ref&gt;Maor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eIsyLD_bDKkC&amp;pg=PA160 p. 160], and Kasner &amp; Newman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ad8hAx-6m9oC&amp;pg=PA103 p. 103–104].&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll of readers conducted by ''[[The Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' in 1990 named Euler's identity as the "most beautiful theorem in mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;Wells, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In another poll of readers that was conducted by ''[[Physics World]]'' in 2004, Euler's identity tied with [[Maxwell's equations]] (of [[electromagnetism]]) as the "greatest equation ever".&lt;ref&gt;Crease, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the brains of sixteen mathematicians found that the "emotional brain" (specifically, the medial [[orbitofrontal cortex]], which lights up for beautiful music, poetry, pictures, etc.) lit up more consistently for Euler's identity than for any other formula.&lt;ref&gt;Zeki et al., 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two books in [[popular mathematics]] have been published about Euler's identity. One is ''A Most Elegant Equation: Euler's formula and the beauty of mathematics'', by David Stipp (2017). Another is ''Euler's Pioneering Equation: The most beautiful theorem in mathematics'', by [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin Wilson]] (2018).

==Explanations==
===Geometric explanation===
Consider any complex number {{math|''z''}} represented in [[polar coordinates]]:

: &lt;math&gt;z = r e^{i\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying {{math|''z''}} by {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} gives another complex number which has the same magnitude as {{math|''z''}}, rotated around the origin by the angle {{math|''θ''}}:

: &lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}\cdot z = r e^{i(\varphi+\theta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this expression, set {{math|''z'' {{=}} 1}} (that is, {{math| ''r'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math| ''φ'' {{=}} 0}}); also set {{math|''θ'' {{=}} ''π''}}. This corresponds to the rotation of the number {{math|1}} around the origin by {{math|''π''}} radians (180°), which gives {{math|−1}}. In symbols, this is

: &lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi}\cdot 1 = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

Euler's identity immediately follows.

===Analytic explanation===
[[File:Euler's formula.svg|thumb|right|Euler's formula for a general angle]]
Euler's identity is a [[special case]] of [[Euler's formula]] from [[complex analysis]], which states that for any [[real number]] {{math|''x''}},

: &lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos x +  i\sin x&lt;/math&gt;

where the inputs of the [[trigonometry|trigonometric functions]] sine and cosine are given in [[radian]]s.

In particular, when {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''π''}},

: &lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} = \cos \pi +  i\sin \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

Since

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \pi = -1&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \pi = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that

: &lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} = -1 + 0 i,&lt;/math&gt;

which yields Euler's identity:

: &lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} +1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
Euler's identity is also a special case of the more general identity that the {{mvar|n}}th [[roots of unity]], for {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}, add up to 0:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{2 \pi i \frac{k}{n}} = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

Euler's identity is the case where {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}.

In another field of mathematics, by using [[quaternion]] exponentiation, one can show that a similar identity also applies to quaternions. Let {{math|{{mset|''i'', ''j'', ''k''}}}} be the basis elements; then,

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{1}{\sqrt 3}(i \pm j \pm k)\pi} + 1 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

In general, given [[real numbers|real]] {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}, then,

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\left(a_1i+a_2j+a_3k\right)\pi} + 1 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

For [[octonions]], with real {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}, and with the octonion basis elements {{math|{{mset|''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''i''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;}}}},

:&lt;math&gt;e^{\left(a_1i_1+a_2i_2+\dots+a_7i_7\right)\pi} + 1 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

==History==
It has been claimed that Euler's identity appears in his monumental work of mathematical analysis published in 1748, ''[[Introductio in analysin infinitorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Conway &amp; Guy, p. 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is questionable whether this particular concept can be attributed to Euler himself, as he may never have expressed it.&lt;ref name=Sandifer2007&gt;Sandifer, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while Euler did write in the ''Introductio'' about what we today call [[Euler's formula]],&lt;ref&gt;Euler, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; which relates {{mvar|e}} with cosine and sine terms in the field of complex numbers, the English mathematician [[Roger Cotes]] (who died in 1716, when Euler was only 9 years old) also knew of this formula and Euler may have acquired the knowledge through his Swiss compatriot [[Johann Bernoulli]].&lt;ref name=Sandifer2007/&gt;

[[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin Wilson]] states the following.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text= 
We've seen how it [Euler's identity] can easily be deduced from results of Johann Bernoulli and Roger Cotes, but that neither of them seems to have done so. Even Euler does not seem to have written it down explicitly – and certainly it doesn't appear in any of his publications – though he must surely have realized that it follows immediately from his identity [i.e. [[Euler's formula]]], {{nowrap|''e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} cos ''x'' + ''i'' sin ''x''}}. Moreover, it seems to be unknown who first stated the result explicitly&amp;hellip;.

[[File:Regular_polygon_7_annotated.svg|thumb|262px|The [[regular polygon|regular]] [[heptagon]] cannot be constructed using only a [[straightedge and compass construction]]; this can be proven using the field of [[constructible number]]s.]]
{{Algebraic structures}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''field'''  is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] on which [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are defined, and behave as the corresponding operations on  [[rational number|rational]] and [[real number]]s do. 
A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]], which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]] and many other areas of mathematics.

The best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].

The relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[Évariste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] can not be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.

Fields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.

== Definition ==
Informally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' ⋅ ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|''&amp;minus;a''}} for all elements ''a'', and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for every nonzero element ''b''. This allows us to consider also the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]] {{math|''a'' &amp;minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, via defining:
:{{math|1=''a'' &amp;minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&amp;minus;''b'')}},
:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' · ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

===Classic definition===

Formally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation|operations]] called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&amp;nbsp;181}}&lt;/ref&gt; An operation is a mapping that associates an element of the set to ''every'' pair of its elements. The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the ''sum'' of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} and denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the ''product'' of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a''⋅''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''field axioms''. In these axioms,  {{math|''a'', ''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{math|''F''}}.

* ''[[Associativity]]'' of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}  and  {{math|1=''a'' · (''b'' · ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') · ''c''}}.
* ''[[Commutativity]]'' of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' · ''b'' = ''b'' · ''a''}}.
* ''[[Additive identity|Additive]]'' and ''[[multiplicative identity]]'': there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' · 1 = ''a''}}.
* ''[[Additive inverse]]s'': for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|−''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (−''a'') = 0}}.
* ''[[Multiplicative inverse]]s'': for every {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|1/''a''}},  or {{math|{{sfrac|1|''a''}}}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' · ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}.
* ''[[Distributivity]]'' of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'')}}.

This may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''; it is an [[abelian group]] under the addition, with 0 as [[additive identity]]; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under the multiplication, with 1 as [[multiplicative identity]]; the multiplication is distributive over the addition.

===Alternative definition===
Fields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses, respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=§II.2}}. See also [[Heyting field]].&lt;/ref&gt; One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation, (the multiplicative inverse} and two constants 1 and –1, since {{math|1=0 = 1 + (–1)}} and {{math|1=–a = (–1) a}}.

==Examples==

===Rational numbers===
Rational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.
They are numbers that can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]
{{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[integer]]s, and {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}. The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|−''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac b a \cdot \frac a b  = \frac{ba}{ab} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac a b \cdot \left(\frac c d + \frac e f \right) \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac a b  \cdot \left(\frac c d  \cdot \frac f f + \frac e f \cdot \frac d d \right) \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{a}{b} \cdot \left(\frac{cf}{df} + \frac{ed}{fd}\right) = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{cf + ed}{df} \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \frac{acf}{bdf} +  \frac{aed}{bdf} = \frac{ac}{bd} +  \frac{ae}{bf} \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \frac a b \cdot \frac c d + \frac a b \cdot \frac e f.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Real and complex numbers===

[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]

{{main|Real number| Complex number}}
The [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions
:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,
where {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1}}.
Addition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces
:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ac''−''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}
It is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with Cartesian coordinates given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &amp;ndash;less intuitively&amp;ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.

===Constructible numbers===
[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]
{{main|Constructible numbers}}
 
In antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through ''B'' in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly &lt;math&gt;h=\sqrt p&lt;/math&gt; from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.

Not all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3] 2&lt;/math&gt; is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.

In addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,

: {{math|1=''A'' · (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' · ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' · ''B'' + ''A'' · ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.

This field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.

==Elementary notions==
In this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.

===Consequences of the definition===
One has {{math|1=''a'' · 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=−''a'' = (−1) · ''a''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|–1}}.

If {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;0, then 
{{math|1=0 = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅0 = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;(''ab'') = (''a''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].

===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===
The axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.

Similarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{nowrap|(''F'' \ {0}, ·)}} or just {{math|''F'' \ {0}}} or {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}. 

A field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|⟨''F'', +, ·, −, &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 0, 1⟩}} of type {{math|⟨2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0⟩}}, such that {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not defined, {{math|⟨''F'', +, –, 0⟩}} and 
{{math|⟨''F'' ∖ {0}, ·, &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⟩}} are abelian groups, and 
· is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|−''a''}} and {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.

The requirement {{math|1 ≠ 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.

Every finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).

===Characteristic===
In addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' ⋅ ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum
:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of  {{math|''F''}}.)

If there is no positive integer such that
:{{math|1=''n'' ⋅ 1 = 0}},
then {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=§I.2, p.&amp;nbsp;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.
For example, the field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.

If {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' ⋅ ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}. This implies that 
:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}},
since all other [[binomial coefficient]]s appearing in the [[binomial formula]] are divisible by {{math|''p''}}. Here, {{math|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; := ''a'' ⋅ ''a'' ⋅ ... ⋅ ''a''}} ({{math|''p''}} factors) is the {{math|''p''}}-th power, i.e., the {{math|''p''}}-fold product of the element {{math|''a''}}. Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]
:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &amp;rarr; ''F'', ''x'' ⟼ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;}}
is compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.

===Subfields and prime fields===
A ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}. Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 ∊ ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' ∊ ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' · ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|–''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.

[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &amp;rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}. All field homomorphisms are [[injective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=section I.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''f''}} is also [[surjective]], it is called an isomorphism (or the fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called isomorphic).

A field is called a [[prime field]] if it has no proper (i.e., strictly smaller) subfields. Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to {{math|'''Q'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=p. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finite fields==
{{main|Finite field}}
''Finite fields'' (also called ''Galois fields'') are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a field with four elements. Its subfield {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements 1 ≠ 0.

[[File:Clock_group.svg|thumb|In modular arithmetic modulo&amp;nbsp;12, 9&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 since 9&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;13 in {{math|'''Z'''}}, which divided by 12 leaves remainder&amp;nbsp;1. Since 12 is not a prime, {{math|'''Z'''/12'''Z'''}} is not a field, though.]]
The simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using [[modular arithmetic]]. For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic "modulo {{math|''n''}}" means to work with the numbers
:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' − 1}.}}
The addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''⋅''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''⋅''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by  {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Every finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A field with {{math|1=''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial 
:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''x''}}.
Such a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.

==History==
Historically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;omega;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}
(with {{math|&amp;omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[François Viète]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation
:{{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}
for a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Évariste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.

In 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''Körper'', which means "body" or "corpus" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term "field" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.
|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&amp;pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&amp;pi;}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].

==Constructing fields==

===Constructing fields from rings===
A [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=§II.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = ±1}}.

In the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, {{math|(0)}} and {{math|''R''}}. Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].

Given a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

====Field of fractions====

Given an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}  are in {{math|''R''}}, and  {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and  {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}.&lt;/math&gt;
It is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=k}^\infty a_i x^i \ (k \in \Z, a_i \in F)&lt;/math&gt;
over a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &amp;ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.

====Residue fields====
In addition the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field ''E'') is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} can not be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field
:{{math|1={{nowrap begin}}''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''p''(''X'')).{{nowrap end}}}}
This field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation
:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.
For example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol i, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(i) = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') ∊ '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf R[X]/\left(X^2 + 1\right) \ \stackrel \cong \longrightarrow \ \mathbf C.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constructing fields within a bigger field===
Fields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to ''E''. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' ⊂ ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.

The [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field extensions===
{{See|Glossary of field theory}}
The notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' ⊂ ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by
:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},
and read "{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}".

A basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.
Extensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; / '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.

====Algebraic extensions====
A pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]
:{{math|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ··· + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}},
with {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; 0}}. 
For example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in  {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation
:{{math|1=''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0}}.
A field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \ \ a_k \in E.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &amp;minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.

====Transcendence bases====
The above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.

Once again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.

A subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, §14, No. 2, Theorem 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.

===Closure operations===
A field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]
:{{math|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ··· + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''F'', ''n'' &gt; 0}},
has a solution {{math|''x'' ∊ ''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation
:{{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0}}
does not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).

By the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.

Any field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{Overline|''F''}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{Overline|''F''}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, §7.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields with additional structure==
Since fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.

===Ordered fields===
{{main|Ordered field}}
A field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}} and {{math|''xy''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation
:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
only has the solution {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, §2.3, Corollary 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of all possible orders on a fixed field ''F'' is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] W(''F'') of [[quadratic form]]s over ''F'', to '''Z'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=§22, Theorem 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression
:{{nowrap|1 + 1 + ··· + 1}}
whose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements.  Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.

[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]
An ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &amp;hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.

Since every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.

The [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].

===Topological fields===
Another refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set ''F'' is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' ↦ &amp;minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' ↦ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function
:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' × ''F'' → '''R''',}}
that measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.

The [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the "gaps" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a "gap" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p''/''q''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} is as small as desired.
The following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero [[sequence]], i.e., a sequence whose limit (for {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;∞}}) is zero.

{| class="wikitable"
! Field !! Metric !! Completion !! zero sequence
|-
| {{math|{{math|'''Q'''}}}} || {{math|1=&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x'' &amp;minus; ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} (usual [[absolute value]]) || '''R''' || {{math|1/''n''}}
|-
| {{math|'''Q'''}} 
|| obtained using the [[p-adic valuation|''p''-adic valuation]], for a prime number {{math|''p''}}

|| {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}

|| obtained using the {{math|''t''}}-adic valuation
|| {{math|''F''((''t''))}}
|| {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}
|}

The field {{math|{{math|'''Q'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is used in number theory and [[p-adic analysis|{{math|''p''}}-adic analysis]]. The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is called the field of [[complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gouvêa|1997|loc=§5.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Local fields====
The following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields. On the other hand, these two fields, also called Archimedean local fields, share little similarity with the local fields considered here, to a point that {{harvtxt|Cassels|1986|loc=p. vi}} calls them "completely anomalous".&lt;/ref&gt;
* finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (local fields of characteristic zero)
* finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}, the field of Laurent series over {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (local fields of characteristic {{math|''p''}}).

These two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' ∈ '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''t'' ∈ '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:
* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.
* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname {Gal}\left(\mathbf Q_p\left(p^{1/p^\infty}\right)\right) \cong \operatorname {Gal}\left(\mathbf F_p((t))\left(t^{1/p^\infty}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Differential fields===
[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=§1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.

==Galois theory==
{{main|Galois theory}}

Galois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form
:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},
where {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.

For a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|σ : ''F'' → ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=§VI.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (can not be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} can ''not'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{\ }&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&amp;ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]:
:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &amp;ge; 5}}).

The [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras
:{{math|''F''  ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; ''F'' ≅ ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.
This fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[Étale fundamental group]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invariants of fields==

Basic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gouvêa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''C'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).

===Model theory of fields===
In [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is
:{{math|&amp;phi;(''E'')}} = "for any {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).
The [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&amp;phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=§2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted by
:{{math|ulim&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;rarr;∞&lt;/sub&gt; ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}},
since it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}: [[Łoś's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&amp;phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{overline|'''F'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are algebraically closed by Łoś's theorem. For the same reason, they both have characteristic zero. Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ulim}_{p \to \infty} \overline \mathbf F_p \cong \mathbf C.&lt;/math&gt;
The Ax–Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})
:{{math|ulim&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ ulim&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;((''t''))}}.
In addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function  {{math|exp : ''F'' &amp;rarr; ''F''&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The absolute Galois group===
For fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} can be shown to be the [[Prüfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by
:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; / '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.
A description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]]. The cohomological study of such representations is done using [[Galois cohomology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Serre|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Brauer group]], which is classically defined as the group of [[central simple algebra|central simple {{math|''F''}}-algebras]], can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely
:{{math|1=Br(''F'') = H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''F'', '''G'''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

===K-theory===
[[Milnor K-theory]] is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;K_n^M(F) = F^\times \otimes \cdots \otimes F^\times / \langle x \otimes (1-x)\mid x \in F \smallsetminus \{0, 1\} \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]], proved around 2000 by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;K_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \mu_l^{\otimes n}).&lt;/math&gt;
[[Algebraic K-theory]] is related to the group of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'') = ''F''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'') agrees with K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.

==Applications==

===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===
[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. They are used in computer graphics.]]
If {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}, then the [[equation]] 
:{{math|1=''ax'' = ''b''}}
has a unique solution {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''F''}}, namely {{math|1=''x'' = ''b''/''a''}}. This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=§3.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.

[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===

[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]
A widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing
:{{math|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a'' ⋅ ''a'' ⋅ ... ⋅ ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}})
in a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation
:{{math|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''}}.
In [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form
:{{math|1=''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.

Finite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].

===Geometry: field of functions===
[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]
[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:
:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' ⋅ ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') ⋅ ''g''(''x'')}}}}.
This makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].

For having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},&lt;/math&gt;
form a field, called field of functions.

This occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of  [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.

The [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.

The function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=§13, Theorem A}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.

===Number theory: global fields===

[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].
They are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).

[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]
[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(ζ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where {{math|ζ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}ζ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|ζ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ 1}} for all {{math|''m'' &lt; ''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation
:{{math|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Local fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse–Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, whose solutions can easily be described.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker–Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field
:{{math|'''Q'''(&amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n'' &amp;ge; 2)}}
obtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, &lt;math&gt;F=\mathbf Q(\sqrt{-d})&lt;/math&gt;, {{math|''d'' &gt; 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.

==Related notions==

In addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &amp;ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.

There are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]] form a Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division rings===
[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball can not be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]

Dropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.&lt;/ref&gt; The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical. It can be deduced from the [[hairy ball theorem]] illustrated at the right.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6523">In [[algebraic geometry]], a morphism ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' of [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s is a '''finite morphism''' if ''Y'' has an [[open cover]] by [[affine schemes]]
:&lt;math&gt;V_i = \mbox{Spec} \; B_i&lt;/math&gt;

such that for each ''i'',

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(V_i) = U_i&lt;/math&gt;

is an open affine subscheme Spec ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the restriction of ''f'' to ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, which induces a [[ring homomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;B_i \rightarrow A_i,&lt;/math&gt;

makes ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; a [[finitely generated module]] over ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Hartshorne (1977), section II.3.&lt;/ref&gt; One also says that ''X'' is '''finite''' over ''Y''.

In fact, ''f'' is finite if and only if for ''every'' open affine open subscheme ''V'' = Spec ''B'' in ''Y'', the inverse image of ''V'' in ''X'' is affine, of the form Spec ''A'', with ''A'' a finitely generated ''B''-module.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 01WG | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01WG}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, for any [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', &lt;math&gt;\text{Spec}(k[t,x]/(x^n-t)) \to \text{Spec}(k[t])&lt;/math&gt;is a finite morphism since &lt;math&gt;k[t,x]/(x^n-t) \cong k[t]\oplus k[t]\cdot x \oplus\cdots \oplus k[t]\cdot x^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;k[t]&lt;/math&gt;-modules. Geometrically, this is obviously finite since this a ramified n-sheeted cover of the affine line which degenerates at the origin. By contrast, the inclusion of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; − 0 into ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is not finite. (Indeed, the [[Laurent polynomial]] ring ''k''[''y'', ''y''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;] is not finitely generated as a module over ''k''[''y''].) This restricts our geometric intuition to surjective families with finite fibers.

== Properties of finite morphisms ==
* The composition of two finite morphisms is finite.
* Any [[fiber product of schemes|base change]] of a finite morphism ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' is finite. That is, if ''g'': Z → ''Y'' is any morphism of schemes, then the resulting morphism ''X'' ×&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; ''Z'' → ''Z'' is finite. This corresponds to the following algebraic statement: if ''A'' and ''C'' are (commutative) ''B''-algebras, and ''A'' is finitely generated as a ''B''-module, then the [[Tensor product of algebras|tensor product]] ''A'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ''C'' is finitely generated as a ''C''-module. Indeed, the generators can be taken to be the elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ 1, where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the given generators of ''A'' as a ''B''-module.
* [[Closed immersion]]s are finite, as they are locally given by ''A'' → ''A''/''I'', where ''I'' is the [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] corresponding to the closed subscheme.
* Finite morphisms are closed, hence (because of their stability under base change) [[proper morphism|proper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 01WG | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01WG}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This follows from the [[going up and going down|going up]] theorem of Cohen-Seidenberg in commutative algebra.
* Finite morphisms have finite fibers (that is, they are [[quasi-finite morphism|quasi-finite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 01WG | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01WG}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This follows from the fact that for a field ''k'', every finite ''k''-algebra is an [[Artinian ring]]. A related statement is that for a finite surjective morphism ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'', ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same [[Krull dimension|dimension]].
* By [[Pierre Deligne|Deligne]], a morphism of schemes is finite if and only if it is proper and quasi-finite.&lt;ref&gt;Grothendieck, EGA IV, Part 4, Corollaire 18.12.4.&lt;/ref&gt; This had been shown by [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]] if the morphism ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' is [[glossary of algebraic geometry#finite presentation|locally of finite presentation]], which follows from the other assumptions if ''Y'' is [[Noetherian scheme|Noetherian]].&lt;ref&gt;Grothendieck, EGA IV, Part 3, Théorème 8.11.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Finite morphisms are both projective and [[Glossary of algebraic geometry#affine|affine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Stacks Project, Tag 01WG | url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01WG}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphisms of finite type ==
{{Split section|date=April 2018}}

For a homomorphism ''A'' → ''B'' of commutative rings, ''B'' is called an ''A''-algebra of '''finite type''' if ''B'' is a finitely generated as an ''A''-algebra. It is much stronger for ''B'' to be a '''finite''' ''A''-algebra, which means that ''B'' is finitely generated as an ''A''-module. For example, for any commutative ring ''A'' and natural number ''n'', the polynomial ring ''A''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] is an ''A''-algebra of finite type, but it is not a finite ''A''-algebra unless ''A'' = 0 or ''n'' = 0. Another example of a finite-type morphism which is not finite is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[t] \to \mathbb{C}[t][x,y]/(y^2 - x^3 - t)&lt;/math&gt;.

The analogous notion in terms of schemes is: a morphism ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' of schemes is of '''finite type''' if ''Y'' has a covering by affine open subschemes ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = Spec ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) has a finite covering by affine open subschemes ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = Spec ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; an ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-algebra of finite type. One also says that ''X'' is of '''finite type''' over ''Y''.

For example, for any natural number ''n'' and field ''k'', affine ''n''-space and projective ''n''-space over ''k'' are of finite type over ''k'' (that is, over Spec ''k''), while they are not finite over ''k'' unless ''n'' = 0. More generally, any [[quasi-projective scheme]] over ''k'' is of finite type over ''k''.

The [[Noether normalization lemma]] says, in geometric terms, that every affine scheme ''X'' of finite type over a field ''k'' has a finite surjective morphism to affine space '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; over ''k'', where ''n'' is the dimension of ''X''. Likewise, every [[projective scheme]] ''X'' over a field has a finite surjective morphism to [[projective space]] '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the dimension of ''X''.

In [[foundations of mathematics]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], and [[philosophy of logic]], '''formalism''' is a [[theory]] that holds that statements of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] can be considered to be statements about the consequences of certain string [[Rule of inference|manipulation rules]].

For example, [[Euclidean geometry]] can be considered a game whose play consists in moving around certain strings of symbols called [[axiom]]s according to a set of rules called "[[rules of inference]]" to generate new strings. In playing this game one can "prove" that the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is [[Validity (logic)|valid]] because the string representing the Pythagorean theorem can be constructed using only the stated rules.

According to formalism, the truths expressed in logic and mathematics are not about numbers, sets, or triangles or any other contensive subject matter — in fact, they aren't "about" anything at all. They are [[syntax (logic)|syntactic]] forms whose shapes and locations have no meaning unless they are given an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] (or [[semantics]]).

Formalism is associated with [[rigor]]ous method. In common use, a ''formalism'' means the out-turn of the effort towards [[formal system|formalisation]] of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a [[formal system]], or commonly enough within something ''formalisable'' with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of [[computer science]].

Formalism stresses [[axiom]]atic proofs using [[theorem]]s, specifically associated with [[David Hilbert]]. A formalist is an individual who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.

Formalists are relatively tolerant and inviting to new approaches to logic, non-standard number systems, new set theories, etc. The more games they study, the better. However, in all three of these examples, motivation is drawn from existing mathematical or philosophical concerns. The "games" are usually not arbitrary.

Recently, some{{Who|date=April 2016}} formalist mathematicians have proposed that all ''formal'' mathematical knowledge should be systematically encoded in [[Machine-readable data|computer-readable]] formats, in order to facilitate [[proof checking|automated proof checking]] of mathematical proofs and the use of [[proof assistant|interactive theorem proving]] in the development of mathematical theories and computer software.  Because of their close connection with [[computer science]], this idea is also advocated by mathematical intuitionists and constructivists in the "computability" tradition.

== Deductivism ==
{{Main|Hypothetico-deductive model}}

Another version of formalism is often known as [[deductivism]]. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem is not an absolute truth, but a relative one.

This is to say, that ''if'' you interpret the strings in such a way that the rules of the game become true ''then'' you have to accept that the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation of the theorem you have given it must be a true statement. (The rules of such a game would have to include, for instance, that true statements are assigned to the axioms, and that the rules of inference are truth-preserving, etcetera.)

Under deductivism, the same view is held to be true for all other statements of formal logic and mathematics. Thus, formalism need not mean that these deductive sciences are nothing more than meaningless symbolic games. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. Compare this position to [[Structuralism (philosophy of mathematics)|structuralism]].

Taking the deductivist view allows the working mathematician to [[Bracketing (phenomenology)|suspend judgement]] on the deep philosophical questions and proceed as if solid epistemological foundations were available. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied are suggested by the demands of the particular science.

== Hilbert's formalism ==

[[Image:Hilbert.jpg|thumb|[[David Hilbert]]]]

A major early proponent of formalism was [[David Hilbert]], whose [[Hilbert's program|program]] was intended to be a [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] and [[Consistency|consistent]] axiomatization of all of mathematics. Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the "finitary arithmetic" (a subsystem of the usual [[arithmetic]] of the positive [[integers]], chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent (i.e. no [[contradiction]]s can be derived from the system).

The way that [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] tried to show that an axiomatic system was consistent was by formalizing it using a particular language (Snapper, 1979). In order to formalize an axiomatic system, you must first choose a language in which you can express and perform operations within that system. This language must include five components:

* It must include variables such as ''x,'' which can stand for some number.
* It must have quantifiers such as the symbol for the existence of an object.
* It must include equality.
* It must include connectives such as ↔ for "if and only if."
* It must include certain undefined terms called parameters. For geometry, these undefined terms might be something like a point or a line, which we still choose symbols for.

Once we choose this language, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] thought that we could prove all theorems within any axiomatic system using nothing more than the axioms themselves and the chosen formal language.

[[Gödel|Gödel's]] conclusion in his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] was that you cannot prove consistency within any axiomatic system rich enough to include classical arithmetic. On the one hand, you must use only the formal language chosen to formalize this axiomatic system; on the other hand, it is impossible to prove the consistency of this language in itself (Snapper, 1979). [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] was originally frustrated by Gödel's work because it shattered his life's goal to completely formalize everything in number theory (Reid and Weyl, 1970). However, [[Gödel]] did not feel that he contradicted everything about [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] formalist point of view. After [[Gödel]] published his work, it became apparent that proof theory still had some use, the only difference is that it could not be used to prove the consistency of all of number theory as [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] had hoped (Reid and Weyl, 1970). Present-day formalists use proof theory to further our understanding in mathematics, but perhaps because of [[Gödel|Gödel's]] work, they make no claims about semantic meaning in the work that they do with mathematics. Proofs are simply the manipulation of symbols in our formal language starting from certain rules that we call axioms.

It is important to note that [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] is not considered a strict formalist as formalism is defined today. He thought there was some meaning and truth in mathematics, which is precisely why he was trying to prove the consistency of number theory. If number theory turned out to be consistent, then there had to be some sort of truth in it (Goodman, 1979). Strict formalists consider mathematics apart from its semantic meaning. They view mathematics as pure syntax: the manipulation of symbols according to certain rules. They then attempt to show that this set of rules is consistent, much like [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] attempted to do (Goodman, 1979). Formalists currently believe that computerized algorithms will eventually take over the task of constructing proofs. Computers will replace humans in all mathematical activities, such as checking to see if a proof is correct or not (Goodman, 1979).

Hilbert was initially a deductivist, but, he considered certain [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] methods to yield intrinsically meaningful results and was a [[Philosophy_of_mathematics#Mathematical_realism|realist]] with respect to the finitary arithmetic. Later, he held the opinion that there was no other meaningful mathematics whatsoever, regardless of interpretation.

== Axiomatic systems ==

Other formalists, such as [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Haskell Curry]], considered mathematics to be the investigation of [[formal system|formal axiom systems]]. [[Mathematical logic]]ians study formal systems but are just as often realists as they are formalists.

== ''Principia Mathematica'' ==

Perhaps the most serious attempt to formalize number theory was by the two mathematicians [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. They created a work, ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', which derived number theory by the manipulation of symbols using formal logic. This work was very detailed, and they spent the better part of a decade in writing it. It was not until page 379 of the first volume that they attempted to prove that [[Principia_Mathematica#Quotations|1+1=2]]. 

Russell's philosophy of mathematics was not formalist, however; it is usually considered a form of [[logicism]]. He strongly criticized Hilbert's formalism.

== Criticisms of formalism ==

[[Gödel]] indicated one of the weak points of formalism by addressing the question of consistency in axiomatic systems. More recent criticisms lie in the assertion of formalists that it is possible to computerize all of mathematics. These criticisms bring up the philosophical question of whether or not computers are able to [[Thought|think]]. [[Turing test]]s, named after [[Alan Turing]], who created the test, are an attempt to provide criteria for judging when a computer is capable of thought. The existence of a computer which in principle could pass a [[Turing test]] would prove to formalists that computers will be able to do all of mathematics. However, there are opponents of this claim, such as [[John Searle]], who came up with the "[[Chinese room]]" thought experiment. He presented the argument that while a computer may be able to manipulate the symbols that we give it, the machine could attach no meaning to these symbols. Since computers will not be able to deal with semantic content in mathematics (Penrose, 1989), they could not be said to "think."

Further, humans can create several ways to prove the same result, even if they might find it challenging to articulate such methods. Since creativity requires thought having a semantic foundation, a computer would not be able to create different methods of solving the same problem. Indeed, a formalist would not be able to say that these other ways of solving problems exist simply because they have not been formalized (Goodman, 1979).

Another critique of formalism is that the actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are far removed from the string manipulation games mentioned above. Formalism is thus silent to the question of which axiom systems ought to be studied, as none is more meaningful than another from a formalistic point of view.

In [[mathematics]], and in particular, [[algebra]], a '''generalized inverse''' of an element ''x'' is an element ''y'' that has some properties of an [[inverse element]] but not necessarily all of them.  Generalized inverses can be defined in any [[mathematical structure]] that involves [[Associative property|associative]] multiplication, that is, in a [[semigroup]].  This article describes generalized inverses of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally, given a matrix &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}&lt;/math&gt; and a matrix &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if it satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt; AA^\mathrm{g}A = A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|pp=2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=vii,20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of constructing a generalized inverse of a matrix is to obtain a matrix that can serve as an inverse in some sense for a wider class of matrices than invertible matrices.  A generalized inverse exists for an arbitrary matrix, and when a matrix has a [[#Motivation|regular inverse]], this inverse is its unique generalized inverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|pp=2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation == &lt;!-- [[Regular inverse]] links here.  Please do not change. --&gt;
Consider the [[System of linear equations|linear system]]

:&lt;math&gt;Ax = y&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix and &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal R(A)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[column space]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is [[nonsingular]] (which implies &lt;math&gt;n = m&lt;/math&gt;) then &lt;math&gt;x = A^{-1}y&lt;/math&gt; will be the solution of the system.  Note that, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, then

:&lt;math&gt;AA^{-1}A = A.&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is rectangular (&lt;math&gt;n \neq m&lt;/math&gt;), or square and singular. Then we need a right candidate &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathcal R(A)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;AGy = y.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;Gy&lt;/math&gt; is a solution of the linear system &lt;math&gt;Ax = y&lt;/math&gt;. 
Equivalently, we need a matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;AGA = A.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence we can define the '''generalized inverse''' or '''g-inverse''' as follows:  Given an &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;AGA = A.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|pp=2,7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=vii,20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrix &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; has been termed a '''regular inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by some authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The Penrose conditions define different generalized inverses for &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}:&lt;/math&gt;

# &lt;math&gt; A A^\mathrm{g} A = A &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{g} A A^\mathrm{g} = A^\mathrm{g} &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \left(A A^\mathrm{g}\right)^* = A A^\mathrm{g} &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; \left(A^\mathrm{g} A\right)^* = A^\mathrm{g} A, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{}^*&lt;/math&gt; indicates conjugate transpose.  If &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the first condition, then it is a '''generalized inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If it satisfies the first two conditions, then it is a '''reflexive generalized inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If it satisfies all four conditions, then it is the '''pseudoinverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|Meyer|1991|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|pp=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|pp=20,28,51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A pseudoinverse is sometimes called the '''[[Moore–Penrose inverse]]''', after the pioneering works by [[E. H. Moore]] and [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ben-Israel|Greville|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|Meyer|1991|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|James|1978|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nakamura|1991|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

When &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is non-singular, any generalized inverse &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{g} = A^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; and is unique, but in all other cases, there are an infinite number of matrices that satisfy condition (1).  However, the Moore–Penrose inverse is unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|James|1978|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other kinds of generalized inverse:
* [[One-sided inverse]] (right inverse or left inverse)
** Right inverse:  If the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \textrm{rank} (A) = n&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{R}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; called the '''right inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; A A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} = I_n &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; [[identity matrix]].
** Left inverse:  If the matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{rank}(A) = m&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{L}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; called the '''left inverse''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{L}^{-1} A = I_m &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_m&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;m \times m&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Bott–Duffin inverse]]
* [[Drazin inverse]]

== Examples ==
=== Reflexive generalized inverse ===
Let

: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
    7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9
  \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
  G = \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{5}{3} &amp;  \frac{2}{3} &amp; 0 \\[4pt]
     \frac{4}{3} &amp; -\frac{1}{3} &amp; 0 \\[4pt]
               0 &amp;            0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\det(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is singular and has no regular inverse.  However, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; satisfy conditions (1) and (2), but not (3) or (4).  Hence, &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; is a reflexive generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.

=== One-sided inverse ===
Let

: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
    4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6
  \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
  A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{17}{18} &amp;  \frac{8}{18} \\[4pt]
    -\frac{2}{18}  &amp;  \frac{2}{18} \\[4pt]
     \frac{13}{18} &amp; -\frac{4}{18}
  \end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is not square, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; has no regular inverse.  However, &lt;math&gt; A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; is a right inverse of &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.  The matrix &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; has no left inverse.

== Construction ==
The following characterizations are easy to verify:
{{ordered list
| A right inverse of a [[square matrix|non-square matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{R}^{-1} = A^\mathsf{T} \left(A A^\mathsf{T}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, provided ''A'' has full row rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| A left inverse of a non-square matrix &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{L}^{-1} = \left(A^\mathsf{T}A\right)^{-1} A^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;, provided ''A'' has full column rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rao|Mitra|1971|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| If &lt;math&gt;A = BC&lt;/math&gt; is a [[rank factorization]],  then &lt;math&gt;G = C_\mathrm{R}^{-1} B_\mathrm{L}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a g-inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{R}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a right inverse of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_\mathrm{L}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is left inverse of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
| If &lt;math&gt;A = P\begin{bmatrix}I_r &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} Q&lt;/math&gt; for any non-singular matrices &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G = Q^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}I_r &amp; U \\ W &amp; V\end{bmatrix} P^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized inverse  of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;U, V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.
|  Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be of rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, let
: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{bmatrix}B &amp; C\\ D &amp; E\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{r \times r}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-singular submatrix of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
: &lt;math&gt;G = \begin{bmatrix} B^{-1} &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
| Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; have [[singular-value decomposition]] &lt;math&gt;U \boldsymbol{\Sigma} V^*&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt; is the conjugate transpose of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;). Then the pseudoinverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is
: &lt;math&gt;A^+ = V \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^+ U^*&lt;/math&gt;

where the diagonal matrix {{math|'''Σ'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the pseudoinverse of {{math|'''Σ'''}}, which is formed by replacing every non-zero diagonal entry by its [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] and transposing the resulting matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985|pp=421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Uses ==

Any generalized inverse can be used to determine whether a [[system of linear equations]] has any solutions, and if so to give all of them. If any solutions exist for the ''n'' × ''m'' linear system

:&lt;math&gt;Ax = b&lt;/math&gt;,

with vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of unknowns and vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of constants, all solutions are given by 

:&lt;math&gt;x = A^\mathrm{g}b + \left[I - A^\mathrm{g}A\right]w&lt;/math&gt;,

parametric on the arbitrary vector &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}&lt;/math&gt; is any generalized inverse of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Solutions exist if and only if &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{g}b&lt;/math&gt; is a solution, that is, if and only if &lt;math&gt;AA^\mathrm{g}b = b&lt;/math&gt;. If ''A'' has full column rank, the bracketed expression in this equation is the zero matrix and so the solution is unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|James|1978|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transformation consistency properties ==

In practical applications it is necessary to identify the class of matrix transformations that must be preserved by a generalized inverse. For example, the Moore-Penrose inverse, &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{P}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving unitary matrices ''U'' and ''V'':

:&lt;math&gt;(UAV)^\mathrm{P} = V A^\mathrm{P} U^*&lt;/math&gt;.

The Drazin inverse, &lt;math&gt; A^\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt;  satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to similarity transformations involving a nonsingular matrix ''S'':

:&lt;math&gt;\left(SAS^{-1}\right)^\mathrm{P} = S A^\mathrm{D} S^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Unit-Consistent (UC) inverse,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Uhlmann|first= J.K.|title=A Generalized Matrix Inverse that is Consistent with Respect to Diagonal Transformations|series=SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis|year=2018|volume=239:2|pages=781–800}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;A^\mathrm{U}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving nonsingular diagonal matrices ''D'' and ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;(DAE)^\mathrm{U} = E^{-1} A^\mathrm{U} D^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The fact that the Moore-Penrose inverse provides consistency with respect to rotations (which are orthonormal transformations) explains its widespread use in physics and other applications in which Euclidean distances must be preserved. The UC inverse, by contrast, is applicable when system behavior is expected to be invariant with respect to the choice of units on different state variables, e.g., miles versus kilometers.

In [[mathematics]], and particularly in formal [[algebra]], an '''indeterminate''' is a symbol that is treated as a variable, but does not stand for anything else but itself and is used as a placeholder in objects such as [[polynomial]]s and [[formal power series]]. In particular, it does not designate a constant or a [[parameter]] of the problem, it is not an unknown that could be solved for, and it is not a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] designating a function argument or being summed or integrated over; it is not any type of [[bound variable]].

==Polynomials==
A polynomial in an indeterminate ''X'' is an expression of the form &lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1X + a_2X^2 + \ldots + a_nX^n&lt;/math&gt;, where the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are called the [[coefficient]]s of the polynomial. Two such polynomials are equal only if the corresponding coefficients are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herstein|1975|loc=Section 3.9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, two polynomial functions in a variable ''x'' may be equal or not depending on the value of ''x''.

For example, the functions
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 2 + 3x, \quad g(x) = 5 + 2x&lt;/math&gt;
are equal when ''x'' = 3 and not equal otherwise. But the two polynomials
:&lt;math&gt;2 + 3X, \quad 5 + 2X&lt;/math&gt;
are unequal, since 2 does not equal 5, and 3 does not equal 2. In fact,
:&lt;math&gt;2 + 3X = a + bX&lt;/math&gt;
does not hold ''unless'' ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3. This is because ''X'' is not, and does not designate, a number.

The distinction is subtle, since a polynomial in ''X'' can be changed to a function in ''x'' by substitution. But the distinction is important because information may be lost when this substitution is made. Working in [[Modular arithmetic|modulo 2]]:
:&lt;math&gt;0 - 0^2 = 0, \quad 1 - 1^2 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
so the polynomial function ''x'' − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is identically equal to 0 for ''x'' having any value in the modulo-2 system. But the polynomial ''X'' − ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not the zero polynomial, since the coefficients, 0, 1 and −1, are not all zero.

==Formal power series==
A formal power series in an indeterminate ''X'' is an expression of the form ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''X'' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + …. This is similar to the definition of a polynomial, except that an infinite number of the coefficients may be nonzero. Unlike the [[power series]] encountered in calculus, questions of convergence are irrelevant. So power series that would diverge for values of ''x'', such as 1 + ''x'' + 2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 6''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + … + ''n''!''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + …, are allowed.

==As generators==
Indeterminates are useful in [[abstract algebra]] for generating [[mathematical structure]]s. For example, given a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', the set of polynomials with coefficients in ''K'' is the [[polynomial ring]] with [[polynomial arithmetic|polynomial addition and multiplication]] as operations. If two indeterminates ''X'' and ''Y'' are used, the polynomial ring ''K''[''X,Y''] also uses these operations, and convention holds that ''XY'' = ''YX''.

Indeterminates may also be used to generate a [[free algebra]] over a [[commutative ring]] ''A''. For instance, with two indeterminates ''X'' and ''Y'', the free algebra ''A''⟨''X,Y''⟩ includes sums of strings in ''X'' and ''Y'', with coefficients in ''A'', and with the stipulation that ''XY'' and ''YX'' are distinct.

[[Image:ExternalAngles.svg|thumb|300px|right|Internal and External angles]]
In [[geometry]], an [[angle]] of a [[polygon]] is formed by two sides of the polygon that share an endpoint.  For a simple (non-self-intersecting) polygon, regardless of whether it is [[Polygon#Convexity and non-convexity|convex or non-convex]], this angle is called an [[Interior (topology)|'''interior''']] '''angle''' (or '''{{visible anchor|internal angle}}''') if a point within the angle is in the interior of the polygon. A polygon has exactly one internal angle per [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]].

If every internal angle of a simple polygon is less than 180°, the polygon is called [[convex polygon|convex]].

In contrast, an [[Interior (topology)|'''exterior''']] '''angle''' (or '''{{visible anchor|external angle}}''') is an angle formed by one side of a simple polygon and a [[extended side|line extended from an adjacent side]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. "Exterior Angle Bisector." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExteriorAngleBisector.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PL&gt;Posamentier, Alfred S., and Lehmann, Ingmar. ''The Secrets of Triangles'', Prometheus Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp. 261-264}}

==Properties==
* The sum of the internal angle and the external angle on the same vertex is 180°.
* The sum of all the internal angles of a simple polygon is 180(''n''–2)° where ''n'' is the number of sides. The formula can be proved using [[mathematical induction]] and starting with a triangle for which the angle sum is 180°, then replacing one side with two sides connected at a vertex, and so on.
* The sum of the external angles of any simple convex or non-convex polygon is 360°.
* The measure of the exterior angle at a vertex is unaffected by which side is extended: the two exterior angles that can be formed at a vertex by extending alternately one side or the other are [[vertical angles]] and thus are equal.

==Extension to crossed polygons==
The interior angle concept can be extended in a consistent way to [[crossed polygon]]s such as [[star polygon]]s by using the concept of [[directed angles]]. In general, the interior angle sum in degrees of any closed polygon, including crossed (self-intersecting) ones, is then given by 180(''n''–2''k'')° where ''n'' is the number of vertices and the non-negative number ''k'' is the number of total revolutions of 360° one undergoes walking around the [[perimeter of the polygon]].  In other words, 360''k''° represents the sum of all the exterior angles. For example, for ordinary [[convex polygon|convex]] and [[concave polygon]]s ''k'' = 1, since the exterior angle sum is 360°, and one undergoes only one full revolution walking around the perimeter.

'''Jean Morlet''' ({{IPA-fr|mɔʁlɛ|lang}}; January 13, 1931 – April 27, 2007) was a [[France|French]] [[geophysicist]] who pioneered work in the field of [[wavelet]] analysis around the year 1975. He invented the term ''wavelet'' to describe the functions he was using. In 1981, Morlet worked with [[Alex Grossman]] to develop what is now known as the [[Wavelet transform]].

==Biography==
Morlet graduated from the [[École Polytechnique]] in 1952 and was research engineer at [[Elf Aquitaine]] when he invented wavelets to solve signal processing problems for oil prospecting.

==Awards==
He was awarded in 1997 with the Reginald Fessenden Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SEG Awards: Reginald Fessenden |website=Virtual Geoscience Center |publisher=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]] |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded in 2001 with the first prize Prix Chéreau Lavet, from the [[French Academy of Technologies|Académie des Technologies]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''Kempe chain''' is a device used mainly in the study of the [[four colour theorem]].

==History==
Kempe chains were first used by [[Alfred Kempe]] in his attempted proof of the four colour theorem. Even though his proof turned out to be incomplete, the method of Kempe chains is crucial to the successful modern proofs (Appel &amp; Haken, Robertson et al., etc.). Furthermore, the method is used in the proof of the [[Five color theorem|five-colour theorem]], a weaker form of the four-colour theorem.

==Formal definition==
The term "Kempe chain" is used in two different but related ways.

Suppose ''G'' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] with vertex set ''V'', and we are given a colouring function
: &lt;math&gt;c : V \to S&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is a finite set of colours, containing at least two distinct colours ''a'' and ''b''. If ''v'' is a vertex with colour ''a'', then the (''a'', ''b'')-Kempe chain of ''G'' containing ''v'' is the maximal connected subset of ''V'' which contains ''v'' and whose vertices are all coloured either ''a'' or ''b''.

The above definition is what Kempe worked with. Typically the set ''S'' has four elements (the four colours of the four colour theorem), and ''c'' is a [[proper colouring]], that is, each pair of adjacent vertices in ''V'' are assigned distinct colours.

A more general definition, which is used in the modern computer-based proofs of the four colour theorem, is the following. Suppose again that ''G'' is a graph, with edge set ''E'', and this time we have a colouring function
: &lt;math&gt;c : E \to S.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''e'' is an edge assigned colour ''a'', then the (''a'', ''b'')-Kempe chain of ''G'' containing ''e'' is the maximal connected subset of ''E'' which contains ''e'' and whose edges are all coloured either ''a'' or ''b''.

This second definition is typically applied where ''S'' has three elements, say ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', and where ''V'' is a [[cubic graph]], that is, every vertex has three incident edges. If such a graph is properly coloured, then each vertex must have edges of three distinct colours, and Kempe chains end up being [[path (graph theory)|path]]s, which is simpler than in the case of the first definition.

==In terms of maps==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
&lt;!-- here we need a pretty picture and a down-to-earth explanation NOT in terms of graph theory terminology --&gt;

==Application to the four colour theorem==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
&lt;!-- Here we need an explanation of e.g. how Kempe chains can be used to reduce a vertex of degree four in the 4ct case, and how to reduce a vertex of degree 5 in the 5ct case, again with some pretty pictures --&gt;

==Other Applications==
Kempe-chains have been used to solve problems in ''coloring extension''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1006/jctb.1998.1827| title = You Can't Paint Yourself into a Corner| journal = Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B| volume = 73| issue = 2| pages = 189| year = 1998| last1 = Albertson | first1 = M.

In [[statistics]], the '''Lehmann–Scheffé theorem''' is a prominent statement, tying together the ideas of completeness, sufficiency, uniqueness, and best unbiased estimation.&lt;ref name=Casella/&gt; The theorem states that any [[estimator]] which is [[unbiased estimator|unbiased]] for a given unknown quantity and that depends on the data only through a [[completeness (statistics)|complete]], [[sufficiency (statistics)|sufficient statistic]] is the unique [[best unbiased estimator]] of that quantity. The Lehmann–Scheffé theorem is named after [[Erich Leo Lehmann]] and [[Henry Scheffé]], given their two early papers.&lt;ref name=LS1/&gt;&lt;ref name=LS2/&gt;

If ''T'' is a complete sufficient statistic for ''θ'' and E(''g''(''T''))&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;tau;''(''&amp;theta;'') then ''g''(''T'') is the [[uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator]] (UMVUE) of&amp;nbsp;''τ''(''&amp;theta;'').

==Statement==

Let &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}= X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n&lt;/math&gt; be a random sample from a distribution that has p.d.f (or p.m.f in the discrete case) &lt;math&gt;f(x:\theta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter in the parameter space. Suppose &lt;math&gt;Y = u(\vec{X})&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient statistic for ''θ'', and let &lt;math&gt;\{ f_Y(y:\theta): \theta \in \Omega\}&lt;/math&gt; be a complete family. If &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\operatorname{E}[\varphi(Y)] = \theta&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\varphi(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is the unique MVUE of ''θ''.

===Proof===

By the [[Rao–Blackwell theorem]], if &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is an unbiased estimator of ''θ'' then &lt;math&gt;\varphi(Y):= \operatorname{E}[Z\mid Y]&lt;/math&gt; defines an unbiased estimator of ''θ'' with the property that its variance is not greater than that of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we show that this function is unique. Suppose &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is another candidate MVUE estimator of ''θ''. Then again &lt;math&gt;\psi(Y):= \operatorname{E}[W\mid Y]&lt;/math&gt; defines an unbiased estimator of ''θ'' with the property that its variance is not greater than that of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{E}[\varphi(Y) - \psi(Y)] = 0, \theta \in \Omega.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\{ f_Y(y:\theta): \theta \in \Omega\}&lt;/math&gt; is a complete family

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{E}[\varphi(Y) - \psi(Y)] = 0 \implies \varphi(y) - \psi(y) = 0, \theta \in \Omega
&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore the function &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the unique function of Y with variance not greater than that of any other unbiased estimator. We conclude that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is the MVUE.

== Example for when using a non-complete minimal sufficient statistic ==

An example of an improvable Rao–Blackwell improvement, when using a minimal sufficient statistic that is '''not complete''', was provided by Galili and Meilijson in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= An Example of an Improvable Rao–Blackwell Improvement, Inefficient Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and Unbiased Generalized Bayes Estimator | authors = Tal Galili &amp; Isaac Meilijson | date = 31 Mar 2016 | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2015.1100683?journalCode=utas20 | pages = 108–113 |doi=10.1080/00031305.2015.1100683| pmc = 4960505 | pmid=27499547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;X_1, \ldots, X_n&lt;/math&gt; be a random sample from a scale-uniform distribution &lt;math&gt;X \sim U ( (1-k) \theta, (1+k) \theta),&lt;/math&gt; with unknown mean &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]=\theta&lt;/math&gt; and known design parameter &lt;math&gt;k \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. In the search for "best" possible unbiased estimators for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, it is natural to consider &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; as an initial (crude) unbiased estimator for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and then try to improve it. Since &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; is not a function of &lt;math&gt;T = \left( X_{(1)}, X_{(n)}  \right)&lt;/math&gt;, the minimal sufficient statistic for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;X_{(1)} = \min_i X_i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_{(n)} = \max_i X_i &lt;/math&gt;), it may be improved using the Rao–Blackwell theorem as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_{RB} =\operatorname{E}_\theta[X_1\mid X_{(1)}, X_{( n)}] = \frac{X_{(1)}+X_{(n)}} 2.&lt;/math&gt;

However, the following unbiased estimator can be shown to have lower variance: 

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_{LV} = \frac 1 {k^2\frac{n-1}{n+1}+1} \cdot \frac{(1-k)X_{(1)} + (1+k) X_{(n)}} 2.&lt;/math&gt; 

And in fact, it could be even further improved when using the following estimator:  

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_\text{BAYES}=\frac{n+1} n \left[1- \frac{\frac{X_{(1)} (1+k)}{X_{(n)} (1-k)}-1}{ \left (\frac{X_{(1)} (1+k)}{X_{(n)} (1-k)}\right )^{n+1} -1} \right] \frac{X_{(n)}}{1+k}&lt;/math&gt;

This article contains a list of sample [[Hilbert system|Hilbert-style]] [[deductive system]]s for [[propositional logic]].

==Classical propositional calculus systems==
[[Classical logic|Classical]] propositional calculus is the standard propositional logic. Its intended semantics is [[bivalent logic|bivalent]] and its main property is that it is [[completeness (logic)|strongly complete]], otherwise said that whenever a formula semantically follows from a set of premises semantically, it also follows from that set syntatically. Many different equivalent complete axiom systems have been formulated. They differ in the choice of basic [[logical connective|connectives]] used, which in all cases have to be [[functionally complete]] (i.e. able to express by composition all ''n''-ary [[truth tables]]), and in the exact complete choice of axioms over the chosen basis of connectives.

===Implication and negation===
The formulations here use implication and negation &lt;math&gt;\{\to,\neg\}&lt;/math&gt; as functionally complete set of basic connectives. Every logic system requires at least one non-nullary [[rule of inference]]. Classical propositional calculus typically uses the rule of [[modus ponens]]:
:&lt;math&gt;A,A\to B\vdash B.&lt;/math&gt;
We assume this rule is included in all systems below unless stated otherwise.

===Implication and falsum===
Instead of negation, classical logic can also be formulated using the functionally complete set &lt;math&gt;\{\to,\bot\}&lt;/math&gt; of connectives.

Tarski–[[Paul Bernays|Bernays]]–[[Mordechaj Wajsberg|Wajsberg]] axiom system:
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to B)\to((B\to C)\to(A\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\to(B\to A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((A\to B)\to A)\to A&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bot\to A&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A\to(B\to A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to(B\to C))\to((A\to B)\to(A\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((A\to\bot)\to\bot)\to A&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;((A\to B)\to((\bot\to C)\to D))\to((D\to A)\to(E\to(F\to A)))&lt;/math&gt;

===Negation and disjunction===
Instead of implication, classical logic can also be formulated using the functionally complete set &lt;math&gt;\{\neg,\lor\}&lt;/math&gt; of connectives. These formulations use the following rule of inference;
:&lt;math&gt;A, \neg A\lor B\vdash B.&lt;/math&gt;

Russell–Bernays axiom system:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\neg B\lor C)\lor (\neg (A\lor B)\lor (A\lor C))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (A\lor B)\lor (B\lor A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg A\lor (B\lor A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (A\lor A)\lor A&lt;/math&gt;

*First:
::&lt;math&gt;\neg (\neg (\neg A\lor B)\lor (C\lor (D\lor E)))\lor (\neg (\neg D\lor A)\lor (C\lor (E\lor A)))&lt;/math&gt;
*Second:
::&lt;math&gt;\neg (\neg (\neg A\lor B)\lor (C\lor (D\lor E)))\lor (\neg (\neg E\lor D)\lor (C\lor (A\lor D)))&lt;/math&gt;
*Third:
::&lt;math&gt;\neg (\neg (\neg A\lor B)\lor (C\lor (D\lor E)))\lor (\neg (\neg C\lor A)\lor (E\lor (D\lor A)))&lt;/math&gt;

Dually, classical propositional logic can be defined using only conjunction and negation.

===Sheffer's stroke===
Because [[Sheffer's stroke]] (also known as NAND operator) is [[functionally complete]], it can be used to create an entire formulation of propositional calculus. NAND formulations use a rule of inference called [[Jean Nicod|Nicod]]'s modus ponens:
:&lt;math&gt;A, A\mid(B\mid C)\vdash C.&lt;/math&gt;

Computer analysis by Argonne has revealed &gt; 60 additional single axiom systems that can be used to formulate NAND propositional calculus.&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;

==Implicational propositional calculus==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
The [[implicational propositional calculus]] is the fragment of the classical propositional calculus which only admits the implication connective. It is not [[functionally complete]] (because it lacks the ability to express falsity and negation) but it is however [[Completeness (logic)|syntactically complete]]. The implicational calculi below use modus ponens as an inference rule.

==Intuitionistic and intermediate logics==

[[Intuitionistic logic]] is a subsystem of classical logic. It is commonly formulated with &lt;math&gt;\{\to,\land,\lor,\bot\}&lt;/math&gt; as the set of (functionally complete) basic connectives. It is not syntactically complete since it lacks [[excluded middle]] A∨¬A or [[Peirce's law]] ((A→B)→A)→A which can be added without making the logic inconsistent. It has modus ponens as inference rule, and the following axioms:
:&lt;math&gt;A\to(B\to A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to(B\to C))\to((A\to B)\to(A\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\land B)\to A&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\land B)\to B&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\to(B\to(A\land B))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\to(A\lor B)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B\to(A\lor B)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to C)\to((B\to C)\to((A\lor B)\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bot\to A&lt;/math&gt;
Alternatively, intuitionistic logic may be axiomatized using &lt;math&gt;\{\to,\land,\lor,\neg\}&lt;/math&gt; as the set of basic connectives, replacing the last axiom with
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to\neg A)\to\neg A&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg A\to(A\to B)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Intermediate logics]] are in between intuitionistic logic and classical logic. Here are a few intermediate logics:

* Jankov logic (KC) is an extension of intuitionistic logic, which can be axiomatized by the intuitionistic axiom system plus the axiom&lt;ref name="CZ"&gt;A. Chagrov, M. Zakharyaschev, ''Modal logic'', Oxford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg A\lor\neg\neg A.&lt;/math&gt;

* Gödel–Dummett logic (LC) can be axiomatized over intuitionistic logic by adding the axiom&lt;ref name="CZ"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to B)\lor(B\to A).&lt;/math&gt;

==Positive implicational calculus==
The positive implicational calculus is the implicational fragment of intuitionistic logic. The calculi below use modus ponens as an inference rule.

Łukasiewicz's axiom system:
:&lt;math&gt;A\to(B\to A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to(B\to C))\to((A\to B)\to(A\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
Meredith's axiom systems:
*First:
::&lt;math&gt;E\to((A\to B)\to(((D\to A)\to(B\to C))\to(A\to C)))&lt;/math&gt;
*Second:
::&lt;math&gt;A\to(B\to A)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;(B\to C)\to((A\to B)\to(A\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(A\to(B\to C))\to(B\to(A\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;A\to(B\to A)&lt;/math&gt;
*Second:
::&lt;math&gt;(A\to(A\to B))\to(A\to B)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(A\to B)\to((B\to C)\to(A\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;A\to(B\to A)&lt;/math&gt;
*Third:
::&lt;math&gt;A\to A&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(A\to B)\to((B\to C)\to(A\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(B\to C)\to((A\to B)\to(A\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;(A\to(A\to B))\to(A\to B)&lt;/math&gt;

==Positive propositional calculus==
Positive propositional calculus is the fragment of intuitionistic logic using only the (non functionally complete) connectives &lt;math&gt;\{\to,\land,\lor\}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be axiomatized by any of the above-mentioned calculi for positive implicational calculus together with the axioms
:&lt;math&gt;(A\land B)\to A&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\land B)\to B&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\to(B\to(A\land B))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\to(A\lor B)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B\to(A\lor B)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to C)\to((B\to C)\to((A\lor B)\to C))&lt;/math&gt;
Optionally, we may also include the connective &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; and the axioms
:&lt;math&gt;(A\leftrightarrow B)\to(A\to B)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\leftrightarrow B)\to(B\to A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to B)\to((B\to A)\to(A\leftrightarrow B))&lt;/math&gt;

[[Ingebrigt Johansson|Johansson]]'s [[minimal logic]] can be axiomatized by any of the axiom systems for positive propositional calculus and expanding its language with the nullary connective &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;, with no additional axiom schemas. Alternatively, it can also be axiomatized in the language &lt;math&gt;\{\to,\land,\lor,\neg\}&lt;/math&gt; by expanding the positive propositional calculus with the axiom
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to\neg B)\to(B\to\neg A)&lt;/math&gt;
or the pair of axioms
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to B)\to(\neg B\to\neg A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\to\neg\neg A&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitionistic logic in language with negation can be axiomatized over the positive calculus by the pair of axioms
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to\neg B)\to(B\to\neg A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg A\to(A\to B)&lt;/math&gt;
or the pair of axioms&lt;ref name="Hackstaff"&gt;L. H. Hackstaff, ''Systems of Formal Logic'', Springer, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to\neg A)\to\neg A&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg A\to(A\to B)&lt;/math&gt;

Classical logic in the language &lt;math&gt;\{\to,\land,\lor,\neg\}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from the positive propositional calculus by adding the axiom
:&lt;math&gt;(\neg A\to\neg B)\to(B\to A)&lt;/math&gt;
or the pair of axioms
:&lt;math&gt;(A\to\neg B)\to(B\to\neg A)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg\neg A\to A&lt;/math&gt;

Fitch calculus takes any of the axiom systems for positive propositional calculus and adds the axioms&lt;ref name="Hackstaff"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg A\to(A\to B)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A\leftrightarrow\neg\neg A&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(A\lor B)\leftrightarrow(\neg A\land\neg B)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(A\land B)\leftrightarrow(\neg A\lor\neg B)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the first and third axioms are also valid in intuitionistic logic.

==Equivalential calculus==
Equivalential calculus is the subsystem of classical propositional calculus that only allows the (functionally incomplete) [[biconditional|equivalence]] connective, denoted here as &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- because if I had to write \leftrightarrow for every single one of them, I would go mad --&gt;. The rule of inference used in these systems is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;A,A\equiv B\vdash B&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9626">In [[mathematics]], some functions or groups of functions are important enough to deserve their own names. This is a listing of articles which explain some of these functions in more detail. There is a large theory of [[special functions]] which developed out of [[statistics]] and [[mathematical physics]]. A modern, abstract point of view contrasts large [[function space]]s, which are infinite-dimensional and within which most functions are 'anonymous', with special functions picked out by properties such as [[symmetry]], or relationship to [[harmonic analysis]] and [[group representation]]s.

'''''Logical Investigations''''' ({{lang-de|Logische Untersuchungen}}) is a work of philosophy by [[Edmund Husserl]], published in two volumes in 1900 and 1901, with a second edition in 1913 and 1921. In ''Logical Investigations'', which resulted from a shift in Husserl's interests from mathematics to logic and epistemology, Husserl maintains that mathematical laws are not empirical laws that describe the workings of the mind, but ideal laws whose necessity is intuited ''a priori''. Though Husserl abandoned [[psychologism]], the doctrine according to which logical entities such as propositions, universals, and numbers can be reduced to mental states or activities, in ''Logical Investigations'', some commentators have seen a revival of psychologism in its second volume. ''Logical Investigations'' helped to create [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and has been credited with making twentieth century [[continental philosophy]] possible. [[Martin Heidegger]] was among the philosophers influenced by the work. An English translation of the second edition, by the philosopher [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]], was published in 1970.

==Background==
Between 1890 and 1900, Husserl's philosophical interests expanded from mathematics to a concern with [[logic]] and [[epistemology]]. ''Logical Investigations'' was the culmination of this development.{{sfn|Sokolowski|1999|page=404}} In this work, Husserl gave a new account of mathematics, one opposed to his previous views, which had been influenced by the psychologism of the late 19th century. Husserl's view in ''Logical Investigations'', which may have been influenced by [[Gottlob Frege]]'s criticism of Husserl's ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic]]'' (1891), was that mathematical laws are not empirical laws that describe the workings of the mind, but ideal laws whose necessity is intuited ''a priori''.{{sfn|Mautner|2000|pages=259–260}}

==Influence and reception==
Husserl's first major work,{{sfn|Wagner|1983|page=215}} ''Logical Investigations'' has been credited with making twentieth century continental philosophy possible. According to Donn Welton, Husserl introduced a novel conception of the relationships between language and experience, meaning and reference, and subject and object, and by attempting to integrate a theory of meaning with a theory of truth, and a theory of the subject with a theory of the object, helped create [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], a new form of philosophy that went beyond systems such as psychologism, [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[idealism]], [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivism]] and [[subjectivism]].{{sfn|Welton|1999|pages=ix, x}} [[Martin Heidegger]] studied ''Logical Investigations'' while a student at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Collegium Borromaeum (Freiburg im Breisgau)|de}}, where they were so rarely requested from the university library that Heidegger was easily able to renew them.{{sfn|Ott|1994|page=57}} Heidegger had expected that ''Logical Investigations'' would, like Carl Braig's ''On Being'' and other works Heidegger had already studied, shed light on the multiple meanings of being, but he was disappointed. Nevertheless, the work impressed Heidegger and convinced him to study philosophy. Especially important for Heidegger was the sixth of the ''Logical Investigations'', in which Husserl distinguishes between "sensuous" and "categorical" intuition.{{sfn|Krell|1993|pages=7, 12–13}} Heidegger, like [[Theodor W. Adorno]], believed that the second volume of ''Logical Investigations'' marked an apparent revival of psychologism, which puzzled him.{{sfn|Inwood|2005|page=409}} In ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927), Heidegger credited Husserl's ''Logical Investigations'' with making his work possible.{{sfn|Heidegger|2008|page=62}}

The German philosopher [[Emil Lask]] was also influenced by ''Logical Investigations''. Heidegger credited Lask with being the only person who had taken up Husserl's investigations "positively from outside the mainstream of phenomenological research", pointing to Lask's ''Die Logik der Philosophie und die Kategorienlehre'' (1911) and ''Die Lehre vom Urteil'' (1912).{{sfn|Heidegger|2008|page=494}} [[Jacques Derrida]], who studied Husserl's ''Logical Investigations'' as a student in the 1950s,{{sfn|Powell|2006|page=25}} offered a critique of Husserl's work in ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]'' (1967).{{sfn|Derrida|1989|page=3}} [[Judith Butler]], writing in the preface to the second edition of ''[[Subjects of Desire]]'' (1987; second edition 1999), commented that "a grammar that is preconceived to express logical relations" is the "conceit" of ''Logical Investigations'', which she compared to the early work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].{{sfn|Butler|1999|page=xi}}

Robert Sokolowski, writing in ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' (1995), criticized the first edition of ''Logical Investigations'' for sharply distinguishing between things as they appear and the thing in itself, a view similar to that of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Sokolowski notes that between 1900 and 1910, Husserl abandoned the Kantian distinctions made in ''Logical Investigations''. According to Sokolowski, when Husserl expressed a new position in ''Ideas'' (1913), he was misinterpreted as adopting a traditional idealism and "many thinkers who admired Husserl's earlier work distanced themselves from what he now taught."{{sfn|Sokolowski|1999|page=404}} Derrida's biographer Jason Powell described the analyses of signs and meaning in ''Logical Investigations'' as "rigorous and abstract", "scrupulous", but also "tedious".{{sfn|Powell|2006|page=25}} The philosopher [[Ray Monk]] wrote that ''Logical Investigations'' is "made almost impenetrable by the obscurity of Husserl’s prose", adding that [[Bertrand Russell]] described trying to read the work as "very much like trying to swallow a whale".{{sfn|Monk|2016}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''lowest common denominator''' or '''least common denominator''' (abbreviated '''LCD''') is the [[least common multiple|lowest common multiple]] of the [[denominator]]s of a set of [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]. It simplifies adding, subtracting, and comparing fractions.

== Description ==
The lowest common [[denominator]] of a set of [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s is the lowest number that is a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] of all the denominators: their [[least common multiple|lowest common multiple]]. 
The product of the denominators is always a common denominator, as in:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{3}\;=\;\frac{3}{6}+\frac{4}{6}\;=\;\frac{7}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

but it is not always the lowest common denominator, as in:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{12}+\frac{11}{18}\;=\;\frac{15}{36}+\frac{22}{36}\;=\;\frac{37}{36}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, 36 is the least common multiple of 12 and 18. Their product, 216, is also a common denominator, but calculating with that denominator involves larger numbers:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{12}+\frac{11}{18}=\frac{90}{216}+\frac{132}{216}=\frac{222}{216}.&lt;/math&gt;

With variables rather than numbers, the same principles apply:&lt;ref name=brooks/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{bc}+\frac{c}{b^2 d}\;=\;\frac{abd}{b^2 cd}+\frac{c^2}{b^2 cd}\;=\;\frac{abd+c^2}{b^2 cd}&lt;/math&gt;

Some methods of calculating the LCD are at [[Least common multiple#Computing the least common multiple]].

== Role in arithmetic and algebra ==
The same fraction can be expressed in many different forms. As long as the ratio between numerator and denominator is the same, the fractions represent the same number. For example:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}=\frac{6}{9}=\frac{12}{18}=\frac{144}{216}=\frac{200,000}{300,000}&lt;/math&gt;
because they are all multiplied by 1 written as a fraction:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}=\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{3}{3}=\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{6}{6}=\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{72}{72}=\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{100,000}{100,000}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is usually easiest to add, subtract, or compare fractions when each is expressed with the same denominator, called a "common denominator". For example, the numerators of fractions with common denominators can simply be added, such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{12}+\frac{6}{12}=\frac{11}{12}&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{12}&lt;\frac{11}{12}&lt;/math&gt;, since each fraction has the common denominator 12. Without computing a common denominator, it is not obvious as to what &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{12}+\frac{11}{18}&lt;/math&gt; equals, or whether &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{12}&lt;/math&gt; is greater than or less than &lt;math&gt;\frac{11}{18}&lt;/math&gt;. Any common denominator will do, but usually the lowest common denominator is desirable because it makes the rest of the calculation as simple as possible.&lt;ref name=worldbook/&gt;

== Colloquial usage ==
The expression "lowest common denominator" is used to describe (usually in a disapproving manner) a rule, proposal, opinion, or media that is deliberately simplified so as to appeal to the largest possible number of people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/lowest-common-denominator (accessed February 21, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis of Condorcet''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁi ʒɑ̃n‿ɑ̃twan nikola də kaʁita kɔ̃dɔʁsɛ|lang}}; 17 September 1743 – 29 March 1794), known as '''Nicolas de Condorcet''', was a French [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]]. His ideas, including support for a [[Economic liberalism|liberal economy]], free and equal public instruction, [[constitutionalism|constitutional]] government, and [[Social equality|equal rights]] for women and people of all races, have been said to embody the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and Enlightenment [[rationalism]]. He died in prison after a period of flight from French Revolutionary authorities.

==Early years==
Condorcet was born in [[Ribemont]] (in present-day [[Aisne]]), descended from the ancient family of Caritat, who took their title from the town of [[Condorcet, Drôme|Condorcet]] in [[Dauphiné]], of which they were long-time residents. Fatherless at a young age, he was raised by his devoutly religious mother. He was educated at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] College in [[Reims]] and at the ''[[Collège de Navarre]]'' in Paris, where he quickly showed his intellectual ability and gained his first public distinctions in [[mathematics]]. When he was sixteen, his analytical abilities gained the praise of [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Alexis Clairaut]]; soon, Condorcet would study under d'Alembert.

From 1765 to 1774, he focused on science. In 1765, he published his first work on mathematics, entitled ''Essai sur le [[integral calculus|calcul intégral]]'', which was well received, launching his career as a mathematician. He went on to publish more papers, and on 25 February 1769, he was elected to the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Académie royale des Sciences]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ellen Judy Wilson|author2=Peter Hanns Reill|title=Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1pQ4YG-TDIC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=124–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anne Robert Jacques Turgot.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Jacques Turgot was Condorcet's mentor and longtime friend]]
In 1772, he published another paper on [[integral calculus]]. Soon after, he met [[Jacques Turgot]], a French economist, and the two became friends. Turgot became an administrator under [[King of France|King]] [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in 1772 and [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Controller-General of Finance]] under [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] in 1774.

Condorcet worked with [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. He soon became an honorary member of many foreign academies and philosophic societies, including the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] (1785), the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1792),&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and also in Prussia and Russia

His political ideas, many in congruity with Turgot's, were criticized heavily in the English-speaking world, however, most notably by [[John Adams]] who wrote two of his principal works of political philosophy to oppose Turgot's and Condorcet's unicameral legislature and radical democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Waldstreicher|title=A Companion to John Adams and John Quincy Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82lNLcxLL5sC&amp;pg=PT64|year=2013|publisher=Wiley|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
In 1774, Condorcet was appointed inspector general of the [[Monnaie de Paris|Paris mint]] by Turgot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Efrosini Gregory|title=Freedom in French Enlightenment Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=poya_r2az2sC&amp;pg=PA148|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point on, Condorcet shifted his focus from the purely mathematical to philosophy and political matters. In the following years, he took up the defense of [[human rights]] in general, and of [[Women's rights|women's]] and [[Black (people)|Blacks']] rights in particular (an [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]], he became active in the [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks]] in the 1780s). He supported the ideals embodied by the newly formed United States, and proposed projects of political, administrative and economic reforms intended to transform France.

In 1776, Turgot was dismissed as Controller General. Consequently, Condorcet submitted his resignation as Inspector General of the ''[[Monnaie de Paris|Monnaie]]'', but the request was refused, and he continued serving in this post until 1791. Condorcet later wrote ''Vie de M. Turgot'' (1786), a biography which spoke fondly of Turgot and advocated Turgot's economic theories. Condorcet continued to receive prestigious appointments: in 1777, he became Permanent Secretary of the [[Académie des Sciences]], holding the post until the abolition of the Académie in 1793; and, in 1782, secretary of the ''[[Académie française]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorraine Daston|title=Classical Probability in the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oq8XNbKyUewC&amp;pg=PA104|year=1995|publisher=Princeton UP|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condorcet's paradox and the Condorcet method==
{{main|Condorcet method}}

In 1785, Condorcet wrote an essay on the application of analysis of the probability of decisions made on a majority vote, one of his most important works. This work described several now famous results, including [[Condorcet's jury theorem]], which states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases as the number of members of the group increases, and [[Condorcet's paradox]], which shows that majority preferences can become [[intransitivity|intransitive]] with three or more options – it is possible for a certain electorate to express a preference for A over B, a preference for B over C, and a preference for C over A, all from the same set of ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas J. Amy|title=Behind the Ballot Box: A Citizen's Guide to Voting Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-G46rVRXkY0C&amp;pg=PA188|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper also outlines a generic [[Condorcet method]], designed to simulate pair-wise elections between all candidates in an election. He disagreed strongly with the alternative method of aggregating preferences put forth by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (based on summed [[Non-parametric statistics|rankings of alternatives]]). Condorcet was one of the first to systematically apply mathematics in the [[social sciences]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Other works==
In 1781, Condorcet wrote a pamphlet, ''Reflections on Negro Slavery'', in which he denounced [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Sociological Analysis|last=Bierstedt|first=Robert|publisher=Basic Books|year=1978|isbn=0-465-03023-8|page=19|chapter=Sociological Thought in the Eighteenth Century|editor1-last=Bottomore|editor1-first=Tom|editor2-first=Robert|editor2-last=Nisbet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1786, Condorcet worked on ideas for the [[Derivative|differential]] and [[integral calculus]], giving a new treatment of [[infinitesimal]]s – a work which was never printed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 1789, he published ''Vie de Voltaire (1789)'', which agreed with [[Voltaire]] in his opposition to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. In 1791, Condorcet, along with Sophie de Grouchy, [[Thomas Paine]], [[Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont|Etienne Dumont]], [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|Jacques-Pierre Brissot]], and Achilles Duchastellet published a brief journal titled ''Le Républicain'', its main goal being the promotion of republicanism and the rejection of constitutional monarchy. The journal's theme was that any sort of monarchy is a threat to freedom no matter who is leading and that liberty is freedom from domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berges|first=Sandrine|year=2015|title=Sophie de Grouchy on the Cost of Domination in the Letters on Sympathy and Two Anonymous Articles in Le Républicain|url=|journal=Monist|volume=98|pages=102–12|via=Florida International University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, Condorcet had a book published called ''[[Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind]]''. It dealt with theoretical thought on perfecting the human mind and analyzing intellectual history based on social arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roman|first=Hanna|date=2015-02-06|title=Conjecturing a New World in Condorcet's Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/569893|journal=MLN|volume=129|issue=4|pages=780–795|doi=10.1353/mln.2014.0077|issn=1080-6598}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Malthus]] wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798) partly in response to Condorcet's views on the "''perfectibility of society''."

==French Revolution==

===Deputy===
Condorcet took a leading role when the [[French Revolution]] swept France in 1789, hoping for a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] reconstruction of society, and championed many [[Classical liberalism|liberal causes]]. As a result, in 1791 he was elected as a Paris representative in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and then became the secretary of the Assembly.

In April 1792 Condorcet presented a project for the reformation of the education system, aiming to create a hierarchical system, under the authority of experts, who would work as the guardians of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and who, independent of power, would be the guarantors of public liberties. The project was judged to be contrary to the republican and egalitarian virtues, giving the education of the Nation over to an aristocracy of savants. The institution adopted Condorcet's design for the state education system, and he drafted a proposed [[Constitutional monarchy|Bourbon Constitution]] for the new France.

He advocated [[women's suffrage]] for the new government, writing an article for ''Journal de la Société de 1789'', and by publishing ''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cité'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060616060257/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/condorcet4.html ("For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women")] in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert William Dimand|author2=Chris Nyland|title=The Status of Women in Classical Economic Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=moR__vx9scMC&amp;pg=PA133|year=2003|publisher=Edward Elgar|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condorcet was not affiliated with any political party but counted many friends among the Girondins. He distanced himself from them during the [[National Convention]], however, due to his distaste for their factionalism.

At the [[Trial of Louis XVI]], Condorcet, who opposed the death penalty albeit supporting the [[Trial of Louis XVI|trial]] itself, spoke out against the execution of the King during the public vote at the Convention – he proposed to send the king to the galleys.

Condorcet was on the Constitution Committee and was the main author of the Girondin constitutional project. The constitution was not put to vote. When the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]] gained control of the Convention, they wrote their own, the [[French Constitution of 1793]]. Condorcet criticized the new work, and as a result, he was branded a traitor. On 3 October 1793, a warrant was issued for Condorcet's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William E.

The warrant forced Condorcet into hiding. He hid for five (or eight) months in the house of Mme. Vernet, on Rue Servandoni, in Paris. It was there that he wrote ''Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain'' (''[[Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit]]''), which was published posthumously in 1795 and is considered one of the major texts of the Enlightenment and of historical thought. It narrates the history of civilization as one of progress in the sciences, shows the intimate connection between [[scientific progress]] and the development of human rights and justice, and outlines the features of a future rational society entirely shaped by scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Loptson|title=Readings on Human Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bGOKpFOY7kC&amp;pg=PA125|year=1998|publisher=[[Broadview Press]]|pages=125–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 1794 Condorcet, convinced he was no longer safe, left his hideout and attempted to flee Paris. He went to seek refuge at the house of [[Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard|Jean-Baptiste Suard]], a friend of his with whom he had resided in 1772,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salmon|first=J.H.M|year=1977|title=Turgot and Condorcet. Progress, Reform and Revolution|url=|journal=History Today|volume=27|page=288|via=Florida International University}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was refused on the basis that he would be betrayed by one of their residents. Two days later, he was arrested in [[Clamart]] and imprisoned in [[Bourg-la-Reine]] (or, as it was known during the Revolution, ''Bourg-l'Égalité'', "Equality Borough" rather than "Queen's Borough") where, after another two days, he was found dead in his cell. The most widely accepted theory is that his friend, [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis]], gave him a poison which he eventually used. However, some historians believe that he may have been murdered (perhaps because he was too loved and respected to be executed). Jean-Pierre Brancourt (in his work ''L'élite, la mort et la révolution'') claims that Condorcet was killed with a mixture of ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' and opium.

Condorcet was symbolically interred in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in 1989, in honour of the bicentennial of the French Revolution and Condorcet's role as a central figure in the Enlightenment.  His coffin, however, was empty as his remains, originally interred in the common cemetery of [[Bourg-la-Reine]], were lost during the nineteenth century.

==Family==
In 1786 Condorcet married [[Sophie de Condorcet|Sophie de Grouchy]], who was more than twenty years his junior. Sophie, reckoned one of the most beautiful women of the day, became an accomplished [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] hostess as Madame de Condorcet, and also an accomplished translator of [[Thomas Paine]] and [[Adam Smith]]. She was intelligent and well educated, fluent in both English and Italian. The marriage was a strong one, and Sophie visited her husband regularly while he remained in hiding. Although she began proceedings for divorce in January 1794, it was at the insistence of Condorcet and Cabanis, who wished to protect their property from expropriation and to provide financially for Sophie and their young daughter, Louise 'Eliza' Alexandrine.

Condorcet was survived by his widow and four-year-old Eliza. Sophie died in 1822, never having remarried, and having published all her husband's works between 1801 and 1804. Her work was carried on by Eliza, wife of former United Irishman [[Arthur O'Connor (United Irishman)|Arthur O'Connor]].  The Condorcet-O'Connors published a revised edition between 1847 and 1849.

== Gender equality ==

Condorcet's work was mainly focused on a quest for a more egalitarian society. This path led him to think and write about gender equality in the Revolutionary context. In 1790, he published "''De l'admission des femmes au droit de cité''"("On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship") in which he strongly advocated for women's suffrage in the new Republic as well as the enlargement of basic political and social rights to include women. One of the most famous [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers at the time, he was one of the first to make such a radical proposal. A visionary, he identified gender as a social construction based on perceived differences in sex and rejected [[biological determinism]] as being able to explain gender relations in society. He denounced patriarchal norms of oppression, present at every institutional level, and continuously subjugating and marginalising women. Like fellow [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinker [[Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his book ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]] ou De l'Education'' (1762), Condorcet identified education as crucial to the emancipation of individuals. He stated: "I believe that all other differences between men and women are simply the result of education″.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Social Choice and Political Theory|date=1994|publisher=Edward Edgard Publishing|last1=and Iain McLean|first1=Fiona Hewitt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw it as the only solution for women to deconstruct gender roles and promote another kind of masculinity, not based on violence, virility and the subjugation of women but rather on shared attributes such as reason and intelligence. In her book "''Essays in the Philosophy of Humanism''", Hooks calls this new concept "feminine masculinity", ″new models of self‐assertion that do not require the construction of an enemy 'other,' be it a woman or the symbolic feminine, for them to define themselves against″.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Feminism is for Everybody|date=2000|publisher=South End Press|last1=Hooks|first1=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condorcet's whole plea for gender equality is founded on the recognition that the attribution of rights and authority comes from the false assumption that men possess reason and women do not. This is, according to Nall, an obvious example of an individual practising and advocating this feminist masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Condorcet and Feminist Masculinity|date=2010|publisher=Men's Studies Press, LLC|location=Florida Atlantic University|last1=Nall|first1=Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, women should enjoy the same fundamental "[[natural right]]".

Scholars{{Who|date=January 2018}} often disagree on the true impact that Condorcet's work had on pre-modern feminist thinking. His detractors{{Who|date=January 2018}} point out that when he was eventually given some responsibilities in the constitutional drafting process, his convictions did not translate into concrete political action and made limited efforts to push these issues on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Condorcet: le seul et premier féministe du 18ème siècle?|last=Pappas|first=John|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=430–441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars{{Who|date=January 2018}} on the other hand, believe that this lack of action is not due to the weakness of his commitment but rather to the political atmosphere at the time and the absence of political appetite for gender equality on the part of decision-makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Le Feminisme pendant la Revolution Francaise|date=2007|page=341 |last1=Devance|first1=Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with authors such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] or [[Olympe de Gouges]], Condorcet made a lasting contribution to the pre-feminist debate.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}

== The Idea of Progress ==
{{main|Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit}}
Condorcet's ''Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit'' (1795) was perhaps the most influential formulation of the idea of progress ever written. It made the [[Idea of Progress]] a central concern of Enlightenment thought. He argued that expanding knowledge in the natural and social sciences would lead to an ever more just world of individual freedom, material affluence, and moral compassion. He argued for three general propositions: that the past revealed an order that could be understood in terms of the progressive development of human capabilities, showing that humanity's "present state, and those through which it has passed, are a necessary constitution of the moral composition of humankind"; that the progress of the natural sciences must be followed by progress in the moral and political sciences "no less certain, no less secure from political revolutions"; that social evils are the result of ignorance and error rather than an inevitable consequence of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Keith Michael|last=Baker|title=On Condorcet's 'Sketch'|journal=[[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]]|volume=133|issue=3 |date=Summer 2004|pages=56–64|doi=10.1162/0011526041504506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condorcet's writings were a key contribution to the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly his work on the Idea of Progress. Condorcet believed that through the use of our senses and communication with others, knowledge could be compared and contrasted as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding. None of Condorcet's writings refer to a belief in a religion or a god who intervenes in human affairs. Condorcet instead frequently had written of his faith in humanity itself and its ability to progress with the help of philosophers such as Aristotle. Through this accumulation and sharing of knowledge he believed it was possible for any man to comprehend all the known facts of the natural world. The [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of the natural world spurred the desire for enlightenment of the social and political world. Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly [[utopian]] society. He believed in the great potential towards growth that man possessed.

However, Condorcet stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of race, religion, culture or gender.&lt;ref name="Williams 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=David|title=Condorcet and Modernity|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84139-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To this end, he became a member of the French [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks|Société des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glawe|first=Eddie|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707124424/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=71563|archivedate=2014-07-07|url=http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=71563|title=Benjamin Banneker|work=Professional Surveyor Magazine|date=June 2014|volume=39|issue=6|publisher=Flatdog Media, Inc.|accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a set of rules for the Society of the Friends of the Blacks which detailed the reasoning and goals behind the organization along with describing the injustice of slavery and put in a statement calling for the abolition of the slave trade as the first step to true abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Condorcet: Political Writings|last=Steven Lukes|first=Nadia Urbinati|publisher=Cambridge University Press, New York|year=2012|isbn=9781107021013|location=United States of America|pages=148–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condorcet was also a strong proponent of women's civil rights. He claimed that women were equal to men in nearly every aspect and asked why then should they be debarred from their fundamental civil rights; the few differences that existed were due to the fact that women were limited by their lack of rights. Condorcet even mentioned several women who were more capable then average men, such as [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and [[Maria Theresa|Maria-Theresa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Condorcet: Political Writings|last=Steven Lukes|first=Nadia Urbinati|publisher=Cambridge University, New York|year=2012|isbn=9781107021013|location=United States  of America|pages=156–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic duty==
For Condorcet's [[republicanism]] the nation needed enlightened citizens and education needed democracy to become truly public. Democracy implied free citizens, and ignorance was the source of servitude. Citizens had to be provided with the necessary knowledge to exercise their freedom and understand the rights and laws that guaranteed their enjoyment. Although education could not eliminate disparities in talent, all citizens, including women, had the right to free education. In opposition to those who relied on revolutionary enthusiasm to form the new citizens, Condorcet maintained that revolution was not made to last and that revolutionary institutions were not intended to prolong the revolutionary experience but to establish political rules and legal mechanisms that would insure future changes without revolution. In a democratic city there would be no Bastille to be seized. Public education would form free and responsible citizens, not revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Keith Michael|title=Condorcet: From Natural Philosophy to Social Mathematics|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1975|isbn=0-226-03532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
Rothschild (2001) argues that Condorcet has been seen since the 1790s as the embodiment of the cold, rational Enlightenment. However she suggests his writings on economic policy, voting, and public instruction indicate different views both of Condorcet and of the Enlightenment. Condorcet was concerned with individual diversity; he was opposed to [[proto-utilitarian]] theories; he considered individual independence, which he described as the characteristic liberty of the moderns, to be of central political importance; and he opposed the imposition of universal and eternal principles. His efforts to reconcile the universality of some values with the diversity of individual opinions are of continuing interest. He emphasizes the institutions of civilized or constitutional conflict, recognizes conflicts or inconsistencies within individuals, and sees moral sentiments as the foundation of universal values. His difficulties call into question some familiar distinctions, for example between French, German, and English-Scottish thought, and between the Enlightenment and the counter-Enlightenment. There was substantial continuity between Condorcet's criticism of the economic ideas of the 1760s and the liberal thought of the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Williams 2004"/&gt;

The [[Lycée Condorcet]] in the rue du Havre, in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]], is named in his honour, as are streets in many French cities.

In [[statistics]], the '''mean signed difference''', '''deviation''', or '''error''' ('''MSD''') is a sample [[statistic]] that summarises how well a set of estimates &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_i&lt;/math&gt; match the quantities &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; that they are supposed to estimate. It is one of a number of statistics that can be used to assess an estimation procedure, and it would often be used in conjunction with a sample version of the [[mean square error]].

For example, suppose a [[linear regression]] model has been estimated over a sample of data, and is then used to extrapolate predictions of the [[dependent variable]] out of sample after the out-of-sample data points have become available. Then &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; would be the ''i''-th out-of-sample value of the dependent variable, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_i&lt;/math&gt; would be its predicted value. The mean signed deviation is the average value of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_i-\theta_i.&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==

The mean signed difference is derived from a set of ''n'' pairs,  &lt;math&gt;( \hat{\theta}_i,\theta_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \hat{\theta}_i&lt;/math&gt; is an estimate of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in a case where it is known that &lt;math&gt;\theta=\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;.  In many applications, all the quantities &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; will share a common value. When applied to [[forecasting]] in a [[time series analysis]] context, a forecasting procedure might be evaluated using the mean signed difference, with  &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}_i&lt;/math&gt; being the predicted value of a series at a given [[lead time]] and &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; being the value of the series eventually observed for that time-point. The mean signed difference is defined to be  
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{MSD}(\hat{\theta}) = \sum^{n}_{i=1} \frac{\hat{\theta_{i}} - \theta_{i}}{n} .&lt;/math&gt;

{{Spacetime|cTopic=Types}}
The '''Minkowski diagram''', also known as a '''spacetime diagram''', was developed in 1908 by [[Hermann Minkowski]] and provides an illustration of the properties of space and time in the [[special theory of relativity]]. It allows a qualitative understanding of the corresponding phenomena like [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]] without mathematical equations.

Minkowski diagrams are two-dimensional graphs that depict events as happening in a [[universe]] consisting of one space dimension and one time dimension. Unlike a regular distance-time graph, the distance will be displayed on the horizontal axis and time on the vertical axis. Additionally, the time and space [[units of measurement]] are chosen in such a way that an object moving at the speed of light is depicted as following a 45° angle to the diagram's axes.

In this way, each object, like an observer or a vehicle, traces a certain line in the diagram, which is called its [[world line]]. Also, each point in the diagram represents a certain position in space and time, and is called an '''event''', regardless of whether anything relevant happens there.

== Basics ==
=== Position versus time graphs ===
[[File:Distance-time graph example.svg|thumb]]
In the study of 1-dimensional kinematics, position vs. time graphs (also called distance vs. time graphs, or p-t graphs) provide a useful means to describe motion. The specific features of the motion of objects are demonstrated by the shape and the slope of the lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What are position vs. time graphs? |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/displacement-velocity-time/a/position-vs-time-graphs |publisher=Khan Academy |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the accompanying figure, the plotted object moves away from the origin at a uniform speed of 1.66&amp;nbsp;m/s for six seconds, halts for five seconds, then returns to the origin over a period of seven seconds at a non-constant speed.

=== Spacetime diagrams ===
At its most basic level, a spacetime diagram is merely a time vs position graph, with the directions of the axes in a usual p-t graph exchanged, that is, the vertical axis refers to temporal and the horizontal axis to spatial coordinate values. Especially when used in STR, the temporal axes of a spacetime diagram are scaled with the speed of light {{mvar|c}}, and thus are often labeled by {{mvar|ct.}} This changes the dimension of the addressed physical quantity from &lt;''Time''&gt; to &lt;''Length''&gt;, in accordance to the dimension associated to the spatial axes, which are frequently labeled {{mvar|x.}}

=== Standard configuration ===
[[File:Standard configuration of coordinate systems.svg|thumb|Galilean diagram of two frames of reference in standard configuration.]]

To ease insight in how spacetime coordinates, measured by observers in different [[Inertial frame of reference|reference frames]], compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup. With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. Setting the temporal component aside for the moment, two  [[Galilean reference frame]]s (i.e. conventional 3-space frames), S and S' (pronounced "S&amp;nbsp;prime"), each with observers O and O' at rest in their respective frames, but measuring the other as moving with speeds ±''v'' are said to be in ''standard configuration'', when:
* The ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective primed axes of frame S′.
* Frame S′ moves in the ''x''-direction of frame S with a constant velocity ''v'' as measured in frame S.
* The origins of frames S and S′ coincide for time ''t'' = 0 in frame S and ''t''′ = 0 in frame S′.&lt;ref name="Collier"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Most Incomprehensible Thing: Notes Towards a Very Gentle Introduction to the Mathematics of Relativity|last1=Collier|first1=Peter|publisher=Incomprehensible Books|year=2017|isbn=9780957389465|edition=3rd|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}}

This spatial setting is displayed in the accompanying figure, in which the temporal coordinates are separately annotated as quantities ''t'' and ''t'''.

In a further step of simplification it is often possible to consider just the direction of the observed motion and ignore the other two spatial components, allowing ''x'' and ''ct'' to be plotted in 2-dimensional spacetime diagrams, as introduced above.

=== Minkowski diagrams ===
The term Minkowski diagram refers to a specific form of spacetime diagram frequently used in special relativity.  The term is used in both a generic and particular sense. In general, a Minkowski diagram is a two-dimensional graphical depiction of a portion of [[Minkowski space]], usually where space has been curtailed to a single dimension. The units of measurement in these diagrams are taken such that the [[light cone]] at an event consists of the lines of [[slope]] plus or minus one through that event.&lt;ref&gt;Mermin (1968) Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; The horizontal lines correspond to the usual notion of ''simultaneous events'' for a stationary observer at the origin.

A particular Minkowski diagram illustrates the result of a [[Lorentz transformation]]. The Lorentz transformation relates two [[inertial frames of reference]], where an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]] stationary at the event {{nowrap|(0, 0)}} makes a change of [[velocity]] along the {{math|''x''}}-axis. The new time axis of the observer forms an angle {{math|''α''}} with the previous time axis, with {{math|''α'' &lt; {{sfrac|π|4}}}} (see the first figure on the right). In the new frame of reference the simultaneous events lie parallel to a line inclined by {{math|''α''}} to the previous lines of simultaneity. This is the new {{math|''x''}}-axis. Both the original set of axes and the primed set of axes have the property that they are orthogonal with respect to the [[Minkowski inner product]] or ''relativistic dot product''.

Whatever the magnitude of {{mvar|α}}, the line {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''x''}} forms the universal&lt;ref&gt;See [[Vladimir Karapetoff]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bisection|bisector]].

The space and time [[units of measurement]] on the axes may, for example, be taken as one of the following pairs:
* Units of 30 centimetres length and [[nanosecond]]s
* [[Astronomical unit]]s and intervals of 8 minutes and 20 seconds (500 seconds)
* [[Light year]]s and [[year]]s
* [[Light-second]] and second

This way, light paths are represented by lines parallel to the bisector between the axes.

== Spacetime diagrams in Newtonian physics ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - Newtonian physics.svg|thumb|right|256px|In Newtonian physics for both observers the event at A is assigned to the same point in time.]]
The black axes labelled {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''ct''}} on the adjoining diagram are the coordinate system of an observer, referred to as 'at rest', and who is positioned at {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}. This observer's world line is identical with the {{math|''ct''}} time axis. Each parallel line to this axis would correspond also to an object at rest but at another position. The blue line describes an object moving with constant speed {{math|''v''}} to the right, such as a moving observer.

This blue line labelled {{math|''ct''′}} may be interpreted as the time axis for the second observer. Together with the {{math|''x''}} axis, which is identical for both observers, it represents their coordinate system. Since the reference frames are in standard configuration, both observers agree on the location of the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of their coordinate systems. The axes for the moving observer are not [[perpendicular]] to each other and the scale on their time axis is stretched. To determine the coordinates of a certain event, two lines, each parallel to one of the two axes, must be constructed passing through the event, and their intersections with the axes read off.

Determining position and time of the event A as an example in the diagram leads to the same time for both observers, as expected. Only for the position different values result, because the moving observer has approached the position of the event A since {{math|1=''t'' =  0}}. Generally stated, all events on a line parallel to the {{math|''x''}} axis happen simultaneously for both observers. There is only one universal time {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''t''′}}, modelling the existence of one common position axis. On the other hand, due to two different time axes the observers usually measure different coordinates for the same event. This graphical translation from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''t''}} to {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''t''′}} and vice versa is described mathematically by the so-called [[Galilean transformation]].

:*Various English translations on Wikisource: [[s:Space and Time|Space and Time]]&lt;/ref&gt; Space and time have properties which lead to different rules for the translation of coordinates in case of moving observers. In particular, events which are estimated to happen simultaneously from the viewpoint of one observer, happen at different times for the other.

In the Minkowski diagram this [[relativity of simultaneity]] corresponds with the introduction of a separate &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; for the moving observer. Following the rule described above, each observer interprets all events on a line parallel to his &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; axis as simultaneous. The sequence of events from the viewpoint of an observer can be illustrated graphically by shifting this line in the diagram from bottom to top.

If {{math|''ct''}} instead of {{math|''t''}} is assigned on the time axes, the angle {{math|''α''}} between the {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''′}} axes will be identical with that between the time axes {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''ct''′}}. This follows from the second postulate of special relativity, which says that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion (see below). The angle {{math|''α''}} is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mechanics and Thermodynamics |edition=illustrated |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Demtröder |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-27877-3 |page=92-93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWUSDgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TWUSDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93 Extract of page 93]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MinkScale.svg|thumb|right|256px|Different scales on the axes.]]
The corresponding translation from {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''t''}} to {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''t''′}} and vice versa is described mathematically by the [[Lorentz transformation]]. Whatever space and time axes arise through such transformation, in a Minkowski diagram they correspond to [[conjugate diameters]] of a pair of [[hyperbola]]s. The scales on the axes are given as follows: If {{math|''U''}} is the unit length on the axes of {{math|''ct''}} and {{math|''x''}} respectively, the unit length on the axes of {{math|''ct''′}} and {{math|''x''′}} is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jürgen |last=Freund |title=Special Relativity for Beginners: A Textbook for Undergraduates |publisher=World Scientific| year=2008 |pages=49|isbn=981277159X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;U'=U\cdot\sqrt\frac{1+\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The {{math|''ct''}}-axis represents the worldline of a clock resting in {{math|''S''}}, with {{math|''U''}} representing the duration between two events happening on this worldline, also called the [[proper time]] between these events. Length {{math|''U''}} upon the {{math|''x''}}-axis represents the rest length or [[proper length]] of a rod resting in {{math|''S''}}. The same interpretation can also be applied to distance {{math|''U''′}} upon the {{math|''ct''′}}- and {{math|''x''′}}-axes for clocks and rods resting in {{math|''S''′}}.

=== History  ===
In Minkowski’s 1908 paper there were three diagrams, first to illustrate the Lorentz transformation, then the partition of the plane by the light-cone, and finally illustration of worldlines.&lt;ref name=minko /&gt; The first diagram used a branch of the [[unit hyperbola]] &lt;math&gt; t^2 - x^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; to show the locus of a unit of [[proper time]] depending on velocity, thus illustrating time dilation. The second diagram showed the conjugate hyperbola to calibrate space, where a similar stretching leaves the impression of [[FitzGerald contraction]]. In 1914 [[Ludwik Silberstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silberstein |first=Ludwik |date=1914 |title=The Theory of Relativity |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; included a diagram of "Minkowski’s representation of the Lorentz transformation". This diagram included the unit hyperbola, its conjugate, and a pair of [[conjugate diameters]]. Since the 1960s a version of this more complete configuration has been referred to as The Minkowski Diagram, and used as a standard illustration of the [[transformation geometry]] of special relativity. [[E. T. Whittaker]] has pointed out that the [[principle of relativity]] is tantamount to the arbitrariness of what hyperbola radius is selected for [[time]] in the Minkowski diagram. In 1912 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Edwin B. Wilson]] applied the methods of [[synthetic geometry]] to develop the properties of the [[non-Euclidean]] plane that has Minkowski diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Edwin B.|last=Wilson|author1-link=Edwin B.

While the rest frame has space and time axes at right angles, the moving frame has primed axes which form an acute angle. Since the frames are meant to be equivalent, the asymmetry may be disturbing. However, several authors showed that there is a frame of reference between the resting and moving ones where their symmetry would be apparent ("median frame").&lt;ref name=mirimanoff /&gt; In this frame, the two other frames are moving in opposite directions with equal speed. Using such coordinates makes the units of length and time the same for both axes. If {{math|''β'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} and {{math|''γ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|{{sqrt|1 − ''β''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}}} is given between S and S′, then these expressions are connected with the values in their median frame S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:&lt;ref name=mirimanoff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirimanoff|first=Dmitry|title=La transformation de Lorentz-Einstein et le temps universel de M.

(2) &amp;  &amp; \beta_{0} &amp; =\frac{\gamma-1}{\beta\gamma}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, if {{math|''β'' {{=}} 0.5}} between S and S′, then by (2) they are moving in their median frame S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with approximately {{math|±0.268''c''}} each in opposite directions. On the other hand, if {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0.5}} in S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then by (1) the relative velocity between S and S′ in their own rest frames is {{math|0.8''c''}}. The construction of the axes of S and S′ is done in accordance with the ordinary method using {{math|tan ''α'' {{=}} ''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} with respect to the orthogonal axes of the median frame (Fig. 1).

However, it turns out that, when drawing such a symmetric diagram, it is possible to derive the diagram's relations even without mentioning the median frame and {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} at all. Instead, the relative velocity {{math|''β'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} between S and S′ can directly be used in the following construction, providing the same result:&lt;ref name=sartori&gt;{{cite book |first=Leo |last=Sartori  |title=Understanding Relativity: A simplified approach to Einstein's theories |isbn=0-520-20029-2 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996|pages=151ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''φ''}} is the angle between the axes of {{math|''ct''′}} and {{math|''ct''}} (or between {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''′}}), and {{math|''θ''}} between the axes of {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''ct''′}}, it is given:&lt;ref name=sartori /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shado /&gt;

\cos\varphi=\sin\theta &amp; =\frac{1}{\gamma},\\
\tan\varphi=\cot\theta &amp; =\beta\cdot\gamma.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Two methods of construction are obvious from Fig. 2: (a) The {{math|''x''}}-axis is drawn perpendicular to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis, the {{math|''x''′}} and {{math|''ct''}}-axes are added at angle {{math|''φ''}}; (b) the ''x''′-axis is drawn at angle {{math|''θ''}} with respect to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis, the {{math|''x''}}-axis is added perpendicular to the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis and the {{math|''ct''}}-axis perpendicular to the {{math|''x''′}}-axis.

Also the components of a vector can be vividly demonstrated by such diagrams (Fig. 3): The parallel projections {{math|(''x'', ''t''; ''x''′ ,''t''′)}} of vector {{math|''R''}} are its [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] components, {{math|(''ξ'', ''τ''; ''ξ''′, ''τ''′)}} its covariant components.&lt;ref name=gruner1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gruner2 /&gt;

*[[Max Born]] (1920) drew Minkowski diagrams by placing the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis almost perpendicular to the {{math|''x''}}-axis, as well as the {{math|''ct''}}-axis to the {{math|''x''′}}-axis, in order to demonstrate length contraction and time dilation in the symmetric case of two rods and two clocks moving in opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Born|first=Max|title=Die Relativitätstheorie Einsteins|trans-title=Einstein's Theory of Relativity|location=|pages=177–180|publisher=Springer|year=1920|edition=First|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006663730}} See also [{{Google books|plainurl=y|id=de_6AAAAQBAJ|page=187}} Reprint (2013) of third edition (1922) at Google books, p. 187]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Time dilation ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - time dilation.svg|thumb|right|256px|Time dilation: Both observers consider the clock of the other as running slower.]]
Relativistic time dilation means that a clock (indicating its [[proper time]]) that moves relative to an observer is observed to run slower. In fact, time itself in the frame of the moving clock is observed to run slower. This can be read immediately from the adjoining Loedel diagram quite straightforwardly because unit lengths in the two system of axes are identical. Thus, in order to compare reading between the two systems, we can simply compare lengths as they appear on the page: we do not need to consider the fact that unit lengths on each axis are warped by the factor
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt\frac{1+\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
which we would have to account for in the corresponding Minkowski diagram.

The observer whose reference frame is given by the black axes is assumed to move from the origin O towards A. The moving clock has the reference frame given by the blue axes and moves from O to B. For the black observer, all events happening simultaneously with the event at A are located on a straight line parallel to its space axis. This line passes through A and B, so A and B are simultaneous from the reference frame of the observer with black axes. However, the clock that is moving relative to the black observer marks off time along the blue time axis. This is represented by the distance from O to B. Therefore, the observer at A with the black axes notices their clock as reading the distance from O to A while they observe the clock moving relative him or her to read the distance from O to B. Due to the distance from O to B being smaller than the distance from O to A, they conclude that the time passed on the clock moving relative to them is smaller than that passed on their own clock.

A second observer, having moved together with the clock from O to B, will argue that the other clock has reached only C until this moment and therefore this clock runs slower. The reason for these apparently paradoxical statements is the different determination of the events happening synchronously at different locations. Due to the principle of relativity, the question of who is right has no answer and does not make sense.
{{clear}}

== Length contraction ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - length contraction.svg|thumb|right|256px|Length contraction: Both observers consider objects moving with the other observer as being shorter.]]
Relativistic length contraction means that the [[proper length]] of an object moving relative to an observer is decreased and finally also the space itself is contracted in this system. The observer is assumed again to move along the {{math|''ct''}}-axis. The world lines of the endpoints of an object moving relative to him are assumed to move along the {{math|''ct''′}}-axis and the parallel line passing through A and B. For this observer the endpoints of the object at {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}} are O and A. For a second observer moving together with the object, so that for him the object is at rest, it has the proper length OB at {{nowrap|1=''t''′ = 0}}. Due to {{nowrap|OA &lt; OB}}. the object is contracted for the first observer.

The second observer will argue that the first observer has evaluated the endpoints of the object at O and A respectively and therefore at different times, leading to a wrong result due to his motion in the meantime. If the second observer investigates the length of another object with endpoints moving along the {{math|''ct''}}-axis and a parallel line passing through C and D he concludes the same way this object to be contracted from OD to OC. Each observer estimates objects moving with the other observer to be contracted. This apparently paradoxical situation is again a consequence of the relativity of simultaneity as demonstrated by the analysis via Minkowski diagram.

For all these considerations it was assumed, that both observers take into account the speed of light and their distance to all events they see in order to determine the actual times at which these events happen from their point of view.

== Constancy of the speed of light ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - 3 systems.svg|thumb|right|256px|Minkowski diagram for 3 coordinate systems. For the speeds relative to the system in black {{math|1=''v''′ = 0.4''c''}} and {{math|1=''v''″ = 0.8''c''}} holds.]] Another postulate of special relativity is the constancy of the speed of light. It says that any observer in an inertial reference frame measuring the vacuum speed of light relative to himself obtains the same value regardless of his own motion and that of the light source. This statement seems to be paradoxical, but it follows immediately from the differential equation yielding this, and the Minkowski diagram agrees. It explains also the result of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] which was considered to be a mystery before the theory of relativity was discovered, when photons were thought to be waves through an undetectable medium.

For world lines of photons passing the origin in different directions {{math|1=''x'' = ''ct''}} and {{math|1=''x'' = −''ct''}} holds. That means any position on such a world line corresponds with steps on {{math|''x''}}- and {{math|''ct''}}-axes of equal absolute value. From the rule for reading off coordinates in coordinate system with tilted axes follows that the two world lines are the angle bisectors of the {{math|''x''}}- and {{math|''ct''}}-axes. The Minkowski diagram shows, that they are angle bisectors of the {{math|''x′''}}- and {{math|''ct''′}}-axes as well. That means both observers measure the same speed {{math|''c''}} for both photons.

Further coordinate systems corresponding to observers with arbitrary velocities can be added to this Minkowski diagram. For all these systems both photon world lines represent the angle bisectors of the axes. The more the relative speed approaches the speed of light the more the axes approach the corresponding angle bisector. The &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis is always more flat and the time axis more steep than the photon world lines. The scales on both axes are always identical, but usually different from those of the other coordinate systems.

== Speed of light and causality ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - causality.svg|thumb|right|256px|Past and future relative to the origin. For the grey areas a corresponding temporal classification is not possible.]]
Straight lines passing the origin which are steeper than both photon world lines correspond with objects moving more slowly than the speed of light. If this applies to an object, then it applies from the viewpoint of all observers, because the world lines of these photons are the angle bisectors for any inertial reference frame. Therefore, any point above the origin and between the world lines of both photons can be reached with a speed smaller than that of the light and can have a cause-and-effect relationship with the origin. This area is the absolute future, because any event there happens later compared to the event represented by the origin regardless of the observer, which is obvious graphically from the Minkowski diagram.

Following the same argument the range below the origin and between the photon world lines is the absolute past relative to the origin. Any event there belongs definitely to the past and can be the cause of an effect at the origin.

The relationship between any such pairs of event is called ''timelike'', because they have a time distance greater than zero for all observers. A straight line connecting these two events is always the time axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same place. Two events which can be connected just with the speed of light are called ''lightlike''.

In principle a further dimension of space can be added to the Minkowski diagram leading to a three-dimensional representation. In this case the ranges of future and past become [[cone (geometry)|cone]]s with apexes touching each other at the origin. They are called [[light cones]].

== The speed of light as a limit ==
[[File:Minkowski diagram - time travel.svg|thumb|right|256px|Sending a message at superluminal speed from O via A to B into the past. Both observers consider the temporal order of the pairs of events O and A as well as A and B different.]]
Following the same argument, all straight lines passing through the origin and which are more nearly horizontal than the photon world lines, would correspond to objects or signals moving [[Faster-than-light|faster than light]] regardless of the speed of the observer. Therefore, no event outside the light cones can be reached from the origin, even by a light-signal, nor by any object or signal moving with less than the speed of light. Such pairs of events are called ''spacelike'' because they have a finite spatial distance different from zero for all observers. On the other hand, a straight line connecting such events is always the space coordinate axis of a possible observer for whom they happen at the same time. By a slight variation of the velocity of this coordinate system in both directions it is always possible to find two inertial reference frames whose observers estimate the chronological order of these events to be different.

Therefore, an object moving faster than light, say from O to A in the adjoining diagram, would imply that, for any observer watching the object moving from O to A, another observer can be found (moving at less than the speed of light with respect to the first) for whom the object moves from A to O. The question of which observer is right has no unique answer, and therefore makes no physical sense. Any such moving object or signal would violate the principle of causality.

Also, any general technical means of sending signals faster than light would permit information to be sent into the originator's own past. In the diagram, an observer at O in the {{math|''x''-''ct''}} system sends a message moving faster than light to A. At A, it is received by another observer, moving so as to be in the {{math|''x''′-''ct''′}} system, who sends it back, again faster than light, arriving at B. But B is in the past relative to O. The absurdity of this process becomes obvious when both observers subsequently confirm that they received no message at all, but all messages were directed towards the other observer as can be seen graphically in the Minkowski diagram. Furthermore, if it were possible to accelerate an observer to the speed of light, their space and time axes would coincide with their angle bisector. The coordinate system would collapse, in concordance with the fact that due to [[time dilation]], time would effectively stop passing for them.

These considerations show that the speed of light as a limit is a consequence of the properties of spacetime, and not of the properties of objects such as technologically imperfect space ships. The prohibition of faster-than-light motion, therefore, has nothing in particular to do with electromagnetic waves or light, but comes as a consequence of the structure of spacetime.

==Eponym==
When Taylor and Wheeler composed ''Spacetime Physics'' (1966), they did ''not'' use the term "Minkowski diagram" for their spacetime geometry. Instead they included an acknowledgement of Minkowski’s contribution to philosophy by the totality of his innovation of 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor |last2=Wheeler |title=Spacetime Physics |date=1966 |page=37 |quote=Minkowski's insight is central to the understanding of the physical world. It focuses attention on those quantities, such as interval, which are the same in all frames of reference. It brings out the relative character of quantities, such as velocity, energy, time, distance, which depend on the frame of reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When abstracted to a line drawing, then any figure showing conjugate hyperbolas, with a selection of conjugate diameters, falls into this category. Students making drawings to accompany the exercises in [[George Salmon]]’s ''A Treatise on Conic Sections'' (1900) at pages 165–171 (on conjugate diameters) will be making Minkowski diagrams.

==Spacetime diagram of an accelerating observer in special relativity==

[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed]]

The momentarily co-moving inertial frames along the world line of a rapidly accelerating observer (center). The vertical direction indicates time, while the horizontal indicates distance, the dashed line is the spacetime trajectory ("world line") of the observer. The small dots are specific events in spacetime. If one imagines these events to be the flashing of a light, then the events that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past light cone of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer. The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22396">In [[abstract algebra]] and [[multilinear algebra]], a '''multilinear form''' on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] of the type &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;f: V^k \to K  &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a [[vector space]] over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (or more generally, a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[commutative ring]]), that is separately ''K''-[[linear]] in each of its &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Multilinear Form|urlname=MultilinearForm}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The rest of this article, however, will only consider multilinear forms on finite-dimensional vector spaces.)

A multilinear ''k''-form on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ('''covariant''') '''''k''-tensor''', and the vector space of such forms is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Many authors use the opposite convention, writing &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the contravariant ''k''-tensors on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}_k(V)&lt;/math&gt; to denote the covariant ''k''-tensors on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tensor product ==
Given ''k''-tensor &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{T}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; and ''ℓ''-tensor &lt;math&gt;g\in\mathcal{T}^\ell(V)&lt;/math&gt;, a product &lt;math&gt;f\otimes g\in\mathcal{T}^{k+\ell}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, known as the '''tensor product''', can be defined by the property&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;(f\otimes g)(v_1,\ldots,v_k,v_{k+1},\ldots, v_{k+\ell})=f(v_1,\ldots,v_k)g(v_{k+1},\ldots, v_{k+\ell})&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/blockquote&gt;for all &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots,v_{k+\ell}\in V&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[tensor product]] of multilinear forms is not commutative; however it is bilinear and associative: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;f\otimes(ag_1+bg_2)=a(f\otimes g_1)+b(f\otimes g_2)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(af_1+bf_2)\otimes g=a(f_1\otimes g)+b(f_2\otimes g)&lt;/math&gt;, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;(f\otimes g)\otimes h=f\otimes (g\otimes h)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;If &lt;math&gt;(v_1,\ldots, v_n)&lt;/math&gt; forms a basis for ''n''-dimensional vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\phi^1,\ldots,\phi^n)&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding dual basis for the dual space &lt;math&gt;V^*=\mathcal{T}^1(V)&lt;/math&gt;, then the products &lt;math&gt;\phi^{i_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes\phi^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;1\le i_1,\ldots,i_k\le n&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; has dimensionality &lt;math&gt;n^k&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

===Bilinear forms===

''Main article: [[Bilinear form|Bilinear forms]]''

If &lt;math&gt;k=2
&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f:V\times V\to K&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as a '''bilinear form'''.  A familiar and important example of a (symmetric) bilinear form is the [[Dot product|standard inner product]] (dot product) of vectors.
===Alternating multilinear forms===

''Main article: [[Alternating multilinear map|Alternating multilinear maps]]''

An important class of multilinear forms are the '''alternating multilinear forms''', which have the additional property that&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Manifolds|last=Tu|first=Loring W.|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4419-7399-3|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x_{\sigma(1)},\ldots, x_{\sigma(k)}) = \mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)f(x_1,\ldots, x_k) &lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\mathbf{N}_k\to\mathbf{N}_k&lt;/math&gt; is a [[permutation]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; denotes its [[Sign of a permutation|sign]] (+1 if even, –1 if odd).  As a consequence, [[Alternating multilinear map|alternating]] multilinear forms are antisymmetric with respect to swapping of any two arguments (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\sigma(p)=q,\sigma(q)=p &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma(i)=i, 1\le i\le k, i\neq p,q &lt;/math&gt;):&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots, x_p,\ldots, x_q,\ldots, x_k) = -f(x_1,\ldots, x_q,\ldots, x_p,\ldots, x_k) &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;With the additional hypothesis that the [[Characteristic (field)|characteristic of the field]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is not 2, setting &lt;math&gt;x_p=x_q=x &lt;/math&gt; implies as a corollary that &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots, x,\ldots, x,\ldots, x_k) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;; that is, the form has a value of 0 whenever two of its arguments are equal.  Note, however, that some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces|last=Halmos|first=Paul R.|publisher=Van Nostrand|year=1958|isbn=0-387-90093-4|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; use this last condition as the defining property of alternating forms.  This definition implies the property given at the beginning of the section, but as noted above, the converse implication holds only when &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{char}(K)\neq 2 &lt;/math&gt;.

An alternating multilinear ''k''-form on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is called a  '''multicovector of degree ''k''''' or '''''k''-covector''', and the vector space of such alternating forms, a subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt;, is generally denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt;, or, using the notation for the isomorphic ''k''th [[exterior power]] of &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt;(the [[dual space]] of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\bigwedge^k V^*&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Spivak uses &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; for the space of ''k''-covectors on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.  However, this notation is more commonly reserved for the space of differential ''k''-forms on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.  In this article, we use &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; to mean the latter.&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that linear functionals (multilinear 1-forms over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;) are trivially alternating, so that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^1(V)=\mathcal{T}^1(V)=V^*&lt;/math&gt;, while, by convention, 0-forms are defined to be scalars: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^0(V)=\mathcal{T}^0(V)=\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[determinant]] on &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices, viewed as an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; argument function of the column vectors, is an important example of an alternating multilinear form.

==== Wedge product ====
The tensor product of alternating multilinear forms is, in general, no longer alternating.  However, by summing over all permutations of the tensor product, taking into account the parity of each term, the '''wedge product''' (&lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;) of multicovectors can be defined, so that if &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{A}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in\mathcal{A}^\ell(V)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f\wedge g\in\mathcal{A}^{k+\ell}(V)&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;(f\wedge g)(v_1,\ldots, v_{k+\ell})=\frac{1}{k!\ell!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_{k+\ell}}
(\mathrm{sgn}(\sigma))f(v_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,v_{\sigma(k)})g(v_{\sigma(k+1)}
,\ldots,v_{\sigma(k+\ell)})&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/blockquote&gt;where the sum is taken over the set of all permutations over &lt;math&gt;k+\ell&lt;/math&gt; elements, &lt;math&gt;S_{k+\ell}&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[wedge product]] is bilinear, associative, and anticommutative: if &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathcal{A}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in\mathcal{A}^\ell(V)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f\wedge g=(-1)^{k\ell}g\wedge f&lt;/math&gt;. 

Given a basis &lt;math&gt;(v_1,\ldots, v_n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and dual basis &lt;math&gt;(\phi^1,\ldots,\phi^n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;V^*=\mathcal{A}^1(V)&lt;/math&gt;, the wedge products &lt;math&gt;\phi^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge\phi^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;1\leq i_1&lt;\cdots&lt;i_k\leq n&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the dimensionality of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^k(V)&lt;/math&gt; for ''n''-dimensional &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\tbinom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!\,k!}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Differential forms===
''Main article: [[Differential form|Differential forms]]''

Differential forms are mathematical objects constructed via tangent spaces and multilinear forms that behave, in many ways, like [[Differential of a function|differentials]] in the classical sense.  Though conceptually and computationally useful, differentials are founded on ill-defined notions of infinitesimal quantities developed early in the [[history of calculus]].  Differential forms provide a mathematically rigorous and precise framework to modernize this long-standing idea.  Differential forms are especially useful in [[multivariable calculus]] (analysis) and [[differential geometry]] because they possess transformation properties that allow them be integrated on curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogues ([[Differentiable manifold|differentiable manifolds]]).  One far-reaching application is the modern statement of [[Stokes' theorem]], a sweeping generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] to higher dimensions.  

The synopsis below is primarily based on Spivak (1965)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/SpivakM.CalculusOnManifoldsPerseus2006Reprint|title=Calculus on Manifolds|last=Spivak|first=Michael|publisher=W. A. Benjamin, Inc.|year=1965|isbn=0805390219|location=New York|pages=75–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tu (2011).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Definition and construction of differential 1-forms ====
To define differential forms on open subsets &lt;math&gt;U\subset\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, we first need the notion of the '''tangent space''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, usually denoted &lt;math&gt;T_p\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n_p&lt;/math&gt;. The vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n_p&lt;/math&gt; can be defined most conveniently as the set of elements &lt;math&gt;v_p&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;v\in\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;p\in\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; fixed) with vector addition and scalar multiplication defined by &lt;math&gt;v_p+w_p:=(v+w)_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a\cdot(v_p):=(a\cdot v)_p&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;(e_1,\ldots,e_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the standard basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;((e_1)_p,\ldots,(e_n)_p)&lt;/math&gt; is the analogous standard basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n_p&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, each tangent space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n_p&lt;/math&gt; can simply be regarded as a copy of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (a set of tangent vectors) based at the point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. The collection (disjoint union) of tangent spaces of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; at all &lt;math&gt;p\in\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''tangent bundle''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and is usually denoted &lt;math display="inline"&gt;T\mathbf{R}^n:=\bigcup_{p\in\mathbf{R}^n}\mathbf{R}^n_p&lt;/math&gt;.  While the definition given here provides a simple description of the tangent space of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, there are other, more sophisticated constructions that are better suited for defining the tangent spaces of [[Differentiable manifold|smooth manifolds]] in general (''see the article on [[Tangent space|tangent spaces]] for details'').      

A '''differential ''k''-form''' on &lt;math&gt;U\subset\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a function &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; that assigns to every &lt;math&gt;p\in U&lt;/math&gt; a ''k''-covector on the tangent space of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\omega_p:=\omega(p)\in\mathcal{A}^k(\mathbf{R}^n_p)&lt;/math&gt;.  In brief, a differential ''k-''form is a ''k''-covector field.  The space of ''k''-forms on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(U)&lt;/math&gt;; thus if &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a differential ''k''-form, we write &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega^k(U)&lt;/math&gt;.  By convention, a continuous function on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a differential 0-form: &lt;math&gt;f\in C^0(U)=\Omega^0(U)&lt;/math&gt;.

We first construct differential 1-forms from 0-forms and deduce some of their basic properties.  To simplify the discussion below, we will only consider [[Smoothness|smooth]] differential forms constructed from smooth (&lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt;) functions.  Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbf{R}^n\to\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth function.  We define the 1-form &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p\in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_p\in\mathbf{R}^n_p&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;(df)_p(v_p):=Df|_p(v)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Df|_p:\mathbf{R}^n\to\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.  (Recall that the total derivative is a linear transformation.)  Of particular interest are the projection maps (also known as coordinate functions) &lt;math&gt;\pi^i:\mathbf{R}^n\to\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto x^i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''th standard coordinate of &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.  The 1-forms &lt;math&gt;d\pi^i&lt;/math&gt; are known as the '''basic 1-forms'''; they are conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;dx^i&lt;/math&gt;.  If the standard coordinates of &lt;math&gt;v_p\in\mathbf{R}^n_p&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;(v^1,\ldots, v^n)&lt;/math&gt;, then application of the definition of &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;dx^i_p(v_p)=v^i&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;dx^i_p((e_j)_p)=\delta_j^i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\delta^i_j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].&lt;ref&gt;The Kronecker delta is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}=\delta(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; and defined as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\delta:X\times X\to\{0,1\},\ (i,j)\mapsto \begin{cases} 1, &amp; i=j \\ 0, &amp; i\neq j \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.  Here, the notation &lt;math&gt;\delta^i_j&lt;/math&gt; is used to conform to the tensor calculus convention on the use of upper and lower indices. &lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as the dual of the standard basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n_p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(dx^1_p,\ldots,dx^n_p)&lt;/math&gt; forms a basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^1(\mathbf{R}^n_p)=(\mathbf{R}^n_p)^*&lt;/math&gt;.  As a consequence, if &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a 1-form on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum a_i\,dx^i&lt;/math&gt; for smooth functions &lt;math&gt;a_i:U\to\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthermore, we can derive an expression for &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; that coincides with the classical expression for a total differential:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;df=\sum_{i=1}^n D_i f\; dx^i={\partial f\over\partial x^1}dx^1+\cdots+{\partial f\over\partial x^n}dx^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[''Comments on'' ''notation:'' In this article, we follow the convention from [[tensor calculus]] and differential geometry in which multivectors and multicovectors are written with lower and upper indices, respectively.  Since differential forms are multicovector fields, upper indices are employed to index them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The opposite rule applies to the ''components'' of multivectors and multicovectors, which instead are written with upper and lower indices, respectively.  For instance, we represent the standard coordinates of vector &lt;math&gt;v\in\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;(v^1,\ldots,v^n)&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;v=\sum_{i=1}^n v^ie_i&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the standard basis &lt;math&gt;(e_1,\ldots,e_n)&lt;/math&gt;.  In addition, superscripts appearing in the ''denominator'' of an expression (as in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;) are treated as lower indices in this convention.  When indices are applied and interpreted in this manner, the number of upper indices minus the number of lower indices in each term of an expression is conserved, both within the sum and across an equal sign, a feature that serves as a useful mnemonic device and helps pinpoint errors made during manual computation.]

==== Basic operations on differential ''k''-forms ====
The '''wedge product''' (&lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;) and '''exterior differentiation''' (&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) are two fundamental operations on differential forms.  The wedge product of a ''k''-form and an ''ℓ''-form is a &lt;math&gt;(k+\ell)&lt;/math&gt;-form, while the exterior derivative of a ''k''-form is a &lt;math&gt;(k+1)&lt;/math&gt;-form.  Thus, both operations generate differential forms of higher degree from those of lower degree.

The [[wedge product]] &lt;math&gt;\wedge:\Omega^k(U)\times\Omega^{\ell}(U)\to\Omega^{k+\ell}(U)&lt;/math&gt; of differential forms is a special case of the wedge product of multicovectors in general (''see above'').  As is true in general for the wedge product, the wedge product of differential forms is bilinear, associative, and anticommutative.

More concretely, if &lt;math&gt;\omega=a_{i_1\ldots i_k} dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta=a_{j_1\ldots i_{\ell}} dx^{j_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{j_{\ell}}&lt;/math&gt;, then   &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega\wedge\eta=a_{i_1\ldots i_k}a_{j_1\ldots j_{\ell}}dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}\wedge dx^{j_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{j_{\ell}}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Furthermore, for any set of indices &lt;math&gt;\{\alpha_1\ldots,\alpha_m\}&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;dx^{\alpha_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{\alpha_p}\cdots\wedge \cdots dx^{\alpha_q}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{\alpha_m}=
-dx^{\alpha_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{\alpha_q}\cdots\wedge \cdots dx^{\alpha_p}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{\alpha_m}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;If &lt;math&gt;I=\{i_1,\ldots,i_k\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J=\{j_1,\ldots,j_{\ell}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;I\cap J=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, then the indices of &lt;math&gt;\omega\wedge\eta&lt;/math&gt; can be arranged in ascending order by a (finite) sequence of such swaps.  Since &lt;math&gt;dx^\alpha\wedge dx^\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I\cap J\neq\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\omega\wedge\eta=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, as a consequence of bilinearity, if &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; are the sums of several terms, their wedge product obeys distributivity with respect to each of these terms.  

The collection of the wedge products of basic 1-forms &lt;math&gt;\{dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}|1\leq i_1&lt;\cdots&lt; i_k\leq n\}&lt;/math&gt; constitutes a basis for the space of differential ''k''-forms.  Thus, any &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega^k(U)&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the form&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega=\sum_{i_1&lt;\cdots&lt;i_k} a_{i_1\ldots i_k}dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; (*),&lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math&gt;a_{i_1\ldots i_k}:U\to\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; are smooth functions.  With each set of indices &lt;math&gt;\{i_1,\ldots,i_k\}&lt;/math&gt; placed in ascending order, (*) is said to be the '''standard presentation''' of '''&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;'''. &lt;br&gt;

In the previous section, the 1-form &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt; was defined by taking the exterior derivative of the 0-form (continuous function) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  We now extend this by defining the exterior derivative operator &lt;math&gt;d:\Omega^k(U)\to\Omega^{k+1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k\geq1&lt;/math&gt;.  If the standard presentation of ''k''-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is given by (*), the &lt;math&gt;(k+1)&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;d\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined by&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;d\omega:=\sum_{i_1&lt;\ldots &lt;i_k} da_{i_1\ldots i_k}\wedge dx^{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;A property of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; that holds for all smooth forms is that the second exterior derivative of any &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; vanishes identically: &lt;math&gt;d^2\omega=d(d\omega)\equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;.  This can be established directly from the definition of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Symmetry of second derivatives|equality of mixed second-order partial derivatives]] of &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; functions (''see the article on [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed and exact forms]] for details''). 

==== Integration of differential forms and Stokes' theorem for chains ====
To integrate a differential form over a parameterized domain, we first need to introduce the notion of the '''pullback''' of a differential form.  Roughly speaking, when a differential form is integrated, applying the pullback transforms it in a way that correctly accounts for a change-of-coordinates.   

Given a differentiable function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbf{R}^n\to\mathbf{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; and ''k''-form &lt;math&gt;\eta\in\Omega^k(\mathbf{R}^m)&lt;/math&gt;, we call &lt;math&gt;f^*\eta\in\Omega^k(\mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and define it as the ''k''-form such that &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;(f^*\eta)_p(v_{1p},\ldots, v_{kp}):=\eta_{f(p)}(f_*(v_{1p}),\ldots,f_*(v_{kp}))&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;/blockquote&gt;for &lt;math&gt;v_{1p},\ldots,v_{kp}\in\mathbf{R}^n_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f_*:\mathbf{R}^n_p\to\mathbf{R}^m_{f(p)}&lt;/math&gt; is the map &lt;math&gt;v_p\mapsto(Df|_p(v))_{f(p)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\omega=f\, dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt; is an ''n''-form on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega^n(\mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;), we define its integral over the unit ''n''-cell as the iterated Riemann integral of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{[0,1]^n} \omega = \int_{[0,1]^n} f\,dx^1\wedge\cdots
\wedge dx^n:=
\int_0^1\cdots\int_0^1 f\, dx^1\cdots dx^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Next, we consider a domain of integration parameterized by a differentiable function &lt;math&gt;c:[0,1]^n\to A\subset\mathbf{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, known as an '''''n''-cube'''.  To define the integral of &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega^n(A)&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, we "pull back" from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to the unit ''n''-cell:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_c \omega :=\int_{[0,1]^n}c^*\omega&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;To integrate over more general domains, we define an '''''n-''chain &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C=\sum_i n_ic_i&lt;/math&gt;''' as the formal sum of ''n-''cubes and set&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_C \omega :=\sum_i n_i\int_{c_i}\omega&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;An appropriate definition of the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-[[Chain (algebraic topology)|chain]] &lt;math&gt;\partial C&lt;/math&gt;, known as the boundary of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The formal definition of the boundary of a chain is somewhat involved and is omitted here (''see Spivak (1965), pp.&amp;nbsp;98-99 for a discussion'').  Intuitively, if &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; maps to a square, then &lt;math&gt;\partial C&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of functions that maps to its edges in a counterclockwise manner.  It should be noted that the boundary of a chain is distinct from the notion of a boundary in point-set topology.&lt;/ref&gt; allows us to state the celebrated '''Stokes' theorem''' (Stokes–Cartan theorem) for chains in a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;blockquote&gt;''If &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a'' ''smooth'' &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;''-form on an open set &lt;math&gt;A\subset\mathbf{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;'' ''and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;'' ''is a smooth'' &lt;math&gt;n
&lt;/math&gt;''-chain in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then&lt;math&gt;\int_C d\omega=\int_{\partial C} \omega&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;Using more sophisticated machinery (e.g., [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] and [[Derivation (differential algebra)|derivations]]), the tangent space &lt;math&gt;T_p M&lt;/math&gt; of any smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;) can be defined.  Analogously, a differential form &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt; on a general smooth manifold is a map &lt;math&gt;\omega:p\in M\mapsto\omega_p\in \mathcal{A}^k(T_pM)&lt;/math&gt;.  [[Stokes' theorem]] can be further generalized to arbitrary smooth manifolds-with-boundary and even certain "rough" domains (''see the article on [[Stokes' theorem]] for details'').

The '''Land Surface Model (LSM)''' is a unidimensional computational model developed by ''Gordon Bonan'' that describes ecological processes joined in many [[ecosystem model]]s, hydrological processes found in hydrological models and flow of surface common in surface models using atmospheric models.

In this way, the model examines interactions especially biogeophysics (sensible and latent heat, momentum, albedo, emission of long waves) and biogeochemistry (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the land-atmosphere the effect of surface of the land in the climate and composition of the atmosphere.

This model has a simplified treatment of the surface flows that reproduce at the very least computational cost the essential characteristics of the important interactions of the land-atmosphere for climatic simulations.

As the types of surface vegetated for some species are several, have a standardization of types of covering being enclosed surfaces covered with water as lakes (amongst others); thus the model wheel for each point of independent form, with the same average of the atmospheric interactions. The model functions in a space grating that can vary of a point until global.

==Work==

===Karmarkar's algorithm===
{{main|Karmarkar's algorithm}}

Karmarkar's algorithm solves [[linear programming]] problems in [[polynomial time]]. These problems are represented by "n" variables and "m" constraints. The previous method of solving these problems consisted of problem representation by an "x" sided solid with "y" vertices, where the solution was approached by traversing from vertex to vertex. Karmarkar's novel method approaches the solution by cutting through the above solid in its traversal. Consequently, complex optimization problems are solved much faster using the Karmarkar algorithm. A practical example of this efficiency is the solution to a complex problem in communications network optimization where the solution time was reduced from weeks to days.  His algorithm thus enables faster business and policy decisions. Karmarkar's algorithm has stimulated the development of several [[interior point method]]s, some of which are used in current codes for solving linear programs.

===Paris Kanellakis Award===
The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] awarded him the prestigious [[Paris Kanellakis Award]] in 2000 for his work on polynomial time interior point methods for linear programming.

====Galois geometry====
After working on the [[interior point method|Interior Point Method]], Karmarkar worked on a new [[computer architecture|architecture]] for [[supercomputing]], based on concepts from [[finite geometry|finite]] [[Galois geometry|geometry]], especially [[projective geometry]] over [[finite fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=126029 |title=A new parallel architecture for sparse matrix computation based on finite projective geometries |work=Proceedings of the 1991 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing |last=Karmarkar |first=Narendra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karmarkar, N.

K., A New Parallel Architecture for Scientific Computation Based on Finite Projective Geometries, Proceeding of Mathematical Programming, State of the Art, pp. 136148 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current investigations====
Currently, he is synthesizing these concepts with some new ideas he calls ''sculpturing free space'' (a non-linear analogue of what has popularly been described as ''folding the perfect corner'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923774,00.html |title=Folding the Perfect Corner |work=Time Magazine |date=1984-12-03 |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last=Angier |first=Natalie}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach allows him to extend this work to the physical design of machines.

In mathematics, the '''Narumi polynomials''' ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are polynomials introduced by {{harvtxt|Narumi|1929}} given by the [[generating function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sum s_n(x)t^n/n! = \left(\frac{t}{\log(1+t)}\right)^a(1+t)^x&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">In [[chemistry]], an '''open-chain compound''' (also spelled as open chain compound) or '''acyclic compound''' (Greek prefix "α", ''without'' and "κύκλος", ''cycle'') is a compound with a linear structure, rather than a [[Cyclic compound|cyclic]] one.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=P04724|title=polycyclic system}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An open-chain compound having no [[side chain]]s is called a '''straight-chain compound''' (also spelled as straight chain compound).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coles|first1=Lydia|title=A chromatographic method for the separation of branched-chain and straight-chain compounds of columns containing urea|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=32|pages=657|year=1968|doi=10.1016/S0021-9673(01)80544-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=silazanes|file=S05669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the simple molecules of [[organic chemistry]], such as the [[alkane]]s and [[alkene]]s, have both linear and ring [[isomer]]s, that is, both acyclic and [[cyclic compound|cyclic]], with the latter often classified as [[aromaticity|aromatic]]. For those with 4 or more carbons, the linear forms can have straight-chain or branched-chain isomers. The lowercase prefix ''n-'' denotes the straight-chain isomer; for example, ''n''-butane is straight-chain [[butane]], whereas ''i''-butane is [[isobutane]]. [[Cycloalkane]]s are isomers of alkenes, not of alkanes, because the ring's closure involves a C=C bond. Having no rings (aromatic or otherwise), all open-chain compounds are [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]].

Typically in [[biochemistry]], some isomers are more prevalent than others. For example, in living organisms, the [[glucose#Open-chain form|open-chain isomer of glucose]] usually exists only transiently, in small amounts; [[glucose|D-glucose]] is the usual isomer; and [[L-Glucose|L-glucose]] is rare.

Straight-chain molecules are often not literally straight, in the sense that their [[bond angle]]s are often not 180°, but the name reflects that they are [[schematic]]ally straight. For example, the straight-chain alkanes are wavy or "puckered", as the models below show.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6554">[[File:Vamos matroid.svg|thumb|The [[Vámos matroid]], a paving matroid of rank four; the shaded parallelograms depict its five circuits of size four]]
In the mathematical theory of [[matroid]]s, a '''paving matroid''' is a matroid in which every circuit has size at least as large as the matroid's rank. In a matroid of rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; every circuit has size at most &lt;math&gt;r+1&lt;/math&gt;, so it is equivalent to define paving matroids as the matroids in which the size of every circuit belongs to the set &lt;math&gt;\{r,r+1\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="w"&gt;{{harvtxt|Welsh|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been conjectured that [[almost all]] matroids are paving matroids.

==Examples==
Every simple matroid of rank three is a paving matroid; for instance this is true of the [[Fano plane|Fano matroid]].  The [[Vámos matroid]] provides another example, of rank four.

[[Uniform matroid]]s of rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; have the property that every circuit is of length exactly &lt;math&gt;r+1&lt;/math&gt; and hence are all paving matroids;&lt;ref name=Ox26&gt;{{harvnb|Oxley|1992|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the converse does not hold, for example, the [[cycle matroid]] of the [[complete graph]] &lt;math&gt;K_4&lt;/math&gt; is paving but not uniform.&lt;ref name=Ox27&gt;{{harvnb|Oxley|1992|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Steiner system]] &lt;math&gt;S(t,k,v)&lt;/math&gt; is a pair &lt;math&gt;(S,\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[finite set]] of size &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-element subsets of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with the property that every &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-element subset of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is also a subset of exactly one set in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.  The elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; form a &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-partition of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and hence are the hyperplanes of a paving matroid on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ox367&gt;{{harvnb|Oxley|1992|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''d''-Partitions==
If a paving matroid has rank &lt;math&gt;d+1&lt;/math&gt;, then its hyperplanes form a [[family of sets|set system]] known as a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-partition. A family of two or more sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; forms a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-partition if every set in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; has size at least &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-element subset of &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of exactly one set in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-partition, then it can be used to define a paving matroid on &lt;math&gt;E = \bigcup\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of hyperplanes. In this matroid, a subset &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is independent whenever either &lt;math&gt;|I|\le d&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|I|=d+1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is not a subset of any set in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="w"/&gt;

==Combinatorial enumeration==
[[Combinatorial enumeration]] of the simple matroids on up to nine elements has shown that a large fraction of them are also paving matroids.&lt;ref name="w"/&gt; On this basis, it has been conjectured that [[almost all]] matroids are paving matroids.{{sfnp|Mayhew|Newman|Welsh|Whittle|2011}} More precisely, according to this conjecture, the limit, as ''n'' goes to infinity, of the ratio between the number of paving matroids and the number of all matroids should equal one. If so, the same statement can be made for the '''sparse paving matroids''', matroids that are both paving and dual to a paving matroid. Although this remains open, a similar statement on the asymptotic ratio of the logarithms of the numbers of matroids and sparse paving matroids has been proven.{{sfnp|Pendavingh|van der Pol|2015}}

==History==
Paving matroids were initially studied by {{harvtxt|Hartmanis|1959}}, in their equivalent formulation in terms of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-partitions; Hartmanis called them generalized partition lattices. In their 1970 book ''Combinatorial Geometries'', Henry Crapo and [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] observed that these structures were matroidal; the name "paving matroid" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Welsh|1976}} following a suggestion of Rota.&lt;ref name=Ox75&gt;{{harvnb|Oxley|1992|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simpler structure of paving matroids, compared to arbitrary matroids, has allowed some facts about them to be proven that remain elusive in the more general case. An example is [[Rota's basis conjecture]], the statement that a set of ''n'' disjoint bases in a rank-''n'' matroid can be arranged into an ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrix so that the rows of the matrix are the given bases and the columns are also bases. It has been proven true for paving matroids, but remains open for most other matroids.{{sfnp|Geelen|Humphries|2006}}

In [[chemistry]], the '''pentagonal planar molecular geometry''' describes the shape of compounds where five atoms, groups of atoms, or [[ligand]]s are arranged around a central atom, defining the vertices of a [[pentagon]].

The only two pentagonal planar species known are the [[Isoelectronicity|isoelectronic]] (nine valence electrons) ions [[Tetramethylammonium pentafluoroxenate|{{chem|XeF|5|-}}]] and {{chem|IF|5|2-}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Housecroft |first=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48785">[[File:Railroad-Tracks-Perspective.jpg|thumb|right|These parallel lines appear to intersect in the [[vanishing point]] "at infinity". In a projective plane this is actually true.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''projective plane''' is a geometric structure that extends the concept of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. In the ordinary Euclidean plane, two lines typically intersect in a single point, but there are some pairs of lines (namely, parallel lines) that do not intersect. A projective plane can be thought of as an ordinary plane equipped with additional "points at infinity" where parallel lines intersect. Thus ''any'' two distinct lines in a projective plane intersect in one and only one point.

[[Perspective (graphical)#Renaissance: Mathematical basis|Renaissance]] artists, in developing the techniques of drawing in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], laid the groundwork for this mathematical topic. The archetypical example is the [[real projective plane]], also known as the '''extended Euclidean plane'''.&lt;ref&gt;The phrases "projective plane", "extended affine plane" and "extended Euclidean plane" may be distinguished according to whether the line at infinity is regarded as special (in the so-called "projective" plane it isn't, in the "extended" planes it is) and to whether Euclidean metric is regarded as meaningful (in the projective and affine planes it isn't). Similarly for projective or extended spaces of other dimensions.&lt;/ref&gt; This example, in slightly different guises, is important in [[algebraic geometry]], [[topology]] and [[projective geometry]] where it may be denoted variously by {{nowrap|PG(2, '''R''')}},  '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or '''P'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''), among other notations. There are many other projective planes, both infinite, such as the [[complex projective plane]], and finite, such as the [[Fano plane]].

A projective plane is a 2-dimensional [[projective space]], but not all projective planes can be embedded in 3-dimensional projective spaces. Such embeddability is a consequence of a property known as [[Desargues' theorem]], not shared by all projective planes.

==Definition==

A '''projective plane''' consists of a set of '''lines''', a set of '''points''', and a relation between points and lines called '''incidence''', having the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;In a more formal version of the definition it is pointed out that the terms ''point, line'' and ''incidence'' are [[primitive notion]]s (undefined terms). This formal viewpoint is needed to understand the concept of [[duality (projective geometry)|duality]] when applied to projective planes.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;div id="axioms-of-projective-planes"&gt;
#Given any two distinct points, there is exactly one line incident with both of them.
#Given any two distinct lines, there is exactly one point incident with both of them.
#There are four points such that no line is incident with more than two of them.
&lt;/div&gt;
The second condition means that there are no [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel lines]]. The last condition excludes the so-called '''''degenerate''''' cases (see [[#Degenerate planes|below]]). The term "incidence" is used to emphasize the symmetric nature of the relationship between points and lines. Thus the expression "point ''P'' is incident with line ''ℓ'' " is used instead of either "''P'' is on ''ℓ'' " or "''ℓ'' passes through ''P'' ".

==Some examples==

===The extended Euclidean plane===

To turn the ordinary Euclidean plane into a projective plane proceed as follows:
# To each set of mutually parallel lines add a single new point. That point is considered incident with each line of this set. The point added is distinct for each such set. These new points are called ''[[point at infinity|points at infinity]]''.
# Add a new line, which is considered incident with all the points at infinity (and no other points). This line is called ''the'' [[line at infinity]].

The extended structure is a projective plane and is called the '''extended Euclidean plane''' or the [[real projective plane]]. The process outlined above, used to obtain it, is called "projective completion" or ''projectivization''. This plane can also be constructed by starting from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; viewed as a vector space, see {{section link||Vector space construction}} below.

===Projective Moulton plane===
[[File:Moulton plane2.svg|thumb|right|300px|The ''Moulton plane''. Lines sloping down and to the right are bent where they cross the ''y''-axis.]]
The points of the [[Moulton plane]] are the points of the Euclidean plane, with coordinates in the usual way. To create the Moulton plane from the Euclidean plane some of the lines are redefined. That is, some of their point sets will be changed, but other lines will remain unchanged. Redefine all the lines with negative slopes so that they look like "bent" lines, meaning that these lines keep their points with negative ''x''-coordinates, but the rest of their points are replaced with the points of the line with the same ''y''-intercept but twice the slope wherever their ''x''-coordinate is positive.

The Moulton plane has parallel classes of lines and is an [[affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine plane]]. It can be projectivized, as in the previous example, to obtain the '''projective Moulton plane'''. [[Desargues' theorem]] is not a valid theorem in either the Moulton plane or the projective Moulton plane.

===A finite example===

This example has just thirteen points and thirteen lines. We label the points P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,P&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and the lines m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,m&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[incidence relation]] (which points are on which lines) can be given by the following [[incidence matrix]]. The rows are labelled by the points and the columns are labelled by the lines. A 1 in row ''i'' and column ''j'' means that the point P&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is on the line m&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, while a 0 (which we represent here by a blank cell for ease of reading) means that they are not incident. The matrix is in Paige-Wexler normal form.

To verify the conditions that make this a projective plane, observe that every two rows have exactly one common column in which 1's appear (every pair of distinct points are on exactly one common line) and that every two columns have exactly one common row in which 1's appear (every pair of distinct lines meet at exactly one point). Among many possibilities, the points P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;,and P&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, for example, will satisfy the third condition. This example is known as the '''projective plane of order three'''.

==Vector space construction==

Though the line at infinity of the extended real plane may appear to have a different nature than the other lines of that projective plane, this is not the case. Another construction of the same projective plane shows that no line can be distinguished (on geometrical grounds) from any other. In this construction, each "point" of the real projective plane is the one-dimensional subspace through the origin in a 3-dimensional vector space, and a "line" in the projective plane arises from a plane through the origin in the 3-space. This idea can be generalized and made more precise as follows.&lt;ref name="Baez2002"&gt;Baez (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''K'' be any [[division ring]] (skewfield). Let ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; denote the set of all triples ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of elements of ''K'' (a [[Cartesian product]] viewed as a [[vector space]]). For any nonzero ''x'' in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the minimal subspace of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; containing ''x'' (which may be visualized as all the vectors in a line through the origin) is the subset
:&lt;math&gt;\{ k x : k \in K \}&lt;/math&gt;
of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, let ''x'' and ''y'' be linearly independent elements of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, meaning that {{nowrap|1=''kx'' + ''my'' = 0}} implies that {{nowrap|1=''k'' = ''m'' = 0}}. The minimal subspace of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; containing ''x'' and ''y'' (which may be visualized as all the vectors in a plane through the origin) is the subset
:&lt;math&gt;\{k x + m y : k, m \in K\}&lt;/math&gt;
of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This 2-dimensional subspace contains various 1-dimensional subspaces through the origin that may be obtained by fixing ''k'' and ''m'' and taking the multiples of the resulting vector. Different choices of ''k'' and ''m'' that are in the same ratio will give the same line.

The '''projective plane''' over ''K'', denoted PG(2,''K'') or ''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has a set of ''points'' consisting of all the 1-dimensional subspaces in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. A subset ''L'' of the points of PG(2,''K'') is a ''line'' in PG(2,''K'') if there exists a 2-dimensional subspace of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; whose set of 1-dimensional subspaces is exactly ''L''.

Verifying that this construction produces a projective plane is usually left as a linear algebra exercise.

An alternate (algebraic) view of this construction is as follows. The points of this projective plane are the equivalence classes of the set {{nowrap|''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ∖ {(0, 0, 0)} }} modulo the [[equivalence relation]]
:''x'' ~ ''kx'',  for all ''k'' in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;.
Lines in the projective plane are defined exactly as above.

The coordinates (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of a point in PG(2,''K'') are called '''homogeneous coordinates'''. Each triple (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) represents a well-defined point in PG(2,''K''), except for the triple (0, 0, 0), which represents no point. Each point in PG(2,''K''), however, is represented by many triples.

If ''K'' is a [[topological space]], then ''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,  inherits a topology via the [[product topology|product]], [[subspace topology|subspace]], and [[quotient topology|quotient]] topologies.

===Classical examples===

The [[real projective plane]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,  arises when ''K'' is taken to be the [[real number]]s, '''R'''. As a closed, non-orientable real 2-[[manifold]], it serves as a fundamental example in topology.&lt;ref name="Bredon1993"&gt;The real projective plane appears 37 times in the index of Bredon (1993), for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this construction consider the unit sphere centered at the origin in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Each of the '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; lines in this construction intersects the sphere at two antipodal points. Since the '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; line represents a point of '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, we will obtain the same model of '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by identifying the antipodal points of the sphere. The lines of '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; will be the great circles of the sphere after this identification of antipodal points. This description gives the standard model of [[elliptic geometry]].

The [[complex projective plane]] '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,  arises when ''K'' is taken to be the [[complex number]]s, '''C'''. It is a closed complex 2-manifold, and hence a closed, orientable real 4-manifold. It and projective planes over other [[Field (algebra)|fields]] (known as '''[[pappian plane]]s''') serve as fundamental examples in [[algebraic geometry]].&lt;ref name="Shafarevich1994"&gt;The projective planes over fields are used throughout Shafarevich (1994), for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[quaternionic projective space|quaternionic projective plane]] '''HP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also of independent interest.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

===Finite field planes===

By [[Wedderburn's little theorem|Wedderburn's Theorem]], a finite division ring must be commutative and so a field. Thus, the finite examples of this construction are known as "field planes". Taking ''K'' to be the [[finite field]] of ''q'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; elements with prime ''p'' produces a projective plane of ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''q'' + 1 points. The field planes are usually denoted by PG(2,''q'') where PG stands for projective geometry, the "2" is the dimension and ''q'' is called the '''order''' of the plane (it is one less than the number of points on any line). The Fano plane, discussed below, is denoted by PG(2,2). The [[#A finite example|third example above]] is the projective plane PG(2,3).

[[File:fano plane.svg|thumb|right|The Fano plane. Points are shown as dots; lines are shown as lines or circles.]]

The [[Fano plane]] is the projective plane arising from the field of two elements. It is the smallest projective plane, with only seven points and seven lines. In the figure at right, the seven points are shown as small black balls, and the seven lines are shown as six line segments and a circle. However, one could equivalently consider the balls to be the "lines" and the line segments and circle to be the "points" – this is an example of [[duality (projective geometry)|duality]] in the projective plane: if the lines and points are interchanged, the result is still a projective plane (see [[#Duality|below]]). A permutation of the seven points that carries [[incidence (geometry)|collinear]] points (points on the same line) to collinear points is called a ''[[collineation]]'' or ''[[symmetry]]'' of the plane. The collineations of a geometry form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] under composition, and for the Fano plane this group (PΓL(3,2) = PGL(3,2)) has 168 elements.

=== {{anchor|Desarguesian}} Desargues' theorem and Desarguesian planes===

The [[Desargues' theorem|theorem of Desargues]] is universally valid in a projective plane if and only if the plane can be constructed from a three-dimensional vector space over a skewfield as [[#Vector space construction|above]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hilbert]] proved the more difficult "only if" part of this result.&lt;/ref&gt; These planes are called '''Desarguesian planes''', named after [[Girard Desargues]]. The real (or complex) projective plane and the projective plane of order 3 given [[Projective plane#Some examples|above]] are examples of Desarguesian projective planes. The projective planes that can not be constructed in this manner are called [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s, and the [[Moulton plane]] given [[Projective plane#Some examples|above]] is an example of one. The PG(2,''K'') notation is reserved for the Desarguesian planes. When ''K'' is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], a very common case, they are also known as ''field planes'' and if the field is a [[finite field]] they can be called [[Galois geometry|''Galois planes'']].

==Subplanes==

A '''subplane''' of a projective plane is a subset of the points of the plane which themselves form a projective plane with the same incidence relations.

{{harv|Bruck|1955}} proves the following theorem. Let Π be a finite projective plane of order ''N'' with a proper subplane Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of order ''M''. Then either ''N'' = ''M''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or ''N'' ≥ ''M''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''M''.

When ''N'' is a square, subplanes of order {{sqrt|''N''}} are called ''Baer subplanes''. Every point of the plane lies on a line of a Baer subplane and every line of the plane contains a point of the Baer subplane.

In the finite Desarguesian planes PG(2,''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''), the subplanes have orders which are the orders of the subfields of the finite field GF(''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''), that is, ''p&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' where ''i'' is a divisor of ''n''. In non-Desarguesian planes however, Bruck's theorem gives the only information about subplane orders. The case of equality in the inequality of this theorem is not known to occur. Whether or not there exists a subplane of order ''M'' in a plane of order ''N'' with ''M''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''M'' = ''N'' is an open question. If such subplanes existed there would be projective planes of composite (non-prime power) order.

===Fano subplanes===

A '''Fano subplane''' is a subplane isomorphic to PG(2,2), the unique projective plane of order 2.

If you consider a ''quadrangle'' (a set of 4 points no three collinear) in this plane, the points determine six of the lines of the plane. The remaining three points (called the ''diagonal points'' of the quadrangle) are the points where the lines that do not intersect at a point of the quadrangle meet. The seventh line consists of all the diagonal points (usually drawn as a circle or semicircle).

The name ''Fano'' for this subplane is really a misnomer. [[Gino Fano]] (1871–1952), in developing a new set of axioms for Euclidean geometry, took as an axiom that the diagonal points of any quadrangle are never collinear. This is called ''Fano's Axiom''. A Fano subplane however violates Fano's Axiom. They really should be called ''Anti-Fano subplanes'', but this name change has not had many supporters.

In finite desarguesian planes, PG(2,''q''), Fano subplanes exist if and only if ''q'' is even (that is, a power of 2). The situation in non-desarguesian planes is unsettled. They could exist in any non-desarguesian plane of order greater than 6, and indeed, they have been found in all non-desarguesian planes in which they have been looked for (in both odd and even orders).

An open question is: Does every non-desarguesian plane contain a Fano subplane?

A theorem concerning Fano subplanes  due to {{harv|Gleason|1956}} is:

:If every quadrangle in a finite projective plane has collinear diagonal points, then the plane is desarguesian (of even order).

==Affine planes==

Projectivization of the Euclidean plane produced the real projective plane. The inverse operation &amp;mdash; starting with a projective plane, remove one line and all the points incident with that line &amp;mdash; produces an '''affine plane'''.

===Definition===
More formally an '''[[Affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine plane]]''' consists of a set of '''lines''' and a set of '''points''', and a relation between points and lines called '''incidence''', having the following properties:
&lt;div id="axioms-of-affine-planes"&gt;
#Given any two distinct points, there is exactly one line incident with both of them.
#Given any line l and any point P not incident with l, there is exactly one line incident with P that does not meet l.
#There are four points such that no line is incident with more than two of them.
&lt;/div&gt;
The second condition means that there are  [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel lines]] and is known as [[John Playfair|Playfair's]] axiom. The expression "does not meet" in this condition is shorthand for "there does not exist a point incident with both lines."

The Euclidean plane and the Moulton plane are examples of infinite affine planes. A finite projective plane will produce a finite affine plane when one of its lines and the points on it are removed. The '''order''' of a finite affine plane is the number of points on any of its lines (this will be the same number as the order of the projective plane from which it comes). The affine planes which arise from the projective planes PG(2,''q'') are denoted by AG(2,''q'').

There is a projective plane of order ''N'' if and only if there is an [[affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine plane]] of order ''N''.  When there is only one affine plane of order ''N'' there is only one projective plane of order ''N'', but the converse is not true. The affine planes formed by the removal of different lines of the projective plane will be isomorphic if and only if the removed lines are in the same orbit of the collineation group of the projective plane. These statements hold for infinite projective planes as well.

===Construction of projective planes from affine planes===

The affine plane ''K''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; over ''K'' embeds into ''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; via the map which sends affine (non-homogeneous) coordinates to homogeneous coordinates,
: &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2) \to (1, x_1, x_2).&lt;/math&gt;

The complement of the image is the set of points of the form (0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). From the point of view of the embedding just given, these points are the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]]. They constitute a line in ''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;mdash; namely, the line arising from the plane
:&lt;math&gt;\{k (0, 0, 1) + m (0, 1, 0) : k, m \in K\}&lt;/math&gt;

in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;mdash; called the [[line at infinity]]. The points at infinity are the "extra" points where parallel lines intersect in the construction of the extended real plane; the point (0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is where all lines of slope ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; intersect. Consider for example the two lines
: &lt;math&gt;u = \{(x, 0) : x \in K\}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y = \{(x, 1) : x \in K\}&lt;/math&gt;

in the affine plane ''K''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These lines have slope 0 and do not intersect. They can be regarded as subsets of ''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; via the embedding above, but these subsets are not lines in ''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Add the point (0, 1, 0) to each subset; that is, let
: &lt;math&gt;\bar{u} = \{(1, x, 0) : x \in K\} \cup \{(0, 1, 0)\}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\bar{y} = \{(1, x, 1) : x \in K\} \cup \{(0, 1, 0)\}&lt;/math&gt;

These are lines in ''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; ū arises from the plane
: &lt;math&gt;\{k (1, 0, 0) + m (0, 1, 0) : k, m \in K\}&lt;/math&gt;

in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, while ȳ arises from the plane
: &lt;math&gt;{k (1, 0, 1) + m (0, 1, 0) : k, m \in K}.&lt;/math&gt;
The projective lines ū and ȳ intersect at (0, 1, 0). In fact, all lines in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of slope 0, when projectivized in this manner, intersect at (0, 1, 0) in ''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The embedding of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; into ''K'''''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; given above is not unique. Each embedding produces its own notion of points at infinity. For example, the embedding
: &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2) \to (x_2, 1, x_1),&lt;/math&gt;
has as its complement those points of the form (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, 0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which are then regarded as points at infinity.

When an affine plane does not have the form of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''K'' a division ring, it can still be embedded in a projective plane, but the construction used above does not work. A commonly used method for carrying out the embedding in this case involves expanding the set of affine coordinates and working in a more general "algebra".

===Generalized coordinates===
{{main|Planar ternary ring}}

One can construct a coordinate "ring"&amp;mdash;a so-called [[planar ternary ring]] (not a genuine ring)&amp;mdash;corresponding to any projective plane.  A planar ternary ring need not be a field or division ring, and there are many projective planes that are not constructed from a division ring.  They are called [[non-Desarguesian projective plane]]s and are an active area of research.   The [[Cayley plane]] ('''OP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), a projective plane over the [[octonion]]s, is one of these because the octonions do not form a division ring.&lt;ref name="Baez2002"/&gt;

Conversely, given a planar ternary ring (R,T), a projective plane can be constructed (see below). The relationship is not one to one. A projective plane may be associated with several non-isomorphic planar ternary rings. The ternary operator T can be used to produce two binary operators on the set R, by:
: a + b = T(a,1,b), and
: a • b = T(a,b,0).
The ternary operator is '''''linear''''' if T(x,m,k) = x•m + k. When the set of coordinates of a projective plane actually form a ring, a linear ternary operator may be defined in this way, using the ring operations on the right, to produce a planar ternary ring.

Algebraic properties of this planar ternary coordinate ring turn out to correspond to geometric incidence properties of the plane. For example, [[Desargues' theorem]] corresponds to the coordinate ring being obtained from a [[division ring]], while [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|Pappus's theorem]] corresponds to this ring being obtained from a [[commutative]] field. A projective plane satisfying Pappus's theorem universally is called a ''Pappian plane''. [[Alternative algebra|Alternative]], not necessarily [[associative]], division algebras like the octonions correspond to [[Moufang plane]]s.

There is no known purely geometric proof of the purely geometric statement that Desargues' theorem implies Pappus' theorem in a finite projective plane (finite Desarguesian planes are Pappian).  (The converse is true in any projective plane and is provable geometrically, but finiteness is essential in this statement as there are infinite Desarguesian planes which are not Pappian.)  The most common proof uses coordinates in a division ring and [[Wedderburn's little theorem|Wedderburn's theorem]] that finite division rings must be commutative; {{harvtxt|Bamberg|Penttila|2015}} give a proof that uses only more "elementary" algebraic facts about division rings.

To describe a finite projective plane of order ''N''(≥ 2) using non-homogeneous coordinates and a planar ternary ring:
:Let one point be labelled (''∞'').
:Label ''N'' points, (''r'') where ''r'' = 0, ..., (''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1).
:Label ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; points, (''r'', ''c'') where ''r'', ''c'' = 0, ..., (''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1).
On these points, construct the following lines:
:One line &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''∞''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = { (''∞''), (0), ..., (''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}
:''N'' lines &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {(''∞''), (''c'',0), ..., (''c'', ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}, where ''c'' = 0, ..., (''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)
:''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lines &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''r'', ''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {(''r'') and the points (''x'', '''T'''(''x'',''r'',''c'')) }, where ''x'', ''r'', ''c'' = 0, ..., (''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) and '''T''' is the ternary operator of the planar ternary ring.

For example, for ''N''=2 we can use the symbols {0,1} associated with the finite field of order 2. The ternary operation defined by T(x,m,k) = xm + k with the operations on the right being the multiplication and addition in the field yields the following:
:One line &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''∞''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = { (''∞''), (0), (1)},
:2 lines &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {(''∞''), (''c'',0), (''c'',1) : ''c'' = 0, 1},
::&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {(''∞''), (0,0), (0,1) }
::&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = {(''∞''), (1,0), (1,1) }
:4 lines &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''r'', ''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: (''r'') and the points  (''i'',''ir'' + ''c''), where i = 0, 1 : ''r'', ''c'' = 0, 1.
::&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0,0&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {(0), (0,0), (1,0) }
::&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;0,1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {(0), (0,1), (1,1) }
::&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1,0&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {(1), (0,0), (1,1) }
::&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;1,1&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;: {(1), (0,1), (1,0) }

==Degenerate planes==

[[File:Degenerate planes wec.svg|thumb|(Non-empty) Degenerate Projective Planes]]

Degenerate planes do not fulfill the [[#axioms-of-projective-planes|third condition]] in the definition of a projective plane. They are not structurally complex enough to be interesting in their own right, but from time to time they arise as special cases in general arguments. There are seven degenerate planes {{harv | Albert | Sandler | 1968}}. They are:

# the empty set;
# a single point, no lines;
# a single line, no points;
# a single point, a collection of lines, the point is incident with all of the lines;
# a single line, a collection of points, the points are all incident with the line;
# a point P incident with a line m, an arbitrary (can be empty) collection of lines all incident with P and an arbitrary collection of points all incident with m;
#  a point P not incident with a line m, an arbitrary (perhaps empty) collection of lines all incident with P and all the points of intersection of these lines with m.

These seven cases are not independent, the fourth and fifth can be considered as special cases of the sixth, while the second and third are special cases of the fourth and fifth respectively. The seven cases  can therefore be organized into two families of degenerate planes as follows (this representation is for finite degenerate planes, but may be extended to infinite ones in a natural way):

1) For any number of points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and lines ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;,

:''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}
:''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; }
:''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; }
:...

2) For any number of points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and lines ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,  (same number of points as lines)

:''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }

==Collineations==
{{Main| Collineation}}

A [[collineation]] of a projective plane is a [[Bijective|bijective map]] of the plane to itself which maps points to points and lines to lines that preserves incidence, meaning that if ''σ'' is a bijection and point P is on line m, then P&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; is on m&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Geometers tend to like writing mappings in an exponential notation, so P&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; means ''σ''(P) in a more conventional notation.&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''σ'' is a collineation of a projective plane, a point P with P = P&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; is called a '''''fixed point''''' of ''σ'', and a line m with m = m&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; is called a '''''fixed line''''' of&amp;nbsp;''σ''. The points on a fixed line need not be fixed points, their images under ''σ'' are just constrained to lie on this line. The collection of fixed points and fixed lines of a collineation form a '''''closed configuration''''', which is a system of points and lines that satisfy the first two but not necessarily the third condition in the [[#Definition|definition]] of a projective plane. Thus, the fixed point and fixed line structure for any collineation either form a projective plane by themselves, or a [[#Degenerate planes|degenerate plane]]. Collineations whose fixed structure forms a plane are called '''''planar collineations'''''.

===Homography===
{{Main|Projective transformation}}

A '''[[homography]]''' (or ''projective transformation'') of PG(2,''K'') is a collineation of this type of projective plane which is a linear transformation of the underlying vector space.  Using homogeneous coordinates they can be represented by invertible 3 &amp;times; 3 matrices over ''K'' which act on the points of PG(2,''K'') by ''y'' = ''M'' ''x''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''x'' and ''y'' are points in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (vectors) and ''M'' is an invertible 3 &amp;times; 3 matrix over ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;The points are viewed as row vectors, so to make the matrix multiplication work in this expression, the point ''x'' must be written as a column vector.&lt;/ref&gt; Two matrices represent the same projective transformation if one is a constant multiple of the other. Thus the group of projective transformations is the quotient of the [[general linear group]] by the scalar matrices called the [[projective linear group]].

Another type of collineation of PG(2,''K'') is induced by any [[automorphism]] of ''K'', these are called '''automorphic collineations'''. If α is an automorphism of ''K'', then the collineation given by (x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) → (x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;) is an automorphic collineation. The [[fundamental theorem of projective geometry]] says that all the collineations of PG(2,''K'') are compositions of homographies and automorphic collineations. Automorphic collineations are planar collineations.

==Plane duality==
{{Main|Duality (projective geometry)}}

{{details|Incidence structure#Dual structure}}
A projective plane is defined axiomatically as an [[incidence structure]], in terms of a set ''P'' of points, a set ''L'' of lines, and an [[incidence relation]] ''I'' that determines which points lie on which lines. As P and L are only sets one can interchange their roles and define a '''plane dual structure'''.

By interchanging the role of "points" and "lines" in
:C=(P,L,I)
we obtain the dual structure
:C* =(L,P,I*),
where ''I*'' is the [[inverse relation]] of ''I''.

In a projective plane a statement involving points, lines and incidence between them that is obtained from another such statement by interchanging the words "point" and "line" and making whatever grammatical adjustments that are necessary, is called the '''plane dual statement''' of the first. The plane dual statement of "Two points are on a unique line." is "Two lines meet at a unique point." Forming the plane dual of a statement is known as ''dualizing'' the statement.

If a statement is true in a projective plane C, then the plane dual of that statement must be true in the dual plane C*. This follows since dualizing each statement in the proof "in C" gives a statement of the proof "in C*."

In the projective plane C, it can be shown that there exist four lines, no three of which are concurrent. Dualizing this theorem and the first two axioms in the definition of a projective plane shows that the plane dual structure C* is also a projective plane, called the '''dual plane''' of C.

If C and C* are isomorphic, then C is called '''''self-dual'''''. The projective planes PG(2,''K'') for any division ring ''K'' are self-dual. However, there are [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s which are not self-dual, such as the Hall planes and some that are, such as the [[Hughes plane]]s.

The '''''Principle of Plane Duality''''' says that dualizing any theorem in a self-dual projective plane C produces another theorem valid in C.

==Correlations==
{{main|correlation (projective geometry)}}
A '''duality''' is a map from a projective plane ''C'' = (''P'', ''L'', I) to its dual plane ''C''* = (''L'', ''P'', I*) (see [[#Plane duality|above]]) which preserves incidence. That is, a duality σ will map points to lines and lines to points (''P''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; = ''L'' and ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''P'') in such a way that if a point ''Q'' is on a line ''m'' (denoted by ''Q'' I ''m'') then ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; I* ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; ⇔ ''m''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; I ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt;.  A duality which is an isomorphism is called a '''correlation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Dembowski|1968}}  pg.151.&lt;/ref&gt; If a correlation exists then the projective plane ''C'' is self-dual.

In the special case that the projective plane is of the [[Projective space|PG(2,''K'')]] type, with ''K'' a division ring, a duality is called a '''reciprocity'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Casse|2006}} pg.94.&lt;/ref&gt; These planes are always self-dual. By the [[fundamental theorem of projective geometry]] a reciprocity is the composition of an [[automorphic function]] of ''K'' and a [[homography]]. If the automorphism involved is the identity, then the reciprocity is called a '''projective correlation'''.

A correlation of order two (an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]) is called a '''polarity'''. If a correlation φ is not a polarity then φ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a nontrivial collineation.

==Finite projective planes==

It can be shown that a projective plane has the same number of lines as it has points (infinite or finite).  Thus, for every finite projective plane there is an [[integer]] ''N'' ≥ 2 such that the plane has
:''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''N'' + 1 points,
:''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''N'' + 1 lines,
:''N'' + 1 points on each line, and
:''N'' + 1 lines through each point.
The number ''N'' is called the '''order''' of the projective plane. 

The projective plane of order 2 is called the [[Fano plane]]. See also the article on [[finite geometry]].

Using the vector space construction with finite fields there exists a projective plane of order ''N'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, for each prime power ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In fact, for all known finite projective planes, the order ''N'' is a prime power.

The existence of finite projective planes of other orders is an open question.  The only general restriction known on the order is the [[Bruck-Ryser-Chowla theorem]] that if the order ''N'' is [[modular arithmetic|congruent]] to 1 or 2 mod 4, it must be the sum of two squares.  This rules out ''N'' = 6.  The next case ''N'' = 10 has been ruled out by massive computer calculations.  Nothing more is known; in particular, the question of whether there exists a finite projective plane of order ''N'' = 12 is still open.

Another longstanding open problem is whether there exist finite projective planes of ''prime'' order which are not finite field planes (equivalently, whether there exists a non-Desarguesian projective plane of prime order).

A projective plane of order ''N'' is a Steiner S(2, ''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) system
(see [[Steiner system]]).  Conversely, one can prove that all Steiner systems of this form (λ = 2) are projective planes.

The number of mutually [[orthogonal Latin squares]] of order ''N'' is at most ''N'' &amp;minus; 1.   ''N'' &amp;minus; 1 exist if and only if there is a projective plane of order ''N''.

While the classification of all projective planes is far from complete, results are known for small orders:
*2 : all isomorphic to PG(2,2)
*3 : all isomorphic to PG(2,3)
*4 : all isomorphic to PG(2,4)
*5 : all isomorphic to PG(2,5)
*6 : impossible as the order of a projective plane, proved by [[Gaston Tarry|Tarry]] who showed that [[Euler]]'s [[thirty-six officers problem]] has no solution. However, the connection between these problems was not known until [[R. C. Bose|Bose]] proved it in 1938.&lt;ref name="Lam"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[The American Mathematical Monthly]] | title = The Search for a Finite Projective Plane of Order 10 | last1 = Lam | first1 = Clement W.H. | volume = 98 | year = 1991 | pages = 305–318 | url = https://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/the-search-for-a-finite-projective-plane-of-order-10 | authorlink = Clement W. H. Lam | quote = In 1938, Bose explained why there is no projective plane of order 6.  He related the existence of a finite projective plane of order ''n'' to the existence of a hyper-Graeco-Latin square. (p. 306)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*7 : all isomorphic to PG(2,7)
*8 : all isomorphic to PG(2,8)
*9 : PG(2,9), and three more different (non-isomorphic) [[non-Desarguesian plane]]s.  (All described in {{harv | Room | Kirkpatrick | 1971}}).
*10 : impossible as an order of a projective plane, proved by heavy computer calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lam|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*11 : at least PG(2,11), others are not known but possible.
*12 : it is conjectured to be impossible as an order of a projective plane.

==Projective planes in higher-dimensional projective spaces==

Projective planes may be thought of as [[Projective geometry|projective geometries]] of "geometric" dimension two.&lt;ref&gt;There are competing notions of ''dimension'' in geometry and algebra (vector spaces). In geometry, lines are 1 dimensional, planes are 2 dimensional, solids are 3 dimensional, etc. In a vector space however, the dimension is the number of vectors in a basis. When geometries are constructed from vector spaces, these two notions of dimension can lead to confusion, so it is often the case that the geometric concept is called ''geometric'' or ''projective'' dimension and the other is ''algebraic'' or ''vector space'' dimension. The two concepts are numerically related by: algebraic dimension = geometric dimension + 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-dimensional projective geometries can be defined in terms of incidence relations in a manner analogous to the definition of a projective plane. These turn out to be "tamer" than the projective planes since the extra degrees of freedom permit [[Desargues' theorem]] to be proved geometrically in the higher-dimensional geometry. This means that the coordinate "ring" associated to the geometry must be a division ring (skewfield) ''K'',  and the projective geometry is isomorphic to the one constructed from the vector space  ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''d''+1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. PG(''d'',''K''). As in the construction given earlier, the points of the ''d''-dimensional [[projective space]]  PG(''d'',''K'') are the lines through the origin in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''d'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; and a line in  PG(''d'',''K'') corresponds to a plane through the origin in ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''d'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;.  In fact, each ''i-dimensional'' object in  PG(''d'',''K''), with ''i'' &amp;lt; ''d'',  is an (''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional (algebraic) vector subspace of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''d'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; ("goes through the origin"). The projective spaces in turn generalize to the [[Grassmannian|Grassmannian spaces]].

It can be shown that if Desargues' theorem holds in a projective space of dimension greater than two, then it must also hold in all planes that are contained in that space. Since there are projective planes in which Desargues' theorem fails ([[non-Desarguesian plane]]s), these planes can not be embedded in a higher-dimensional projective space. Only the planes from the vector space construction PG(2,''K'') can appear in projective spaces of higher dimension. Some disciplines in mathematics restrict the meaning of projective plane to only this type of projective plane since otherwise general statements about projective spaces would always have to mention the exceptions when the geometric dimension is two.&lt;ref&gt;"One might say, with some justice, that projective geometry, in so far as present day research is concerned, has split into two quite separate fields. On the one hand, the researcher into the foundations of geometry tends to regard Desarguesian spaces as completely known. Since the only possible non-Desarguesian spaces are planes, his attention is restricted to the theory of projective planes, especially the non- Desarguesian planes. On the other hand stand all those researchers - and especially, the algebraic geometers - who are unwilling to be bound to two-dimensional space and uninterested in permitting non-Desarguesian planes to assume an exceptional role in their theorems. For the latter group of researchers, there are no projective spaces except the Desarguesian spaces." {{harv|Bruck|Bose|1964|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] published the first and second proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity on arts 125&amp;ndash;146 and 262 of  ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' in 1801.]]
In [[number theory]], the '''law of quadratic reciprocity''' is a theorem about [[modular arithmetic]] that gives conditions for the solvability of [[quadratic equation]]s modulo [[prime number]]s. Due to its subtlety, it has many formulations, but the most standard statement is: 
{{math_theorem|name=Law of quadratic reciprocity|Let ''p'' and ''q'' be distinct odd prime numbers, and define the [[Legendre symbol]] as: 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)
=\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
1 &amp; \text{if }\, n^2 \equiv q \!{\pmod p}\, \text{ for some integer } n,\\
-1 &amp; \text{otherwise.}
\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
Then:
:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{p}{q}\right) \left(\frac{q}{p}\right) = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

This law allows the easy calculation of any Legendre symbol, making it possible to determine whether there is an integer solution for any quadratic equation of the form &lt;math&gt;x^2\equiv a \!\!\!\pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; for ''p'' an odd prime; that is, to determine the "perfect squares" mod ''p''. However, this is a [[constructivism (mathematics)|non-constructive]] result: it gives no help at all for ''finding'' a specific solution; for this, one uses [[quadratic residue]]s.

The theorem was conjectured by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] and first proved by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]].&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA&amp;nbsp;§&amp;nbsp;4, arts 107&amp;ndash;150&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to it as the "fundamental theorem" in the ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' and his papers, writing

:''The fundamental theorem must certainly be regarded as one of the most elegant of its type.'' (Art. 151)

Privately he referred to it as the "golden theorem."&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in his mathematical diary entry for April 8, 1796 (the date he first proved quadratic reciprocity). See [https://books.google.com/books?id=NM36hgqmOLkC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=+%22theorema+aureum%22++diary+gauss&amp;source=web&amp;ots=m5uXIuw73w&amp;sig=Bzhx36Y3ZVh6WniMjT6kWUIpZqY&amp;hl=en facsimile page from Felix Klein's ''Development of Mathematics in the 19th century'']&lt;/ref&gt; He published six  [[mathematical proof|proofs]], and two more were found in his posthumous papers. There are now over 240 published proofs.&lt;ref&gt;See F. Lemmermeyer's chronology and bibliography of proofs in the [[#External links|external references]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Gauss, generalizing the reciprocity law has been a leading problem in mathematics, and has been crucial to the development of much of the machinery of modern algebra, number theory, and algebraic geometry, culminating in [[Artin reciprocity]], [[class field theory]], and the [[Langlands program]]. 

==Motivating examples==
Quadratic reciprocity arises from certain subtle factorization patterns involving perfect square numbers. In this section, we give examples which lead to the general case. 

===Factoring &lt;math&gt;n^2-q&lt;/math&gt;===
Consider the polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(n) = n^2 - 5&lt;/math&gt; and its values for &lt;math&gt;n \in \N.&lt;/math&gt; The prime factorizations of these values are given as follows:

The prime factors &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; dividing &lt;math&gt;f(n)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;p=2,5&lt;/math&gt;, and every prime whose final digit is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;9&lt;/math&gt;; no primes ending in &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;7&lt;/math&gt; ever appear. Now, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a prime factor of some &lt;math&gt;n^2-5&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;n^2 - 5 \equiv 0\ (\text{mod }p)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. whenever &lt;math&gt;n^2 \equiv 5 \ (\text{mod }p)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. whenever 5 is a quadratic residue modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. This happens for &lt;math&gt;p= 2, 5&lt;/math&gt; and those primes with &lt;math&gt;p\equiv 1, 4 \ (\text{mod }5)\!&lt;/math&gt;, and note that the latter numbers &lt;math&gt;1=(\pm1)^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4=(\pm2)^2&lt;/math&gt; are precisely the quadratic residues modulo &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, except for &lt;math&gt;p = 2,5&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic residue modulo &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a quadratic residue modulo &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;.

The law of quadratic reciprocity gives a similar characterization of prime divisors of &lt;math&gt;f(n)=n^2 - q&lt;/math&gt; for any prime ''q'', which leads to a characterization for any integer &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.

===Patterns among quadratic residues===
Let ''p'' be an odd prime. A number modulo ''p'' is a [[quadratic residue]] whenever it is congruent to a square (mod ''p''); otherwise it is a quadratic non-residue. ("Quadratic" can be dropped if it is clear from the context.) Here we exclude zero as a special case. Then as a consequence of the fact that the multiplicative group of a [[finite field]] of order ''p'' is cyclic of order ''p-1'', the following statements hold:

*There are an equal number of quadratic residues and non-residues; and
*The product of two quadratic residues is a residue, the product of a residue and a non-residue is a non-residue, and the product of two non-residues is a residue.

For the avoidance of doubt, these statements do ''not'' hold if the modulus is not prime.  
For example, there are only 2 quadratic residues (1 and 4) in the multiplicative group modulo 15.  
Moreover although 7 and 8 are quadratic non-residues, their product 7x8 = 11 is also a quadratic non-residue, in contrast to the prime case.  

Quadratic residues are entries in the following table:

This table is complete for odd primes less than 50. To check whether a number ''m'' is a quadratic residue mod one of these primes ''p'', find ''a'' ≡ ''m'' (mod ''p'') and 0 ≤ ''a'' &lt; ''p''. If ''a'' is in row ''p'', then ''m'' is a residue (mod ''p''); if ''a'' is not in row ''p'' of the table, then ''m'' is a nonresidue (mod ''p'').

The quadratic reciprocity law is the statement that certain patterns found in the table are true in general.

===''q'' = ±1 and the first supplement===

Trivially 1 is a quadratic residue for all primes. The question becomes more interesting for −1. Examining the table, we find −1 in rows 5, 13, 17, 29, 37, and 41 but not in rows 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 43 or 47. The former set of primes are all congruent to 1 modulo 4, and the latter are congruent to 3 modulo 4.

:'''First Supplement to Quadratic Reciprocity.''' The congruence &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;  is solvable if and only if &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to 1 modulo 4.

===''q'' = ±2 and the second supplement===
Examining the table, we find 2 in rows 7, 17, 23, 31, 41, and 47, but not in rows 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 29, 37, or 43. The former primes are all ≡ ±1 (mod 8), and the latter are all ≡ ±3 (mod 8). This leads to

:'''Second Supplement to Quadratic Reciprocity.''' The congruence &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;  is solvable if and only if &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to ±1 modulo 8.

−2 is in rows 3, 11, 17, 19, 41, 43, but not in rows 5, 7, 13, 23, 29, 31, 37, or 47. The former are ≡ 1 or ≡ 3 (mod 8), and the latter are ≡ 5, 7 (mod 8).

===''q'' = ±3===
3 is in rows 11, 13, 23, 37, and 47, but not in rows 5, 7, 17, 19, 29, 31, 41, or 43. The former are  ≡ ±1 (mod 12) and the latter are all ≡ ±5 (mod 12).

−3 is in rows 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, and 43 but not in rows 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, or 47. The former are ≡ 1 (mod 3) and the latter ≡ 2 (mod 3).

Since the only residue (mod 3) is 1, we see that −3 is a quadratic residue modulo every prime which is a residue modulo 3.

===''q'' = ±5===
5 is in rows 11, 19, 29, 31, and 41 but not in rows 3, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, or 47. The former are  ≡ ±1 (mod 5) and the latter are ≡ ±2 (mod 5).

Since the only residues (mod 5) are ±1, we see that 5 is a quadratic residue modulo every prime which is a residue modulo 5.

−5 is in rows 3, 7, 23, 29, 41, 43, and 47 but not in rows 11, 13, 17, 19, 31, or 37. The former are ≡ 1, 3, 7, 9 (mod 20) and the latter are ≡ 11, 13, 17, 19 (mod 20).

===Higher ''q''===
The observations about −3 and 5 continue to hold: −7 is a residue modulo ''p'' if and only if ''p'' is a residue modulo 7, −11 is a residue modulo ''p'' if and only if ''p'' is a residue modulo 11, 13 is a residue (mod ''p'') if and only if ''p'' is a residue modulo 13, etc. The more complicated-looking rules for the quadratic characters of 3 and −5, which depend upon congruences modulo 12 and 20 respectively, are simply the ones for −3 and 5 working with the first supplement.

:'''Example.''' For −5 to be a residue (mod ''p''), either both 5 and −1 have to be residues (mod ''p'') or they both have to be non-residues: i.e., ''p'' ≡ ±1 (mod 5) ''and'' ''p'' ≡ 1 (mod 4) or ''p'' ≡ ±2 (mod 5) ''and'' ''p'' ≡ 3 (mod 4). Using the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] these are equivalent to ''p'' ≡ 1, 9 (mod 20) or ''p'' ≡ 3, 7 (mod 20).

The generalization of the rules for −3 and 5 is Gauss's statement of quadratic reciprocity.

===Legendre's version===
Another way to organize the data is to see which primes are residues mod which other primes, as illustrated in the following table. The entry in row ''p'' column ''q'' is '''R''' if ''q'' is a quadratic residue (mod ''p''); if it is a nonresidue the entry is '''N'''.

If the row, or the column, or both, are ≡ 1 (mod 4) the entry is blue or green; if both row and column are ≡ 3 (mod 4), it is yellow or orange.

The blue and green entries are symmetric around the diagonal: The entry for row ''p'', column ''q'' is '''R''' (resp '''N''') if and only if the entry at row ''q'', column ''p'', is '''R''' (resp '''N''').

The yellow and orange ones, on the other hand, are antisymmetric: The entry for row ''p'', column ''q'' is '''R''' (resp '''N''') if and only if the entry at row ''q'', column ''p'', is '''N''' (resp '''R''').

The reciprocity law states that these patterns hold for all ''p'' and ''q''.

==Statement of the theorem==

'''Quadratic Reciprocity (Gauss's Statement).''' If &lt;math&gt;q \equiv 1\!\!\! \pmod{4}&lt;/math&gt; then the congruence &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv p\!\!\! \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;  is solvable if and only if &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv q\!\!\! \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable. If &lt;math&gt;q \equiv 3\!\!\! \pmod{4}&lt;/math&gt; then the congruence &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv p\!\!\! \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt;  is solvable if and only if &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv -q\!\!\! \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable.

'''Quadratic Reciprocity (Combined Statement).'''  Define &lt;math&gt;q^* = (-1)^{\frac{q-1}{2}}q&lt;/math&gt;. Then the congruence &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv p\!\!\! \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable if and only if &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv q^*\!\!\! \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable.

'''Quadratic Reciprocity (Legendre's Statement).''' If ''p'' or ''q'' are congruent to 1 modulo 4,  then: &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv q\!\!\! \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable if and only if &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv p\!\!\! \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable. If ''p'' and ''q'' are congruent to 3 modulo 4,  then: &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv q\!\!\! \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt; is solvable if and only if &lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv p\!\!\! \pmod{q}&lt;/math&gt; is not solvable.

The last is immediately equivalent to the modern form stated in the introduction above. It is a simple exercise to prove that Legendre's and Gauss's statements are equivalent – it requires no more than the first supplement and the facts about multiplying residues and nonresidues.

==History and alternative statements==
The theorem was formulated in many ways before its modern form: Euler and Legendre did not have Gauss's congruence notation, nor did Gauss have the Legendre symbol.

In this article ''p'' and ''q'' always refer to distinct positive odd primes, and ''x'' and ''y'' to unspecified integers.

===Fermat===
Fermat proved&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, pp. 2&amp;ndash;3&lt;/ref&gt; (or claimed to have proved)&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA, art. 182&lt;/ref&gt; a number of theorems about expressing a prime by a quadratic form:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p=x^2+ y^2 \qquad &amp;\Longleftrightarrow \qquad p=2 \quad  \text{ or } \quad p\equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
p=x^2+2y^2 \qquad &amp;\Longleftrightarrow \qquad p=2 \quad  \text{ or } \quad p\equiv 1, 3 \pmod{8} \\
p=x^2+3y^2 \qquad &amp;\Longleftrightarrow \qquad p=3 \quad \text{ or } \quad p\equiv 1 \pmod{3} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

He did not state the law of quadratic reciprocity, although the cases −1, ±2, and ±3 are easy deductions from these and other of his theorems.

He also claimed to have a proof that if the prime number ''p'' ends with 7, (in base 10) and the prime number ''q'' ends in 3, and ''p'' ≡ ''q'' ≡ 3 (mod 4), then

:&lt;math&gt;pq=x^2+5y^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Euler conjectured, and Lagrange proved, that&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p &amp;\equiv 1, 9 \pmod{20}\quad \Longrightarrow \quad p = x^2+5y^2 \\
p, q &amp;\equiv 3, 7 \pmod{20} \quad \Longrightarrow  \quad pq=x^2+5y^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Proving these and other statements of Fermat was one of the things that led mathematicians to the reciprocity theorem.

===Euler===
Translated into modern notation, Euler stated &lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. 5, Ireland &amp; Rosen, pp. 54, 61&lt;/ref&gt; that for distinct odd primes ''p'' and ''q'':

# If ''q'' ≡ 1 (mod 4) then ''q'' is a quadratic residue (mod ''p'') if and only if there exists some integer ''b'' such that ''p'' ≡ ''b^2'' (mod ''q'').
# If ''q'' ≡ 3 (mod 4) then ''q'' is a quadratic residue (mod ''p'') if and only if there exists some integer ''b'' which is odd and not divisible by ''q'' such that ''p'' ≡ ±''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (mod 4''q'').

This is equivalent to quadratic reciprocity.

He could not prove it, but he did prove the second supplement.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland &amp; Rosen, pp. 69&amp;ndash;70. His proof is based on what are now called Gauss sums.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legendre and his symbol===
Fermat proved that if ''p'' is a prime number and ''a'' is an integer, 
:&lt;math&gt;a^p\equiv a \pmod{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus if ''p'' does not divide ''a'', using the non-obvious fact (see for example Ireland and Rosen below) that the residues modulo ''p'' form a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and therefore in particular the multiplicative group is cyclic, hence there can be at most two solutions to a quadratic equation: 
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

Legendre&lt;ref&gt;This section is based on Lemmermeyer, pp. 6&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt;  lets ''a'' and ''A'' represent positive primes ≡ 1 (mod 4) and ''b'' and ''B'' positive primes ≡ 3 (mod 4), and sets out a table of eight theorems that together are equivalent to quadratic reciprocity:

He says that since expressions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;N^{\frac{c-1}{2}}\pmod{c}, \qquad \gcd(N, c) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

will come up so often he will abbreviate them as:

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{N}{c}\right) \equiv N^{\frac{c-1}{2}} \pmod{c} = \pm 1. &lt;/math&gt;

This is now known as the [[Legendre symbol]], and an equivalent&lt;ref&gt;The equivalence is [[Euler's criterion]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The analogue of Legendre's original definition is used for higher-power residue symbols&lt;/ref&gt; definition is used today: for all integers ''a'' and all odd primes ''p''

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)  = \left\{\begin{array}{rl} 0 &amp; a \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \\ 1 &amp; a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p} \text{ and } \exists x : a\equiv x^2\pmod{p} \\-1 &amp;a \not\equiv 0\pmod{p} \text{ and there is no such } x. \end{array}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

  \left(\tfrac{q}{p}\right) &amp; p\equiv 1 \pmod{4} \quad \text{ or } \quad q \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
-\left(\tfrac{q}{p}\right) &amp; p \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \quad \text{ and } \quad q \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

He notes that these can be combined:
:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{p}{q}\right) \left(\frac{q}{p}\right) = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A number of proofs, especially those based on [[Gauss's lemma (number theory)|Gauss's Lemma]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Kronecker's proof (Lemmermeyer, ex. p. 31, 1.34) is to use Gauss's lemma to establish that
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) =\sgn\prod_{i=1}^{\frac{q-1}{2}}\prod_{k=1}^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\left(\frac{k}{p}-\frac{i}{q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and then switch ''p'' and ''q''.&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly calculate this formula.

====The supplementary laws using Legendre symbols====

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right)  &amp;= (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}} = \left\{\begin{array}{rl} 1 &amp;p \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\\ -1 &amp; p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\end{array}\right. \\
\left(\frac{2}{p}\right)  &amp;= (-1)^{\frac{p^2-1}{8}}  = \left\{\begin{array}{rl} 1 &amp; p \equiv 1, 7 \pmod{8}\\ -1 &amp; p \equiv 3, 5\pmod{8}\end{array}\right.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Legendre's attempt to prove reciprocity is based on a theorem of his:

:'''Legendre's Theorem.''' Let ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' be integers where any pair of the three are relatively prime. Moreover assume that at least one of ''ab'', ''bc'' or ''ca'' is negative (i.e. they don't all have the same sign). If 
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
u^2 &amp;\equiv -bc \pmod{a} \\
v^2 &amp;\equiv -ca \pmod{b} \\
w^2 &amp;\equiv -ab \pmod{c} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:are solvable then the following equation has a nontrivial solution in integers:
::&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2=0.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example.''' Theorem I is handled by letting ''a'' ≡ 1 and ''b'' ≡ 3 (mod 4) be primes and assuming that &lt;math&gt;\left (\tfrac{b}{a} \right) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and, contrary the theorem, that &lt;math&gt;\left (\tfrac{a}{b} \right ) = -1.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x^2+ay^2-bz^2=0&lt;/math&gt; has a solution, and taking congruences (mod 4) leads to a contradiction.

This technique doesn't work for Theorem VIII. Let ''b'' ≡ ''B'' ≡ 3 (mod 4), and assume

:&lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{B}{b} \right ) = \left (\frac{b}{B} \right ) = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

Then if there is another prime ''p'' ≡ 1 (mod 4) such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{p}{b} \right ) = \left (\frac{p}{B} \right ) = -1,&lt;/math&gt;

the solvability of &lt;math&gt;Bx^2+by^2-pz^2=0&lt;/math&gt; leads to a contradiction (mod 4). But Legendre was unable to prove there has to be such a prime ''p''; he was later able to show that all that is required is:

:'''Legendre's Lemma.''' If ''p'' is a prime that is congruent to 1 modulo 4 then there exists an odd prime ''q'' such that &lt;math&gt;\left (\tfrac{p}{q} \right ) = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

but he couldn't prove that either. [[#Hilbert symbol|Hilbert symbol (below)]] discusses how techniques based on the existence of solutions to &lt;math&gt;ax^2+by^2+cz^2=0&lt;/math&gt; can be made to work.

===Gauss===
[[Image:Disquisitiones-Arithmeticae-p133.jpg|200px|thumb|Part of Article 131 in the first edition (1801) of the ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae|Disquisitiones]]'', listing the 8 cases of quadratic reciprocity]]

Gauss first proves&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA, arts 108&amp;ndash;116&lt;/ref&gt; the supplementary laws. He sets&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA, arts 117&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;  the basis for induction by proving the theorem for ±3 and ±5. Noting&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA, arts 130&lt;/ref&gt; that it is easier to state for −3 and +5 than it is for +3 or −5, he states&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA, Art 131&lt;/ref&gt; the general theorem in the form:

:If ''p'' is a prime of the form 4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 then ''p'', but if ''p'' is of the form 4''n'' + 3 then −''p'', is a quadratic residue (resp. nonresidue) of every prime, which, with a positive sign, is a residue (resp. nonresidue) of ''p''. In the next sentence, he christens it the "fundamental theorem" (Gauss never used the word "reciprocity").

Introducing the notation ''a'' R ''b'' (resp. ''a'' N ''b'') to mean ''a'' is a quadratic residue (resp. nonresidue) (mod ''b''), and letting ''a'', ''a''&amp;prime;, etc. represent positive primes ≡ 1 (mod 4) and  ''b'', ''b''&amp;prime;, etc. positive primes ≡ 3 (mod 4), he breaks it out into the same 8 cases as Legendre:

|}

In the next Article he generalizes this to what are basically the rules for the [[#Jacobi symbol|Jacobi symbol (below)]]. Letting ''A'', ''A''&amp;prime;, etc. represent any (prime or composite) positive numbers ≡ 1 (mod 4) and  ''B'', ''B''&amp;prime;, etc. positive numbers ≡ 3 (mod 4):

|}

All of these cases take the form "if a prime is a residue (mod a composite), then the composite is a residue or nonresidue (mod the prime), depending on the congruences (mod 4)". He proves that these follow from cases 1) - 8).

Gauss needed, and was able to prove,&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, DA, arts. 125&amp;ndash;129&lt;/ref&gt; a lemma similar to the one Legendre needed:

:'''Gauss's Lemma.''' If ''p'' is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 8 then there exists an odd prime ''q'' such that:
::&lt;math&gt;q &lt;2\sqrt p+1 \quad \text{and} \quad \left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = -1.&lt;/math&gt;

The proof of quadratic reciprocity uses [[Mathematical induction#Complete induction|complete induction]].

:'''Gauss's Version in Legendre Symbols.''' 
::&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = \begin{cases}  \left(\frac{q}{p}\right) &amp; q \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\ \left(\frac{-q}{p}\right) &amp; q \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

These can be combined:

:'''Gauss's Combined Version in Legendre Symbols.''' Let
::&lt;math&gt;q^* = (-1)^{\frac{q-1}{2}}q.&lt;/math&gt;
:In other words:
::&lt;math&gt;|q^*|=|q| \quad \text{and} \quad q^*\equiv 1 \pmod{4}.&lt;/math&gt;
:Then:
::&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = \left(\frac{q^*}{p}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

A number of proofs of the theorem, especially those based on [[Gauss sum]]s  derive this formula.&lt;ref&gt;Because the basic Gauss sum equals &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{q^*}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or the splitting of primes in [[algebraic number field]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Because the quadratic field &lt;math&gt;\Q(\sqrt{q^*})&lt;/math&gt; is a subfield of the cyclotomic field &lt;math&gt;\Q(e^{\frac{2\pi i}{q}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other statements===
Note that the statements in this section are equivalent to quadratic reciprocity: if, for example, Euler's version is assumed, the Legendre-Gauss version can be deduced from it, and vice versa.

:'''Euler's Formulation of Quadratic Reciprocity.'''&lt;ref&gt;Ireland &amp; Rosen, pp 60&amp;ndash;61.&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;p \equiv \pm q \pmod{4a}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{a}{p}\right)=\left(\tfrac{a}{q}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be proven using [[Gauss's lemma (number theory)|Gauss's lemma]].
 
:'''Quadratic Reciprocity (Gauss; Fourth Proof).'''&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, "Summierung gewisser Reihen von besonderer Art", reprinted in ''Untersuchumgen uber hohere Arithmetik'', pp.463&amp;ndash;495&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ... be unequal positive odd primes, whose product is ''n'', and let ''m'' be the number of them that are ≡ 3 (mod 4); check whether ''n''/''a'' is a residue of ''a'', whether ''n''/''b'' is a residue of ''b'', .... The number of nonresidues found will be even when ''m'' ≡ 0, 1 (mod 4), and it will be odd if ''m'' ≡ 2, 3 (mod 4).

Gauss's fourth proof consists of proving this theorem (by comparing two formulas for the value of Gauss sums) and then restricting it to two primes. He then gives an example: Let ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 5, ''c'' = 7, and ''d'' = 11. Three of these, 3, 7, and 11 ≡ 3 (mod 4), so ''m'' ≡ 3 (mod 4). 5×7×11&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;3;&amp;nbsp;3×7×11&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;5;&amp;nbsp;3×5×11&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;7;&amp;nbsp; and&amp;nbsp; 3×5×7&amp;nbsp;N&amp;nbsp;11, so there are an odd number of nonresidues.

:'''Eisenstein's Formulation of Quadratic Reciprocity.'''&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Th. 2.28, pp 63&amp;ndash;65&lt;/ref&gt; Assume
::&lt;math&gt;p\ne q,  \quad p'\ne q', \quad p \equiv p' \pmod{4}, \quad  q \equiv q' \pmod{4}.&lt;/math&gt;
:Then
::&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{p}{q}\right) \left(\frac{q}{p}\right) =\left(\frac{p'}{q'}\right) \left(\frac{q'}{p'}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Mordell's Formulation of Quadratic Reciprocity.'''&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, ex. 1.9, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' be integers. For every prime, ''p'', dividing ''abc'' if the congruence 
::&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{\tfrac{4abc}{p}}&lt;/math&gt;
:has a nontrivial solution, then so does:
::&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4abc}.&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Zeta function formulation'''
:As mentioned in the article on [[Dedekind zeta function|Dedekind zeta functions]], quadratic reciprocity is equivalent to the zeta function of a quadratic field being the product of the Riemann zeta function and a certain Dirichlet L-function

===Jacobi symbol===
The [[Jacobi symbol]] is a generalization of the Legendre symbol; the main difference is that the bottom number has to be positive and odd, but does not have to be prime. If it is prime, the two symbols agree. It obeys the same rules of manipulation as the Legendre symbol. In particular

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left(\frac{-1}{n}\right) = (-1)^{\frac{n-1}{2}} &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{rl} 1 &amp; n \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\\ -1 &amp; n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\end{array}\right. \\
\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)  = (-1)^{\frac{n^2-1}{8}} &amp;= \left\{\begin{array}{rl} 1 &amp; n \equiv 1, 7 \pmod{8}\\ -1 &amp; n \equiv 3, 5\pmod{8}\end{array}\right.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and if both numbers are positive and odd (this is sometimes called "Jacobi's reciprocity law"):

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{m}{n}\right) = (-1)^{\frac{(m-1)(n-1)}{4}}\left(\frac{n}{m}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

However, if the Jacobi symbol is 1 but the denominator is not a prime, it does not necessarily follow that the numerator is a quadratic residue of the denominator. Gauss's cases 9) - 14) above can be expressed in terms of Jacobi symbols:

:&lt;math&gt; \biggl(\frac{M}{p}\biggr) = (-1)^{\frac{(p-1)(M-1)}{4}} \biggl (\frac{p}{M}\biggr),&lt;/math&gt;

and since ''p'' is prime the left hand side is a Legendre symbol, and we know whether ''M'' is a residue modulo ''p'' or not.

The formulas listed in the preceding section are true for Jacobi symbols as long as the symbols are defined. Euler's formula may be written

:&lt;math&gt;\biggl(\frac{a}{m}\biggr) =\biggl(\frac{a}{m \pm 4an}\biggr), \qquad n \in \Z,  m\pm4an&gt;0. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example.'''

:&lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{2}{7} \right ) = \left (\frac{2}{15} \right ) = \left (\frac{2}{23} \right ) = \left (\frac{2}{31} \right ) = \cdots = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

2 is a residue modulo the primes 7, 23 and 31:

:&lt;math&gt;3^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}, \quad 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \quad 8^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{31}.&lt;/math&gt;

But 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo 5, so it can't be one modulo 15. This is related to the problem Legendre had: if &lt;math&gt;\left (\tfrac{a}{m} \right) = -1,&lt;/math&gt; then ''a'' is a non-residue modulo every prime in the arithmetic progression ''m'' + 4''a'', ''m'' + 8''a'', ..., if there ''are'' any primes in this series, but that wasn't proved until decades after Legendre.&lt;ref&gt;By [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] in 1837&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenstein's formula requires relative primality conditions (which are true if the numbers are prime)

:Let &lt;math&gt;a, b, a', b'&lt;/math&gt; be positive odd integers such that:
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\gcd &amp;(a,b) =\gcd(a',b')= 1 \\
&amp;a \equiv a' \pmod{4} \\
&amp;b \equiv b' \pmod{4}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Then
::&lt;math&gt; \biggl(\frac{a}{b}\biggr) \biggl(\frac{b}{a}\biggr) =\biggl(\frac{a'}{b'}\biggr) \biggl(\frac{b'}{a'}\biggr).&lt;/math&gt;

===Hilbert symbol===
The quadratic reciprocity law can be formulated in terms of the [[Hilbert symbol]] &lt;math&gt;(a,b)_v&lt;/math&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are any  two nonzero rational numbers and ''v'' runs over all the non-trivial absolute values of the rationals (the archimedean one and  the ''p''-adic absolute values for primes ''p''). The Hilbert symbol &lt;math&gt;(a,b)_v&lt;/math&gt; is 1 or −1. It is defined to be 1 if and only if the equation &lt;math&gt;ax^2+by^2=z^2&lt;/math&gt; has a solution in the [[Completion (ring theory)|completion]] of the rationals at ''v'' other than &lt;math&gt;x=y=z=0&lt;/math&gt;. The Hilbert reciprocity law states that &lt;math&gt;(a,b)_v&lt;/math&gt;, for fixed ''a'' and ''b'' and varying ''v'', is 1 for  all but finitely many ''v'' and the product of &lt;math&gt;(a,b)_v&lt;/math&gt; over all ''v'' is 1.  (This formally resembles the residue theorem from complex analysis.)

The proof of Hilbert reciprocity reduces to checking a few special cases, and the non-trivial cases  turn out to be equivalent to the main law and the two supplementary laws of quadratic reciprocity for the Legendre symbol. There is no kind of reciprocity in the Hilbert reciprocity law; its name  simply indicates the historical source of the result in quadratic reciprocity. Unlike quadratic reciprocity,  which requires sign conditions (namely positivity of the primes involved) and a special treatment of the prime 2, the Hilbert reciprocity law treats all absolute values of the rationals on an equal footing. Therefore, it is a more natural way of expressing quadratic reciprocity with a view towards generalization: the Hilbert reciprocity law extends with very few changes to all [[global field]]s and this extension can rightly be considered a generalization of quadratic reciprocity to all global fields.
&lt;!--

The next example should be beefed up a bit and moved to [[Jacobi symbol]]. There it would be possible to see much more clearly how the algorithm looks just like the Euclidean algorithm. ~~~~

For example taking ''p'' to be 11 and ''q'' to be 19, we can relate &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{11}{19}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{19}{11}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, which is &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{-3}{11}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. To proceed further we may need to know supplementary laws for computing &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{3}{q}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{-1}{q}\right)&lt;/math&gt; explicitly. For example,

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{-1}{q}\right) = (-1)^{(q-1)/2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using this we relate &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{-3}{11}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{3}{11}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{11}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{-1}{3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, and can complete the initial calculation.

--&gt;

==Connection with cyclotomic fields==

The early proofs of quadratic reciprocity are relatively unilluminating. The situation changed when Gauss used [[Gauss sum]]s to show that [[quadratic field]]s are subfields of [[cyclotomic field]]s, and implicitly deduced quadratic reciprocity from a reciprocity theorem for cyclotomic fields. His proof was cast in modern form by later algebraic number theorists. This proof served as a template for [[class field theory]], which can be viewed as a vast generalization of quadratic reciprocity.

[[Robert Langlands]] formulated the [[Langlands program]], which gives a conjectural vast generalization of class field theory. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.duke.edu/langlands/Three.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122104607/http://www.math.duke.edu/langlands/Three.pdf |archivedate=January 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''I confess that, as a student unaware of the history of the subject and unaware of the connection with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that I saw it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Theory-Numbers-Hermann-Weyl/dp/0691059179&lt;/ref&gt; that I appreciated it as anything more.''

== Other rings ==
There are also quadratic reciprocity laws in [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s other than the integers.

===Gaussian integers===
In his second monograph on [[quartic reciprocity]]&lt;ref&gt;Gauss, BQ § 60&lt;/ref&gt;  Gauss stated quadratic reciprocity for the ring &lt;math&gt;\Z[\imath]&lt;/math&gt; of [[Gaussian integer]]s, saying that it is a corollary of the [[quartic reciprocity|biquadratic law]] in &lt;math&gt;\Z[\imath],&lt;/math&gt; but did not provide a proof of either theorem. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet|Dirichlet]]&lt;ref&gt;Dirichlet's proof is in Lemmermeyer, Prop. 5.1 p.154, and Ireland &amp; Rosen, ex. 26 p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the law in &lt;math&gt;\Z[\imath]&lt;/math&gt; can be deduced from the law for &lt;math&gt;\Z&lt;/math&gt; without using [[quartic reciprocity|biquadratic reciprocity]].

For an odd Gaussian prime &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and a Gaussian integer &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; relatively prime to &lt;math&gt;\pi,&lt;/math&gt; define the quadratic character for &lt;math&gt;\Z[\imath]&lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right]_2 \equiv \alpha^\frac{\mathrm{N} \pi - 1}{2}\pmod{\pi} = 
\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
1 &amp; \exists \eta \in \Z[\imath]: \alpha \equiv \eta^2 \pmod{\pi} \\
-1 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{array}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda = a + b \imath, \mu = c + d \imath&lt;/math&gt; be distinct Gaussian primes where ''a'' and ''c'' are odd and ''b'' and ''d'' are even. Then&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Prop. 5.1, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left [\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right ]_2 = \left [\frac{\mu}{\lambda}\right ]_2, \qquad \left [\frac{\imath}{\lambda}\right ]_2 =(-1)^\frac{b}{2}, \qquad \left [\frac{1+\imath}{\lambda}\right ]_2 =\left(\frac{2}{a+b}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Eisenstein integers===
Consider the following third root of unity:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{-3}}{2}=e^\frac{2\pi \imath}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

The ring of Eisenstein integers is &lt;math&gt;\Z[\omega].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the articles on [[Eisenstein integer]] and [[cubic reciprocity]] for definitions and notations.&lt;/ref&gt; For an Eisenstein prime &lt;math&gt;\pi, \mathrm{N} \pi \neq 3,&lt;/math&gt; and an Eisenstein integer &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\gcd(\alpha, \pi) = 1,&lt;/math&gt; define the quadratic character for &lt;math&gt;\Z[\omega]&lt;/math&gt; by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right]_2 \equiv \alpha^\frac{\mathrm{N} \pi - 1}{2}\pmod{\pi} =
\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
1 &amp;\exists \eta \in \Z[\omega]: \alpha \equiv \eta^2 \pmod{\pi} \\
-1 &amp;\text{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Let λ = ''a'' + ''bω'' and μ = ''c'' + ''dω'' be distinct Eisenstein primes where ''a'' and ''c'' are not divisible by 3  and ''b'' and ''d'' are divisible by 3. Eisenstein proved&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Thm. 7.10, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left[\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right]_2  \left [\frac{\mu}{\lambda}\right ]_2 = (-1)^{\frac{\mathrm{N} \lambda - 1}{2}\frac{\mathrm{N} \mu-1}{2}}, \qquad \left [\frac{1-\omega}{\lambda}\right ]_2 =\left(\frac{a}{3}\right), \qquad \left [\frac{2}{\lambda}\right ]_2 =\left (\frac{2}{\mathrm{N} \lambda }\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Imaginary quadratic fields===
The above laws are special cases of more general laws that hold for the [[ring of integers]] in any [[Quadratic field|imaginary quadratic number field]]. Let ''k'' be an imaginary quadratic number field with ring of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k.&lt;/math&gt;  For a [[Number field#Prime ideals|prime ideal]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} \subset \mathcal{O}_k &lt;/math&gt; with odd norm &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in \mathcal{O}_k,&lt;/math&gt; define the quadratic character for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k &lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{\alpha}{\mathfrak{p} }\right]_2 \equiv \alpha^{\frac{\mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} - 1}{2}} \pmod{\mathfrak{p}} = 
\left\{\begin{array}{rl}
1 &amp;\alpha\not\in \mathfrak{p}   \text{ and } \exists \eta \in \mathcal{O}_k \text{ such that } \alpha - \eta^2 \in \mathfrak{p}  \\
-1 &amp; \alpha\not\in \mathfrak{p}  \text{ and there is no such } \eta \\
0 &amp; \alpha\in \mathfrak{p}
\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

for an arbitrary ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt; factored into prime ideals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}  = \mathfrak{p}_1 \cdots \mathfrak{p}_n&lt;/math&gt; define

:&lt;math&gt;\left [\frac{\alpha}{\mathfrak{a}}\right ]_2 = \left[\frac{\alpha}{\mathfrak{p}_1 }\right]_2\cdots \left[\frac{\alpha}{\mathfrak{p}_n }\right]_2,&lt;/math&gt;

and for &lt;math&gt;\beta \in \mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt; define

:&lt;math&gt;\left [\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right ]_2 = \left [\frac{\alpha}{\beta \mathcal{O}_k}\right ]_2. &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k = \mathbb{Z} \omega_1\oplus \mathbb{Z} \omega_2,&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;\left\{\omega_1, \omega_2\right\}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Number field#Integral basis|integral basis]] for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k.&lt;/math&gt; For &lt;math&gt;\nu \in \mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt; with odd norm &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{N}\nu,&lt;/math&gt; define (ordinary) integers ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' by the equations,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nu\omega_1&amp;=a\omega_1+b\omega_2\\
\nu\omega_2&amp;=c\omega_1+d\omega_2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and a function

:&lt;math&gt;\chi(\nu) := \imath^{(b^2-a+2)c+(a^2-b+2)d+ad}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''m'' = ''Nμ'' and ''n'' = ''Nν'' are both odd, Herglotz proved&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, Thm 8.15, p.256 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left [\frac{\mu}{\nu}\right ]_2 \left[\frac{\nu}{\mu}\right]_2 =  (-1)^{\frac{m-1}{2}\frac{n-1}{2}} \chi(\mu)^{m\frac{n-1}{2}} \chi(\nu)^{-n\frac{m-1}{2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Also, if

:&lt;math&gt; \mu \equiv\mu' \pmod{4} \quad \text{and} \quad \nu \equiv\nu' \pmod{4}&lt;/math&gt;

Then&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer Thm. 8.18, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \left [\frac{\mu}{\nu}\right ]_2 \left[\frac{\nu}{\mu}\right]_2 =  \left [\frac{\mu'}{\nu'}\right ]_2 \left[\frac{\nu'}{\mu'}\right]_2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Polynomials over a finite field===
Let ''F'' be a [[finite field]] with ''q'' = ''p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' elements, where ''p'' is an odd prime number and ''n'' is positive, and let ''F''[''x''] be the [[Polynomial ring|ring of polynomials]] in one variable with coefficients in ''F''. If &lt;math&gt;f,g \in F[x]&lt;/math&gt; and ''f'' is [[Irreducible polynomial|irreducible]], [[Polynomial#Classifications|monic]], and has positive degree, define the quadratic character for ''F''[''x''] in the usual manner:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{g}{f}\right) = \left\{\begin{array}{rl}
1 &amp; \gcd(f,g)=1 \text{ and } \exists h,k \in F[x] \text{ such that  }g-h^2 = kf \\
-1 &amp; \gcd(f,g)=1 \text{ and } g \text{ is not a square}\pmod{f}\\
0 &amp; \gcd(f,g)\ne 1
\end{array}\right. &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f=f_1 \cdots f_n&lt;/math&gt; is a product of monic irreducibles let
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{g}{f}\right) = \left(\frac{g}{f_1}\right) \cdots \left(\frac{g}{f_n}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Dedekind proved that if &lt;math&gt;f,g \in F[x]&lt;/math&gt; are monic and have positive degrees,&lt;ref&gt;Bach &amp; Shallit, Thm. 6.7.1&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{g}{f}\right) \left(\frac{f}{g}\right) =  (-1)^{\frac{q-1}{2}(\deg f)(\deg g)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Higher powers==
The attempt to generalize quadratic reciprocity for powers higher than the second was one of the main goals that led 19th century mathematicians, including [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi]], [[Gotthold Eisenstein]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Ernst Kummer]], and [[David Hilbert]] to the study of general algebraic number fields and their rings of integers;&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. 15, and Edwards, pp.79&amp;ndash;80 both make strong cases that the study of higher reciprocity was much more important as a motivation than Fermat's Last Theorem was&lt;/ref&gt; specifically Kummer invented ideals in order to state and prove higher reciprocity laws.

The [[Hilbert's ninth problem|ninth]] in the list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems]] which David Hilbert proposed to the Congress of Mathematicians in 1900 asked for the 
"Proof of the most general reciprocity law [f]or an arbitrary number field".&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 [[Emil Artin]], building upon work by [[Philipp Furtwängler]], [[Teiji Takagi]], [[Helmut Hasse]] and others, discovered a general theorem for which all known reciprocity laws are special cases; he proved it in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Lemmermeyer, p. ix ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Its immense bibliography includes literature citations for 196 different published [[Proofs of quadratic reciprocity|proofs for the quadratic reciprocity law]].

Kenneth Ireland and [[Michael Rosen]]'s ''A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory'' also has many proofs of quadratic reciprocity (and many exercises), and covers the cubic and biquadratic cases as well. Exercise 13.26 (p.&amp;nbsp;202) says it all

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8411">In descriptive [[statistics]] and [[chaos theory]], a '''recurrence plot''' ('''RP''') is a plot showing, for a given moment in time, the times at which a [[phase space]] trajectory visits roughly the same area in the phase space. In other words, it is a graph of

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{x}(i)\approx \vec{x}(j),&lt;/math&gt;

showing &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; on a horizontal axis and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on a vertical axis, where &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[phase space]] trajectory.

==Background==

Natural processes can have a distinct recurrent behaviour, e.g. periodicities (as [[Seasonality|seasonal]] or [[Milankovich cycle]]s), but also irregular cyclicities (as [[El Niño]] Southern Oscillation). Moreover, the recurrence of states, in the meaning that states are again arbitrarily close after some time of [[divergence]], is a fundamental property of [[deterministic]] [[dynamical systems]] and is typical for [[nonlinear]] or [[chaotic system]]s (cf. [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]]). The recurrence of states in nature has been known for a long time and has also been discussed in early work (e.g. [[Henri Poincaré]] 1890).

==Detailed description==

Eckmann et al. (1987) introduced recurrence plots, which provide a way to visualize the periodic nature of a trajectory through a [[phase space]]. Often, the phase space does not have a low enough dimension (two or three) to be pictured, since higher-dimensional phase spaces can only be visualized by projection into the two or three-dimensional sub-spaces. However, making a recurrence plot enables us to investigate certain aspects of the ''m''-dimensional phase space trajectory through a two-dimensional representation.

A '''recurrence''' is a time the trajectory returns to a location it has visited before.  The recurrence plot depicts the collection of pairs of times at which the trajectory is at the same place, i.e. the set of &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}(i) = \vec{x}(j)&lt;/math&gt;.  This can show many things, for instance, if the trajectory is strictly periodic with period &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, then all such pairs of times will be separated by a multiple of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and visible as diagonal lines.  To make the plot, continuous time and continuous phase space are discretized, taking e.g. &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}(i)&lt;/math&gt; as the location of the trajectory at time &lt;math&gt;i \tau&lt;/math&gt; and counting as a recurrence any time the trajectory gets sufficiently close (say, within &amp;epsilon;) to a point it has been previously.  Concretely then, recurrence/non-recurrence can be recorded by the binary function

:&lt;math&gt;R(i,j) = \begin{cases} 1 \quad &amp;\text{if} \quad \| \vec{x}(i) - \vec{x}(j)\| \le \varepsilon \\  0 \quad &amp; \text{otherwise}, \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and the recurrence plot puts a (black) point at coordinates &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;R(i,j)=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Caused by characteristic behaviour of the phase space trajectory, a recurrence plot contains typical small-scale structures, as single dots, diagonal lines and vertical/horizontal lines (or a mixture of the latter, which combines to extended clusters). The large-scale structure, also called ''texture'', can be visually characterised by ''homogenous'', ''periodic'', ''drift'' or ''disrupted''. The visual appearance of an RP gives hints about the dynamics of the system.

[[Image:Rp examples740.gif|thumb|center|740px|Typical examples of recurrence plots (top row: [[time series]] (plotted over time); bottom row: corresponding recurrence plots). From left to right: uncorrelated stochastic data ([[white noise]]), [[harmonic oscillation]] with two frequencies, chaotic data with linear trend ([[logistic map]]) and data from an [[autoregressive process|auto-regressive process]].]]

The small-scale structures in RPs are used by the [[recurrence quantification analysis]] (Zbilut &amp; Webber 1992; Marwan et al. 2002). This quantification allows to describe the RPs in a quantitative way, and to study transitions or nonlinear parameters of the system. In contrast to the heuristic approach of  the recurrence quantification analysis, which depends on the choice of the embedding parameters, some [[dynamical invariant]]s as [[correlation dimension]], [[K2 entropy]] or [[mutual information]], which are independent on the embedding, can also be derived from recurrence plots. The base for these dynamical invariants are the recurrence rate and the distribution of the lengths of the diagonal lines.

Close returns plots are similar to recurrence plots. The difference is that  the relative time between recurrences is used for the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axis (instead of absolute time).

The main advantage of recurrence plots is that they provide useful information even for short and non-stationary data, where other methods fail.

==Extensions==

Multivariate extensions of recurrence plots were developed as '''cross recurrence plots''' and '''joint recurrence plots'''.

Cross recurrence plots consider the phase space trajectories of two different systems in the same phase space (Marwan &amp; Kurths 2002):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{CR}(i,j) = \Theta(\varepsilon - \| \vec{x}(i) - \vec{y}(j)\|), \quad \vec{x}(i),\, \vec{y}(i) \in \Bbb{R}^m, \quad i=1, \dots, N_x, \ j=1, \dots, N_y.&lt;/math&gt;

The dimension of both systems must be the same, but the number of considered states (i.e. data length) can be different. Cross recurrence plots compare the occurrences of ''similar states'' of two systems. They can be used in order to analyse the similarity of the dynamical evolution between two different systems, to look for similar matching patterns in two systems, or to study the time-relationship of two similar systems, whose time-scale differ (Marwan &amp; Kurths 2005).

Joint recurrence plots are the [[Matrix product#Hadamard product|Hadamard product]] of the recurrence plots of the considered sub-systems (Romano et al. 2004), e.g. for two systems &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt; the joint recurrence plot is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{JR}(i,j) = \Theta(\varepsilon_x - \| \vec{x}(i) - \vec{x}(j)\|) \cdot \Theta(\varepsilon_y - \| \vec{y}(i) - \vec{y}(j)\|), \quad \vec{x}(i) \in \Bbb{R}^m, \quad \vec{y}(i) \in \Bbb{R}^n,\quad i,j=1, \dots, N_{x,y}.&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast to cross recurrence plots, joint recurrence plots compare the simultaneous occurrence of ''recurrences'' in two (or more) systems. Moreover, the dimension of the considered phase spaces can be different, but the number of the considered states has to be the same for all the sub-systems. Joint recurrence plots can be used in order to detect [[phase synchronization|phase synchronisation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3442">In [[econometrics]], '''ridit scoring''' is a statistical method used to analyze ordered qualitative measurements.
The tools of ridit analysis were developed and first applied by Bross,&lt;ref&gt;Bross, Irwin D.J. (1958) "How to Use Ridit Analysis," ''Biometrics'', 14 (1):18-38 {{jstor|2527727}}
&lt;/ref&gt; who coined the term "ridit" by analogy with other statistical transformations such as [[probit]] and [[logit]].

==Calculation of ridit scores==

===Choosing a reference data set===
Since ridit scoring is used to compare two or more sets of ordered qualitative data, one set is designated as a reference against which other sets can be compared. In econometric studies, for example, the ridit scores measuring taste survey answers of a competing or historically important product are often used as the reference data set against which taste surveys of new products are compared. Absent a convenient reference data set, an accumulation of pooled data from several sets or even an artificial or hypothetical set can be used.

===Determining the probability function===
After a reference data set has been chosen, the reference data set must be converted to a probability function. To do this, let ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'',..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the ordered categories of the preference scale. For each ''j'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents a choice or judgment. Then, let the probability function ''p'' be defined with respect to the reference data set as

:&lt;math&gt;p_j=Prob({x_j}).&lt;/math&gt;

===Determining ridits===
The ridit scores, or simply ridits, of the reference data set are then easily calculated as

:&lt;math&gt;w_j=0.5p_j+\sum_{k&lt;j}{p_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Each of the categories of the reference data set are then associated with a ridit score.
More formally, for each &lt;math&gt;1\le j\le n&lt;/math&gt;, the value ''w&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ridit score of the choice ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Interpretation and examples==
Intuitively, ridit scoring can be understood as a modified notion of percentile. For any j, if ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' has a low (close to 0) ridit score, one can conclude that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k&lt;j}{Prob(x_k)}&lt;/math&gt;
is very small, which is to say that very few respondents have chosen a category "lower" than ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Applications==
Ridit scoring has found use primarily in the [[health science]]s (including nursing and [[epidemiology]]) and econometric preference studies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==A mathematical approach==
Besides having intuitive appeal, the derivation for ridit scoring can be arrived at with mathematically rigorous methods as well. Brockett and Levine&lt;ref&gt;Brockett, Patrick L. and Levine, Arnold (1977) "On a Characterization of Ridits," ''The Annals of Statistics'', 5 (6):1245-1248 {{jstor|2958658}}
&lt;/ref&gt; presented a derivation of the above ridit score equations based on several intuitively uncontroversial mathematical postulates.

== Examples ==
* The integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; have characteristic zero, but for any [[prime number]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p=\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[finite field]] with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; elements and hence has characteristic &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ring of integers of any [[number field]] is of mixed characteristic
* Fix a prime ''p'' and [[localization of a ring|localize]] the integers at the prime ideal (''p'').  The resulting ring '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt; has characteristic zero.  It has a unique maximal ideal ''p'''''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt;, and the quotient '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt;/''p'''''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt; is a finite field with ''p'' elements. In contrast to the previous example, the only possible characteristics for rings of the form {{nowrap|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;(''p'')&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''}} are zero (when ''I'' is the zero ideal) and powers of ''p'' (when ''I'' is any other non-unit ideal); it is not possible to have a quotient of any other characteristic.
* If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a non-zero prime ideal of the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_K&lt;/math&gt; of integers of a number field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; then the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_K&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is likewise of mixed characteristic.
* The [[p-adic number|''p''-adic integers]] '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; for any prime ''p'' are a ring of characteristic zero. However, they have an ideal generated by the image of the prime number ''p'' under the canonical map {{nowrap|'''Z''' &amp;rarr; '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The quotient '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;/''p'''''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is again the finite field of ''p'' elements.  '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is an example of a [[completion (ring theory)|complete]] [[discrete valuation ring]] of mixed characteristic.
* The integers, the [[ring of integers]] of any number field, and any localization or completion of one of these rings is a characteristic zero [[Dedekind domain]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2319">The '''sensitivity index''' or '''''d{{'}}''''' (pronounced 'dee-prime') is a [[statistic]] used in [[signal detection theory]]. It provides the separation between the means of the signal and the noise distributions, compared against the standard deviation of the signal or noise distribution. For [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] signal and noise with mean and standard deviations &lt;math&gt;\mu_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, d' is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;d' = \frac{\mu_S - \mu_N}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_S^2 + \sigma_N^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=MandC&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Detection_Theory.html?id=hDX65v9bReYC MacMillan N, Creelman C (2005) Detection Theory: A User’s Guide. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that by convention, d' assumes that the standard deviations for signal and noise are equal. An estimate of d' can be also found from measurements of the hit rate and [[False alarm|false-alarm]] rate. It is calculated as:

::''d''' = ''Z''(hit rate) − ''Z''(false alarm rate),&lt;ref name=MandC /&gt;{{rp|7}}

where function ''Z''(''p''), ''p'' &amp;isin; [0,1], is the inverse of the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the [[Gaussian distribution]].

''d' '' can be related to the Area Under the [[Receiver operating characteristic]] Curve, or AUC, via 

::&lt;math&gt;d' = \sqrt{2} Z(\mbox{AUC}).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=MandC /&gt;{{rp|63}}

''d' '' is a [[dimensionless]] statistic. A higher ''d''' indicates that the signal can be more readily detected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5782">In [[arithmetic]], '''short division''' is a [[division algorithm]] which breaks down a [[division (mathematics)|division]] problem into a series of easy steps. It is an abbreviated form of [[long division]]. Short division relies on [[Mental calculation|mental arithmetic]], which necessarily limits the size of the [[divisor]]. For most people, small integer divisors up to 12 are handled using memorised [[multiplication tables]], though some people can use the procedure for larger divisors.

As in all division problems, a number called the ''[[Division (mathematics)|dividend]]'' is divided by another, called the ''[[divisor]]''. The answer to the problem is called the ''[[quotient]]''.

Using short division, one can solve a division problem with a very large dividend by following a series of easy steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Practical Arithmetic |author=G.P Quackenbos, LL.D. |chapter=Chapter VII: Division |publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company |year=1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tableau==
Short division does not use the ''[[Slash (punctuation)|slash]]'' (/) or  ''[[obelus]]'' (÷) symbols. Instead, it displays the dividend, divisor, and  [[quotient]] (when it is found) in a [[Long division#Method|tableau]]. An example is shown below, representing the division of 500 by 4. The quotient is  125.
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{r}
125\\
4\overline{)500}\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively the bar may be placed below the number which means the sum proceeds down the page.  This is in distinction to [[long division]] where the space under the dividend is required for workings:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{r}
4\underline{)500}\\
125\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
The procedure involves several steps. As an example, consider 950 divided by 4:

{{ordered list
|1=The dividend and divisor are written in the short division tableau:

:&lt;math&gt;
4 \overline{)950} \ 
&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing 950 by 4 in a single step would require knowing the [[multiplication table]] up to 238 × 4. Instead, the division is reduced to small steps.  Starting from the left, enough digits are selected to form a number (called the ''partial dividend'') from 1×4 to 10×4-1 (4 being the divisor in this problem). Here, the partial dividend is 9.

|2=The first number to be divided by the divisor (4) is the partial dividend (9). We write the [[integer]] part of the result (2) above the division bar over the leftmost digit of the dividend, and we write the remainder (1) as a small digit above and to the right of the partial dividend (9).

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
2\\
4\overline{)9^150}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

|3=Next we repeat step 2, using the small digit concatenated with the next digit of the dividend to form a new partial dividend (15). Dividing the new partial dividend by the divisor (4), we write the result as before — the quotient above the next digit of the dividend, and the remainder as a small digit to the upper right. (Here 15 divided by 4 is 3, with a remainder of 3.)

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\,\,2\ 3\\
4\overline{)9^15^30}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

|4=We continue repeating step 2 until there are no digits remaining in the dividend. In this example, we see that 30 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 2. The number written above the bar (237) is the quotient, and the last small digit (2) is the remainder.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\quad 2\ 3\ 7\\
4\overline{)9^15^30^2}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

|5=The answer in this example is 237 with a remainder of 2. Alternatively, we can continue the above procedure if we want to produce a decimal answer. We do this by adding a [[decimal point]] and zeroes as necessary at the right of the dividend, and then treating each zero as another digit of the dividend. Thus, the next step in such a calculation would give the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\quad 2\ 3\ 7.\ 5\\
4\overline{)9^15^30.^20}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Using the alternative layout the final workings would be:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{r}
4\underline{)9^{1}5^{3}0.^{2}0}\\
2^{\color{White}1}3^{\color{White}3}7.^{\color{White}2}5\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Prime factoring==
[[File:Factorizing.JPG|thumb|An example of manual factorizing.]]
A common requirement is to reduce a number to its prime factors.  This is used particularly in working with [[Fraction (mathematics)|vulgar fractions]].  The dividend is successively divided by prime numbers, repeating where possible:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{r}
2\underline{)950}\\
5\underline{)475}\\
5\underline{){\color{White}0}95}\\
\ \ \ 19\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

So 950 = 2 x 5² x 19

==Modulo division==

When one is interested only in the [[remainder]] of the division, this procedure (a variation of short division) ignores the quotient and tallies only the remainders. It can be used for manual [[Modulo operation|modulo calculation]] or as a [[Divisibility rule|test for even divisibility]].
The quotient digits are not written down.

For example, what is the remainder of 16762109 divided by 7?

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
7)16^27^66^32^41^60^49^0
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The remainder is zero, so 16762109 is exactly divisible by 7.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11404">{{for|the theorem about simplexes|Sperner's lemma}}'''Sperner's theorem''', in [[discrete mathematics]], describes the largest possible [[family of sets|families]] of [[finite set]]s none of which contain any other sets in the family. It is one of the central results in [[Extremal combinatorics|extremal set theory]], and is named after [[Emanuel Sperner]], who published it in 1928.

This result is sometimes called Sperner's lemma, but the name "[[Sperner's lemma]]" also refers to an unrelated result on coloring triangulations.  To differentiate the two results, the result on the size of a Sperner family is now more commonly known as Sperner's theorem.

==Statement==
A [[family of sets]] that does not include two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' for which ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is called a [[Sperner family]]. For example, the family of ''k''-element subsets of an ''n''-element set is a Sperner family. No set in this family can contain any of the others, because a containing set has to be strictly bigger than the set it contains, and in this family all sets have equal size. The value of ''k'' that makes this example have as many sets as possible is ''n''/2 if ''n'' is even, or the nearest integer to ''n''/2 if ''n'' is odd. For this choice, the number of sets in the family is &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}&lt;/math&gt;.

Sperner's theorem states that these examples  are the largest possible Sperner families over an ''n''-element set.
Formally, the theorem states that, for every Sperner family ''S'' whose union has a total of ''n'' elements,
:&lt;math&gt;|S| \le \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Partial orders==
Sperner's theorem can also be stated in terms of [[partial order width]]. The family of all subsets of an ''n''-element set (its [[power set]]) can be [[partially ordered]] by set inclusion; in this partial order, two distinct elements are said to be incomparable when neither of them contains the other. The width of a partial order is the largest number of elements in an [[antichain]], a set of pairwise incomparable elements. Translating this terminology into the language of sets, an antichain is just a Sperner family, and the width of the partial order is the maximum number of sets in a Sperner family.
Thus, another way of stating Sperner's theorem is that the width of the inclusion order on a power set is &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[Graded poset|graded]] [[partially ordered set]] is said to have the [[Sperner property of a partially ordered set|Sperner property]] when one of its largest antichains is formed by a set of elements that all have the same rank. In this terminology, Sperner's theorem states that the partially ordered set of all subsets of a finite set, partially ordered by set inclusion, has the Sperner property.

== Proof ==
The following proof is due to {{harvtxt|Lubell|1966}}. Let ''s&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the number of ''k''-sets in ''S''. For all 0 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n'',

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose \lfloor{n/2}\rfloor} \ge {n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

and, thus,

:&lt;math&gt;{s_k \over {n \choose \lfloor{n/2}\rfloor}} \le {s_k \over {n \choose k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''S'' is an antichain, we can sum over the above inequality from ''k'' = 0 to ''n'' and then apply the [[Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality|LYM inequality]] to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^n{s_k \over {n \choose \lfloor{n/2}\rfloor}} \le \sum_{k=0}^n{s_k \over {n \choose k}} \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

which means

:&lt;math&gt; |S| = \sum_{k=0}^n s_k \le {n \choose \lfloor{n/2}\rfloor}.&lt;/math&gt;

This completes the proof.

==Generalizations==
There are several generalizations of Sperner's theorem for subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P(E),&lt;/math&gt; the poset of all subsets of ''E''.

===No long chains===
A '''chain''' is a subfamily &lt;math&gt;\{S_0,S_1,\dots,S_r\} \subseteq \mathcal P(E)&lt;/math&gt; that is totally ordered, i.e., &lt;math&gt;S_0 \subset S_1\subset \dots\subset S_r&lt;/math&gt; (possibly after renumbering).  The chain has ''r'' + 1 members and '''length''' ''r''.  An ''r'''''-chain-free family''' (also called an ''r'''''-family''') is a family of subsets of ''E'' that contains no chain of length ''r''.  {{harvtxt|Erdős|1945}} proved that the largest size of an ''r''-chain-free family is the sum of the ''r'' largest binomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{i}&lt;/math&gt;.  The case ''r'' = 1 is Sperner's theorem.

===''p''-compositions of a set===
In the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P(E)^p&lt;/math&gt; of ''p''-tuples of subsets of ''E'', we say a ''p''-tuple &lt;math&gt;(S_1,\dots,S_p)&lt;/math&gt; is &amp;le; another one, &lt;math&gt;(T_1,\dots,T_p),&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;S_i \subseteq T_i&lt;/math&gt; for each ''i'' = 1,2,...,''p''.  We call  &lt;math&gt;(S_1,\dots,S_p)&lt;/math&gt; a ''p'''''-composition of''' ''E'' if the sets &lt;math&gt;S_1,\dots,S_p&lt;/math&gt; form a partition of ''E''.  {{harvtxt|Meshalkin|1963}} proved that the maximum size of an antichain of ''p''-compositions is the largest ''p''-multinomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{n_1\ n_2\ \dots\ n_p},&lt;/math&gt; that is, the coefficient in which all ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are as nearly equal as possible (i.e., they differ by at most 1).  Meshalkin proved this by proving a generalized LYM inequality.

The case ''p'' = 2 is Sperner's theorem, because then &lt;math&gt;S_2 = E \setminus S_1&lt;/math&gt; and the assumptions reduce to the sets &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; being a Sperner family.

===No long chains in ''p''-compositions of a set===
{{harvtxt|Beck|Zaslavsky|2002}} combined the Erd&amp;ouml;s and Meshalkin theorems by adapting Meshalkin's proof of his generalized LYM inequality.  They showed that the largest size of a family of ''p''-compositions such that the sets in the ''i''-th position of the ''p''-tuples, ignoring duplications, are ''r''-chain-free, for every &lt;math&gt;i = 1,2,\dots,p-1&lt;/math&gt; (but not necessarily for ''i'' = ''p''), is not greater than the sum of the &lt;math&gt;r^{p-1}&lt;/math&gt; largest ''p''-multinomial coefficients.

===Projective geometry analog===
In the finite projective geometry PG(''d'', ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) of dimension ''d'' over a finite field of order ''q'', let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(p,F_q)&lt;/math&gt; be the family of all subspaces.  When partially ordered by set inclusion, this family is a lattice.  {{harvtxt|Rota|Harper|1971}} proved that the largest size of an antichain in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(p,F_q)&lt;/math&gt; is the largest [[Gaussian coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} d+1 \\ k\end{bmatrix};&lt;/math&gt; this is the projective-geometry analog, or ''q'''''-analog''', of Sperner's theorem.

They further proved that the largest size of an ''r''-chain-free family in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal L(p,F_q)&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the ''r'' largest Gaussian coefficients.  Their proof is by a projective analog of the LYM inequality.

===No long chains in ''p''-compositions of a projective space===
{{harvtxt|Beck|Zaslavsky|2003}} obtained a Meshalkin-like generalization of the Rota&amp;ndash;Harper theorem.  In PG(''d'', ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;), a '''Meshalkin sequence''' of length ''p'' is a sequence &lt;math&gt;(A_1,\ldots,A_p)&lt;/math&gt; of projective subspaces such that no proper subspace of PG(''d'', ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;) contains them all and their dimensions sum to &lt;math&gt;d-p+1&lt;/math&gt;.  The theorem is that a family of Meshalkin sequences of length ''p'' in PG(''d'', ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;), such that the subspaces appearing in position ''i'' of the sequences contain no chain of length ''r'' for each &lt;math&gt;i = 1,2,\dots,p-1,&lt;/math&gt; is not more than the sum of the largest &lt;math&gt;r^{p-1}&lt;/math&gt; of the quantities 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} d+1 \\ n_1\ n_2\ \dots\ n_p \end{bmatrix} q^{s_2(n_1,\ldots,n_p)},&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} d+1 \\ n_1\ n_2\ \dots\ n_p \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; (in which we assume that &lt;math&gt;d+1 = n_1+\cdots+n_p&lt;/math&gt;) denotes the ''p''-Gaussian coefficient

== Stable manifold theorem ==
Let 
:&lt;math&gt;f: U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;
be a [[smooth map]] with hyperbolic fixed point at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. We denote by &lt;math&gt;W^{s}(p)&lt;/math&gt; the [[stable manifold|stable set]] and by &lt;math&gt;W^{u}(p)&lt;/math&gt; the [[unstable set]] of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8948">In [[algebra]] and [[algebraic geometry]], given a [[commutative]] [[Noetherian ring]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in it, the '''''n''-th symbolic power''' of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the ideal

:&lt;math&gt; I^{(n)} = R \cap \bigcap_{P\in \operatorname{Ass}(I)} I^n R_P &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_P &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Localization of a ring|localization]] of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and the intersection runs through all of the [[associated prime]]s of &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt;

Though this definition does not require &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; to be [[prime ideal|prime]], this assumption is often worked with because in the case of a [[prime ideal]], the symbolic power can be equivalently defined as the &lt;math&gt;I &lt;/math&gt;-[[Primary decomposition|primary component]] of  &lt;math&gt;I^n&lt;/math&gt;. Very roughly, it consists of functions with zeros of order ''n'' along the variety defined by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.  We have: &lt;math&gt;I^{(1)} = I&lt;/math&gt; and if  is a [[maximal ideal]], then &lt;math&gt;I^{(n)} = I^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Symbolic powers induce the following chain of ideals:

:&lt;math&gt;  I^{(0)}=R\supset I=I^{(1)}\supset I^{(2)}\supset I^{(3)}\supset I^{(4)}\supset \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

== Uses ==
The study and use of symbolic powers has a long history in [[commutative algebra]]. [[Wolfgang Krull|Krull’s]] famous proof of his [[Krull's principal ideal theorem|principal ideal theorem]] uses them in an essential way. They first arose after [[primary decomposition]]s were proved for [[Noetherian rings]]. [[Oscar Zariski|Zariski]] used symbolic powers in his study of the analytic [[Normal space|normality]] of [[algebraic varieties]]. [[Claude Chevalley|Chevalley's]] famous lemma comparing [[topology|topologies]] states that in a [[local ring|complete local domain]] the symbolic powers [[topology]] of any [[prime number|prime]] is [[Comparison of topologies|finer]] than the [[completion (algebra)|''m''-adic topology]]. A crucial step in the vanishing theorem on [[local cohomology]] of Hartshorne and Lichtenbaum uses that for a prime &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; defining a [[curve]] in a [[local ring|complete local domain]], the powers of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] with the symbolic powers of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. This important property of being [[cofinality|cofinal]] was further developed by Schenzel in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In algebraic geometry ==
Though [[generator (mathematics)|generators]] for ''ordinary powers'' of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are well understood when &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is given in terms of its generators as &lt;math&gt; I = (f_1, \ldots, f_k)&lt;/math&gt;, it is still very difficult in many cases to determine the generators of symbolic powers of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. But in the [[Geometry|geometric]] setting, there is a clear geometric interpretation in the case when &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a [[radical ideal]] over an [[algebraically closed field]] of [[characteristic zero]].

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Irreducible component|irreducible]] [[algebraic variety|variety]] whose ideal of vanishing is &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, then the ''[[Differential ideal|differential power]]'' of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  consists of all the [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; that vanish
to order ≥ ''n'' on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;I^{\langle n\rangle} := \{ f \in R \mid f \text{ vanishes to order} \geq n \text{ on all of }X \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Or equivalently, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{m}_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[maximal ideal]] for a point &lt;math&gt;p\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I^{\langle n\rangle}=\bigcap _{p \in X} \mathbf{m}_p^n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem (Nagata, Zariski)'''&lt;ref&gt;David Eisenbud. Commutative Algebra: with a view toward algebraic geometry, volume 150. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be a prime ideal in a [[polynomial ring]] &lt;math&gt;K[x_1, \ldots , x_N ]&lt;/math&gt; over an algebraically closed field. Then
:&lt;math&gt;I^{(m)}=I^{\langle m\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;
This result can be extended to any [[radical ideal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=math/0611696|last1=Sidman|first1=Jessica|title=Prolongations and computational algebra|last2=Sullivant|first2=Seth|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formulation is very useful because, in [[characteristic zero]], we can compute the differential powers in terms of generators as:

:&lt;math&gt;I^{\langle m\rangle}=\left\langle f \mid \frac{\partial^\mathbf{a}f}{\partial x^\mathbf{a}}\in I \text{ for all }\mathbf{a}\in \mathbb{N}
^N \text{ where }|\mathbf{a}|=\sum_{i=1}^N a_i\leq m-1 \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

For another formulation, we can consider the case when the base [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is a [[polynomial ring]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. In this case, we can interpret the ''n''-th symbolic power as the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of all function [[germ (mathematics)|germs]] over &lt;math&gt; X = \operatorname{Spec}(R) \text{ vanishing to order} \geq n \text{ at } Z=V(I)&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[smooth scheme|smooth variety]] over a [[perfect field]], then

:&lt;math&gt; I^ {(n)} = \{f \in R \mid f \in \mathbf{m}^ n \text{ for every closed point }\mathbf{m} \in  Z\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Dao|first=Hailong|last2=De Stefani|first2=Alessandro|last3=Grifo|first3=Eloísa|last4=Huneke|first4=Craig|last5=Núñez-Betancourt|first5=Luis|date=2017-08-09|title=Symbolic powers of ideals|eprint=1708.03010|class=math.AC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Containments ==
It is natural to consider whether or not symbolic powers agree with ordinary powers, i.e. does &lt;math&gt;I^n=I^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; hold? In general this is not the case. One example of this is the prime ideal &lt;math&gt;P =(x^4-yz,\, y^2-xz, \,x^3y-z^2) \subseteq K[x,y,z]&lt;/math&gt;. Here we have that &lt;math&gt;P^2\neq P^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, &lt;math&gt;P^2\subset P^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; does hold and the generalization of this [[containment order|containment]] is well understood. Indeed, the containment &lt;math&gt;I^n\subseteq I^{(n)}&lt;/math&gt;follows from the definition. Further, it is known that &lt;math&gt;I^r\subseteq I^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;m\leq r&lt;/math&gt;. The proof follows from [[Nakayama's lemma]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Thomas Bauer, S Di Rocco, Brian Harbourne, Micha l Kapustka, Andreas Knutsen, Wioletta Syzdek, and Tomasz Szemberg. A primer on seshadri constants. Contemporary Mathematics, 496:33, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been extensive study into the other containment, when symbolic powers are contained in ordinary powers of ideals, referred to as the Containment Problem. Once again this has an easily stated answer summarized in the following theorem. It was developed by Ein, Lazarfeld, and Smith in characteristic zero &lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Ein, Robert Lazarsfeld, and Karen E Smith. Uniform bounds and symbolic powers on smooth varieties. Inventiones mathematicae, 144(2):241–252, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and was expanded to [[Characteristic (algebra)|positive characteristic]] by Hochster and Huneke.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Hochster and Craig Huneke. Comparison of symbolic and ordinary powers of ideals. Inventiones mathematicae, 147(2):349–369, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Their papers both build upon the results of [[Irena Swanson]] in ''Linear Equivalence of Ideal Topologies'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;[[Irena Swanson]]. Linear equivalence of ideal topologies. Mathematische Zeitschrift, 234(4):755–775, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem  (Ein, Lazarfeld, Smith; Hochster, Huneke)''' Let &lt;math&gt;I\subset K[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N]&lt;/math&gt; be a [[graded ring|homogeneous ideal]]. Then the containment
:&lt;math&gt;I^{(m)}\subset I^r&lt;/math&gt;  holds for all &lt;math&gt;m\geq Nr&lt;/math&gt;.
It was later verified that the [[upper and lower bounds|bound]] of &lt;math&gt; N&lt;/math&gt; in the theorem cannot be tightened for general ideals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=0706.3707|last1=Bocci|first1=Cristiano|title=Comparing powers and symbolic powers of ideals|last2=Harbourne|first2=Brian|class=math.AG|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a question posed&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; by Bocci, Harbourne, and Huneke, it was discovered that a better bound exists in some cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7771">[[File:Translation of a set.svg|thumb|300px|For translational invariant functions &lt;math&gt;f:\R^2\rightarrow\R&lt;/math&gt; it is &lt;math&gt;f(A)=f(A+t)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Lebesgue measure]] is an example for such a function.]]

In [[geometry]], a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] "slides" a thing by '''a''': ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''p''') = '''p''' + '''a'''.

In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], continuous '''translational symmetry''' is the [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariance]] of a system of equations under any translation. Discrete translational [[symmetry]] is invariant under [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] translation.

Analogously an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] ''A'' on functions is said to be translationally invariant with respect to a [[Translation (geometry)|translation operator]] &lt;math&gt;T_\delta&lt;/math&gt; if the result after applying ''A'' doesn't change if the argument function is translated.
More precisely it must hold that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \delta \ A f = A (T_\delta f).\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Laws of physics]] are translationally invariant under a spatial translation if they do not distinguish different points in space. According to [[Noether's theorem]], space translational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the [[momentum]] conservation law.

Translational symmetry of an object means that a particular translation does not change the object. For a given object, the translations for which this applies form a group, the [[symmetry group]] of the object, or, if the object has more kinds of symmetry, a subgroup of the symmetry group.

== Geometry ==
{{Lie groups}}
Translational invariance implies that, at least in one direction, the object is infinite: for any given point '''p''', the set of points with the same properties due to the translational symmetry form the infinite discrete set {'''p'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'''''a'''|''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''} = '''p'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''Z''' '''a'''. Fundamental domains are e.g. '''H'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1] '''a''' for any [[hyperplane]] '''H''' for which '''a''' has an independent direction. This is in 1D a [[line segment]], in 2D an infinite strip, and in 3D a slab, such that the vector starting at one side ends at the other side. Note that the strip and slab need not be perpendicular to the vector, hence can be narrower or thinner than the length of the vector.

In spaces with dimension higher than 1, there may be multiple translational symmetry. For each set of ''k'' independent translation vectors, the symmetry group is isomorphic with '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. 
In particular, the multiplicity may be equal to the dimension. This implies that the object is infinite in all directions. In this case, the set of all translations forms a [[lattice (group)|lattice]]. Different bases of translation vectors generate the same lattice [[if and only if]] one is transformed into the other by a matrix of integer coefficients of which the [[absolute value]] of the [[determinant]] is 1. The [[absolute value]] of the [[determinant]] of the matrix formed by a set of translation vectors is the hypervolume of the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped]] the set subtends (also called the ''covolume'' of the lattice). This parallelepiped is a [[fundamental region]] of the symmetry: any pattern on or in it is possible, and this defines the whole object. 
See also [[lattice (group)]]. 

E.g. in 2D, instead of '''a''' and '''b''' we can also take '''a''' and '''a'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;'''b''', etc. In general in 2D, we can take ''p'''''a'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q'''''b''' and ''r'''''a'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s'''''b''' for integers ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', and ''s'' such  that ''ps''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''qr'' is 1 or &amp;minus;1. This ensures that '''a''' and '''b''' themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors. If not, not all translations are possible with the other pair. Each pair '''a''', '''b''' defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the [[cross product]]. One parallelogram fully defines the whole  object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a fundamental domain. The vectors '''a''' and '''b''' can be represented by complex numbers. For two given lattice points, equivalence of choices of a third point to generate a lattice shape is represented by the [[modular group]], see [[lattice (group)]].
 
Alternatively, e.g. a rectangle may define the whole object, even if the translation vectors are not perpendicular, if it has two sides parallel to one translation vector, while the other translation vector starting at one side of the rectangle ends at the opposite side.

For example, consider a tiling with equal rectangular tiles with an  asymmetric pattern on them, all oriented the same, in rows, with for each row a shift of a fraction, not one half, of a tile, always the same, then we have only translational symmetry, [[Wallpaper_group#Group_.22p1.22|wallpaper group ''p''1]] (the same applies without shift). With rotational symmetry of order two of the pattern on the tile we have ''p''2 (more symmetry of the pattern on the tile does not change that, because of the arrangement of the tiles). The rectangle is a more convenient unit to consider as fundamental domain (or set of two of them) than a parallelogram consisting of part of a tile and part of another one.

In 2D there may be translational symmetry in one direction for vectors of any length. One line, not in the same direction, fully defines the whole object. Similarly, in 3D there may be translational symmetry in one or two directions for vectors of any length. One plane ([[Cross-section (geometry)|cross-section]]) or line, respectively, fully defines the whole object.

An example of translational symmetry in one direction in 2D nr. 1) is:

Note: The example is not an example of rotational symmetry.

(get the same by moving one line down and two positions to the right), and of translational symmetry in two directions in 2D (wallpaper group p1):

(get the same by moving three positions to the right, or one line down and two positions to the right; consequently get also the same moving three lines down). 

In both cases there is neither mirror-image symmetry nor rotational symmetry.

For a given translation of space we can consider the corresponding translation of objects. The objects with at least the corresponding  translational symmetry are the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of the latter, not to be confused with fixed points of the translation of space, which are non-existent.

{{UML diagram types}}A '''use case diagram''' at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different [[Use case|use cases]] in which the user is involved. A use case diagram can identify the different types of users of a system and the different use cases and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses.

== Application ==
While a [[Use Case|use case]] itself might drill into a lot of detail about every possibility, a use-case diagram can help provide a higher-level view of the system. It has been said before that "Use case diagrams are the blueprints for your system".&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin et al, 2006, page 297&lt;/ref&gt; They provide the simplified and graphical representation of what the system must actually do.

Due to their simplistic nature, use case diagrams can be a good communication tool for [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. The drawings attempt to mimic the real world and provide a view for the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] to understand how the system is going to be designed. Siau and Lee conducted research to determine if there was a valid situation for use case diagrams at all or if they were unnecessary. What was found was that the use case diagrams conveyed the intent of the system in a more simplified manner to [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] and that they were "interpreted more completely than class diagrams".&lt;ref&gt;Siau &amp; Lee, 2004, page 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the use case diagrams is simply to provide the high level view of the system and convey the requirements in laypeople's terms for the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. Additional diagrams and documentation can be used to provide a complete functional and technical view of the system.

In [[modal logic]], the '''window operator''' &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[modal operator]] with the following [[semantic]] definition:

&lt;math&gt;M,w\models\triangle\phi \iff \forall u, M,u\models\phi\Rightarrow Rwu&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;M=(W,R,f)&lt;/math&gt; a [[Kripke model]] and &lt;math&gt;w,u\in W&lt;/math&gt;. Informally, it says that ''w'' "sees" every [[φ]]-world (or every φ-world is seen by ''w''). This operator is not definable in the basic modal logic (i.e. some propositional non-modal language together with a single primitive "necessity" (universal) operator, often denoted by '&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;', or its existential dual, often denoted by '&lt;math&gt;\Diamond&lt;/math&gt;'). Notice that its [[truth condition]] is the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the truth condition for the standard "necessity" operator.

For references to some of its applications, see the References section.
