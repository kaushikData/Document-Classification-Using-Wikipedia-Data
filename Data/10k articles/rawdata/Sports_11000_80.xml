The '''[[Eredivisie|Netherlands Football League Championship]] 1894/1895''' was contested by six teams from the cities [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Haarlem]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Wageningen]]. The teams participated in the competition that would later be called ''Eerste Klasse West''. But since the western football district of the Netherlands was the only one to have a competition at the time, it could be regarded as a national championship. This was also the reason that [[GVC (football club)|Go Ahead Wageningen]] participated, as they would later play in the eastern division. [[Koninklijke HFC]] won the championship.

The '''1988 [[UCI Road World Championships]]''' took place in [[Ronse]], [[Belgium]]. As this was an Olympic year all the [[Cycling at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic cycling events]] served as World Championships, leaving just the Professional road race and the Women's Team Time Trial to be contested. The men's road race was decided in a sprint involving three riders, [[Maurizio Fondriest]], [[Claude Criquielion]] and [[Steve Bauer]]. 200 meters from the uphill finish, Bauer began the sprint and Fondriest was unable to respond. However Criquielion accelerated to the right of Bauer, close to the barriers. Bauer saw him coming with a much greater speed and closed the gap, which resulted in pushing Criquielion into the barriers. Bauer was also hampered by his manoeuvre and lost a lot of speed, making it easy for Fondriest to ride past and claim the world title. Criquelion's bike was damaged too much to cycle again and he was passed by the pursuing group while walking to the finish line. Bauer finished second but was immediately disqualified after the race.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

'''Andrews Field''', formerly known as '''Westbran Stadium''', is a [[baseball stadium]] located in the city of [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]], [[Manitoba]].  Although the stadium is used solely for amateur baseball, it has received praise as one of the best baseball venues in Canada.

==History==
Westbran Stadium, as it was originally known, was constructed in 1987 at a cost of $1.3 million.&lt;ref name="horde"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horne |first=William R. |title=Municipal Economic Development Via Hallmark Tourist Events |journal=The Journal of Tourism Studies |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=6 |publisher=[[James Cook University]] |location=[[Cairns, Australia]] |date=May 2000 |url=http://www.jcu.edu.au/business/public/groups/everyone/documents/journal_article/jcudev_012720.pdf |accessdate=18 August 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its opening, the stadium has been hosted a number of provincial, national, and international tournaments, including two [[18U Baseball World Cup|World Under-18 Championships]], two Canadian Senior Championships, and the 1997 [[Canada Summer Games]] baseball tournament.&lt;ref name="baseballcanada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball.ca/eng_news_story.cfm?NewsID=1921|title=Canada's Favourite Ballpark: Week 2|publisher=[[Baseball Canada]]|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1997 Summer Games, a [[The Sports Network|TSN]] broadcaster commented that Westbran Stadium was "as good as many Triple-A fields".&lt;ref name="horde" /&gt;

In 2007, the stadium was renamed Andrews Field in recognition of the late Neil Andrews, a long time volunteer and local baseball executive.&lt;ref name="bs1"&gt;{{cite news| title = Andrews Field up for tops in the country | newspaper = Brandon Sun | date = 19 July 2011 | url = http://www.brandonsun.com/breaking-news/Andrews-Field-up-for-tops-in-the-country-125822233.html | accessdate = 18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Andrews Field was among the top eight chosen for Canada's Favorite Ballpark, a contest held by [[Baseball Canada]].&lt;ref name="baseballcanada" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bs1" /&gt;

The stadium is currently home to Brandon's two senior baseball clubs, the Marlins and Cloverleafs.

[[File:De Balneis Puteolanis MS 1474 Biblioteca Angelica de Rome 3.jpg|thumb|Illumination from ''De balneis Puteolanis'' -late 13th century manuscript, MS 1474, [[Biblioteca Angelica]] in Rome]]

'''''De balneis Puteolanis''''' ("On the baths of Pozzuoli") is a medieval didactic poem in Latin, attributed to [[Peter of Eboli]], describing the thermal baths of [[Pozzuoli]] in the [[Campi Flegrei]] region of [[Campania]]. The poem has the alternative title '''''De balneis terrae laboris'''''.

The poem in thirty-five epigrams was written in the last decade of the twelfth century, probably in 1197. It is dedicated to the emperor ("Cesaris ad laudem"), probably [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The author "reports every detail about more than thirty different thermal sites in the Campi Flegrei, including all therapeutic effects of their waters."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15293539 Mezzogiorno et al. (2004). "Pietro Anzolino da Eboli and the thermal therapy of renal pathologies". J Nephrol. 2004 Mar-Apr;17(2):329-33. PMID: 15293539.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution to [[Peter of Eboli]] ''(Petrus de Ebulo)'' is generally made "with some certainty", although some historians associate it with the work of Sicilian physician [[Alcadino di Siracusa]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulvio Delle Donne, [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pietro-da-eboli_(Federiciana)/ "Pietro da Eboli"], ''Enciclopedia Federiciana'', Vol. II, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani&lt;/ref&gt;

''De balneis Puteolanis'' was popular in its time and survives in a number of manuscript versions. It was also translated into vernacular languages and was issued in 12 editions in print, from 1457 to 1607.

Many surviving manuscript versions are especially notable for their accompanying illustrations of medieval [[bathing]].

Many of the thermal baths described in the Pozzuoli region were destroyed in the 1538 volcanic eruption which transformed the landscape of the Campi Flegrei caldera and created [[Monte Nuovo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6960">{{for|the National Football League or National Hockey League's disabled list|injured reserve list}}

In [[Major League Baseball]], the '''disabled list''' ('''DL''') is a method for teams to remove their injured players from the roster in order to summon healthy players.

==General guidelines==
Players are placed on either the '''10-day''' (prior to the 2017 season, '''15-day''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBA ending All-Star link to World Series' home-field advantage|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/18178051/new-cba-ending-all-star-link-world-series|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''60-day disabled list''', usually depending on the severity and/or recovery time of the injury. A player may be shifted from the 10-day to the 60-day DL at any time, but not vice versa. The player may not rejoin the team until 10 or 60 days has elapsed; however, a player's time on the DL may exceed the specified number of days, and, further, if a player is transferred to the 60-day DL after August 1, he may not return to the active roster that season. The rule about rejoining the team only applies to active duty. Players are permitted to stay with the team and attend games, though players may leave the team for short term minor league rehabilitation assignments to prepare for their return to the active roster.

The 10-day DL does not count the player on the [[active roster]] (comprising the [[25-man roster]] until September 1), whereas the 60-day DL does not require the player to be counted on either the team's active roster or its [[40-man roster]]; however, a team's 40-man roster must be full in order for the option of a placement on the 60-day disabled list to be available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/rules_regulations.jsp "MLB Miscellany: Rules, regulations and statistics"] [[MLB.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Placing a player on the disabled list opens a spot on the [[active roster]]. Another player from the [[minor leagues]], [[free agent]] pool, a traded player, or a recovered player coming off the disabled list may be used to fill this spot.  This allows a team to avoid being penalized because it avoids the disadvantage of playing with a reduced roster.

Retroactive placement may be made at most 10 days after the time of injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indians.scout.com/2/569136.html "Scout.com: MLB Roster Rules"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Concussion List===
Starting with the 2011 season, Major League Baseball instituted a new disabled list, a '''7-day''' list specifically for [[concussion]]s. The idea is to prevent long-term brain damage which may take up to 7 days by current standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=6270514 MLB institutes 7-day DL for concussions] [[ESPN]]&lt;/ref&gt; If a player is not activated from the concussion DL after those 7 days have passed, he is automatically transferred to the 10-day DL.

===Paternity List===
Also in 2011, Major League Baseball instituted a '''paternity list'''. This allows a team to replace a player who is an expectant father for 1–3 days on the roster to be available for the birth of his child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110505&amp;content_id=18668180&amp;notebook_id=18669986&amp;vkey=notebook_nym&amp;c_id=nym#18668604 Bay returns, appreciative of paternity leave] MLB.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bereavement List===
A player may be placed on the '''bereavement list''' upon attending to a seriously ill member in the player's immediate family or to a death in the family. The bereavement list may span from a minimum of three to a maximum of seven games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecubreporter.com/book/export/html/3537|title=MLB Status Lists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umpiring's bereavement list for death in the immediate family may span up to a full season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.closecallsports.com/2015/03/off-bereavement-sam-holbrook-returns-to.html|title = Off Bereavement, Sam Holbrook Returns to Field|date = 20 March 2015|accessdate = |website = Close Call Sports &amp; Umpire Ejection Fantasy League|publisher = |last = Imber|first = Gil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minor League Baseball===
[[Minor League Baseball]] uses a 7-day disabled list for all injuries. Players who are on the 40-man roster but get hurt in the minor leagues are placed on the minor league DL, but not on the major league DL. One problem this poses is that a player who is injured in the minors and who would be placed on the major league 60-day DL cannot be placed on the 60-day, meaning the 40-man roster spot is not freed up.

The freed-up roster spot can be strategically valuable, leading to occasional creative use of disabled lists by MLB teams and their affiliates (similar to teams appealing or dropping the appeal of a suspended player to maximize player contribution). Players who are performing poorly and are slightly injured might be put on the DL so they can go to the minors on rehab, when the MLB club might only want them in the minors because they are playing poorly. There are rules against blatantly "[[gaming the system]]" in the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the players and the league.

A team may keep an injured player on the roster but keep him listed as 'day-to-day' to indicate that the medical staff is unable to determine when the player can resume normal playing activities again. If the injury turns out to be minor, then the player may resume playing without having to wait to come off the disabled list; however, depending upon the circumstances, the team may find itself effectively shorthanded in the meantime.

Players recovering from an injury may appear in a limited number of minor league games while still on the disabled list in order to prepare for reactivation. Non-pitchers may stay in the minor league club for up to 20 days; pitchers for up to 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/transanctionsprimer.html "Transactions Primer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The categories and variety of disabled lists have changed numerous times over the years. The 15-day disabled list was introduced in 1966, joining 10-day, 21-day and 30-day options, and the 60-day disabled list in 1990. Prior to 1990, the number of players who could be placed on each list was limited, players with major league contracts were not allowed to go to the minor leagues for rehabilitation, and there was less flexibility about when they could return to action. The 10-day disabled list was dropped in 1984 but restored for the 2017 season (replacing the 15-day option), and the 21-day and 30-day options were dropped in 1990 with the introduction of the 60-day disabled list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawkins|first=Corey|title=The Disabled List: A History|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=15967|work=Baseball Prospectus|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1973, ten-year-old Eddie Edwards dreams of [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] glory, practicing in various Olympic events and failing miserably. His mother unconditionally supports him, while his father constantly discourages him. As a young teen, he gives up his dream of participating in the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Games]] in favour of [[skiing]] in the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]]. Although successful at the sport, he is rejected by British Olympic officials for being uncouth. Realizing he could make the team as a [[Ski jumping|ski jumper]] (a sport in which the United Kingdom had not participated in six decades), he decamps to a training facility in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[Germany]]. The more seasoned jumpers, specifically those on the Norwegian team, belittle him.

He self-trains, and after successfully completing the {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} hill on his first try, he injures himself on his first try from a {{convert|40|m|ft|adj=on}} hill. Alcoholic [[Snow grooming|snow groomer]] Bronson Peary encourages Eddie to give up, but Eddie's tenacious spirit and shared feelings of ostracism by the other jumpers there convince him to train Eddie. Peary is a former champion American ski jumper who left the sport in his 20s after a conflict with his mentor, famous ski jumper Warren Sharp, which Eddie learns from Petra, the kindly owner of a nearby tavern. With very little time to qualify for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Eddie and Bronson employ various unorthodox methods to condition and refine Eddie's form, and he successfully completes the 40m hill.

To qualify for the British Olympic division in ski jumping, Eddie only needs to complete a jump from a {{convert|70|m|ft|adj=on}} hill in order to qualify for the Winter Olympics. Not long after, he manages to land the jump successfully, with a distance of 34 metres (112&amp;nbsp;ft), thus winning a place on the British Olympic Team. However, the officials, in an effort to keep Eddie from sullying the Winter Games with his amateurish skillset, decide to change the rules and demand that he jump at least {{convert|61|m|ft}}. Though discouraged, Eddie decides to continue training and performs on a circuit, his jumps increasing in length each time, but unable to meet the Olympic requirements. During a practice jump at the final event before the cutoff date for qualification, he lands a 61m jump exactly, but on his official jump, he falls and is disqualified. Eddie is devastated and resolves to return home to work with his father as a plasterer, but he receives a letter claiming that his qualifying practice jump is valid, and he happily tells Bronson that he's eligible to compete in the Winter Olympics. Bronson tries to dissuade him, promising that he will make a complete fool of himself and his country if he goes, but Eddie is undeterred, noting that competing in the Olympics was always enough for him.

Upon arriving in Calgary, he receives instant scorn from the other British athletes, who get him drunk and nearly provoke him into fighting after he is subsequently absent from the opening ceremonies. Despite finishing last in the 70m jump with {{convert|60.5|m|ft}}, Eddie sets a British record. His triumphant celebrations win the audience over, and the media embrace him as Eddie "The Eagle". Over the phone, Bronson criticises Edwards for not taking the sport seriously. Edwards publicly apologizes to the press for his antics, and wanting to ensure he does not leave the games as little more than a novelty, he enters the {{convert|90|m|ft|adj=on}} jump, which he had never attempted before. Bronson decides to travel to the games and support him. After an encouraging conversation with his idol [[Matti Nykänen|Matti "The Flying Finn" Nykänen]] on the lift to the top of the hill, Eddie barely manages to land a {{convert|71.5|m|ft|adj=on}} jump. Once again, he scores last in the event, but is nonetheless cheered by the audience as well as millions around the world, which includes a playful salute in the closing speech of the [[President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games]], Frank King. British Olympic officials grudgingly accept him.

Warren Sharp reconciles with Bronson, who was present, and Edwards returns home a national hero to the cheers of his fans at the airport, his mother rushes to him embracing him. And as Eddie looks to his father, he reveals a jumper declaring his support before then embracing Eddie as well.

'''Five Flags Center''' is a multi-purpose facility in downtown [[Dubuque, Iowa]]. It is named for the five flags that have flown over Dubuque; the [[Fleur de Lis]] of [[France]] (1673–1763), the Royal Flag of [[Spain]] (1763–1803), the Union Jack of [[Great Britain]] (1780, during a brief interruption of Spanish rule), the [[French Republic]] Flag of [[Napoleon]] (1803) &amp; America's [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] (1803–Present).

==History==
The site's first theater was the Athenaeum Theater, built in 1840, which became the City Hotel (also a theater) in 1846 and later the Peosta House.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=72000474}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Orpheum Theatre and Site / Majestic Theatre |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=July 13, 2016|author=Gent M. Wittenberg |date=August 1972}} with {{NRHP url|id=72000474|photos=y|title=12 photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second theatre was originally built in 1864{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} or 1877,&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc/&gt; but then was destroyed by fire in 1910. It had been purchased then renovated during 1909-1910 by local prominent businessman Harker Brentnal Spensley, Sr. and his partner, C. H. Eighmey.

The current Great Five Flags Theater was constructed as the Majestic Theater in 1910.  The rebuilt theater was designed by [[George L. Rapp]], who eventually became one of the nation's premier theater architects. It was converted to a movie house in 1920 and renamed 'Spensley Theater' in 1929. Constructed in a Renaissance Revival style with French influences, it was later renamed the [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] Orpheum and used to show movies. Eventually, it fell into disrepair and was slated for demolition during [[urban renewal]] in 1969.

A committee made up of concerned citizens began a fund drive to save the theater, which was incorporated in the Five Flags Center project in 1972. Restoration was begun in 1975, and the theater was reopened in 1976 as the Five Flags Theater. It is currently the home of the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra, high school musicals, and occasional concerts and ballet productions.

==Arena==
Five Flags Arena was conceived as part of a project to rehabilitate the Five Flags Theater. Construction began in 1976, and the facility opened in 1979. The first event was a concert by [[Bob Hope]].

The arena can seat up to 5,200 for [[basketball]], although in its primary use, [[ice hockey]], actual seating capacity is only about 2,500.

It features one side of permanent seating; the other three sides are bleachers, some for [[Loras College]] basketball, and most of Dubuque's major concerts.

High school graduation ceremonies for Hempstead High School and Senior High School have been held at the center.

The Five Flags Center was formerly the main convention center in Dubuque, but construction of the [[Grand River Event Center]] in 2003, moved many events away from Five Flags.

It was also the former home of the [[Dubuque Fighting Saints (1980-2001)]] of the [[United States Hockey League]] from 1980–2001 and the home of the [[Dubuque Thunderbirds]] hockey team of the [[Central States Hockey League]] from 2001–2010.

Dubuque opened a new Ice Arena, the [[Mystique Ice Center]], which opened in Fall of 2010, and now hosts the expansion [[Dubuque Fighting Saints]].

[[SMG (property management)|SMG]] took over operations of the arena in 2004, which were formerly handled by the City of Dubuque.

In 2005, the arena was closed during the summer for concession, entrance, and concourse renovation.

'''Hapoel Petah Tikva''' is a [[Team handball|handball]] team from the city of [[Petah Tikva]], [[Israel]].

Hapoel is one of the oldest handball clubs in the country, the most successful period was in the late-1960s and early-1970s when the team won 3 championships.

The last time Petah Tikva played in the top division was in the 1996-97 season, they finished 12 out 14 and did not manage to win the relegation playoff.

In August 1997 Hapoel merged with [[Maccabi Petah Tikva (handball)|Maccabi Petah Tikva]] and played as [[Ironi Petah Tikva]] for 12 seasons in the top division. In September 2009 the merger was over as the supporters of Hapoel reformed their team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrg.co.il/online/3/ART1/938/155.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:manning_tyree_catch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eli Manning]] (top) breaks away from several defenders to make the 32-yard pass to [[David Tyree]] (bottom) over [[Rodney Harrison]].]]
The '''Helmet Catch''' was an [[American football]] [[American football plays|play]] involving [[New York Giants]] quarterback [[Eli Manning]] and wide receiver [[David Tyree]] in the final two minutes of [[Super Bowl XLII]] on February 3, 2008. It featured Manning escaping from the grasp of three [[New England Patriots]] defensive players and throwing a [[forward pass]], followed by Tyree making a leaping catch by pressing the ball against his helmet. The play, a 32-yard gain during a [[Glossary of American football#D|drive]] on which the Giants scored the game-winning [[touchdown]], was instrumental in the Giants' 17–14 upset victory over the Patriots, who were on the verge of becoming the first [[National Football League]] (NFL) team to finish a season [[perfect season|undefeated and untied]] since the [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972 Miami Dolphins]], and the first since the NFL adopted a 16-game schedule in {{nfly|1978}}. [[NFL Films]]' [[Steve Sabol]] called it "the greatest play the [[Super Bowl]] has ever produced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sabol |first=Steve |authorlink=Steve Sabol |title=Sabol's Shot – Tyree catch |publisher=[[NFL Films]] |date=February 10, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |url=http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d8069f011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was also named by NFL Films as "The Play of the Decade (2000s)".&lt;ref name="PlayOfTheDecade"&gt;{{cite web |title=Play of the decade |publisher=NFL Films |date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-films-presents/09000d5d8163c627/Play-of-the-decade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Tyree had been used primarily on [[American football positions#Special teams|special teams]] and had only 4 receptions for 35 yards and no touchdowns during the 2007 regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=David Tyree Statistics |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TyreDa00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tyree was seldom used as a receiver during the regular season, he caught the Giants' first touchdown of the Super Bowl early in the fourth quarter, (which was Tyree's first touchdown of the season) giving his team a 10–7 lead at the time. The Patriots, undefeated on the season and heavily favored to win the game, scored a touchdown on a pass from [[Tom Brady]] to [[Randy Moss]] to take a 14–10 lead with 2:42 remaining in the game. The Giants then faced a 3rd down with 5 yards needed for a 1st down from their own 44-yard line with 1:15 remaining. On the previous play, Patriots' cornerback [[Asante Samuel]] dropped what could have been a game-sealing [[interception]].

==Play==
[[Image:Tyree catch.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Tyree re-enacts his catch during the victory rally at Giants Stadium after the Super Bowl.]]
Manning was given the play call "62 Sail-Y Union" from the Giants' playbook in hopes of connecting with a receiver downfield. On third and 5 from the Giants' 44 yard line, Manning took the snap in the [[shotgun formation]] and immediately faced pressure from the Patriots [[defensive end]]s [[Richard Seymour]], [[Jarvis Green]], and [[linebacker]] [[Adalius Thomas]]. Green grabbed Manning by the shoulder while Seymour grabbed him by the back of his jersey and attempted to pull him down for a [[Quarterback sack|sack]]. Manning, however, was able to stay on his feet and duck under the arms of the Patriot defenders before [[Quarterback scramble|scrambling]] backwards into space at around the 34 yard line. [[Linebacker]]s [[Mike Vrabel]] and [[Junior Seau]] attempted to sack Manning, but he was able to throw the ball towards David Tyree. After [[Eli Manning]] released the [[Ball (gridiron football)|football]], he was immediately hit by [[Mike Vrabel]]. He threw the ball downfield to Tyree at the 24 yard line of the Patriots. [[NFL on Fox|Fox]] announcer [[Troy Aikman]] said after the play, "I don't know how he got out of there." Had Manning been sacked, the Giants would have faced a fourth down with around 8 yards to go for a first, and would have needed to convert for the second time on the drive to keep their chances to win alive (halfback [[Brandon Jacobs]] converted on a 4th and 1 three plays earlier in the drive).

Tyree was unable to run his intended route due to a jam by [[Ellis Hobbs]]. Starting cornerback Asante Samuel was on the left side of the field, walking to the line of scrimmage right before the snap to jam [[Plaxico Burress]]. Tyree saw Manning under pressure and instead came back towards the line to give Manning an option down the field, stopping at the 25 yard line. As the ball arrived Tyree made a fully extended leap for it, while Patriots [[strong safety]] [[Rodney Harrison]], also leaping fully extended in tight coverage, attempted to knock it down. Initially, Tyree caught the ball with both hands, but a swipe by Harrison's arm caused his left hand to be knocked off the ball. However, Tyree was able to secure possession of the ball by pressing it against the top of his helmet with his right hand. Harrison pulled him down, and Tyree landed on top of him with the ball still pressed against his helmet. [[Free safety]] [[James Sanders (American football)|James Sanders]] and [[cornerback]]s [[Asante Samuel]] and [[Ellis Hobbs]] were there, but neither had the time to assist Harrison in trying to prevent Tyree from making the catch.

The play gained 32 yards for the Giants and gave them a first down with 58 seconds left. After the play, the Giants called [[time-out (sport)|timeout]]. Four plays later, [[Plaxico Burress]] scored the touchdown that won the game for the Giants, 17–14. It was the Patriots' only loss of the season, preventing them from finishing with a perfect 19–0 record.

==Nickname==
Like other famous plays in the NFL, this play has been given nicknames, but largely due to two separate, unique occurrences in the play, consensus was not reached on a single name for some time. In 2009, readers of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' voted on nicknaming the play "Catch-42" as the favored name in reference to Super Bowl&amp;nbsp;XLII and the kind of coverage the Patriots deployed against the Giants' four-receiver set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vacchiano|first=Ralph|title=Daily News readers pick 'Catch 42'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/giants/daily-news-readers-pick-catch-42-blog-entry-1.1658517|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=December 18, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, David Tyree has adopted the "Catch-42" nickname as well as [[ESPN.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Spencer |first=Sheldon |title=David Tyree recalls 'Catch-42' |publisher=ESPN.com |date=January 25, 2011 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2010/news/story?id=6011037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proposed nicknames include "The Escape and the Helmet Catch", "The E-mmaculate Connection" (a pun on the [[Immaculate Reception]]; the 'E' standing for Eli), "The Double Miracle", and "The Reception that Ended Perfection".&lt;ref name="PlayOfTheDecade" /&gt; "The Great Escape" was used by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] during the Giants' [[White House]] visit. "David and Eliath" was also suggested by David Tyree due to [[Bible|biblical]] reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Tyree |first=David |subjectlink=David Tyree |interviewer=[[Jimmy Kimmel]] |work=[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]] |date=February 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bill Simmons]] named it "The Helmet Catch" five days after the game, and as time passed by, this became the consensus name for the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=The Super Bowl&amp;nbsp;XLII mailbag |publisher=ESPN.com |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/080208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The catch won the 2008 [[Best Play ESPY Award]].  The award ceremony featured a spoof by host [[Justin Timberlake]], who "revealed" that he had left [[Chewing gum|gum]] on David Tyree's helmet, which helped him catch the pass (since he caught it close to the top of his helmet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everett, Tyree, NY Giants win ESPY Awards |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=July 17, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |url=http://www.cnycentral.com/sports/story.aspx?id=160531}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the acceptance speech, Tyree jokingly stated, "Justin, thanks for the gum." Eli Manning also jokingly thanked his offensive line, "for giving me zero pass protection."

In an [[2011&amp;ndash;12 NFL playoffs#NFC: New York Giants 37, Green Bay Packers 20|NFC Divisional playoff game]] against the defending [[Super Bowl XLV]] champion [[Green Bay Packers]] on January 15, 2012, Manning threw a [[Hail Mary pass]] at the end of the first half, which was caught in the end zone by [[Hakeem Nicks]], giving the Giants a 20–10 lead. Nicks caught the ball by cradling it against his helmet, which prompted commentators [[Joe Buck]] and [[Troy Aikman]] to note the similarity to Tyree's catch. Incidentally, Buck and Aikman were also the commentators of Super Bowl XLII. The Giants would go on to beat the Packers 37–20,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Borden |first=Sam |title=Giants&amp;nbsp;37, Packers&amp;nbsp;20: Giants Knock Out the Champs |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=January 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/sports/football/giants-upset-packers-to-reach-nfc-title-game.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Division Can't Miss Play: Nicks does it again|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/09000d5d826086f7/Divisional-Can-t-Miss-Play-Nicks-does-it-again|publisher=National Football League|date=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as win [[Super Bowl XLVI|another Super Bowl against the New England Patriots]].

{{quote box|quote="It’s probably the luckiest play in NFL history.

The origins of nicknames (if known) are noted below. Several of the above are simply shortened names or plays on the current team name or jersey.

*'''"Bay Street Bullies"''' - [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]: a play on [[Philadelphia Flyers|Philadelphia Flyers']] ''Broad Street Bullies''. Originally used by the line composed of [[Gary Roberts (ice hockey)|Gary Roberts]], [[Shayne Corson]] and [[Darcy Tucker]] due to their gritty style of play and because the team [[Air Canada Centre|arena]] is located on [[Bay Street]].
*'''"Big Bad Bruins"''' - Boston Bruins: During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Bruins were known for their physical style of play as well as their success. During recent years, similarities have revived the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Is Boston back to being ‘The Big Bad Bruins’?|url =http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2011/02/13/is-boston-back-to-being-the-big-bad-bruins/|author =O'Brien, James|publisher =Pro Hockey Talk|date =Feb 13, 2011|accessdate =2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''"Broad Street Bullies"''' – Philadelphia Flyers: during the team's Stanley Cup runs during the 1970s, their home ice was the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] on Broad Street in [[South Philadelphia]] and the team was noted for its physical play. The team currently plays in the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]] (which is also on Broad Street).
*'''"Buds"''' – Toronto Maple Leafs: probably based on the team's use of a leaf as a logo, particularly the secondary logo which includes more tiny lobes than is common in most actual maple leaves - bearing a resemblance to other plants which are known for their buds.
*'''"Cats"''' - [[Florida Panthers]]: the Panther is a cat.
*'''"Golden Misfits'''" - [[Vegas Golden Knights]]: In reference to the expansion team status of the Golden Knights, the term was coined by one of its players [[Ryan Reaves]].
*'''''"Les Glorieux"''''' ([[French language|French]], "The Glorious Ones") – [[Montreal Canadiens]]
*'''"Hogs"''' - Toronto Maple Leafs: based on Toronto's nickname [[Toronto the Good|Hogtown]].
*'''"The Katanas"''' - [[Buffalo Sabres]]: based off the team (Tokyo Katanas) the imaginary player [[Taro Tsujimoto]] was drafted from in [[1974 NHL Amateur Draft|1974]] by then Sabres' GM [[Punch Imlach]], Katanas being an approximation for "Sabres" in the Japanese language.
*'''"The 'Notes"''' - [[St. Louis Blues]]: abbreviation of "Bluenotes".
*'''"'Nucks"''' – [[Vancouver Canucks]]: abbreviation of "Canucks". (Local Press and fans)
*'''''"Les Rouges"''''' – Montreal Canadiens: after the red colour of their jerseys.
*'''"Slugs"''' - Buffalo Sabres: a disparaging nickname derived from their logo, which resembles a cross between a buffalo and a slug.
*'''"Swords"''' - Buffalo Sabres: a nickname derived from their title, the "sabres", which is a sword.
*'''"Sabs"''', '''Sabes''' - Buffalo Sabres: abbreviation of the name "Sabres".
*'''''"Le Tricolore"''''' (French, "The Tricolour") – Montreal Canadiens: after the [[flag of France]], which has the same colour scheme (blue-white-red).
*'''"Southern Stars"''' - [[Dallas Stars]]: as opposed to the [[Minnesota North Stars|North Stars]], who they replaced.
*'''"Tomales"''' – Toronto Maple Leafs: taken from the first two letters of the teams full name ('TO'ronto 'MA'aple 'LE'afS).
*'''"Dead Wings"''' - [[Detroit Red Wings]]: nickname given by the rivaled Hawks fans.
*'''''"La sainte flanelle"''''' (French, "The Holy Flannel") - [[Montreal Canadiens]] : Maurice Richard came back on the ice after being cut to the head to score the Stanley Cup winning goal against Boston Bruins in 1953.  His jersey was full of blood.

'''Merchiston Park''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛər|k|ɪ|s|t|ən|}}) was a [[association football|football]] ground in [[Bainsford]], near [[Falkirk]], which was the home of [[East Stirlingshire F.C.]] between [[circa|c.]]1882 and 1920. It was located near Main Street, just north of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] at Bainsford Bridge.

==History==

===Early years===
[[East Stirlingshire F.C.]] was formed in 1880 when a group of friends from a cricket team called ''Bainsford Blue Bonnets'' formed a football team under the name ''Britannia''.&lt;ref name="History_1880-1900"&gt;[http://www.eaststirlingshirefc.com/the-club/club-history/1880-1900/ Club History - 1880-1900], [[East Stirlingshire F.C.]]. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the club's first year of existence it found a home at Randyford Park in the east of Falkirk. At the time, the ground's previous tenant was a cricket team called ''East Stirlingshire Cricket Club'' and in 1881, Britannia also adopted the East Stirlingshire name, which stands to this day.&lt;ref name="History_1880-1900" /&gt; 

By 1882, East Stirlingshire is recorded as having played home games at Merchiston Park in [[Bainsford]]. The ground was located just west of Main Street and north of the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] at Bainsford Bridge. One of the first matches at the ground under the East Stirlingshire name was against neighbours [[Falkirk F.C.]] and ended in a 4–0 defeat for the home side.&lt;ref name="Falkirk_FC_match"&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/br1anmccoll/falkirkfc18771891.pdf Falkirk FC Matches 1882-83], ''oocities.org''. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was admitted to the second tier of the [[Scottish Football League]] in 1900 and played its first ever league game at Merchiston Park in August of the same year. The match was against [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]], in front of a crowd of 2,500 people, and ended in a 3–2 defeat.&lt;ref name="History_1900-1940"&gt;[http://www.eaststirlingshirefc.com/the-club/club-history/1900-1940/ Club History - 1900-1940], [[East Stirlingshire F.C.]]. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="London_Hearts_1900"&gt;[http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/a1900/eaststirlingshire1901.htm Results for East Stirlingshire for 1900-01], ''londonhearts.com''. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the whole ground was moved a few hundred metres south to make way for a new railway line, the Bainsford Branch, which bypassed [[Falkirk Grahamston railway station]] to the north.&lt;ref name="Bainsford_branch"&gt;[http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Grangemouth_Railway/frame.htm Grangemouth Railway (Forth and Clyde Canal Company)], ''railbrit.co.uk''. 11 March 2012. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The line no longer exists and now forms the route of the [[A9 road (Scotland)|A9 Falkirk Ring Road]].

===Move to Firs Park===
The ground was closed completely in 1920 when the adjacent Burnbank Iron Foundry acquired the Merchiston Park grounds for expansion.&lt;ref name="Merchiston_1907"&gt;Easton, T. (1907). [http://collections.falkirk.gov.uk/search.do?id=181683&amp;db=object&amp;page=1&amp;view=detail Museum &amp; Archives Collection], Falkirk Community Trust. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The club then moved south of the canal to Firs Street in Falkirk, where [[Firs Park]] was located.&lt;ref name="Merchiston_1907" /&gt; It remained the club's home for 87 years, until 2008, when it was vacated due to the prohibitive cost of expanding the venue.&lt;ref name="BBC_departure"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/east_stirlingshire/7376220.stm Shire explain Firs Park Departure], [[BBC Sport]]. 30 April 2008. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; East Stirlingshire now plays its home games at [[Ochilview Park]], the home of neighbours [[Stenhousemuir F.C.]] in a [[groundshare]] agreement.&lt;ref name="BBC_departure" /&gt;

In 2012, East Stirlingshire opened a club shop in Bainsford, near to the former location of Merchiston Park, with the aim of recognising the club's historical roots.&lt;ref name="Bainsford_club_shop"&gt;[http://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/sport/local-sport/football/shire-go-back-to-the-future-1-2330652 Shire go back to the future], [[Falkirk Herald]]. 1 June 2012.

The centre hosted [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|tennis]] events of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], and the [[Wheelchair tennis at the Summer Paralympics|wheelchair tennis]] events of the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]]. The centre was built on the site of the former [[Nelson Piquet International Autodrome]].

The centre was designed by architect [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners]], along with [[Schlaich Bergermann Partner|schlaich bergermann partner]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbp.de/en/project/olympic-park-rio-2016-tennis-venues/|title=Olympic Park Rio 2016 - Tennis Venues|website=www.sbp.de|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction started in 2013 and was completed in 2016. However, the stadium faced numerous hurdles during construction. The biggest of these was when the city of Rio de Janeiro canceled the construction contract 200 days before the start of the games and finned the consortium responsible for delays 11 million reais ($2.7 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-rio-tennis/rio-cancels-contract-for-olympic-tennis-center-due-to-delays-idUSKCN0US2LM20160114|title=Rio cancels contract for Olympic tennis center due to delays|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2015, the centre court was named after [[Maria Esther Bueno]], a former Brazilian tennis player, who became the first woman ever to win all four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] doubles titles in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/olimpiadas/noticia/2015/12/paes-inaugura-arena-olimpica-de-tenis-em-homenagem-maria-esther-bueno.html | title=Paes inaugura arena olímpica de tênis em homenagem a Maria Esther Bueno | work=globoesporte | date=12 December 2016 | accessdate=10 March 2016 | author=Fontes, Carol | language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also marked the first ever event to be held at the [[Barra Olympic Park]], which saw 75 Brazilian tennis players take part in a competition. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/brazil-mastercup-proves-a-masterstroke-as-tennis-venue-declares-itself-ready-for-rio|title=Brazil Mastercup proves a masterstroke as tennis venue declares itself ready for Rio|date=2017-01-24|work=International Olympic Committee|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Orange County International Raceway''' was a combined {{frac|1|4}}-mile [[United States|US]] [[dragstrip]] and 2-mile road course located in [[Irvine, California]] adjacent to the [[Interstate 5]] ([[Interstate 5|I-5]]) [[Santa Ana Freeway]]. Under a lease agreement with the [[Irvine Company]], OCIR – as it was known in racing circles – was in operation from August 5, 1967 until its closure on October 30, 1983.  The track was so named because its founders envisioned hosting sports car, motorcycle, midget, and stock car races in addition to [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) sanctioned drag racing events.

Known as 'The Supertrack', OCIR was designed to be the most modern of [[dragstrip]] facilities in the late 1960s, offering spectator comforts and conveniences never before available at a drag race facility in [[Southern California]]. The track construction included the extensive use of landscaping, permanent restrooms and concession stands, reserved seats with backs, drinking fountains installed throughout, the sport's first electric scoreboard and a 40-foot-high, four-story, glass-enclosed control tower and administration building.

The well-known [[Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving]] was founded at the track in 1968.

'''Orienteering''' is a group of [[sport]]s that requires [[navigation]]al skills using a [[map]] and [[compass]] to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain whilst moving at speed. Participants are given a topographical map, usually a specially prepared [[orienteering map]], which they use to find [[Control point (orienteering)|control points]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a training exercise in [[Land navigation (military)|land navigation for military officers]], orienteering has developed many variations. Among these, the oldest and the most popular is [[foot orienteering]].  For the purposes of this article, foot orienteering serves as a point of departure for discussion of all other variations, but almost any sport that involves racing against a clock and requires navigation with a map is a type of orienteering.

==Orienteering sports==
Orienteering sports combine significant [[navigation]] with a specific method of travel.  Because the method of travel determines the needed equipment and tactics, each sport requires specific rules for competition and guidelines for orienteering event logistics and [[Course (orienteering)|course]] design.

[[International Orienteering Federation]], the governing body of the sport, currently sanctions the following four disciplines as official disciplines in the sport of orienteering:
* [[Foot orienteering]] (FootO)
* [[Mountain bike orienteering]] (MTBO)
* [[Ski orienteering]] (SkiO)
* [[Trail orienteering]] (TrailO)

Moreover, [[International Amateur Radio Union]] (IARU) sanctions the following orienteering sport:
* [[Amateur radio direction finding]] (Radio orienteering or ARDF) [including variants [[Fox Oring]] and [[Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area]] (ROCA)]

Other orienteering disciplines include, but are not limited to:
* [[Canoe orienteering]]
* [[Car orienteering]]
* [[Mountain marathon]]ing
* [[Mounted orienteering]]
* [[Rogaining]]
* SportLabyrinth – micro orienteering

[[Adventure racing]] is a combination of two or more disciplines, and usually includes orienteering as part of the [[Racing|race]].

===National===
&lt;!--Country/nation. Note UK is one nation comprising four countries--&gt;
{{See also|Category:International Orienteering Federation members|l1=International Orienteering Federation members}}

There are governing bodies for most of the individual nations that are represented in the sport of orienteering. These national bodies are the rule-making body for that nation. For example, the [[British Orienteering Federation]] is the national governing body for the [[United Kingdom]]. The federation was founded in 1967 and it is made up of 13 constituent associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/about/index.php|title=About British Orienteering|accessdate=2008-05-25|publisher=British Orienteering Federation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105559/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/about/index.php|archivedate=2008-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[United States]], the national governing body is [[Orienteering USA]].

===Regional===
Most nations have some form of regional governing bodies. These are not rule-making bodies but are there to assist in coordinating clubs within that region, e.g., they may allocate dates so that clubs do not clash with their events.

===Local===
{{See also|Category:Orienteering clubs|l1=Orienteering clubs}}
Clubs are usually formed at a local level and affiliated to their national governing body. It is clubs who put on events usually open to all-comers. Clubs may also put on practice, training, and social events.
Open clubs are open to anyone and there is usually no restriction on joining them.
Closed clubs restrict their membership to specific groups. For example, BAOC (British Army Orienteering Club)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baoc.org.uk/ |title= BAOC Online |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=baoc.org.uk |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has restrictions on who may join, principally British Army personnel.

==History==
{{main|History of orienteering}}

The history of orienteering begins in the late 19th century in [[Sweden]], the actual term "orientering" (the original Swedish name for orienteering, lit. "orientation") was first used in 1886 and meant the crossing of unknown land with the aid of a map and a compass.&lt;ref name=iof_past_present&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006/iof/past_present|title=Past &amp; present|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2008-09-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802131200/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?%2Fiof2006%2Fiof%2Fpast_present|archivedate=2008-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden, orienteering grew from [[Military education and training|military training]] in [[land navigation (military)|land navigation]] into a competitive sport for military officers, then for civilians. The name is derived from a word root meaning to find the direction or location. The first orienteering competition open to the public was held in [[Norway]] in 1897.&lt;ref name=iof_past_present/&gt;

From the beginning, locations selected for orienteering have been chosen in part for their beauty, natural or man-made. For the first public orienteering competition in Sweden, in 1901, control points included two historic churches, [[Spånga Church|Spånga kyrka]] and [[Bromma Church|Bromma kyrka]] (a [[round church]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientering.se/t2.asp?p=3398 |title=Milstolpar i utvecklingen |publisher=Svenska Orienteringsförbundet |language=Swedish |accessdate=2008-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233231/http://www.orientering.se/t2.asp?p=3398 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Orienteering Championships 2007 - middle distance 04.jpg|thumb|right|World Orienteering Championships 2007 in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. Winners of middle-distance event: [[Simone Niggli-Luder]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Thierry Gueorgiou]], [[France]]]]
With the invention of inexpensive yet reliable compasses, the sport gained popularity during the 1930s. By 1934, over a quarter million Swedes were participants, and orienteering had spread to [[Finland]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Hungary]]. Following [[World War II]], orienteering spread throughout Europe and to Asia, North America and Oceania. In Sweden in 1959, an international orienteering conference was held. Representatives from 12 countries ([[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]], [[Hungary]], Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, [[Yugoslavia]]) participated.&lt;ref name=iof_past_present/&gt;  In 1961, orienteering organizations representing 10 European nations&lt;!-- 10 national federations? --&gt; founded the [[International Orienteering Federation]] (IOF). Since then, IOF has supported the founding of many national orienteering federations. By 2010, 71 national orienteering federations were member societies of the [[International Orienteering Federation]].&lt;ref name=iof_nations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006|title=National Federations|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2006-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061227191403/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?%2Fiof2006|archive-date=2006-12-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These federations enabled the development of national and world championships. World championships were held every two years until 2003, then every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.asn.au/promotion/facts/History/|title=Orienteering: A Brief History|publisher=Orienteering Australia|accessdate=2008-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719230326/http://www.orienteering.asn.au/promotion/facts/History/|archivedate=2008-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this time, orienteering has remained most popular in [[Scandinavia]]. There, the two oldest recurring orienteering meets have been held since the 1940s ([[Jukola relay]] and [[Tiomila]]), and the single largest orienteering meet has been held every year since 1965 and attracts around 15,000 competitors ([[O-Ringen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/The+Jukola+Relay+is+about+much+more+than+orienteering+/1135228145846|title=The Jukola Relay is about much more than orienteering|last=Pulkkinen|first=Sanna|publisher=Helsingin Sanomat|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, orienteering is run in wild terrain. In its Scandinavian origins, this typically meant in the [[forest]], but orienteering in open [[fell]], [[heathland]], [[moorland]] and other mixed terrain is also common. Orienteering in [[town]]s has been common for many years. Street-O has typically been a low-key affair; score events, often at night, normally as informal training events. The [[Venice]] street-O is notable for attracting a large international participation. With Park World Tour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwt.org|title=Park World Tour|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; races and other (e.g. World championships) elite sprint races often being held in urban areas, and the development of a map specification for urban areas (ISSOM), from the mid-2000s, Street-O has been rebranded as urban orienteering, and has taken itself rather more seriously, with full colour maps and electronic punching, and may now be regarded as a serious competition with inclusion in national ranking lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/page/rankings|title=British Orienteering Rankings|accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such urban races are often much longer than the sprint distance.

==Competition and results==
===Basics===
[[File:Tajfuto.jpg|thumb|left|An orienteer at a control point]]

The competition, or race, is intended to test the navigational skill, concentration, and running ability of the competitors. High levels of [[physical fitness|fitness]] and running speed are required to compete successfully at an international or elite level. To ensure fairness between competitors the map is not usually provided until the start, and starts are normally staggered with competitors starting at not less than one-minute intervals.&lt;ref name=nutshell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orienteer.com/nutshell.htm |title=Your first orienteering event |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=orienteer.com |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516084924/http://www.orienteer.com/nutshell.htm |archive-date=2008-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective on each leg is to follow the fastest route between controls. The fastest is not always the shortest route, and can depend heavily on [[Route choice (orienteering)|route choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oq.asn.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=85|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224192329/http://www.oq.asn.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=85|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-02-24|title=Foot Orienteering|publisher=[[Orienteering Queensland]]|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Map===
[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005.PNG|thumb|left|An orienteering map]]
Orienteering competitions use specially prepared [[orienteering map]]s. They are topographic maps although much more detailed than general-purpose maps. The ISOM map scales are 1:15,000 or 1:10,000, with grids aligned to [[Magnetic declination|magnetic]] [[north]]. Map symbols are standardized by the IOF,&lt;ref name=iof-map-2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/International-Specification-for-Orienteering-Maps-2000.pdf |format=PDF|title=International Specification for Orienteering Maps|accessdate=2011-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed to be readable by any competitor regardless of background or native tongue.

===Courses===
[[File:Orienteering map control points.svg|thumb|right|An example of how control points are shown on an orienteering map]]
Orienteering events offer a range of courses, of varying physical and technical difficulty, to meet the needs of competitors. The orienteering [[course (orienteering)|course]] is marked in purple or red on a map.&lt;ref name=themap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williams.edu/Biology/Faculty_Staff/hwilliams/Orienteering/map.html |title=The Map |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher=www.williams.edu |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[triangle]] is used to indicate the start and a double [[circle]] indicates the finish. Circles are used to show the control points.&lt;ref name=ounlimited&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orienteeringunlimited.com/ODetails.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010412133640/http://orienteeringunlimited.com/ODetails.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-04-12 |title=Details of the sport of orienteering |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Age-related classes====
At international, national, and the larger events, courses are classified by age, e.g., M35 for men 35 years of age and older. Classes requiring similar distances and difficulties are usually combined into a smaller number of courses, e.g., M60 will normally share a course with W50, and often with M65 and W55. The results are normally arranged by class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyprus-orienteering.com/htmldocs/pdf/ColourCodedexplained.pdf|title=Courses and classes - cutting through the confusion.|year=1997|publisher=Cyprus Orienteers|accessdate=2015-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904010428/http://www.cyprus-orienteering.com/htmldocs/pdf/ColourCodedexplained.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ability-based courses====

Short, easy courses are provided for beginners and younger competitors, with technically and physically demanding courses being provided for experienced orienteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runningforfun.co.uk/orienteering.html|title=Orienteering |accessdate=2008-09-28 |work= |publisher= www.runningforfun.co.uk |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Permanent courses and other events====
Some orienteering clubs have set up permanent courses, which can be used for personal, or club, training. Non-standard permanent markers are used as control kites, and maps of the courses are usually available publicly for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.orienteering.org/new-o/resources/permanent-courses|title=Permanent Courses|publisher=US Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courses are usually set up in public areas and there may be some restrictions on access, e.g., daylight hours only. Clubs also organise informal events for practice and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sloweb.org.uk/poc/pocinfo.htm |title=Permanent orienteering courses |publisher=South London Orienteers and Wayfarers |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828191654/http://www.sloweb.org.uk/poc/pocinfo.htm |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controls and control description sheet===
[[File:Control description.svg|thumb|right|Control description sheet (pictorial). `Opisy punktów' stands for 'Description of points'.]]
[[Control point (orienteering)|Control points]] are placed on features on the map that can be clearly identified on the ground. Control points are marked in the terrain by white and orange "flags".&lt;!--(or white and red) needs to be in history--&gt;

Competitors receive a "control description sheet" or "clue sheet" which gives a precise description of the feature and the location of the kite, e.g., boulder, 5m, north side. For experienced orienteers the descriptions use symbols (pictorial), in accordance with the ''IOF Control descriptions''.&lt;ref name=iof-controls-2004&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IOF-Control-Descriptions-2004.pdf|format=PDF|title=IOF Control descriptions|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control card and punching===
Each competitor is required to carry an electronic or paper control card, and to present it at the Start and hand it in at the Finish.  The control card is marked by some means at each control point to show that the competitor has completed the course correctly. Most events now use electronic punching, although cards and needle punches are still widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteer.com/nutshell.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221055013/http://orienteer.com/nutshell.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-12-21|title=Your first orienteering event|publisher=orienteer.com|accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results===
The winner is normally the competitor with the fastest time, but other scoring systems can be used, e.g., score events and Trail-O. Most events produce provisional results 'on the day', with draft results on the Internet that night; the final results being confirmed a few days later. With electronic punching&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/Appendices_IElectronicPunching.pdf |format=PDF |title=Appendix I : Electronic Punching |accessdate=2008-10-23 |work= |publisher=www.britishorienteering.org.uk |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807175505/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/Appendices_IElectronicPunching.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the results can include ''split times'' for competitors. These show the times between controls and aggregate times to each control. With suitable computer software these times can be displayed in a graphical form (Progressograph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/event/organisers.php#responsibilities|title=Organisers are responsible for|publisher=British Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080804112125/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/event/organisers.php#responsibilities &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
Each competitor is responsible for his or her own safety. There are no rules, but there are guidelines, which should be followed. The basic safety check was the ''stub check''. The competitor hands in his stub at the start and his control card at the finish. Event officials match the two and any unmatched stubs represent a missing competitor. This has been superseded with electronic punching in that event officials can now request a ‘still to finish’ report listing all those competitors who punched at the start but have not yet downloaded their electronic card. All competitors must report to the finish whether they have completed the course or not.&lt;ref name=nutshell/&gt;&lt;ref name=ounlimited/&gt;

===Personal clothing===
IOF rule 21.1 is that the specification for clothing is delegated to the national organising body, and no specific clothing is required.&lt;ref name=iof-rules2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006/document_library/rules_and_guidelines/foot_orienteering|title=IOF Foot-O Rules|accessdate=2008-11-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614090613/http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?%2Fiof2006%2Fdocument_library%2Frules_and_guidelines%2Ffoot_orienteering|archivedate=2008-06-14|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK rule 7.1.1 requires ''full body cover'': the torso and legs must be covered.&lt;ref name=bof-rules&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/2007Rules_Jan07.pdf|format=PDF|title=BOF Event Rules|accessdate=2008-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704171146/http://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/downloads/documents/2007Rules_Jan07.pdf|archive-date=2008-07-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organiser may allow shorts, e.g., in park or street orienteering.  In the United States, rule A.34.1 states that competitors are free to choose clothing that they are most comfortable in (full leg cover is ''not'' required), unless specifically stated in the meet announcement.

The early competitors used standard athletic clothing, i.e., shorts and an athletic vest, which provided little protection for racing through [[undergrowth]]. Purpose-made lightweight [[nylon]] full-body suits were later adopted. The early ''O-suits'' were made in muted colours but modern suits are generally multi-coloured. Clubs often organise the bulk purchase of clothing, which are then made in the club colours with the club’s name prominently displayed. Some competitors prefer [[Spandex|lycra]] [[tights]] or leggings. [[Gaiters]] are also often worn. Lightweight studded (and often cleated) orienteering shoes are commonly used.

===Personal equipment===
[[File:Compasses orienteering.jpg|thumb|Thumb compass and protractor compass]]
The basic equipment required for orienteering is usually listed as a compass and appropriate [[wilderness|outdoor]] clothing. Most national bodies recommend that a [[whistle]] be carried for [[Whistle#Safety|safety]].

Competitive orienteers usually use specialized equipment:
* A [[thumb compass]], or [[protractor compass]] on a short wrist cord.
* A clear map case to protect the map. May be provided by organizers in competitions.
* A clear plastic sleeve, worn on the forearm, to hold control descriptions.
* A map board, fixed to the handlebars or worn on the arm or strapped to the torso  (MTB-O, Ski-o and [[Amateur radio direction finding|ARDF]] only).
* IOF rules forbid the use of artificial aids that competitors can refer to during a race, so [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and other electronic navigation devices are not used. ([[Amateur radio direction finding|ARDF]] may allow them at some events).  [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] logging devices that track and record position, without allowing competitors to refer to the data during the race, are permitted, and are increasingly being used for post-race route-choice analysis and live tracking for event spectators.

==Competition types==
[[File:Gold Relay UK WOC 2008-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Foot-O relay, the winner crosses the line – joined by the rest of his team]]

Orienteering events can be classified in many different aspects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orienteering.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IOF-Rules-2018-v1.14final.pdf |title=IOF rules |date=2018 |website=orienteering.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* By method of travel: [[FootO]], [[SkiO]], [[Mountain bike orienteering|MTBO]], etc.
* By the length: sprint, middle, long
* By the time the competition was held: day, night
* By the number of competitors: individual, team, relay
* By the visiting order of controls: cross-country (in a specific order), score (free to decide order)

===Long===
Classic orienteering involves a race between controls in a preset order.  The winner is the person who completes the course in the shortest time. This is called a "cross-country" course as distinct from a score course (see below). Courses are normally designed so that the fastest route is not straightforward to find on the map, or to follow on the ground. The classic race has a typical winning time of 75–90 minutes. As of 2007, the IOF have dictated that the "classic" course should be redesignated the "long".

===Middle===
The middle distance is a shorter cross-country race than the classic (or long), with a winning time in the region of 30 minutes and with an emphasis more on fine navigation than route-choice. When races of this distance were run in the mid-late 1990s, they were called "short" races, or "sprint-O". The short distance was introduced as a world championship discipline in 1991. More recently, though the IOF have renamed this distance as "middle".

===Relay===
A [[relay race]] is run by a team of competitors each running a course, and the result is based on the team's total time. Relays usually employ a mass start instead of a staggered start. Relays are part of [[World Orienteering Championships]] both as sprint relays and as cross-country relays. Additionally, there are popular mass club races out of which [[Jukola relay]] has the highest number of participating clubs 1,787 (in 2015), while [[25-manna]] has the highest number of legs 25.  To reduce competitors following each other, various spreading methods might be used. This is called "gaffling", which is a Swedish word meaning "forking". The key principle is that every team must run every leg (between each pair of two controls), but not necessarily in the same order. The IOF have introduced the nomenclature to try to clarify the usage of the word "leg". In orienteering usage, leg normally refers to the part of a race between two control points. In relay (non-orienteering) usage, leg refers to the part of a race run by a single team member. The IOF prefer "lap" for this latter term, but despite this, in common parlance, "leg" is used for both terms.

===Score===
Competitors visit as many controls as possible within a time limit. There is usually a mass start (rather than staggered), with a time limit. Controls may have different point values depending on difficulty, and there is a point penalty for each minute late. The competitor with the most points is the winner.
The large-scale, endurance-style version of a Score-O is known as a [[Rogaining|rogaine]], competed by teams in events lasting (often) 24 hours. A very large area is used for competition, and the map scale is smaller. The format originated in Australia. The term ROGAINE is often said to stand for Rugged Outdoor Group Activity Involving Navigation and Endurance; this is essentially a [[backronym]], as the name actually originates from the names of Rod, Gail and Neil Phillips, who were among Australian Rogaining's first participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ptoc.org/begin_guide/htdocs/courses.html|title= Point-to-point orienteering (also called Cross-country orienteering)|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sprint===
Very short races, with winning times in the region of 12–15 minutes, often held in city [[park]]s and other more urban settings. Map scales are usually 1:5,000 or 1:4,000. Control sites can include benches, litterbins, sculptures, and other objects common to urban parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lazarus.elte.hu/mc/specs/issom2005.pdf|format=PDF|title=International Specification for Sprint Orienteering Maps|date=April 15, 2008|publisher=International Orienteering Federation|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sprint distance may also be held in the forest, when it would be called a "forest sprint" as opposed to an "urban sprint". This distance was pioneered in the late 1990s as an elite event by the Park World Tour organisation who organised an independent "world cup" in park sprint orienteering. In 2001 in Tampere, the IOF included a sprint distance in the orienteering world championships.

===Ultrasprint===
[[File:BDHX.jpg|thumb| 300 px|A setting for indoor ultrasprint orienteering]]
Ultrasprint events are held in a specially constructed labyrinth. Due to the limited area of the labyrinth, ultrasprint is a more spectator-friendly form of orienteering. Also, as the course is artificial, identical courses can be set in different geographical locations for simultaneous local competitions as parts of a larger tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nopesport.com/news/1139-sheffield-ultrasprint Sheffield Ultrasprint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportlabyrinth.com/index/0-10 Sport Labyrinth]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Night===
[[File:Start.jpg|thumb|Studying the map at the start of a night orienteering competition, or "night-o"]]
Competitors use a [[Headlamp (outdoor)|headlamp]] to navigate in the dark. Reflective markers often are used on control point flags, which shifts the tactics from precision navigation to searching.  Competitors can travel at high speed to the vicinity of the control point, then sweep the area with the light to catch a reflection off the control flag.  If a night event starts before dark, a mass start must be used so all competitors have equal time in the light and dark. The two classic club relays, Tiomila and [[Jukola]], both include night legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4orienteering.com/terrain_association/56/
|title=Night Navigation
|accessdate=2008-05-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Full length (24-hour) rogaines and many adventure races run through the night, without a light period, and competitors may choose not to rest.

===String===
Competitors follow a string around a short course, noting down things that they find on the way. This is generally used by young children and people new to the sport who want to find out what it is like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://orienteeringusa.org/youth-leaders/materials/o-young |title=The String Course |accessdate=2012-05-04 |publisher=Orienteering USA}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precision===
Precision orienteering generally is not a speed event, but rather a test of the competitors' ability to precisely match map and terrain.  Examples include [[trail orienteering|trail-O]] (untimed), TREC style [[mounted orienteering]], and [[Radio Orienteering in a Compact Area]] (ROCA).  Both trail-O and ROCA use decoys in the vicinity of the control point.

==The Olympics==
Efforts begun in 1996 to promote the inclusion of orienteering in the [[Olympic Games]] have so far been unsuccessful, although orienteering became a sport in the [[World Games]] in 2001, and is a sport in the Summer [[Deaflympics]].  Supporters recognize that the sport is neither television- nor spectator-friendly, the venue of competition is often necessarily remote from major cities, and the duration of the event is longer than most other individual competitions.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady|first=Gerry|title=The Olympics, Orienteering and Ireland|publisher=The Irish Orienteer|year=2008|edition=94|url=http://orienteering.ie/tio/94/OLYMPICS.htm|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Efforts to develop a format suitable for Olympic competitions have focused on park orienteering, micro-orienteering, and short-distance relays. Sprint Orienteering on foot as a format of the sport is most likely to be included in Olympic Games, as this discipline is becoming more and more popular worldwide and can have a significant spectator interest. According to the website of a Chicago Orienteering club, "the International Orienteering Federation is committed to entering the Olympic World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicago-orienteering.org/newsletter/article0303f.htm|title=Current Status of Orienteering in the Olympics|publisher=Chicago Area Orienteering Club|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not an official [[demonstration sport]], an international [[ski-orienteering]] event was held in [[Sugadaira Kōgen]], [[Japan]], as part of the International Cultural Festival held in conjunction with the [[1998 Winter Olympics|XVIII Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="IOF_Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/press/ccil0197.htm |title=Extensive discussion on the Olympic item |publisher=International Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201155503/http://www.orienteering.org/press/ccil0197.htm |archivedate=December 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Orienteering Federation petitioned the International Olympic Committee in 2002 to include ski orienteering in the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympic Games]], noting that it could share the venue with the [[biathlon]] competitions.&lt;ref name="Rönnberg_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0203.htm |title=Ski Orienteering's Olympic Bid |last=Rönnberg |first=Barbro |date=March 2002 |work=O-zine |publisher=International Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209145610/http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0203.htm |archivedate=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its formal recommendation that ski orienteering not be included in those games, the Olympic Programme Commission focused on a lack of participation in the sport outside [[Nordic countries]], "the challenges for broadcasters and spectators to easily follow the competition", and the costs associated with new technology and a new results system.&lt;ref name="olympic_programme_commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/common/asp/download_report.asp?file=en_report_520.pdf&amp;id=520|title=Review of the Olympic Programme and the Recommendations on the Programme of the XX Olympic Winter Games, Turin 2006|last=Cararro|first=Franco|year=2002|publisher=Olympic Programme Commission|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[International Olympic Committee]] confirmed that ski orienteering was under consideration for inclusion in the review process of the Olympic sport program for the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name="Rönnberg_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0512.pdf |format=PDF |title=Green light for continued Olympic campaign |last=Barbrod |first=Rönnberg |date=December 2005 |work=O-Zine |publisher=International Orienteering Federation |accessdate=2008-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209144914/http://www.orienteering.org/ozine0512.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] decided not to include any new sports in this review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=1972|title=Olympic programme updates|publisher=International Olympic Federation|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Filipinos' triple gold all came in Boxing where Mansueto Velasco, Jr. reigned supreme in the light-flyweight division, Elias Recaido Jr. in the flyweight class, and Reynaldo Galido in the light-welterweight category. The three-two-eight gold-silver-bronze showing turned out to be the seventh best by the country at that time in the 43-year history and 12 Asiad stagings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JqMxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2QoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4868%2C3236208 RP boxers get big heroes' welcome], Manila Standard&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[climbing]], a '''piton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|t|ɒ|n}}; also called a '''''pin''''' or '''''peg''''') is a metal spike (usually steel) that is driven into a crack or seam in the climbing surface with a [[Rock climbing hammer|climbing hammer]], and which acts as an anchor to either [[protection (climbing)|protect]] the climber against the consequences of a fall or to assist progress in [[aid climbing]].  Pitons are equipped with an eye hole or a ring to which a [[carabiner]] is attached; the carabiner can then be directly or indirectly attached to a climbing rope.

Pitons were the original form of [[protection (climbing)|protection]] and are still used where there is no alternative.  Repeated hammering and extraction of pitons damages the rock, and climbers who subscribe to the [[clean climbing]] ethic avoid their use as much as possible.  With the popularization of clean climbing in the 1970s, pitons were largely replaced by faster and easier-to-use clean protection, such as [[nut (climbing)|nuts]] and [[spring-loaded camming device|camming devices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loughman|first=Michael|title=Learning to Rock Climb|year=1981|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=Page 78|isbn=0-87156-281-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pitons are still found in place (as "fixed" pitons) on some established [[free climbing]] routes, as fixed belay station anchors, in places where nuts or cams do not work; and are used on some hard aid climbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loughman|first=Michael|title=Learning to Rock Climb|year=1981|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=Page 80|isbn=0-87156-281-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Genereux|first1=Andy|title=Yamnuska Rock: The Crown Jewel of Canadian Rockies Traditional Climbing|date=May 2006|publisher=Rocky Mountain Books|isbn=9781894765749|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection using pitons|url=http://www.mountaineeringmethodology.com/protection-using-pitons/|website=Mountaineering Methodology|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and shapes==

Pitons are sized and manufactured to fit a wide range of cracks.  From small to large, the most common are:
* '''RURP''' – for Realized Ultimate Reality Piton – a tiny piton the size of a postage stamp used in thin, shallow seams. It was designed by [[Tom Frost]] and [[Yvon Chouinard]] in 1959, and manufactured by Chouinard Equipment in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jones, Chris |title=Climbing in North America |page=274 |publisher=American Alpine Club and University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1976 |isbn=0-520-02976-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a strong piece, and is mainly used for [[aid climbing]], although it can feature as protection on extreme free routes (e.g. Rurp The Wild Berserk (E6 6b) at The Brand, Leicestershire, UK).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leicesterclimbs.f9.co.uk/ThebrandR.htm Climbs at The Brand]&lt;/ref&gt; More recent versions of the RURP include '''Bird Beaks''' and '''Peckers'''.
* '''Knifeblade''' – also known as Bugaboos, are a thin straight piton, that work in thin, deep cracks.
* '''Lost Arrow''' – designed by [[John Salathé]] and Yvon Chouinard, are a hot-forged, tapered piton that performs well in medium-size cracks.
* '''Angle''' – A piton made of steel sheet bent into a "U", "V", or "Z" shape; work well for larger cracks, where the steel deforms elastically as the piton is placed.
* '''Bongs''' – The largest pitons are angles made from aluminium sheet called '''bongs''', named for the sound they produce while being hammered into place, or the sound they make when dropped.  Bongs have become rare with the advent of [[Spring-loaded camming device|camming]] units, [[Nut (climbing)|nuts]] (chocks) which protect the same wide cracks more easily, and without causing damage to the rock.

==Materials and evolution==

Early pitons were made of malleable iron and soft steel and would deform to the shape of the crack when driven into the rock, which worked well in the irregular cracks found on European limestone.  Soft pitons are difficult to remove without damaging the piton, so they were frequently left in place and became fixed anchor points on a climb.

During climbing exploration of the hard granite in [[Yosemite Valley]] in the 1950s and 1960s, it was found that soft pitons did not work very well. The long routes developed in Yosemite made it impractical and costly to fix routes, and the soft pitons were not durable enough to be placed and removed more than a few times.  Pitons needed to be removed and used again on subsequent pitches, sometimes many times.  Leaving gear in place went against the ethics of many climbers.  [[John Salathé]] pioneered designs using hardened steel which were much tougher than the European pitons.  Salathé's pins, which he developed for a climb of the [[Lost Arrow Spire|Lost Arrow]], resisted deformation and were easier to remove and reuse, and were durable enough to be reused indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McNamara, Chris |title=Yosemite Big Walls: SuperTopo  |url=http://www.supertopo.com/bigwalls/yosemite/bigwalls.html |page=113 |publisher=SuperTopo |location=Mill Valley |year=2000 |isbn= 0-9672391-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
;Films
* In the [[James Bond]] film ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' (1981), [[James Bond]] ([[Roger Moore]]) makes use of pitons while climbing a sheer cliff face, as a means to infiltrate the villain Kristatos' ([[Julian Glover]]) hideout.  Just before he gets to the top of the cliff, Bond is met by Apostis, one of Kristatos' assassins.  Apostis tries to kill Bond by knocking his pitons out of the rock, which would cause Bond to fall to his death. Just before Apostis knocks out the last piton, Bond unclips another piton from his belt and uses it as a throwing knife, injuring Apostis and sending the assassin falling to his death.  Bond is then able to infiltrate Kristatos' hideout.
;Games
* In the [[video game]] ''[[I Am Alive]]'', the main character can also use a piton to rest and replenish their [[Endurance|stamina]] while climbing for extended periods of time.
* In ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'', Nathan Drake acquires a piton from a hanged corpse. The tool becomes more used in the later half of the game.
;Literature
* [[Dan Simmons]]' historical fiction novel, ''The Abominable'' (2013), centers on mountain climbing and frequently depicts passages in which piton use is crucial (e.g., Chapter 5). Additionally, the world class British Alpinist, Richard Davis Deacon, sneers at the Germans' heavy use of such equipment, while the narrator, his younger American protege, deems it brilliant (Chapter 6).
;Television
* In the ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' season 2 episode "Eagles", [[Angus MacGyver|MacGyver]] must climb a mountain to save baby eagles. Short of equipment, he uses tent stakes as pitons.
*[[The Alienist (TV series)]] Season 1 Episode 4 (These bloody thoughts), the two Jewish twins who works on the case, discover a metal tool on the ground of the crime scene. (the old immigration station, also known as the battery). One of the twins, called Marcus finds a 'piton' on the ground, which was used by their suspect.

'''Sanshou (Wushu Sanshou)''', also known as '''Sanda (Wushu Sanda)''', '''Chinese boxing''' or '''Chinese kickboxing''', is a [[China|Chinese]] [[self-defense]] system and [[combat sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZG1tmt7nmkC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=sanda+china&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fwuyVPHbLcnvUpLugdgJ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=sanda%20china&amp;f=false|title=Journal of Chinese Martial Studies 01.2009|publisher=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wushu Sanshou is a martial art which was originally developed by the [[Chinese military]] based upon the study and practices of traditional [[Kung fu]] and modern combat fighting techniques; it combines full-contact [[kickboxing]], which includes close range and rapid successive [[punch (strike)|punches]] and [[kicks]], with [[wrestling]], [[Takedown (grappling)|takedown]]s, [[throw (grappling)|throws]], [[sweep (martial arts)|sweeps]], kick catches, and in some competitions, even [[elbow (strike)|elbow]] and [[knee strikes]].

Wushu Sanshou is not seen as a [[Styles of Chinese martial arts|style]] itself, but rather is considered as just one of the two components of [[Chinese martial arts]] training and is often taught alongside ''Wushu Taolu'' (forms) training.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} However, as part of the development of [[sport wushu]] by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]], a standard curriculum for sanshou was developed. It is to this standard curriculum that the term ''Wushu Sanshou'' is usually applied.
This curriculum was developed with reference to traditional Chinese martial arts. This general Wushu Sanshou curriculum varies in its different forms, as the Chinese government developed a version for civilians for self-defense and as a sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G9kDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=sanshou&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FAqyVLqyNYvsUv6SgrAK&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=sanshou&amp;f=false|title=Black Belt|publisher=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most famous fighters in Sanshou are [[Fang Bian]] (Sanda), [[Cung Le]] (MMA), [[Liu Hailong]] (Sanda), [[Muslim Salikhov]] (Sanda), [[Zabit Magomedsharipov]] (Sanda), [[Zhang Tiequan]] (MMA), [[Hossein Ojaghi]] (sanda) and Zhenwei Wang (sanda).

==Curriculum==
The generalized modern curriculum practiced in modern wushu schools is composed of different traditional martial arts fighting styles from China, but mainly based on scientific efficiency. Wushu Sanshou is composed of Chinese martial arts applications including most aspects of combat including striking and grappling, however when Wushu Sanshou was developed as a sport, restrictions were made for safety reasons as well as to promote it as a non-violent sport. Examples of such restrictions included no blows delivered to the back of the head, throat, spine or groin and the discontinuation of the combat when any of the fighters fall to the ground. However many schools, whether traditional or modern, practice it as an all-round martial arts system with no restrictions, only adapting their training in relation to competition rules prior to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Sanda:China's most popular combat sport|work= [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/sanda-chinas-most-popular-combat-sport|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanshou tournaments are one of the two disciplines recognized by the [[International Wushu Federation]].

Wushu Sanshou's competitive history involved barehanded or [[lei tai]] fights in which no rules existed. However, even sanshou as a competitive event developed in the military as these bouts were commonly held between the soldiers to test and practice barehanded martial skills, ability and techniques. Rules were developed and the use of protective gloves etc. was adopted. It was originally used by the [[Kuomintang]] at the first modern military academy in Whampoa in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Full-Contact Kung Fu
|work= Kung Fu Magazine|date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=272|accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was also adopted as a method by the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China.

One can see Wushu Sanshou as a synthesis of traditional Chinese fighting techniques into a more amorphous system and is commonly taught alongside traditional Chinese styles, from which Wushu Sanshou techniques, theory and training methods are derived. The emphasis of Sanshou is on a more amorphous fighting ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Know your major: sanda |work= Global Times |date=  |url= http://life.globaltimes.cn/life/2009-12/495190.html |accessdate= 2010-06-22 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005070046/http://life.globaltimes.cn/life/2009-12/495190.html |archivedate= 2010-10-05 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport Variation==
'''Yùndòng Sǎndǎ (Pinyin, Sport Free Fighting), or Jingzheng Sǎndǎ (Mandarin Chinese, Pinyin Free Fighting)''': A modern fighting method, sport, and applicable component of Wushu / Kung Fu influenced by traditional Chinese Boxing, of which takedowns &amp; throws are legal in competition, as well as all other sorts of striking (use of arms &amp; legs). 
Chinese wrestling methods called [[Shuai Jiao]] and other Chinese grappling techniques such as [[Chin Na]]. It has all the combat aspects of wushu.

Sanda appears much like Kickboxing but includes many more grappling techniques. Sanda fighting competitions are often held alongside taolu or form competitions. Sanda represents the modern development of Lei Tai contests, but with rules in place to reduce the chance of serious injury. 
Many Chinese martial art schools teach or work within the rule sets of Sanda, working to incorporate the movements, characteristics, and theory of their style.

Chinese martial artists also compete in non-Chinese or mixed combat sports, including boxing, kickboxing and [[mixed martial arts]]. Sanda is practiced in tournaments and is normally held alongside taolu events in wushu competition. For safety reasons, some techniques from the self-defense form such as elbow strikes, chokes, and joint locks, are not allowed during tournaments. Competitors can win by knockout or points which are earned by landing strikes to the body or head, throwing an opponent, or when competition is held on a raised lei tai platform, pushing them off the platform. Fighters are only allowed to clinch for a few seconds. If the clinch is not broken by the fighters, and if neither succeeds in throwing his opponent within the time limit, the referee will break the clinch. In the U.S., competitions are held either in boxing rings or on the raised lei tai platform. Amateur fighters wear protective gear.

'''"Amateur Sanda"''' allows kicks, punches, knees (not to the head), and throws. A competition held in China, called the "King of Sanda", is held in a ring similar to a boxing ring in design but larger in dimension. As professionals, they wear no protective gear except for gloves, cup, and mouthpiece, and 
'''"Professional Sanda"''' allows knee strikes (including to the head) as well as kicking, punching and throwing.

Some Sanda fighters have participated in fighting tournaments such as [[K-1]] and [[Shoot Boxing]]. They have had some degree of success, especially in Shoot boxing competitions, which is more similar to Sanda. Due to the rules of Kickboxing competition, Sanda fighters are subjected to more limitations than usual. Also notable competitors in China's mainstream Mixed Martial Arts competitions, Art of War Fighting Championship and [[Ranik Ultimate Fighting Federation]] are dominantly of wushu background. 
Sanda has been featured in many style-versus-style competitions. Muay Thai is frequently pitted against Sanda as is Karate, Kickboxing, &amp; Tae Kwon Do. Although it is less common, some Sanda practitioners have also fought in American Mixed Martial Arts competitions.

===Notable competitors===
Some well-known Chinese Wushu Sanshou fighters include [[Hossein Ojaghi]], Bao Li Gao, and [[Liu Hailong]]. Some Wushu Sanshou fighters well known in the [[United States]] include the [[International Kickboxing Federation|IKF]] and former [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]] middleweight champion, [[Cung Le]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Sanshou's Golden boy

==Military Variation==
'''Jūnshì Sǎndǎ''' (Pinyin, Military Free Fighting): A system of unarmed combat that was designed by Chinese Elite Forces based upon their intense study of traditional martial arts such as traditional Kung Fu, Shuai Jiao, Chin Na and modern hand-to-hand fighting and combat philosophy to develop a realistic system of unarmed fighting for the Chinese military. Jùnshì Sǎndǎ employs all parts of the body as anatomical weapons to attack and counter with, by using what the Chinese consider to be the four basic martial arts techniques:
* Da &amp;ndash; Upper-Body Striking &amp;ndash; using fists, open hands, fingers, elbows, shoulders, forearms and the head
* Ti &amp;ndash; Lower-Body Striking &amp;ndash; including kicks, knees and stomping
* Shuai &amp;ndash; Throws &amp;ndash; using [[Shuai Jiao|Wrestling]] and [[Judo]]-like takedowns and sweeps, and
* Chin-Na &amp;ndash; Seizing &amp;ndash; which includes jointlocks, strangulation and other submissions

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3166">The '''Sports titles system of Albania''' was based on a government decree of 1967, which replaced prior legislation on sports titles as recognized by the [[Albania|Albanian Government]]. It was based on government decree Nr.4259, as of 11 April 1967 (On the creation of titles ''Merited Master of Sports'', ''Master of Sports, ''Champion of the People's Republic of Albania'', and ''Distinguished Sports Executive'').

==Athletes==

The classification was established in Nr.4259, on 11 April 1967, and replaced the law number 3957 dated 18 January 1965 that gave the ''Distinguished athlete'' title, and instituted the four following titles:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qbz.gov.al/doc.jsp?doc=docs/Dekret%20Nr%204259%20Dat%C3%AB%2011-04-1967.htm DEKRET Nr.4259, datë 11.4.1967 MBI KRIJIMIN E TITUJVE “MJESHTËR I MERITUAR I SPORTIT”, “MJESHTËR SPORTI”, “KAMPJON I REPUBLIKËS POPULLORE TË SHQIPËRISË” DHE “KUADËRI DALLUAR NË SPORT”]&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Merited Master of Sports'' ({{lang-al|Mjeshtër i merituar i sportit}}), equates to masters that have made valuable contributions to the sport and influenced other athletes
*''Master of Sport'' ({{lang-al|Mjeshtër i sportit}}), equates to athletes that have distinguished themselves in high results.
*''National Champion'' ({{lang-al|Kampion i Republikës Popullore të Shqipërisë}}), given to all teams and athletes with best results in a sports season.
*''Distinguished Sports Executive'' ({{lang-al|Kuadër i dalluar në sport}}), equates to professional executives with high merits in the sports education for a long period.

This system was popular in Albania and was copied from the Soviet system of the [[Unified Sports Classification System of the USSR and Russia]], as well as from Soviet satellite states and was used in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland, and Romania until the breakup of the USSR in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Спортсмены стран социализма на международной арене|trans-title=Socialist Athletes in International Competition|author=V.L. Shteinbakh |year=1974|publisher=[[Fizkultura i sport]]|location=Moscow|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia continued the system, and former [[Soviet republics]] [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Uzbekistan]] also maintain a similar or identical ranking system.

'''Sprint Center''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] in downtown [[Kansas City, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps?address=E+14th+St+%26+Grand+Blvd&amp;city=Kansas+City&amp;state=MO&amp;zipcode=64106 | title=E 14th St &amp; Grand Blvd Kansas City, MO 64106-2919 | publisher=[[MapQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the intersection of 14th Street and Grand Boulevard on the east side of the [[Power &amp; Light District]]. The arena's naming rights partner is the [[telecommunications]] company [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], which is headquartered in nearby [[Overland Park, Kansas]].

Sprint Center opened on October 10, 2007, and a concert by [[Elton John]] held three days later was the arena's first event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/115/story/316889.html Elton John made Saturday night alright for a concert] ''Kansas City Star'', 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/news/breaking_news/story/206573.html Elton John to open Sprint Center] ''Kansas City Star'', 26 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The arena seats over 19,000 people and has 72 suites. Sprint Center has effectively replaced [[Kemper Arena]], which was built in 1974 just a few miles away in the southern portion of the [[West Bottoms]] neighborhood. Additionally, the [[College Basketball Experience]], which includes the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, is connected to and directly north of Sprint Center.

Sprint Center hosted the [[Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament]] in 2008 and has done so every year since 2010. It also hosted the first and second rounds of the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]] and [[2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2013 NCAA Men's Tournament]]s, as well as the regional rounds of the [[2017 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2017 NCAA Men's Tournament]] and the [[2010 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010 NCAA Women's Tournament]]; it is also scheduled to host a 2019 NCAA Men's Division I regional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/article/2017-04-18/2019-2022-future-di-ncaa-championship-sites|title=2019 - 2022 Future DI NCAA Championship Sites|author=|date=18 April 2017|website=ncaa.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena also was the home of the former [[Kansas City Command]] of the [[Arena Football League (2010)|Arena Football League]] (AFL).

The city of Kansas City has entered into discussions with the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) about possible [[Expansion team|expansion]] or [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation]] of a professional [[ice hockey|hockey]] and/or [[basketball]] franchise for the arena; however, neither the NHL nor the NBA have yet to approve a team to play in the Sprint Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keeler|first=Sean|title=With the NBA and KC, never say never -- though we're getting close|url=http://www.foxsports.com/kansas-city/story/with-the-nba-and-kc-never-say-never-though-we-re-getting-close-101614|publisher=Fox Sports Kansas City|date=October 16, 2014|accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KC again left in the cold as NHL commissioner says 'no' to expansion|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/nhl/article2566841.html|publisher=''Kansas City Star''|date=October 7, 2014|accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
[[File:Sprint Center entrance Kansas City Missouri.jpg|220px|left|thumb|Sprint Center entrance from Grand Boulevard in 2008.]]
[[Groundbreaking|Ground was broken]] for the arena on June 24, 2005, and construction completed on October 11, 2007. The final design, by the Downtown Arena Design Team (a collaboration of the architectural firms Populous, [[360 Architecture]], Rafael Architects, and [[Ellerbe Becket]]), was selected in August 2005. The construction manager responsible for the entire project was [[M.A. Mortenson Company]], based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The complete exterior glass facade system, all metal panels for the adjacent buildings and all accessory metal cladding was custom designed, detailed and supplied by Overgaard Ltd. Hong Kong to Architectural Wall Systems, the Des Moines, Iowa based [[glazing (window)|glazing]] contractor who installed the building envelope. In total there are approximately 13,000 m² (139,932 square feet) of double insulated glass and 5,000 m² (53,820 square feet) painted aluminum curtain wall panels. In addition there are roughly 200 tons of system profiles and accessories. All of the 2,404 individual glass units on the main building were produced sequentially and completely assembled prior to shipping. The 5,000,000&amp;nbsp;lbs of rebar used in construction was detailed, fabricated and supplied by The Carter-Waters Corporation of Kansas City. The arena also features a work of [[public art]], The Moons, by artist [[Chris Doyle (artist)|Chris Doyle]], commissioned by the Kansas City Municipal Arts Commission (KCMAC).

The [[Big 12 Conference]] [[Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament|Men's Basketball Tournament]] was held at Sprint Center in 2008, marking the tournament's return to Kansas City after three years in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].  After returning to Oklahoma City in 2009, the Sprint Center again hosted the tournament in 2010 and 2011.  It is scheduled to be the tournament host site through 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprintcenter.com/events/detail/2017-big-12-mens-baskeball-championship|title=2017 Big 12 Men's Basketball Championship - Sprint Center|first=Sprint|last=Center|date=|website=www.sprintcenter.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Kansas City's proximity to the [[University of Kansas]] in neighboring Lawrence, Jayhawk fans who fill the arena for Big 12 Tournament games refer to the arena as "Allen Fieldhouse East" in reference to Kansas' home arena in Lawrence, [[Allen Fieldhouse]]. However, due to Iowa State's recent Big 12 Tournament success - winning three tournament championships in a four-year span - and their fanbase's huge migration to the annual event, the Sprint Center is referred to by Iowa State fans as "Hilton South", after Iowa State's home venue, Hilton Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/college/iowa-state/cyclone-insider/2017/03/11/iowa-state-cyclones-west-virginia-mountaineers-big-12-conference-basketball-noise-complaint-tweet/99074026/|title=Iowa State Police has perfect tweet about noise complaint at Hilton South|author=|date=|website=desmoinesregister.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena also houses the College Basketball Experience and the [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]], which is at 1301 Grand Boulevard and connected to Sprint Center.

The arena's exterior is made of glass, and the interior has a 360-degree [[LED]] video screen. This facility allows Kansas City to draw most concerts touring the United States.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Sprint Center opened on time and on budget{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} on October 10, 2007 at 10:10 am.  A tour lasted from 10:10 am – 10:10 pm for those who wanted to see it to grab a ticket at the box office. The tour consisted of the [[College Basketball Experience]], two open concession stands: "Taco Taco" and "Oak Street Pizza"; a free drink from [[UMB Financial Corporation|UMB Bank]] and other free items: a UMB Bank cup, a UMB Bank frisbee, and a UMB Bank ice scraper. [[UMB Bank]] is the only [[automated teller machine|ATM]] in the new arena because it is a Sprint Center Founding Partner along with [[Farmland Industries|Farmland]], The [[University of Kansas]] Hospital, [[QuikTrip]], and [[Syntax-Brillian Corporation|Olevia]]. There are other Sprint Center Founding Partners: [[H&amp;R Block]], [[Toyota]], [[American Century Investments]], [[YRC Worldwide]], and [[Time Warner Cable]] of Kansas City.

===Possible major-league sports===
The Kansas City Brigade played at the Sprint Center for one season before the original AFL folded after the 2008 postseason. However, the revamped AFL brought arena football back to the Sprint Center in 2011, with the team playing as the [[Kansas City Command]].

William "Boots" Del Biaggio, III, made an offer to purchase the [[Nashville Predators]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] with the intention of bringing the team to the Sprint Center.&lt;ref&gt;Duhatschek, Eric. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070613.wsptduha13/BNStory/Sports/columnists Balsillie shouldn't overplay his hand] ''Globe and Mail'', 13 June&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Del Biaggio has since joined a group of Nashville investors in an effort to keep the Predators in Nashville.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN.com news services. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=3026992 Bettman says board could vote on Predators bid by November] ''ESPN.com'', 20 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Kansas City's hopes to land the Predators took another blow as Del Biaggio ran into legal trouble over a multitude of unpaid loans, culminating in him filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, effectively ending any chance of Del Biaggio moving the Predators to Missouri.  On January 10, 2007, it was reported the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] have taken an interest in moving to the arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thekansascitychannel.com/sports/10717941/detail.html Other Teams Express Interest in Sprint Center] [[KMBC-TV|KMBC]] Channel 9 Kansas City, 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[New York Islanders]] owner [[Charles Wang]] announced the Islanders will play a preseason game September 22, 2009 at the Sprint Center against the [[Los Angeles Kings]].  Local media reported anonymous team sources stated the game was a test of the Kansas City market.&lt;ref&gt;Shoalts, David. [http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090120.wsptislanders20/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/home?cid=al_gam_mostview Islanders' arena plans caught in red tape] ''Globe and Mail'', 20 January&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, Kansas City and the Sprint Center also attempted to attract relocation of the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], but the Penguins reached a deal with the City of Pittsburgh to build a new arena, the CONSOL Energy Center (now [[PPG Paints Arena]]), and stay in Western Pennsylvania. The Sprint Center had also been looked at as a possible relocation spot for the [[NBA]]'s [[New Orleans Hornets]] and the [[Sacramento Kings]] (the latter of which had played in Kansas City) before both teams settled their local issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22748484/26301103 Report: League Looking into Kansas City for Hornets] [[CBS]] CBSSportsline, 07 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=mc-johnsonkings111010|title=NBA Basketball News, Scores, Standings, Rumors, Fantasy Games|author=|date=|website=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As recently as 2015, Kansas City was considered as a potential site for [[potential National Hockey League expansion]], but the consensus among those who had the resources to buy an expansion franchise for the arena was that the NHL's asking price was too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanaimodailynews.com/sports/nhl-expansion-comes-at-the-wrong-time-for-hockey-fans-in-kansas-city-1.1990326|title=NHL expansion comes at the wrong time for hockey fans in Kansas City|publisher=Nanaimo Daily News|date=July 6, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708193931/http://www.nanaimodailynews.com/sports/nhl-expansion-comes-at-the-wrong-time-for-hockey-fans-in-kansas-city-1.1990326|archivedate=July 8, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tamme Stadium''' ({{lang-et|Tamme staadion}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]], located in the district of [[Tammelinn]]. It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and hosts the matches of [[Tammeka Tartu]]. The stadium holds 1,638 people.&lt;ref name="trt" /&gt;

==History==
The original sports park was designed in 1928 by the architect [[Arnold Matteus]]. The work was completed in 1932 and in 1936, a grandstand was added. Since then the stadium has been used for games in the [[Meistriliiga|Estonian Football League]]. There have been numerous international athletic competitions held in the stadium, and also Estonian Song Festivals.

In the 1960s the stadium was extensively renovated and reopened in 1973. However, a major fire destroyed much of the stadium complex in 1997, which led to a new building by the architects [[Andres Siim]] and [[Kristel Ausing]].

Extensive renovation took place in 2007/2008 costing about 14 million Kroons (900,000 euros).

2010–2011 renovation cost about 4 million euros. The new stadium can hold any international athletics or football competition.&lt;ref name="ERR" /&gt;

It was the home ground for [[Tartu SK 10]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2957">'''Toe wrestling''' is a sport involving two opponents who lock feet and attempt to pin each other's foot down with no time limit similar to arm wrestling.

== History ==
{{unreferenced|date=March 2018|section}}
The game was invented by four drinkers in Ye Olde Royal Oak Inn in [[Wetton, Staffordshire|Wetton]], Staffordshire in 1974, who were bemoaning the fact that the [[United Kingdom]] struggled to produce any world champions. Logically, if a new sport was invented that no one else knew about, the country could boast a champion at last. Having tried "ear wrestling" and "push of war" (with a scaffolding pole), Pete Cheetham, Eddie Stansfield, Pete Dean and Mick Dawson created toe wrestling. A rule board was produced by the sign writers at the [[Yorkshire Evening Post]]. (Mick's girlfriend, Angie Edward, had a father who was the editor.) A small trophy was made and engraved. 

Mick became the first world champion, retaining the title the next year in 1975; however, in 1976, a Canadian visitor competed and won. The point of the sport being gone, the event was discontinued for a long period. Now the sport is gaining popularity, and although the Olympic committee refused to acknowledge it, the World Toe Wrestling Championship is held annually at the Bentley Brook Inn in [[Fenny Bentley]] near [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire]], England. Top players include Tom "100m" Martin, Paul "Toeminator" Beech and Alan "Nasty" Nash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bentleybrookinn.co.uk/page14.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614031713/http://www.bentleybrookinn.co.uk/page14.html |archivedate=2009-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the current world champion.

== Rules ==

Toe wrestling is similar to [[arm wrestling]]. To play, players must take off their shoes and socks as the game is played with bare feet. It is common courtesy for each player to remove the other player's shoes and socks. Players must link toes and each player's foot must touch flat on the other person's foot. The opponents proceed to attempt to ''pin'' (capture or trap) the other's foot for three seconds while avoiding the same. There are 3 rounds played on a best 2 out of 3 basis. Rounds are played first with the right foot, then left, and right again if necessary.

== Prominent competitors ==
Alan 'Nasty' Nash appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jay Leno]] following his win in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metro.co.uk/lifestyle/article.html?Best_foot_forward_with_toe_wrestling&amp;in_article_id=667203&amp;in_page_id=194&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sport features on the front cover of ''[[Eccentric Britain]]'' (2nd Edition) by Benedict le Vay.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/1841621226/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link&lt;/ref&gt;
