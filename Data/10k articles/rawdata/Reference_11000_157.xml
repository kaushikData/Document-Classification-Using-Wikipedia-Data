The '''Armed Forces Recipe Service''' is a compendium of high-volume [[foodservice]] recipes written and updated regularly by the [[United States Department of Defense]] [[Natick Laboratories]], and used by military cooks and by institutional and [[catering]] operations. It originated in 1969 as a consolidation of the cooking manuals of the four main services, and is based on previous military publications dating back to the first standardization efforts in the US Army in 1896. Recipes are based primarily on [[Cuisine of the United States|American cookery]], with the addition of specialized items such as [[vegetarian]], [[kosher]] and [[halal]] recipes to meet more specialized needs of those being served. The Service database is now distributed by the Joint Culinary Center of Excellence, a division of the US Army Quartermaster School based in [[Fort Lee, Virginia]].

Each recipe card has a standardized format; each recipe is calibrated to feed 100 people, with a basic nutritional analysis across the top of the card. Traditionally available primarily in print format, the AFRS database is also available electronically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1219">The '''Book of Cuanu''' is a lost [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Annal]], which referred to events from the fifth to seventh centuries. It is referred to on over a dozen occasions in the [[Annals of Ulster]], its entries been terse accounts of battles or notable deaths. 

In a short study concerning it, Eoghan O Mordha states that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... by making use of the specific placename evidence in the entries attributed to the Book of Cuanu, it can be argued that, because the Cuanu entries display a bias towards recording events which took place for the most part in [[Leinster|Lagin]] or the midlands, the entries can be regarded as been written somewhere in this general area."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The identity of Cuanu is uncertain.

The '''Communist International''' ('''Comintern'''), known also as the '''Third International''' (1919–1943), was an [[international organization]] that advocated [[world communism]]. The Comintern resolved at its Second Congress to "struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold Henry Fisher|title=The Communist Revolution: An Outline of Strategy and Tactics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b2umAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA13|year=1955|publisher=Stanford UP|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Comintern had been preceded by the 1916 dissolution of the [[Second International]].

The Comintern held seven World Congresses in Moscow between 1919 and 1935. During that period, it also conducted thirteen Enlarged Plenums of its governing [[Executive Committee of the Communist International|Executive Committee]], which had much the same function as the somewhat larger and more grandiose Congresses. The Comintern was officially dissolved by [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1943 to avoid antagonizing its allies the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

== Organizational history ==
=== Failure of the Second International ===
[[File:Communist-International-1920.jpg|thumb|220px|The Communist International published a [[Communist International (magazine)|namesake theoretical magazine]] in a variety of European languages from 1919 to 1943]]
While the differences had been evident for decades, [[World War I]] proved the issue that finally divided the [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] and [[reformism|reformist]] wings of the [[workers' movement]]. The [[History of socialism|socialist movement]] had been historically [[Antimilitarism|antimilitarist]] and [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] and therefore opposed workers serving as cannon fodder for the [[bourgeois]] governments at war, this was especially true since the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] comprised two empires while the [[Triple Entente]] gathered France and Britain into an alliance with Russia. [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'' had stated that "the working class has no [[patriotism|country]]" and exclaimed "[[Workers of the world, unite!|Proletarians of all countries, unite!]]". Massive majorities voted in favor of resolutions for the Second International to call upon the international working class to resist war if it were declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David North and Joe Kishore|title=The Historical &amp; International Foundations of the Socialist Equality Party|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTB5zSyBnDkC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2008|publisher=Mehring Books|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, within hours of the declarations of war almost all the socialist parties of the combatant states announced their support for the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C. Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of World War I: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&amp;pg=PA884|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=883–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions were the socialist parties of the [[Balkans]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]]. To [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s surprise, even the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] voted in favor of war credits. The assassination of [[French Section of the Workers' International|French Socialist]] [[Jean Jaurès]] on 31 July 1914 killed the last hope of peace by removing one of the few leaders who possessed enough influence on the international socialist movement to prevent it from segmenting itself along national lines and supporting [[government of national unity|governments of national unity]].

Socialist parties in neutral countries mostly supported neutrality rather than total opposition to the war. On the other hand, during the 1915 [[Zimmerwald Conference]] Lenin organized opposition to the [[Imperialism|imperialist]] war into a movement that became known as the [[Zimmerwald Left]] and published the pamphlet ''Socialism and War'' in which he called all socialists who collaborated with their national governments [[Social chauvinism|social chauvinists]], i.e. socialists in word, but chauvinists in deed.&lt;ref&gt;R. Craig Nation (1989). ''War on War: Lenin, the Zimmerwald Left, and the Origins of Communist Internationalism''. Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zimmerwald Left produced no practical advice for how to initiate socialist revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dttCVcOvmdcC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=comintern.+zimmerwald&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYo_2kjePdAhUEk1kKHXVKCNgQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=No%20practical%20advice,%20zimmerwald&amp;f=false|title=International Communism and the Communist International, 1919-43|last=Rees|first=Tim|last2=Thorpe|first2=Andrew|date=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719055461|pages=15-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International divided into a revolutionary left and a reformist right, with a [[Centrist Marxism|center group wavering between those poles]]. Lenin condemned much of the center as social pacifists for several reasons, including their voting for war credits despite opposing the war. Lenin's term social pacifist aimed in particular at [[Ramsay MacDonald]], leader of the [[Independent Labour Party]] in Britain, who opposed the war on grounds of [[pacifism]], but did not actively resist it.

Discredited by its passivity towards world events, the [[Second International]] dissolved in the middle of the war in 1916. In 1917, Lenin published the ''[[April Theses]]'' which openly supported a [[revolutionary defeatism]], i.e. the [[Bolsheviks]] pronounced themselves in favor of the defeat of Russia which would permit them to move directly to the stage of a revolutionary insurrection.&lt;ref&gt;Service. ''Lenin: A Biography''. p 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact of the Russian Revolution ===
The victory of the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)|Russian Communist Party]] in the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of November 1917 was felt throughout the world and an alternative path to power to parliamentary politics was demonstrated. With much of Europe on the verge of economic and political collapse in the aftermath of the carnage of World War I, revolutionary sentiments were widespread. The Russian Bolsheviks headed by Lenin believed that unless socialist revolution swept Europe, they would be crushed by the military might of world capitalism just as the [[Paris Commune]] had been crushed by force of arms in 1871. The Bolsheviks believed that this required a new international to foment revolution in Europe and around the world.

=== Founding Congress ===
{{main|1st Congress of the Comintern}}
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar |History}}
The Comintern was founded at a Congress held in Moscow on 2–6 March 1919&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Nils J. (1982). ''I kamp för Socialismen - Kortfattad framställning av det svenska kommunistiska partiets historia 1917-1981''. It opened with a tribute to [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], recently murdered by the [[Freikorps]] during the [[Spartakus Uprising]]. [[Stockholm]]: Arbetarkultur. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; against the backdrop of the [[Russian Civil War]]. There were 52 delegates present from 34 parties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/events/c/comintern.htm#first-congress|title=Glossary of Events: Congresses of the Communist International|website=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to form an Executive Committee with representatives of the most important sections and that other parties joining the International would have their own representatives. The Congress decided that the Executive Committee would elect a five-member bureau to run the daily affairs of the International. However, such a bureau was not formed and Lenin, [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Christian Rakovsky]] later delegated the task of managing the International to [[Grigory Zinoviev]] as the Chairman of the Executive. Zinoviev was assisted by [[Angelica Balabanoff]], acting as the secretary of the International, [[Victor Serge|Victor L. Kibaltchitch]]&lt;ref&gt;Kibaltchitch would later take the name Victor Serge. A former anarchist, he was not even a member of the RCP(b) at the time. He believed he was included because of his knowledge of European languages. See Serge, Victor. ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/serge/1945/memoirs/ch03a.htm Memoirs of a Revolutionary]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladmir Ossipovich Mazin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/1st-congress/organisation.htm|title=First Congress of the Communist International|first=Lenin, Trotsky, Bukharin,|last=Kollontai|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin, Trotsky and [[Alexandra Kollontai]] presented material. The main topic of discussion was the difference between [[bourgeois democracy]] and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/1st-congress/index.htm|title=History of the Communist International|first=Andy|last=Blunden|website=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinoviev served as the first Chairman of the Comintern's Executive Committee from 1919 to 1926, but its dominant figure until his death in January 1924 was Lenin, whose strategy for revolution had been laid out in ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' (1902). The central policy of the Comintern under Lenin's leadership was that communist parties should be established across the world to aid the international [[world revolution|proletarian revolution]]. The parties also shared his principle of [[democratic centralism]] (freedom of discussion, unity of action), namely that parties would make decisions democratically, but uphold in a disciplined fashion whatever decision was made.&lt;ref name=freedomunity&gt;Lenin, V. (1906). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/rucong/viii.htm ''Report on the Unity Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.'']&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, the Comintern was promoted as the [[Staff (military)|general staff]] of the [[world revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/chamberlin-william/1929/soviet-russia/ch11.htm William Henry Chamberlin ''Soviet Russia: A Living Record and a History'' 1929, chapter 11]; [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol01/no01/editors1.htm Max Shachtman "For the Fourth International!"

=== Second World Congress ===

Ahead of the Second Congress of the Communist International, held in July through August 1920, Lenin sent out a number of documents, including his [[Twenty-one Conditions]] to all socialist parties. The Congress adopted the 21 conditions as prerequisites for any group wanting to become affiliated to the International. The 21 Conditions called for the demarcation between communist parties and other socialist groups&lt;ref&gt;For example, the thirteenth condition stated: "The communist parties of those countries in which the communists can carry out their work legally must from time to time undertake purges (re-registration) of the membership of their party organisations in order to cleanse the party systematically of the petty-bourgeois elements within it". The term purge has taken on very negative connotations because of the [[Great Purge]] of the 1930s, but in the early 1920s the term was more ambiguous. See J. Arch Getty's ''Origins of the Great Purges: The Soviet Communist Party Reconsidered, 1933-1938'' at p. 41 for discussion of the ambiguities in the term, including its use in the 1920 Comintern resolution.&lt;/ref&gt; and instructed the Comintern sections not to trust the legality of the bourgeois states. They also called for the build-up of party organisations along democratic centralist lines in which the party press and parliamentary factions would be under the direct control of the party leadership.

Regarding the political situation in the colonized world, the Second Congress of the Communist International stipulated that a united front should be formed between the proletariat, peasantry and national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. Amongst the twenty-one conditions drafted by Lenin ahead of the congress was the 11th thesis which stipulated that all communist parties must support the bourgeois-democratic liberation movements in the colonies. Notably, some of the delegates opposed the idea of alliance with the bourgeoisie and preferred giving support to communist movements in these countries instead. Their criticism was shared by the Indian revolutionary [[M. N. Roy]], who attended as a delegate of the [[Mexican Communist Party|Mexican Communist Party]]. The Congress removed the term bourgeois-democratic in what became the 8th condition.&lt;ref&gt;M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. ''Communist Parties and United Front - Experience in Kerala and West Bengal''. [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 48, 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many European socialist parties divided because of the adhesion issue. The [[French Section of the Workers International]] (SFIO) thus broke away with the 1920 [[Tours Congress]], leading to the creation of the new [[French Communist Party]] (initially called French Section of the Communist International – SFIC). The [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] was created in 1920, the [[Communist Party of Italy]] was created in 1921, the [[Belgian Communist Party]] in September 1921 and so on.

=== Third World Congress ===
Writings from the Third Congress, held in June–July 1921, talked about how the struggle could be transformed into civil war when the circumstances were favorable and openly revolutionary uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Black Book of Communism]] pp. 275–276; [http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/2nd-congress/ch07.htm Minutes of the Seventh Session].&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourth Congress, held in November 1922, at which Trotsky played a prominent role, continued in this vein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/4th-congress/index.htm|title=History of the Communist International|first=Andy|last=Blunden|website=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dungan people|Dungan]] commander of the Dungan Cavalry Regiment [[Magaza Masanchi]] attended the Third Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LtoAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=In+1921+he+attended+the+Third+Congress+of+the+Comintern,+then+fought+against+the+Basmachi.+When+the+Civil+War+ended,+Masanchin+supposedly+held+highly+responsible+positions+for+the+Soviet+secret+police&amp;dq=In+1921+he+attended+the+Third+Congress+of+the+Comintern,+then+fought+against+the+Basmachi.+When+the+Civil+War+ended,+Masanchin+supposedly+held+highly+responsible+positions+for+the+Soviet+secret+police&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=51AiTdGpAcWblgfYwrnjCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA|title=The Modern encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet history, Volume 21|author=Joseph L. Wieczynski|year=1994|publisher=Academic International Press|isbn=0-87569-064-5|page=125|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this early period, known as the First Period in Comintern history, with the Bolshevik Revolution under attack in the [[Russian Civil War]] and a [[Revolutions of 1917–23|wave of revolutions across Europe]], the Comintern's priority was exporting the October Revolution. Some communist parties had secret military wings. One example is the [[M-Apparat]] of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. Its purpose was to prepare for the civil war the Communists believed was impending in Germany and to liquidate opponents and informers who might have infiltrated the party. There was also a paramilitary organization called the [[Rotfrontkämpferbund]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Black Book of Communism]]''. pp. 282. [http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/4th-congress/index.htm Marxist Internet Archive].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comintern was involved in the revolutions across Europe in this period, starting with the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] in 1919. Several hundred agitators and financial aid were sent from the Soviet Union and Lenin was in regular contact with its leader [[Béla Kun]]. Soon, an official Terror Group of the Revolutionary Council of the Government was formed, unofficially known as [[Lenin Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Black Book of Communism]] pp. 272–275&lt;/ref&gt; The next attempt was the [[Béla Kun#The "March Action" in Germany|March Action]] in Germany in 1921, including an attempt to dynamite the express train from Halle to Leipzig. After this failed, the Communist Party of Germany expelled its former chairman [[Paul Levi]] from the party for publicly criticising the March Action in a pamphlet,&lt;ref&gt;Broue, P. (2006) ''The German Revolution: 1917-1923'', Chicago: Haymarket Books, p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; which was ratified by the [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] prior to the Third Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Broue, P. (2006) ''The German Revolution: 1917-1923'', Chicago: Haymarket Books, p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; A new attempt was made at the time of the [[Occupation of the Ruhr|Ruhr crisis]] in spring and then again in selected parts of Germany in the autumn of 1923. The [[Red Army]] was mobilized, ready to come to the aid of the planned insurrection. Resolute action by the German government cancelled the plans, except due to miscommunication in Hamburg, where 200–300 Communists attacked police stations, but were quickly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Black Book of Communism]]''. pp. 277–278.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, there was [[1924 Estonian coup d'état attempt|a failed coup in Estonia]] by the [[Estonian Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Black Book of Communism]]''. pp. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] joined Comintern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~ceus/u469week7a.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913130539/http://www.indiana.edu/~ceus/u469week7a.htm|date=September 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, in China both the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Kuomintang]] were supported. After the definite break with [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in 1927, [[Joseph Stalin]] sent personal emissaries to help organize revolts which at this time failed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Black Book of Communism]]''. pp. 280–282.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fifth to Seventh World Congresses: 1925–1935 ===
==== Second Period ====
[[File:KilbomKominternKard.jpg|thumb|260px|The Comintern membership card of [[Karl Kilbom]]]]
Lenin died in 1924 and the next year saw a shift in the organization's focus from the immediate activity of world revolution towards a defence of the Soviet state. In that year, Stalin took power in Moscow and upheld the thesis of [[socialism in one country]], detailed by [[Nikolai Bukharin]] in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'' (April 1925). The position was finalized as the state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism''. Stalin made the party line clear: "An internationalist is one who is ready to defend the USSR without reservation, without wavering, unconditionally; for the USSR it is the base of the world revolutionary movement, and this revolutionary movement cannot be defended and promoted without defending the USSR".&lt;ref&gt;David Priestland, ''Of the Read Flag: A History of Communism'' (2009) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dream of a [[world revolution]] was abandoned after the failures of the [[Spartacist uprising]] in Germany and of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and the failure of all revolutionary movements in Europe such as in Italy, where the [[Italian fascism|fascist]] ''[[squadristi]]'' broke the strikes and quickly assumed power following the 1922 [[March on Rome]]. This period up to 1928 was known as the Second Period, mirroring the shift in the [[Soviet Union]] from [[war communism]] to the [[New Economic Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1985/comintern/ch5.htm Duncan Hallas ''The Comintern'', chapter 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Fifth World Congress of the Comintern in July 1924, Zinoviev condemned Marxist philosopher [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''History and Class Consciousness'', published in 1923 after his involvement in [[Béla Kun]]'s [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and [[Karl Korsch]]'s ''[http://libcom.org/library/marxism-philosophy-korsch Marxism and Philosophy]''. Zinoviev himself was dismissed in 1926 after falling out of favor with Stalin. Bukharin then led the Comintern for two years until 1928, when he too fell out with Stalin. Bulgarian Communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]] headed the Comintern in 1934 and presided until its dissolution.

Geoff Eley summed up the change in attitude at this time as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;By the Fifth Comintern Congress in July 1924 [...] the collapse of Communist support in Europe tightened the pressure for conformity. A new policy of "Bolshevization" was adopted, which dragooned the CPs toward stricter bureaucratic centralism. This flattened out the earlier diversity of radicalisms, welding them into a single approved model of Communist organization. Only then did the new parties retreat from broader Left arenas into their own belligerent world, even if many local cultures of broader cooperation persisted. Respect for Bolshevik achievements and defense of the Russian Revolution now transmuted into dependency on Moscow and belief in Soviet infallibility. Depressing cycles of "internal rectification" began, disgracing and expelling successive leaderships, so that by the later 1920s many founding Communists had gone. This process of coordination, in a hard-faced drive for uniformity, was finalized at the next Congress of the Third International in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Eley, ''Forging Democracy: The History of the Left in Europe, 1850–2000'' (Oxford University Press  2002) p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Comintern was a relatively small organization, but it devised novel ways of controlling communist parties around the world. In many places, there was a communist subculture, founded upon indigenous left-wing traditions which had never been controlled by Moscow. The Comintern attempted to establish control over party leaderships by sending agents who bolstered certain factions, by judicious use of secret funding, by expelling independent-minded activists and even by closing down entire national parties (such as the [[Communist Party of Poland]] in 1938). Above all, the Comintern exploited Soviet prestige in sharp contrast to the weaknesses of local parties that rarely had political power.&lt;ref name="David Priestland 2009 p 124-25"&gt;David Priestland, ''The Read Flag: A History of Communism'' (2009) p. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: a history of world communism'' (2007) pp. 164–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Communist front organizations ====
{{main|Communist front}}
[[Communist front]] organizations were set up to attract non-members who agreed with the party on certain specific points. [[Opposition to fascism]] was a common theme in the [[popular front]] era of the mid 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Archie Brown, ''The Rise and Fall of Communism'' (2011) pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; The well-known names and prestige of artists, intellectuals and other fellow travelers were used to advance party positions. They often came to the Soviet Union for propaganda tours praising the future.&lt;ref&gt;Michael David‐Fox, "The Fellow Travelers Revisited: The 'Cultured West' through Soviet Eyes," ''Journal of Modern History'' (2003) 75#2 pp. 300–335 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/380140 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of Zinoviev, the Comintern established fronts in many countries in the 1920s and after.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: a history of world communism'' (2007) pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; To coordinate their activities, the Comintern set up international umbrella organizations linking groups across national borders, such as the [[Young Communist International]] (youth), [[Profintern]] (trade unions),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Birchall, "Profintern: Die Rote Gewerkschaftsinternationale 1920–1937," ''Historical Materialism'', 2009, Vol. 17, Issue 4, pp 164–176, review (in English) of a German language study by Reiner Tosstorff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krestintern]] (peasants), [[International Red Aid]] (humanitarian aid), [[Sportintern]] (organized sports) and more. Front organizations were especially influential in France, which in 1933 became the base for communist front organizer [[Willi Münzenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jackson, ''The Popular Front in France'' (1990) p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations were dissolved in the late 1930s or early 1940s.

==== The Third Period ====
In 1928, the Ninth Plenum of the Executive Committee began the so-called [[Third Period]], which was to last until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1985/comintern/ch6.htm Duncan Hallas ''The Comintern'', chapter 6]; Nicholas N. Kozlov, Eric D. Weitz "Reflections on the Origins of the 'Third Period': Bukharin, the Comintern, and the Political Economy of Weimar Germany" ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 24, No. 3 (Jul., 1989), pp. 387–410 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/260667 JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; The Comintern proclaimed that the capitalist system was entering the period of final collapse and therefore all communist parties were to adopt an aggressive and militant [[ultra-left]] line. In particular, the Comintern labelled all moderate left-wing parties [[social fascists]] and urged the communists to destroy the moderate left. With the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement in Germany after 1930, this stance became controversial.

The Sixth World Congress also revised the policy of united front in the colonial world. In 1927, the Kuomintang had turned on the Chinese Communists, which led to a review of the policy on forming alliances with the national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. The Congress did make a differentiation between the character of the Chinese Kuomintang on one hand and the Indian Swarajist Party and the Egyptian [[Wafd Party]] on the other, considering the latter as an unreliable ally yet not a direct enemy. The Congress called on the [[Communist Party of India|Indian Communists]] to utilize the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the British imperialists.&lt;ref&gt;M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. ''Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal''. [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seventh World Congress and the Popular Front ===
{{main article|Seventh World Congress of the Comintern}}
[[File:Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai's Delegate's Card at Comintern's 1935 VII Congress, Moscow.jpg|thumb|[[Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai]]'s Delegates' Card at the 1935 Comintern's 7th Congress as she was a delegate representing the [[Indochinese Communist Party]]]]
The Seventh and last Congress of the Comintern was held between 25 July 25 and 20 August 1935. It was attended by representatives of 65 communist parties. The main report was delivered by Dimitrov, other reports were delivered by [[Palmiro Togliatti]], [[Wilhelm Pieck]] and [[Dmitry Manuilsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CPCz CC, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CPS CC. ''An Outline of the History of the CPCz''. [[Prague]]: Orbis Press Agency, 1980. p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress officially endorsed the popular front against [[fascism]]. This policy argued that communist parties should seek to form a popular front with all parties that opposed fascism and not limit themselves to forming a [[United Front|united front]] with those parties based in the working class. There was no significant opposition to this policy within any of the national sections of the Comintern. In France and Spain, it would have momentous consequences with [[Léon Blum]]'s 1936 election which led to the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front government]].

Stalin's purges of the 1930s affected Comintern activists living in both the Soviet Union and overseas. At Stalin's direction, the Comintern was thoroughly infused with Soviet secret police and foreign intelligence operatives and informers working under Comintern guise. One of its leaders, [[Mikhail Trilisser]], using the pseudonym Mikhail Aleksandrovich Moskvin, was in fact chief of the foreign department of the Soviet [[OGPU]] (later the [[NKVD]]). At Stalin's orders, 133 out of 492 Comintern staff members became victims of the [[Great Purge]]. Several hundred German communists and antifascists who had either fled from [[Nazi Germany]] or were convinced to relocate in the Soviet Union were liquidated and more than a thousand were handed over to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Black Book of Communism]]''. p. 298–301.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fritz Platten]] died in a labor camp and the leaders of the Indian ([[Virendranath Chattopadhyaya]] or Chatto), Korean, Mexican, Iranian and Turkish communist parties were executed. Out of 11 Mongolian Communist Party leaders, only [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]] survived. [[Leopold Trepper]] recalled these days: "In house, where the party activists of all the countries were living, no-one slept until 3 o'clock in the morning. [...] Exactly 3 o'clock the car lights began to be seen [...] we stayed near the window and waited [to find out], where the car stopped".&lt;ref&gt;Radzinski, ''Stalin'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dissolution ===
At the start of [[World War II]], the Comintern supported a policy of [[non-intervention]], arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes, much like [[World War I]] had been, but when the Soviet Union itself [[Operation Barbarossa|was invaded on 22 June 1941]] the Comintern changed its position to one of active support for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. On 15 May 1943, a declaration of the Executive Committee was sent out to all sections of the International, calling for the dissolution of Comintern. The declaration read: &lt;blockquote&gt;The historical role of the Communist International, organized in 1919 as a result of the political collapse of the overwhelming majority of the old pre-war workers' parties, consisted in that it preserved the teachings of Marxism from vulgarisation and distortion by opportunist elements of the labor movement.

But long before the war it became increasingly clear that, to the extent that the internal as well as the international situation of individual countries became more complicated, the solution of the problems of the labor movement of each individual country through the medium of some international centre would meet with insuperable obstacles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concretely, the declaration asked the member sections to approve: &lt;blockquote&gt;To dissolve the Communist International as a guiding centre of the international labor movement, releasing sections of the Communist International from the obligations ensuing from the constitution and decisions of the Congresses of the Communist International.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After endorsements of the declaration were received from the member sections, the International was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/dissolution.htm|title=Dissolution of the Communist International|website=marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, it is asserted that the dissolution came about as Stalin wished to calm his World War II allies (particularly [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]]) and keep them from suspecting the Soviet Union of pursuing a policy of trying to foment revolution in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Stalin. A biography''. (Macmillan - London, 2004), pp. 444–445.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Successor organizations ===
The Research Institutes 100 and 205 worked for the International and later were moved to the [[International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], founded at roughly the same time that the Comintern was abolished in 1943, although its specific duties during the first several years of its existence are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kramer, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/152044 The Role of the CPSU International Department in Soviet Foreign Relations and National Security Policy], ''[[Soviet Studies]]'', Vol. 42, No. 3 (Jul., 1990), pp. 429–446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-hoac&amp;month=0507&amp;week=b&amp;msg=4EspdL4D5k+JL1n+GlDXJA&amp;user=&amp;pw=|title=H-Net Discussion Networks|website=h-net.msu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stalin and the Cold War in Europe: The Emergence and Development of East-West Conflict, 1939-1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the June 1947 Paris Conference on [[Marshall Aid]], Stalin gathered a grouping of key European communist parties in September and set up the [[Cominform]], or Communist Information Bureau, often seen as a substitute to the Comintern. It was a network made up of the communist parties of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia (led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], it was expelled in June 1948). The Cominform was dissolved in 1956 following Stalin's 1953 death and the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

While the communist parties of the world no longer had a formal international organization, they continued to maintain close relations with each other through a series of international forums. In the period directly after the Comintern's dissolution, periodical meetings of communist parties were held in Moscow. Moreover, ''[[World Marxist Review]]'', a joint periodical of the communist parties, played an important role in coordinating the communist movement up to the break-up of the [[Socialist Bloc]] in 1989–1991.

== Comintern-sponsored international organizations ==
Several international organizations were sponsored by the Comintern in this period:
* [[Communist Youth International]] (1919–1943)
* [[Red International of Labour Unions]] (Profintern, formed in 1920)
* [[Communist Women's International]] (formed in 1920)
* [[International Red Aid]] (MOPR, formed in 1922)
* [[Red Peasant International]] (Krestintern, formed in 1923)
* [[Red Sports International]] (Sportintern)
* International of the Proletarian Freethinkers (1925–1933)
* [[League against Imperialism]] (formed in 1927)
* [[Workers International Relief]]

== International Liaison Department ==

One historian has described: &lt;blockquote&gt;The OMS was the Comintern's department for the coordination of subversive and conspiratorial activities. Some of its functions overlapped with those of the main Soviet intelligence agencies, the OGPU and the GRU, whose agents sometimes were assigned to the Comintern. But the OMS maintained its own set of operations and had its own representative on the central committees of each Communist party abroad.&lt;ref name=Sakmyster/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 2012, historian David McKnight stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;The most intense practical application of the conspiratorial work of the Comintern was carried out by its international liaison service, the OMS. This body undertook clandenstine courier activities and work which supported underground political activities. These included the transport of money and letters, the manufacture of passports and other false documents and technical support to underground parties, such as managing "safe houses" and establishing businesses overseas as cover activities.&lt;ref name=McKnight/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;'''Notes'''
:{{note|USB-roles|USB roles}}: The [[USB]] standard defines 'host' and 'device' roles. A USB bus may only have one host and up to 127 devices. In this table the USB '''2.0''' and '''3.0''' columns document the number of host ports available on the single-board computer (SBC) that can be used to connect USB devices such as [[USB flash drive|flash drives]] or [[USB camera|cameras]] to the SBC. The USB '''Device''' column documents if the SBC has at least one 'device' role USB port so that the SBC can be connected to a computer. If the SBC uses [[USB On-The-Go]] (OTG) ports then that is noted in this column as OTG ports can operate in both host and device roles.
:{{note|utilite-msata|Utilite mSATA}}: the mSATA slot in Utilite is considered non-user-serviceable and the procedure to access it causes the warranty to be void.&lt;ref name="utilite-ssd-mod"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utilite-computer.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=72&amp;t=1431&amp;p=5910&amp;hilit=msata&amp;sid=f335415ff7e050d89496b29e80fd98dc#p5910 |title=Utilite &amp; Trim-Slice Users Forum - View Topic - Pictures of Utilite Pro |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="utilite-ssd-mod-warranty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utilite-computer.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4614#p4614 |title=Utilite &amp; Trim-Slice Users Forum - View Topic - mSATA/RAM Upgradable? |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3029">DYP, (also known as ‘Digital Yearbook Page’), is an [[IOS]] social discovery app that facilitates interaction between mutually interested classmates. {{sfn|New spin on the old-school yearbook|}} It differs from other social networks and anonymous sharing apps in that it is primarily for reconnecting with former classmates using their [[yearbook]] photos.{{sfn|Try DYP, an App that Wants to Reinvigorate the Old-School Yearbook|}}Classmates are kept exclusive to each other, with limited access to other school years.

==History==

Currently incorporated in Delaware, DYP was founded in Los Angeles, California by Robert Nunn, a former real estate broker and Samuel Zaribian, a former marketing consultant.{{sfn|DYP, an Innovative App that Scans a Yearbook Photo and Connects it to a Digital Page|}} Robert Nunn has said “the idea came to me when I was cleaning my closet and stumbled across my old high school yearbook. Browsing through it I wondered what happened to some of my classmates but I didn’t want to search classmates one by one on social networks for the answer”. The company raised $125k in [[Seed funding|seed]] funding in 2013. The app was released in the Apple Store on April 28, 2014, with plans of an Android version release in the works. {{sfn|New iPhone App Helps People Find Long-Lost Classmates Using Old Yearbook Photos|}}

==Reception==

Technology commentators likened DYP to a High School version of [[Tinder (application software)|Tinder]] and [[Facebook]] at its early stage.{{sfn|DYP Demo| Watch The Video|}} Notably, Yahoo News called DYP ‘A Facebook for Yearbooks’. Samuel Zaribian has emphasized in interviews that DYP is not trying to replace any social network or the printed yearbook and should be used as a tool for schools and publishers to sell more printed yearbooks in the digital era. DYP was featured on the homepage of [[Yahoo]] on May 2, and 3rd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">The '''European Atlas of the Seas''' is an easy to use and interactive web-based atlas on the coasts and seas within and around [[Europe]]. A new version of the Atlas has been released on the 11 June 2018, offering new features and more content. It is freely accessible on the internet. Next to the English version, it will be consultable in all languages of the European Union, thanks to automatic e-Translation.

The Atlas is provided by the [[European Commission]], Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, in the context of the implementation of the integrated maritime policy &lt;ref name="IMP"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/ Integrated Maritime Policy], European Union&lt;/ref&gt; (Communication 'An Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union', COM(2007) 575 final, 10/10/2007).

Other names: European atlas of the oceans, European coastal atlas, European maritime atlas, European marine atlas

== Purpose ==
The European Atlas of the Seas brings statistical data in a comprehensive way to professionals, students and anyone interested in learning more about Europe's seas and coasts, their environment, related human activities and European policies.

== Content ==
In the context of the EU's maritime policy, the European Atlas of the Seas offers a diverse range of information on topics such as:
* Coastal regions geography and statistics
* Renewable energy and maritime resources
* Sea depth, tidal amplitude and coastal erosion
* Fishing stocks, quotas and catches
* European fishing fleet
* Aquaculture
* Ports, maritime transport and traffic
* Marine protected areas
* Coastal tourism
* Maritime policies and initiatives…

Most of the data displayed in the atlas has been collected from European Commission departments and European agencies, especially DG MARE, [[Eurostat]], [[Joint Research Centre|JRC]] and the [[European Environment Agency|EEA]]. The information source and date appears in each map's description.

== Geographical coverage ==
The European Atlas of the Seas covers the seas and oceans within and around Europe: 
* [[Arctic Ocean]]
* [[Atlantic Ocean]], including the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[Bay of Biscay]], and the [[North Sea]]

[[File:Rocket warfare.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mysorean rockets]] being used by Indian forces against British troops during the [[Second Anglo–Mysore War]] (1780–1784).]]
'''''Fathul Mujahidin''''' is a military manual that was written by [[Zainul Abedin Shustari]] at the instruction of [[Tipu Sultan]], a defacto ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], considered a pioneer in the use of [[rocket artillery]]. Mysore started to equip their army with rockets in the 1750s and during the [[Second Anglo–Mysore War]] (1780–1784) Tipu and his father [[Hyder Ali|Haider Ali]] used this technology against British troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8CxJeFzCdQC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=haider+ali+rockets&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI5LfrlfCVxgIVw1yICh0FzQhk#v=onepage&amp;q=haider%20ali%20rockets&amp;f=false|title=Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology|date=October 2007|last=Van Riper|first=A.

Tipu distributed copies of his military manual to all of his officers.&lt;ref name="Husine,1986"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the manual he defined 200 men to handle rockets within each of the [[Mysore]] [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cushoon cushoons], with 16 to 24 cushoons of [[infantry]]. The personnel handling the rockets were trained to define the launch angle to properly affect the curve at which the rocket would land. Tipu also defined in the manual a multiple rocket launcher (much like a musical organ) that would launch up to 10 rockets. Some of the rockets had blades in the front of the bamboo guiding rods, while others were designed as incendiary rockets.

Although not the first use of rockets by Mysore, the 1792 [[Siege of Seringapatam (1792)|Siege of Srirangapatna]] reportedly began with showers of as many as 2,000 rockets fired simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Beatson,1800" &gt;{{cite book

According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. Guilmartin, Jr. in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (2008):

{{quote|[[Hyder Ali]], prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the [[combustion]] powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Hyder Ali's son, [[Tippu Sultan]], continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at [[Seringapatam]] in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.&lt;ref name=r&amp;ms&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (2008), "rocket and missile"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A product of [[The Enlightenment|The Age of Enlightenment]], '''''Flora Danica''''' is a comprehensive atlas of [[botany]], containing folio-sized pictures of all the wild plants native to [[Denmark]], in the period from 1761-1883.

It was proposed by [[Georg Christian Oeder|G. C. Oeder]], then professor of botany at the [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden|Botanic Garden in Copenhagen]], in 1753 and was completed 123 years later, in 1883. The complete work comprises 51 parts and 3 supplements, containing 3,240 copper engraved plates. The original plan was to cover all plants, including [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s and [[fungus|fungi]] native to crown lands of the [[Denmark|Danish]] king, that is [[Denmark]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Oldenburg]]-[[Delmenhorst]] and Norway with its [[North Atlantic]] dependencies [[Iceland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]]. However, changes were made due to territorial cessations during the period of publication. After 1814, when the double monarchy of [[Denmark–Norway]] was abolished, very few Norwegian plants were included, and similar changes were seen after 1864, when the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]] were ceded. However, in the mid-19th-century era of [[Scandinavism]], the ''[[Scandinavian Scientist Conference|Nordiske Naturforskermøde]]'' in [[Copenhagen]] proposed to make Flora Danica a [[Scandinavia]]n work. Thus, three supplementary volumes were issued, containing the remaining Norwegian plants and the more important plants only occurring in [[Sweden]].

==Dinner set==
[[File:København 2013 (34).JPG|thumb|left|Part of the original Flora Danica dinner set on display in the Flora Danica Cabinet at [[Christiansborg Palace]] in [[Copenhagen]].]]In 1790 the Danish [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Crown Prince Frederik]] ordered a dinner set made decorated with exact copies of the plates of ''Flora Danica''. The dinner set was meant as a gift for Russian [[Catherine II of Russia|Empress Catherine II]]. Catherine, however, never received it, as she died in 1796. It is currently on display at [[Christiansborg Palace]], [[Amalienborg Palace]] and [[Rosenborg Castle]].

The dinner set is still in use for state occasions in the [[Christiansborg Palace]] in [[Copenhagen]]. Copies of the set are sold by the [[Royal Copenhagen]] Porcelain Manufactory.

'''''Flora Zambesiaca''''' is an ongoing botanical project aimed at achieving a full account of the flowering plants and ferns of the [[Zambezi River]] basin covering [[Zambia]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]] and the [[Caprivi Strip]], and is published by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]. The work is published in parts or whole volumes as and when the relevant families are completed, and is currently (2012) over the halfway mark. Some 24 500 plant species have been described so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.kew.org/datasources.htm#EFZ |title=electronic Plant Information Centre (ePIC) — ePIC Data Sources |website=Epic.kew.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the line illustration plates in the first volume were by Miss L. M. Ripley and Miss G. W. Dalby.&lt;ref&gt;''Flora Zambesiaca'', vol.1, pt.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Flora Zambesiaca'' project was set in motion in 1950 by [[Arthur Wallis Exell]] when he returned to the [[British Museum]] from his wartime activities with the Government Communications Headquarters at [[Bletchley Park]] - he was co-editor of ''Flora Zambesiaca'' from 1962 onwards. The present survey is under the editorship of Jonathan Timberlake who works in the Herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyika-vwaza-trust.org/Trustees/Jonathan%20Timberlake.html |title=Trustees &amp;#124; Nyika Vwaza Trusts &amp;#124; Nyika National Park &amp;#124; Vwaza Marsh &amp;#124; Conservation &amp;#124; Malawi |website=Nyika-vwaza-trust.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana''''' is a multivolume [[Flora (publication)|flora]] describing the [[vascular plant]]s of the [[Guayana Region]] of [[Venezuela]], encompassing the three [[States of Venezuela|states]] south of the [[Orinoco]]: [[Amazonas, Venezuela|Amazonas]], [[Bolívar, Venezuela|Bolívar]], and [[Delta Amacuro]]. Initiated by [[Julian Alfred Steyermark]] in the early 1980s, it was completed after his death under the guidance of [[Paul E. Berry]], [[Kay Yatskievych]], and [[Bruce K. Holst]]. The nine volumes were published between 1995 and 2005 by [[Timber Press]] and [[Missouri Botanical Garden Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/flora-of-the-venezuelan-guayana/oclc/31938617 Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana]. WorldCat.&lt;/ref&gt; The project brought together more than 200 botanists from around the world and was "the first effort to produce a comprehensive inventory and identification guide for the plants of such an extensive region of northern South America".&lt;ref&gt;Berry, P.E., K. Yatskievych &amp; B.K. Holst (eds.) (2005). ''Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana. Volume 9. Rutaceae-Zygophyllaceae.'' Missouri Botanical Garden Press, St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volumes==
The first volume, written primarily by Italian ecologist [[Otto Huber (ecologist)|Otto Huber]], is an introduction to the geography, ecology, botanical history and conservation of the Venezuelan Guayana, and includes two fold-out maps of the region (one vegetation and one [[topographic map|topographical]], both 1:2,000,000 scale).&lt;ref name=intro&gt;Berry, P.E., B.K. Holst &amp; K. Yatskievych (eds.) (1995). ''Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana. Volume 1. Introduction.'' Missouri Botanical Garden Press, St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent eight volumes cover the known plant families of the area in alphabetical order, each treating around 1000–1300 species. [[Fern]]s and [[fern allies]] are covered in the first part of volume 2, with the remainder of that volume, and the rest of the flora, devoted to [[seed plant]]s (generally following the [[Cronquist system]] for [[flowering plant]]s). Both native and [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] species are included. Around half of all species are illustrated with black-and-white line drawings by Venezuelan artist Bruno Manara. Species accounts include non-exhaustive [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymies]], and [[vernacular name]]s are occasionally given.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/ven-guayana/ Projects: Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana].

==Reviews==
In his ''Guide to Standard Floras of the World'', David G. Frodin cited ''Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana'' as an example of a "[g]ood modern, relatively 'concise' conventional flora".&lt;ref name=Frodin&gt;Frodin, D.G. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=aMjXCF4rmDUC ''Guide to Standard Floras of the World. Second Edition.''] Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9780511541803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introductory volume has been singled out as both a useful addition to the flora and a valuable work in its own right.&lt;ref name=Frodin /&gt; Writing in the ''[[Edinburgh Journal of Botany]]'', S. Bridgewater considered the first volume "an excellent way of starting a Flora" and "a highly desirable book for anyone with a love of botany and South America".&lt;ref name=Bridgewater&gt;Bridgewater, S. (November 1997). Book reviews: Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana. Volume 1. Introduction. ''Edinburgh Journal of Botany'' '''54'''(3): 355–356. {{DOI|10.1017/S0960428600004182}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the prose "is both unpretentious and accessible, whilst being thoroughly researched".&lt;ref name=Bridgewater /&gt; These views were echoed in the ''Handbook of Latin American Studies'', where the volume is described as "authoritative and superbly illustrated" and "[m]uch broader than [its] title suggests".&lt;ref&gt;McCan, K.D. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pzq0FVFRvZIC&amp;pg=PA359 ''Handbook of Latin American Studies: No. 57'']. University of Texas Press, Austin.&lt;/ref&gt;

R. Atkinson, who reviewed volume 2 for the ''Edinburgh Journal of Botany'', considered the book's [[dichotomous key]]s "concise and easy to use" and the illustrations "clear although sometimes rather diagrammatic".&lt;ref name=Atkinson&gt;Atkinson, R. (July 1998). Book reviews: Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana. Volume 2. Pteridophytes, Spermatophytes; Acanthaceae–Araceae. ''Edinburgh Journal of Botany'' '''55'''(2): 317–318. {{DOI|10.1017/S0960428600002213}}&lt;/ref&gt; More serious criticism was levelled at the alphabetical arrangement of families, which Atkinson considered the work's "biggest drawback". He continued: "It would be more valuable if a systematic approach had been taken to avoid the absurdity of closely related families being placed (under an evolutionarily arbitrary, alphabetical system) in different volumes."&lt;ref name=Atkinson /&gt;

Reviewing volume 7 in ''[[Economic Botany]]'', Neil A. Harriman wrote that the entire flora was "lavishly produced, with a great many line drawings to aid in identification".&lt;ref name=Harriman /&gt; He added: "I think it indicates how carefully these volumes are done, that weedy little ''[[Plantago major]]'' gets just as much space, and just as fine an illustration, as any of the rare, exotic, endemic orchid species do." Harriman also noted the comprehensive literature citations, which he found "most helpful". Although rather conservative, Harriman considered the species synonymies adequate.&lt;ref name=Harriman /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1821">'''''Frame, Journal of Literary Studies''''' is a biannual journal run by (former) students of [[literature]] and [[literary theory]] (most from [[Utrecht University]])'''''.''''' Since its establishment in 1984 it has been the only Dutch publication forum that allows for a centered discussion on comparative literary studies. The journal publishes articles by international researchers as well as academic lectures, interviews, and critical reviews.  
Issues of ''Frame'' usually concentrate on a topic that resonates with cutting-edge research, debates, and discussions within the field of contemporary literary studies, and its editors select articles that provide readers with wide-ranging insight into the current topic. In the special "Masterclass" section, ''Frame'' offers Master students of literature the opportunity to acquire much-needed publishing experience. The journal furthermore offers room for conference announcements, symposiums or workshop reports, lectures, and interviews.

In the past, ''Frame'' has had the opportunity to work with well-known researchers such as [[Jonathan Culler]], [[N. Katherine Hayles]], [[J. Hillis Miller]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]]

'''''Inland Empire''''' is a 2006 film written and directed by [[David Lynch]]. The cast includes such [[List of frequent David Lynch collaborators|Lynch regulars]] as [[Laura Dern]], [[Justin Theroux]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and [[Grace Zabriskie]], as well as [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Karolina Gruszka]], [[Peter J. Lucas]], [[Krzysztof Majchrzak]], and [[Julia Ormond]]. There are also brief appearances by a host of additional actors, including [[Nastassja Kinski]], [[Laura Harring]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], and [[William H. Macy]]. The voices of Harring, [[Naomi Watts]], and [[Scott Coffey]] are included in excerpts from Lynch's 2002 ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'' online project.

Released with the [[tagline]] "A Woman in Trouble", the film follows the fragmented and nightmarish events surrounding a [[Hollywood]] actress (Dern) who begins to take on the personality of a character she plays in a film. An international co-production between the United States, France, and Poland, the film was completed over a three-year period and shot primarily in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Poland]]. The process marked several firsts for Lynch: the film was shot without a finished [[screenplay]], instead being largely developed on a scene-by-scene basis; and it was shot entirely in low resolution [[digital video]] by Lynch himself using a handheld [[Sony DCR-VX1000|Sony camcorder]] rather than traditional [[film stock]].&lt;ref name="grf4"/&gt; The film's [[film editing|editing]], score and [[sound design]] were also helmed by Lynch, with pieces by a variety of other musicians also featured. The title borrows its name from a [[Inland Empire|residential area in Southern California]].

''Inland Empire'' premiered in Italy at the [[Venice Film Festival]] on 6 September 2006.&lt;ref name="grf4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5321270.stm |title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Entertainment {{!}} David Lynch given lifetime award |date=6 September 2006 |work=[[BBC Online|bbc.co.uk]] |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received generally positive but polarized reviews from critics, with attention centering on its challenging and [[surrealist]] elements.&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inland_empire |title=Inland Empire |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named the second-best film of 2007 (tied with two others) by ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/cahiers.html#y2007 |title=Cahiers du Cinema: Top Ten Lists 1951–2009 |work=alumnus.caltech.edu |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and listed among ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]''{{'}}s "thirty best films of the 2000s", as well as ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s "10 most underrated movies of the decade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/dec/22/10-most-underrated-movies |title=The view: The 10 most underrated movies of the decade {{!}} Film {{!}} guardian.co.uk |last=Leigh |first=Danny |date=22 December 2009 |work=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]] |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film opens to the sound of a [[Phonograph|gramophone]] playing ''Axxon N.'', "the longest-running radio play in history". Meanwhile, a young prostitute, identified in the credits as the "Lost Girl", cries while watching television in a hotel room, following an unpleasant encounter with her client. The Lost Girl's television displays a family of [[Rabbits (film)|surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits]] who speak in cryptic statements and questions. Occasionally, there are [[laugh track]] responses within these Rabbit scenes. These three elements become recurring motifs throughout ''Inland Empire''.

The main plot follows an actress named Nikki Grace ([[Laura Dern]]), who has applied for a comeback role as a character named Sue in a film entitled ''On High in Blue Tomorrows''. The day before the audition, Nikki is visited by an enigmatic old woman ([[Grace Zabriskie]]) claiming to be her neighbor; she predicts that Nikki will get the role, and recounts two folk tales. One tells of a boy who, sparking a reflection after passing through a doorway, "caused evil to be born". The other tells of a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, "discovers a palace". The old woman presses Nikki for details on her new film, asking whether the story is about marriage and involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbor disagrees. Disregarding Nikki's offended response, the old woman comments on the confusion of time, claiming that were this tomorrow, Nikki would be sitting on a couch adjacent to them. The film then pans to where the neighbor is pointing, and we see Nikki and two girlfriends sitting on the couch. Her butler ([[Ian Abercrombie]]) walks into the living room with a phone call from her agent, announcing that she has won the role. Ecstatic, Nikki and her friends celebrate while her husband Piotrek ([[Peter J. Lucas]]) ominously surveys them from atop a nearby staircase.

Some time later, Nikki and her co-star Devon Berk ([[Justin Theroux]]) receive an interview on a talk show. The host ([[Diane Ladd]]) asks them both whether they are having an affair, to which each of them responds negatively. Devon is warned by his entourage that Nikki is out of bounds, due to her husband's power and influence. Later, on the set being built for the film, Nikki and Devon rehearse a scene with the director, Kingsley Stewart ([[Jeremy Irons]]). They are interrupted by a disturbance, but upon investigation Devon finds nothing. Shaken by the event, Kingsley confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled ''47''. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.

Immersed in her character, while the film is being shot, "Sue" / Nikki appears to begin an affair with Devon / "Billy". A strange scene follows based on what the old woman had described: Nikki appears in a mysterious alley walking to her car, carrying a bag of groceries, but then she notices a door in the alley marked ''Axxon N.'', and enters. It leads her back to the soundstage where the earlier rehearsal took place. She witnesses that rehearsal from across the room—she herself was what had interrupted it earlier. This time, when Devon seeks to discover who's observing them, she disappears from the rehearsal scene, and flees among the half-built backgrounds and into the house of a character named Smithy. Despite the set being merely a wooden facade, Nikki enters to find an illuminated suburban house inside. Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness, not hearing her frantic cries of his character's name, "Billy".

At this point, the film takes a drastic stylistic turn. Various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other. The chronological order is often confused or nonexistent. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband (whether it's "Smithy" or Piotrek is unclear) in bed. Hiding from him, she enters a different room and encounters a troupe of prostitutes. One of the women advises her to burn a hole through silk with a cigarette and look through the hole. Nikki complies and witnesses several strange happenings, many of which seem to revolve around her, or alternate versions of herself.

Prior to these scenes, the woman who plays Billy's wife Doris ([[Julia Ormond]]) tells a policeman that she had been hypnotized to murder someone with a screwdriver, but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from [[Inland Empire]]. A parallel plotline involves Polish circus artists in the present day, as well as Polish prostitutes in [[Łódź]] during the 1930s, who are confronted by strange pimps while murder permeates their city. Nikki, having become one of the group of present-day prostitutes, wanders the streets while her companions ask, "Who is she?" Both Nikki and her prostitutes frequently ask people to look at them and "say whether you've known me before". In a parallel plotline, Sue climbs the dark staircase behind a nightclub to deliver long monologues to an unidentified man touching upon her [[Child sexual abuse|childhood sexual abuse]], disastrous relationships, and retaliations. Her husband Smithy seems to be connected with both the pimps and the organization, and then is hired by a circus from Poland because he is said to be "good with animals". There is much talk of the Phantom, an elusive hypnotist. Convinced she's being stalked by a red-lipped man, Sue arms herself with a screwdriver.

Finally, Sue walks down [[Hollywood Boulevard]], and is startled to see her doppelgänger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and attempts to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger down the street and eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of [[Hollywood and Vine]]. One woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to [[Pomona, California|Pomona]]. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko, a prostitute whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The older woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter in front of her face until she finally dies, promising her "no more blue tomorrows". Off-camera, Kingsley yells "Cut!" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.

As the actors and film crew wrap for the next scene, Sue slowly arises, Nikki once more. Kingsley announces that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only ''On High in Blue Tomorrows''—encompassing some of the subplots of the film—but events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked "Axxon N.". Eventually, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man from earlier, now known to be the Phantom. She shoots him, which causes his face to morph first into a distorted copy of Nikki's own face, and then an even more distorted face bleeding from its mouth.

Nikki flees into a nearby room—Room 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. Elsewhere in the building, Nikki finds the Lost Girl, who has been watching and crying all along. The two women kiss, before Nikki fades away into the light along with the rabbits. The Lost Girl runs out of the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces a man and child.

Nikki is then seen back home, smiling at the old woman from the beginning of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them [[Laura Harring]], [[Nastassja Kinski]], and [[Ben Harper]]. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue's monologue looks around and says, "Sweet!" Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to [[Nina Simone]]'s "[[Sinner Man]]" while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat.&lt;!-- Please don't add your interpretation of what you think the ending means --&gt;

===Production===
''Inland Empire'' is the first Lynch feature to be completely shot in [[digital video]]; it was shot with a hand-held [[Sony DSR-PD150]] by Lynch himself. Lynch has stated that he will no longer use film to make motion pictures.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news |work=Variety.com |first=Adam |last=Dawtrey |date=11 May 2005 |url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/lynch-invades-an-empire-1117922566/ |title=Lynch invades an 'Empire'; Digital pic details a mystery |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110015512/http://variety.com/2005/film/news/lynch-invades-an-empire-1117922566/ |archivedate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his preference, stating that the medium gives one "more room to dream", and more options in post-production.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; Much of the project was shot in [[Łódź]], Poland, with local actors, such as [[Karolina Gruszka]], [[Krzysztof Majchrzak]], [[Leon Niemczyk]], Piotr Andrzejewski and artists of the local circus Cyrk Zalewski. Some videography was also done in [[Los Angeles]], and in 2006 Lynch returned from Poland to complete filming. Lynch then edited the final results in [[Final Cut Pro]] in his home office over six months.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite web|title=Director's Chair: David Lynch –  'Inland Empire'|url=http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2007/February-1-2007/DIRECTORS-CHAIR-DAVID-LYNCH-INLAND-EMPIRE.aspx|website=Post Magazine|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not work with frequent collaborator and editor [[Mary Sweeney]] because "there wasn't a real organized script to go by and no one knew what was going on except" him.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt;

Lynch shot the film without a complete screenplay. Instead, he handed each actor several pages of freshly written dialogue each day.&lt;ref name="grf4"/&gt; In a 2005 interview, he described his feelings about the shooting process:
"I've never worked on a project in this way before. I don't know exactly how this thing will finally unfold&amp;nbsp;... This film is very different because I don't have a script. I write the thing scene by scene and much of it is shot and I don't have much of a clue where it will end. It's a risk, but I have this feeling that because all things are unified, this idea over here in that room will somehow relate to that idea over there in the pink room."&lt;ref name=hwise&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Attwood |author2=Robert Roth |url=http://www.healthywealthynwise.com/article.asp?Article=3062 |title=A Dog's Trip to the Chocolate Shop – David Lynch |work=Healthy Wealthy N' Wise |date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed at the [[Venice Film Festival]], Laura Dern admitted that she did not know what ''Inland Empire'' was about or the role she was playing, but hoped that seeing the film's premiere at the festival would help her "learn more".&lt;ref name="grf4"/&gt; Justin Theroux has also stated that he "couldn't possibly tell you what the film's about, and at this point I don't know that [[David Lynch]] could. It's become sort of a pastime—Laura [Dern] and I sit around on set trying to figure out what's going on."&lt;ref name="wfaa"/&gt; In an [[NPR]] interview, Dern recounted a conversation she had with one of the movie's new producers, Jeremy Alter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=NPR Weekend Edition Sunday |first=Andrea |last=Shea |date=17 December 2006 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6637676 |title=David Lynch's Latest Endeavor Breaks New Ground}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked if Lynch was joking when he requested a one-legged woman, a monkey and a lumberjack by 3:15. "Yeah, you're on a David Lynch movie, dude," Dern replied. "Sit back and enjoy the ride." Dern reported that by 4 p.m. they were shooting with the requested individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6637676 |title=NPR Weekend Edition Sunday article December 17 2006; audio remarks by Laura Dern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing and distribution===
Lynch financed much of the production from his own resources, with longtime artistic collaborator and ex-wife [[Mary Sweeney]] producing. The film was also partially financed by the French production company [[StudioCanal]], which had provided funding for three previous Lynch films. StudioCanal wanted to enter the film in the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Cannes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chokingonpopcorn.com/popcorn/2006/03/david-lynch-walk-with-me/ |title=David Lynch.. Walk With Me ...|accessdate=28 July 2015 |work=Choking on Popcorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it premiered at Italy's [[Venice Film Festival]] on 6 September 2006, where David Lynch also received the [[Golden Lion]] lifetime achievement award for his "contributions to the art of cinema". The film premiered in the United States on 8 October 2006 at the [[New York Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="NYFF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/david-lynch-announces-distribution-partnerships-and-theatrical-release-dates-for-inland-empire-56396397.html |title=David Lynch Announces Distribution Partnerships and Theatrical Release Dates for Inland Empire |accessdate=28 July 2015 |work=PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received a limited release in the US beginning on 15 December 2006; distribution was handled by the specialist company [[518 Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=17007 |work=ComingSoon.net Film Database |title=Inland Empire release details}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch hoped to distribute the film independently, saying that with the entire industry changing, he thought he would attempt a new form of distribution as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=ComingSoon.net |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/indietopnews.php?id=16889 |date=9 October 2006 |title=Lynch to Distribute ''Inland Empire'' Himself}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acquired the rights to the DVD and worked out a deal with StudioCanal in an arrangement that allowed him to distribute the film himself, through both digital and traditional means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=11 October 2006 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003223922 |title=Filmmaker Lynch to self-distribute 'Inland Empire' |first=Gregg |last=Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; A North American DVD release occurred on 14 August 2007. Among other special features, the DVD included a 75-minute featurette, "More Things That Happened", which compiled footage elaborating on Sue's marriage to Smithy, her unpleasant life story, the Phantom's influence on women, and the lives of the prostitutes on Hollywood Boulevard.

==Themes and analysis==
{{quote box|width=40%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=[T]he structure of Inland Empire differs from prior Lynch films, ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' or ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''. It is neither a [[Möbius strip]] that endlessly circles around itself, nor is it divisible into sections of fantasy and reality. Its structure is more akin to a web where individual moments hyperlink to each other and other Lynch films—hence the musical number that closes the film which contains obvious allusions to everything from ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' to ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.|source=Zoran Samardžija, 2010&lt;ref&gt;Samardžija, Zoran (February, 2010). [http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=16&amp;id=1171 "DavidLynch.com: Auteurship in the Age of the Internet and Digital Cinema"]. ''Scope: An Online Journal of Film and Television Studies'', '''16'''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When asked about ''Inland Empire'', Lynch refrained from explaining the film, responding that it is "about a woman in trouble, and it's a mystery, and that's all I want to say about it."&lt;ref name="wfaa"&gt;{{cite news |work=Riverside Press-Enterprise |title=David Lynch turns his eye to 'Inland Empire' |first=Helene |last=Blatter |url=http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/090406dnGLempire.64579170.html |date=3 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928045413/http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/090406dnGLempire.64579170.html |archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When presenting screenings of the digital work, Lynch sometimes offers a clue in the form of a quotation from the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are like the spider. We weave our life and then move along in it. We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives in the dream. This is true for the entire universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Twitch |title=Inland Empire—The San Rafael Film Center Q&amp;A With David Lynch |date=24 January 2007 |first=Michael |last=Guillen |url=http://twitchfilm.net/archives/008819.html |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Egenes and Kumuda Reddy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BcDlPTSbEoEC&amp;pg=PA71 ''Eternal Stories from the Upanishads''] (New Delhi: Smrti Books, 2002), p.71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[New York Film Festival]] official Richard Peña summarized the film as "a plotless collection of snippets that explore themes Lynch has been working on for years", including "a [[Hollywood]] story about a young actress who gets a part in a film that might be cursed; a story about the smuggling of women from [[Eastern Europe]]; and an abstract story about a family of people with rabbit heads sitting around in a [[living room]]."&lt;ref name="wfaa"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' critic [[Peter Bradshaw]] called the film "a meditation on the unacknowledged and unnoticed strangeness of Hollywood and [[movie making|movie-making]] in general", adding that Lynch "establishes a bizarre series of worm-holes between the worlds of myth, movies and reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|title=Inland Empire – Film Review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/09/thriller|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]] wrote that the film "often seems like a series of [[dream sequence]]s floating free of any grounding reality, a dream without a dreamer [in which] no frame is secure, all attempts at embedding fail", but argued that "it is the ''film'' that is mad, not the characters in it&amp;nbsp;... it is Hollywood itself that is dreaming".&lt;ref name="fisher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Mark|title=The Weird and the Eerie|date=2017|publisher=Repeater Books|url=http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/009285.html|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also commented that "to see Lynch's worlds captured on digital video makes for a bizarre short-circuiting: as if we are witnessing a direct feed from the unconscious".&lt;ref name="fisher"/&gt;

Dennis Lim of ''[[Slate Magazine|Slate]]'' described the film as "a three-hour waking nightmare that derives both its form and its content from the splintering psyche of a troubled Hollywood actress", and commented on Lynch's use of digital video, describing it as "the medium of [[home movie]]s, [[viral video]], and [[pornography]]—the everyday media detritus we associate more with&amp;nbsp;... intimate or private viewing experiences than communal ones", adding that the film "progresses with the darting, associative logic of [[hyperlink]]s".&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web|last=Lim|first=Dennis|title=David Lynch Goes Digital: Inland Empire on DVD|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2007/08/david_lynch_goes_digital.html|website=[[Slate Magazine]]|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Anne Jerslev has argued that the film "constitutes multiple and fractured modes of perception in a world of digital screens".&lt;ref name=jerslev/&gt; Other critics have argued that the film features "formal similarities with a [[website]]'s hyperlinked layering of screens/windows, constantly disclosing new worlds from new points of view", but according to theorist [[Steven Shaviro]] "it also builds on cinematic codes, even as it [[deconstruction|deconstructs]] them".&lt;ref name=jerslev&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jerslev|first=Anne|title=The post-perspectival: screens and time in David Lynch's Inland Empire|journal=Journal of Aesthetics &amp; Culture|date=21 March 2012|volume=4|issue=1|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jac.v4i0.17298|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Delorme indicated that the film is about [[adultery]], but in a way that Lynch "avoid[s] a chronological unfolding of the scenes and situations provoked by the adultery", but rather "superimpose[s] them instead in as many scenarios developing from the potentials of the adultery", so that "[t]he narrative is constructed on strange characters brought together by a similar terror".&lt;ref&gt;Delorme, Stephane (February 2007).

It later expanded to its widest release of fifteen nationwide theaters, ultimately grossing $861,355 at American box office. In other countries outside the United States, ''Inland Empire'' grossed $3,176,222—bringing the film's worldwide total gross to $4,037,577.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=inlandempire.htm|title=Inland Empire (2006)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 72, based on 24 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/inland-empire|title=Inland Empire – Reviews, Ratings, Credits and More|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and holds a 72% "fresh" rating on [[review aggregator]] web site [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The site's consensus states that the film is "typical David Lynch fare: fans of the director will find ''Inland Empire'' seductive and deep. All others will consider the heady surrealism impenetrable and pointless."&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' classified ''Inland Empire'' as "fitfully brilliant" after the Venice Film Festival screening. [[Peter Travers]], the film critic for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine wrote, "My advice, in the face of such hallucinatory brilliance, is that you hang on."&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inland Empire Review |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/11692273/review/12626084/inland_empire |first=Peter |last=Travers |date=21 November 2006 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Yorker'' was one of the few publications to offer any negative points about the film, calling it a "trenchant, nuanced film" that "quickly devolves into self-parody".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |title=Inland Empire: The Film File |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/inland_empire_lynch |first=Richard |last=Brody |date=11 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]], presenter of the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Film 2007]]'', described it as "a work of genius&amp;nbsp;... I think".&lt;ref name=Film2007&gt;[[Film 2007]], 5 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Damon Wise of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine gave it five stars, calling it "A dazzling and exquisitely original riddle as told by an enigma"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |title=Reviews Central: Inland Empire |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=117669 |first=Damon |last=Wise |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jim Emerson (editor of [[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]]) gave it 4 stars and praised it: "When people say ''Inland Empire'' is Lynch's ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', Lynch's ''[[Persona (film)|Persona]]'' or Lynch's ''[[8½]]'', they're quite right, but it also explicitly invokes connections to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Pierrot le Fou]]'', Buñuel and Dalí's ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'', Maya Deren's LA-experimental ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (a Lynch favorite) and others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=rogerebert.suntimes.com |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070125/REVIEWS/701250301 |first=Jim |last=Emerson |title=Inland Empire |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "the film, which begins promisingly, disappears down so many rabbit holes (one of them involving actual rabbits) that eventually it just disappears for good".&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Carina |last=Chocano |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-inland15dec15,0,3659742.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Inland Empire |date=15 December 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dern received almost universal acclaim for her performance, with many reviews describing it as her finest to date. Lynch attempted to promote Dern's chances of an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] nomination at the [[79th Academy Awards|2007 Academy Awards]] by campaigning with a live cow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2006/scene/awards/lynch-cow-campaign-for-oscar-1117954009/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|variety.com]] |title=Lynch, cow campaign for Oscar; Helmer touts 'Inland Empire' thesp Dern, cheese |first=Alex |last=Romanelli |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was not nominated for the award.

'''Involuntary servitude''' or '''involuntary slavery''' is a [[United States]] [[law|legal]] and [[constitution]]al term for a person laboring against that person's will to benefit another, under some form of [[coercion]] other than the worker's financial needs. While laboring  to benefit another occurs also in the condition of [[slavery]], involuntary servitude does not necessarily connote the complete lack of freedom experienced in [[chattel slavery]]; involuntary servitude may also refer to other forms of [[unfree labor]]. Involuntary servitude is not dependent upon [[Remuneration|compensation]] or its amount.

The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] makes involuntary servitude illegal under any U.S. jurisdiction whether at the hands of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] or in the private sphere, except [[Penal labor in the United States|as punishment for a crime]]:  &lt;blockquote&gt;Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Supreme Court has held, in ''Butler v. Perry'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=240&amp;invol=328 240 U.S. 328] (1916)&lt;/ref&gt; that the Thirteenth Amendment does not prohibit "enforcement of those duties which individuals owe to the state, such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc." Onerous long term alimony and spousal support orders, premised on a proprietary interest retained by former marital partners in one another's persons, have also been allowed in many states, though they may in practice embody features of involuntary servitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Other interpretations of involuntary servitude==

The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party of the United States]] and other [[libertarianism|libertarian]]s consider military conscription to be involuntary servitude in the sense of the Thirteenth Amendment. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] disagreed with that interpretation in ''[[Arver v. United States]],'' relying on text of Article I and the prerequisites of [[sovereignty]].  Some libertarians consider [[compulsory schooling]] involuntary servitude. [[John Taylor Gatto]], a retired schoolteacher and libertarian activist critical of compulsory schooling writes of what he terms "The Cult Of Forced Schooling".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Some have also argued that, should ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113 (1973), be overturned by the United States Supreme Court, a constitutional right to abortion could still be sustained on the basis that denying it would subject women to involuntary servitude contrary to the Thirteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Koppelman, Andrew, "Forced Labor: A Thirteenth Amendment Defense of Abortion", 84 ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 480 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; However, no U.S. court has yet accepted such an argument.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe v. Rampton'', 394 F. Supp. 677 (D Utah 1975) (Ritter C.J. dissenting); ''Jane L. v. Bangerter'', 794 F. Supp. 1537 (D Utah 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Differing views have been expressed as to whether the argument is so unpersuasive as to be "frivolous".&lt;ref&gt;''Jane L. v. Bangerter'', 61 F.3d 1505, 1514–1515 (10th Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; One major difficulty with the argument relates to the claim that pregnancy and child-bearing are within the scope of the term "servitude".&lt;ref&gt;Vieira, Norman, "''Hardwick'' and the Right of Privacy" 55 ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 1181, 1189–1191 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Otto Josten founded the company as a watch-repair business in Owatonna in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Jostens looks into expanding operations in Owatonna| url = http://www.southernminn.com/owatonna_peoples_press/news/article_f7fecb83-2a09-584b-8b56-2529d2bfd81c.html|date = 18 April 2014|accessdate = 18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jostens (then called "Josten's" — the apostrophe was later dropped) began manufacturing emblems and awards for nearby schools and in 1906, the year of incorporation, Josten added class rings to his product line, to be sold to schools throughout the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/jostens-inc-history/|title=History of Jostens, Inc. – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 14, 2015, [[Jarden]] announced that it would acquire Jostens for $1.5 billion, stating that it planned to take advantage of synergies with its other properties (particularly [[Rawlings (company)|Rawlings]] and [[Yankee Candle]]), and "turn it into a true consumer-product business, as opposed to it historically being run like a printing asset".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Picker| first = Leslie| title = Jarden Reaches Deal to Buy Jostens for $1.5 Billion| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2015-10-25| date = 2015-10-14| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/business/dealbook/jarden-reaches-deal-to-buy-jostens-for-1-5-billion.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg-jardenjostens&gt;{{cite news|title=Jarden to Buy Yearbook Maker Jostens for About $1.5 Billion|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-14/jarden-to-acquire-yearbook-maker-jostens-for-about-1-5-billion|accessdate=14 December 2015|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After being acquired by Jarden in 2015, Jarden merged with Newell Rubbermaid in 2016 to form [[Newell Brands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/213690/newell-nwl-closes-jarden-merger-creates-newell-brands|title=Newell (NWL) Closes Jarden Merger, Creates Newell Brands|last=Research|first=Zacks Investment|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Newell Brands sold Jostens to Platinum Equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Newell Brands Announces Agreements to Sell Pure Fishing to Sycamore Partners and Jostens to Platinum Equity| accessdate = 2018-11-25| url = http://ir.newellbrands.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Newell-Brands-Announces-Agreements-to-Sell-Pure-Fishing-to-Sycamore-Partners-and-Jostens-to-Platinum-Equity/default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
In mid 2013, Jostens released the yearbook industry's first iPad app at the [[National Scholastic Press Association]] Spring Convention in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jostens Introduce Educational iPad App | url=http://www.couponcodeslady.com/2013/08/jostens-introduce-educational-ipad-app.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jostens is the primary supplier of [[Super Bowl]] rings, and has made 31 champion rings in the Super Bowl's 50-year history through 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/super-bowl-champion-rings-2017-2/#super-bowl-ii-1968-green-bay-packers-33-oakland-raiders-14-2 |title=Here are the extravagant rings given to Super Bowl champions over the years |publisher=Business Insider |date=Feb 5, 2017 |accessdate=Oct 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kevin O' Dwyer''' is an internationally exhibited artist whose works embrace the fields of [[design]], [[metalworking]] and [[sculpture]]. He creates primarily in [[silver]].

==Career==
He began his training in 1979 with [[jeweller]] Harriet Dreissigger and continued his studies with [[silversmith]]s William Frederick and [[Heikki Seppa]]. He has also occupied roles as artist-in-residence in the U.S state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and lecturer in design methods at the [[National College of Art and Design]], [[Dublin]], where he taught students business and product development skills. He works from his studio in [[Durrow, County Offaly]].

==Works==
O'Dwyer's artwork is influenced by Irish prehistoric art, bronze-age artefacts, early monastic metalwork, and 20th century design and architecture. His childhood was divided between the monastic ruins of Tipperary and the skyscrapers of Manhattan.and this has influenced the way he approached the creation of artefacts or site-specific installations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kevinjodwyer.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
His works have been featured in public collections including the [[High Museum]] (US), [[Racine Art Museum]] (US), The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (UK), [[Ulster Museum]] (Belfast),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nmni.com/collections/art/silver-metalwork-and-jewellery&lt;/ref&gt; Espace Paul Ricard (France), Governor’s Palace (Belgium) and the [[National Museum of Ireland]]. He founded [[Sculpture in the Parklands]], a land-art sculpture park in [[Boora Bog|Lough Boora Parklands]], County Offaly, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.offalyhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/boora_sculpture2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

SIEMERS&lt;/ref&gt;

== Centinel ==
"Centinel" was an alias used to write a series of 18 articles that were printed in the ''[[Philadelphia Independent Gazetteer]]'' and the ''[[Philadelphia Freeman's Journal]]'' between October 5, 1787, and April 9, 1788.

It is generally accepted by historians that the majority of these articles were written by [[Samuel Bryan]]. However, some may have been written by [[Eleazer Oswald]] of the ''Independent Gazetteer''.&lt;ref&gt;Quote - [http://www.infoplease.com/t/hist/antifederalist/centinel.html infoplease.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Louvre Abu Dhabi''' is an [[art museum|art]] and [[civilization]] [[museum]], located in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. The museum was established on 8 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/watch-live-emmanuel-macron-and-uae-leaders-formally-open-louvre-abu-dhabi-1.674159.|title=Emmanuel Macron and UAE leaders formally open Louvre Abu Dhabi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of a thirty-year agreement between the city of Abu Dhabi and the [[Political system of France|French government]]. The museum is located on the [[Saadiyat Island#Saadiyat Cultural District|Saadiyat Island Cultural District]]. It is approximately {{convert|24000|m2|ft2}} in size, with {{convert|8000|m2|ft2}} of galleries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/louvre-abu-dhabi|title=The Louvre Abu Dhabi - Louvre Museum - Paris|date=6 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, making it the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] art museum in the [[Arabian peninsula]]. The final cost of the construction is expected to be about €600 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ad8fcc08-c3a5-11e7-b2bb-322b2cb39656|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, US$525 million was paid by Abu Dhabi to be associated with the [[Louvre]] name, and an additional US$747 million will be paid in exchange for art loans, special exhibitions and management advice.&lt;ref name="The Louvre’s Art: Priceless.

Artworks from around the world are showcased at the museum, with particular focus placed upon bridging the gap between [[Eastern art|Eastern]] and [[Western art]].&lt;ref name="Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol, Claude Monet and Henri Matisse in Louvre Abu Dhabi"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.glammonitor.com/2014/10/21/middle-eastern-art-lovers-rejoice-louvre-finally-coming-abu-dhabi/ | publisher = [[Glammonitor]] | title= Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol, Claude Monet and Henri Matisse in Louvre Abu Dhabi | date = 2014-10-21| accessdate=2014-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The establishment of this museum was approved by the French Parliament on 9 October 2007. The architect for the building is [[Jean Nouvel]] and the engineers are [[BuroHappold Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/20071009.WWW000000436_le_louvre_abu_dhabi_verra_bien_le_jour.html|title=Le "Louvre Abu Dhabi" verra bien le jour|publisher=''[[Le Figaro]]''|language=French|date=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meed.com/uae/news/2008/01/louvre_abu_dhabi_agreement_signed.html|title=Abu Dhabi and Paris sign museam&lt;!--SIC--&gt; deal|last=Robinson|first=Victoria|date=7 January 2008 |publisher=MEED|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Nouvel also designed the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]] in [[Paris]].

The museum is part of a US$27 billion tourist and cultural development for [[Saadiyat Island]], a complex which is planned to include three other museums, including a [[Guggenheim Abu Dhabi|Guggenheim Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i5X29Np917I-YpiaA_XWq8oiGDZg|title=Feu vert du parlement français au futur musée "Louvre Abou Dhabi"|publisher=''[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]''|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609092458/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i5X29Np917I-YpiaA_XWq8oiGDZg|archivedate=9 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Zayed National Museum]]. According to the government-sponsored website UAE Interact: "The French Museums Agency will operate in collaboration with the Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC), which is behind the transformation of Saadiyat Island. It will be chaired by French financier and member of the country's [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], [[Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière]], publisher of the periodical ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]''."&lt;ref name="UAE interacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/French_cultural_agency_to_steer_work_on_Louvre_Abu_Dhabi/26498.htm|title=French cultural agency to steer work on Louvre Abu Dhabi|date=2007-08-13|publisher=UAE Interact|accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Maquart, the former Executive Director of [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], will take the position of Executive Director.&lt;ref name="UAE interacts"/&gt;
{{Quote|By choosing the Louvre, the emirate of Abu Dhabi not only sealed a partnership with the world’s most visited and well-known museum, but selected one which, from its very inception, had a vocation to reach out to the world, to the essence of mankind, through the contemplation of works of art.|[[Jacques Chirac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menareport.com/en/business/210487|title=Louvre Abu Dhabi to be created within the Saadiyat Island Cultural District|date=2008-09-08 |publisher= [[Mena Report]]| accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Architecture ===

The museum is designed as a "seemingly floating dome structure"; its web-patterned dome allowing the sun to filter through. The overall effect is meant to represent "rays of sunlight passing through [[date palm]] fronds in an [[oasis]]."&lt;ref name="Art Gallery and Museum Louvre Abu Dhabi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/louvre-abu-dhabi/ | title =DesignBuild Network | year = 2008 | publisher = designbuild-network.com | accessdate=2008-09-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wallpaper.com/gallery/Best_new_grooming_product/1436 | title = Louvre, Abu Dhabi | date = 2007-05-07 | publisher = Wallpaper | accessdate = 2008-09-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090211203351/http://www.wallpaper.com/gallery/Best_new_grooming_product/1436 | archivedate = 11 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total area of the museum will be approximately {{convert|24000|m2|ft2}}.

=== Engineering ===
BuroHappold Engineering provided multidisciplinary engineering services across the project, including structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, energy and environmental consultancy, water engineering, facade engineering, lighting design, people movement consultancy, security services and inclusive design. Their structural engineers realised the "floating dome" from 7,850 aluminium stars of varying sizes, which tessellate over eight layers to create a perforated roof structure that allows sunlight through to the spaces below. A team of specialist geotechnical and water engineers designed a watertight basement and tidal pools within the galleries to give the illusion of a "museum in the sea" while protecting artwork, artefacts and visitors from the corrosive marine environment.

=== Construction ===
Construction works at Louvre Abu Dhabi officially started on 26 May 2009. [[Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the President of France, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] inaugurated an exhibition titled, ''Talking Art: Louvre Abu Dhabi'' at the ''Gallery One'' of the [[Emirates Palace]] hotel which includes 19 works of art bought over the last 18 months for the Louvre Abu Dhabi, as well as loans from the French national museums to mark the beginning of the construction work.

Piling works in Louvre were to be completed by August 2010, with the piling and enabling works package  awarded to the German specialized company (Bauer International FZE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baueruae.ae/en/index.html|title=Bauer International FZE|website=www.baueruae.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The total of 4536 piles consisted of RC Piles and H-Piles and was completed on 3 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulfnews.com/Nation/Government/10317095.html|title=Construction of historic Louvre Abu Dhabi museum starts|date=26 May 2009|author=Eman Mohammed|publisher=[[Gulf News]]|accessdate=2009-06-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529092236/http://www.gulfnews.com/nation/Government/10317095.html|archivedate=29 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/arts/design/27louv.html|title=Abu Dhabi Gets a Sampler of World Art|last=Vogel|first=Carol|date=26 May 2009|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/10/11/10159435.html|title=Louvre Abu Dhabi gets green light|date=10 October 2007|publisher=[[Gulf News]]|accessdate=2008-09-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913182318/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/10/11/10159435.html|archivedate=13 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2011, Tourism Development &amp; Investment Company (TDIC.), the project manager owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, announced it would delay establishing the museum. The company gave no new date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdic.ae/en/news/media-center/news/tourism-development-investment-tdic-statement-on-saadiyat-cultural-district.html|title=Statement by T.D.I.C., October, 29, 2011|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109015134/http://www.tdic.ae/en/news/media-center/news/tourism-development-investment-tdic-statement-on-saadiyat-cultural-district.html|archivedate=9 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the UAE newspapers ''[[Gulf News]]'' and  ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'', the delay could be explained by a review of the emirate's economic strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/business/economy/showcase-projects-yield-to-more-urgent-needs-1.927270 Showcase projects yield to more urgent needs, ''[[Gulf News]]'', 10 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TDIC outlines new roll-out of museums|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/industry-insights/property/tdic-outlines-new-roll-out-of-museums|publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031000957/http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/industry-insights/property/tdic-outlines-new-roll-out-of-museums|archivedate=31 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012 it was confirmed that the Louvre Abu Dhabi's new opening date would be 2015.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/world/middleeast/27iht-m27-gulf-louvre.html?_r=0|title=After a Sputtering Start, the Louvre Abu Dhabi Project Gathers Pace |author=SARA HAMDAN|accessdate=10 January 2013 |date=26 September 2012 |work=nytimes |publisher=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the main phase of the museum began in early 2013 by a consortium headed by Arabtec, Constructora San José and Oger Abu Dhabi. This stage includes waterproofing and the two basement levels, along with four concrete pillars that will support the 7,000-tonne dome.&lt;ref name="thenational"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/louvre-abu-dhabi-is-a-modern-marvel-in-the-making?_r=0 |title=A modern marvel in the making |author=JAMES LANGTON |accessdate=24 May 2013 |date=11 October 2013 |work=thenational |publisher=Abu Dhabi Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014174902/http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/louvre-abu-dhabi-is-a-modern-marvel-in-the-making?_r=0 |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on the construction of the gallery spaces and initial preparation for the dome began in the fourth quarter of 2013. On 5 December 2013, the first element of the museum's canopy was lifted into place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louvre Abu Dhabi chalks up another towering achievement|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/tourism/louvre-abu-dhabi-chalks-up-another-towering-achievement|publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 2014 TDIC announced the completion of the first permanent gallery structure to mark the first anniversary of the start of construction. At this time, it was claimed that a total of ten million man hours had been worked and 120,538 cubic meters of concrete used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From a patch of sand to the outline of a masterpiece|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/tourism/louvre-abu-dhabi-from-patch-of-sand-to-the-outline-of-a-masterpiece|publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September, the final super-sized element in the canopy was fitted in place, marking a significant milestone in the museum's construction phase. In October, The Tourism &amp; Development Investment Company announced that the Louvre Abu Dhabi was more than 50 percent complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The story of the final piece of the Louvre Abu Dhabi|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/tourism/the-story-of-the-final-piece-of-the-louvre-abu-dhabis-great-puzzle|publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual identity===
The three-languages [[wayfinding]] system for the Louvre Abu Dhabi was designed by [[Philippe Apeloig]], and is implemented in both Arabic and Roman script. [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger LT]] typeface has been chosen for the Roman texts for its perfect readability for signage; while Lebanese typographer Kristyan Sarkis created an Arabic bespoke typeface, the LAD Arabic, based on the classic [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] style and his Colvert Arabic font.

The design of the pictograms was inspired by the museum’s architecture, and particularly by the abstract shapes created by the rain of light filtering through the gigantic dome's [[mashrabiya]]s. Each pictogram is a combination of several of these shapes, creating silhouettes and objects.

== Collection ==

Questions have been raised as to the nature of the artworks to be displayed at the museum. However, according to ''The National'': "the type and nature of the exhibits planned for the Louvre Abu Dhabi have been affected to no extent by the fact the new museum would be in a Muslim country, said Mr. Loyrette."&lt;ref name="Abu Dhabi’s Louvre to get Middle East art" /&gt;

Nevertheless, a walk through the museum reveals the absence of ancient Greek male nudes, other than medieval or Victorian era fig leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://geographic.org/streetview/special_places/view_louvre_abu_dhabi_inside.php |title=Google Street View image inside Louvre Abu Dhabi |work=Geographic.org/streetview |accessdate=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted that the museum will showcase work from multiple French museums, including the [[Louvre]], the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], the [[Musée d'Orsay]] and [[Palace of Versailles]]. However, [[Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres]], the French Culture Minister, stated at the announcement that the Paris Louvre "would not sell any of its 35,000-piece collection currently on display".

In 2012, the Louvre Abu Dhabi started collecting photography, making its first acquisitions in the field, including works by [[Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey]], [[Roger Fenton]] and [[George Wilson Bridges]]. The museum also acquired a sculpture of a Bactrian princess dating from the third millennium BC, a pavement and fountain set from the early Ottoman period, as well as the paintings ''Breton Boys Wrestling'' (1888) by [[Paul Gauguin]] and ''The Subjugated Reader'' (1928) by [[René Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (14 September 2012), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Louvre-Abu-Dhabi-acquires-its-first-photographic-works/27189  Louvre Abu Dhabi acquires its first photographic works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921115105/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Louvre-Abu-Dhabi-acquires-its-first-photographic-works/27189 |date=21 September 2012 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
[[File:Vives reflexions Groupe F Louvre.jpg|thumb|Vives Réflexions exhibition]]
The Louvre Abu Dhabi first started sharing its collection with the public through an exhibition entitled "Talking Art: Louvre Abu Dhabi," which opened in May 2009. The exhibition presented the first 19 acquisitions for the institution, including a [[Mamluk]] holy Koran from the 14th century, a 5th-century Fibula from [[Domagnano Treasure|Domagnano]], a Virgin and Child by [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellini]], and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]’s ''Composition with blue, red, yellow and black'' from 1922.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Sara Amdan (26 September 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/world/middleeast/27iht-m27-gulf-louvre.html After a Sputtering Start, the Louvre Abu Dhabi Project Gathers Pace] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second exhibition, "Birth of a Museum", opened at the exhibition space Manarat Al Saadiyat in May 2013, ending in August that year.

== Other programmes ==
The Louvre Abu Dhabi has also been working with the [[Paris Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi]] to set up a master’s program for museum professionals to train them and help them respond to local needs.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

== Management ==

=== Contract ===
Louvre Abu Dhabi is an entirely separate museum from the Louvre in Paris, although the two are linked by a thirty-year branding and training agreement and the Paris Louvre is one of the 12 shareholders in Agence France-Muséums.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The thirty-year agreement, signed by [[France|French]] Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres and Sheik Sultan bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, will prompt the construction of a Louvre museum on [[Saadiyat Island]], near central Abu Dhabi, in exchange for US$1.3 billion.&lt;ref name="ART IN THE DESERT"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,470356,00.html | title = Art in the Desert | publisher = [[Spiegel Online]] |date = 2007-07-03 | accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract prohibits the creation of any similar operation with the name of the Louvre in any of the other emirates of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, or Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de51gn.com/2008/07/30/louvre-abu-dhabis-exclusive-details/ |title=Louvre Abu Dhabi’s exclusive deal |date=30 July 2008 |publisher=de51gn.com |accessdate=2008-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106151120/http://de51gn.com/2008/07/30/louvre-abu-dhabis-exclusive-details/ |archivedate=6 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; French President [[Jacques Chirac]] praised the museum deal with Abu Dhabi, saying it reflects "a certain idea of the world" in which each party to the accord, "proud of its roots and of its identity, is conscious of the equal dignity of all cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/20070307.FIG000000146_le_louvre_abu_dhabi_sous_une_coupole_aerienne.html|title=Le Louvre Abu Dhabi sous une coupole aérienne|last=Heliot|first=Armelle |date=2007-10-15|publisher=''[[Le Figaro]]''|language=French|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=15archive/&amp;entry_id=14365|title=A Louvre for Abu Dhabi?

The Louvre’s Name: Expensive."/&gt; Arabtec is leading a consortium that is building the museum under a $653 million contract awarded early in 2013.

== Controversies ==

=== Opposition ===
The deal has sparked controversy in both artistic and academic circles. According to  Maymanah Farhat, "the controversy that has surfaced in France is led by art historian Didier Rykner, one of the most outspoken critics of the French–Emirati deal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/1730|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202080755/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/1730|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 December 2008|title=The Louvre Abu Dhabi, Exploitation and the Politics of the Museum Industry|last=Farhat|first=Maymanah|date=27 March 2007|publisher=ZNet|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition against the deal, signed by 4,650 curators, archaeologists and art historians, has insisted that French museums are not for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6421205.stm|title=Gulf Louvre deal riles French art world |last=Astier|first=Henri|date=2007-03-07|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2007/03/06/louvre_museum_to_build_a_branch_in_uae/|title=France's Louvre branching to Abu Dhabi|last=Krane|first=Jim|date=2007-03-06|publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Louvre has been accused of behaving "like a corporation with a clearly-defined strategy: profit maximization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/bizart/2007/07/the_desert_louvre_a_change_in.html|title=The ‘Desert Louvre’ – a change in museum policy?|last = Koek| first=Marjolein |date=2007-07-06| publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|accessdate = 2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Response ====
According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', "[[Henri Loyrette]], the president and director of the Louvre, has responded to growing criticism of the museum’s new policy of establishing footholds abroad, arguing that the Louvre cannot ignore the 'internationalization' of museums."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/09/arts/09arts.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin|title=Arts, Briefly|last=Van Gelder|first=Lawrence|date=9 January 2007|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the following to say in the museum's defence: {{Quote|It's a fair fee for the concession of the name. This tutelary role deserves a reward. It's normal.|Henri Loyrette}}
{{Quote|We're not selling the French legacy and heritage. We want this culture to radiate to parts of the world that value it. We're proud that Abu Dhabi wants to bring the Louvre here. We're not here to transform culture into a consumer product.|Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17482641/|title=Louvre to build branch in Abu Dhabi|date=6 March 2007|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi said: {{Quote|This is a major achievement in Abu Dhabi's vision to become a world-class destination bridging global cultures. This accord further strengthens international dialogue, which will embrace all cultures.

===Concerns about human rights abuse ===
In April 2011, [[Al Jazeera]] reported that over 120 international artists urged a boycott of both the Louvre and Guggenheim museums over concerns regarding the abuse and exploitation of construction workers employed to develop the complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/middleeast/2011/04/20114342518230176.html|title=Artists urge Guggenheim boycott|date=3 April 2011|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the architects, Jean Nouvel,  defended the treatment of the construction workers, starting that the condition of construction workers were better than some European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/24/architect-defends-treatment-workers-louvre-abu-dhabi-jean-nouvel|title=Architect defends treatment of workers at Louvre Abu Dhabi|date=24 September 2017|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Malleus Maleficarum''''',&lt;ref&gt;Translator [[Montague Summers]] consistently uses "the ''Malleus Maleficarum''" (or simply "the ''Malleus''") in his 1928 and 1948 introductions. {{cite web|url=http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718110138/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c.html |archivedate=2009-07-18 |df= }} {{cite web|url=http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00b.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607182655/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00b.html |archivedate=2007-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually translated as the '''''Hammer of Witches''''',&lt;ref&gt;In his translation of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'', Christopher S. Mackay explains the terminology at length – ''sorcerer'' is used to preserve the relationship of the Latin terminology. '"Malefium" = act of sorcery (literally an act of 'evil-doing'), while "malefica" = female performers of sorcery (evil deeds) and "maleficus" = male performer of evil deeds; sorcery, sorceress, and sorcerer."&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Alternative translations: ''The Witch Hammer'',{{sfnp|Guiley|2008|p=223'}} ''Hammer for Sorceresses'' ,{{sfnp|Mackay|2009}} ''Hammer Against Witches'', ''Hammer For Witches''}} is the best known and the most important treatise on [[witchcraft]].{{sfnb|Mackay|2009|p=1}}{{sfnb|Summers|2012|p=vii|loc=Introduction to 1948 edition|ps=: "It is hardly disputed that in the whole vast literature of witchcraft, the most prominent, the most important, the most authoritative volume is the ''Malleus Maleficarum" (''The Witch Hammer'') of Heinrich Kramer (Henricus Institioris) and James Sprenger."}} It was written by the discredited [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clergyman [[Heinrich Kramer]] (under his [[Latinized]] name ''Henricus Institoris'') and first published in the German city of [[Speyer]] in 1487.&lt;ref name="Ruickbie 2004"&gt;Ruickbie (2004), 71, highlights the problems of dating; Ankarloo (2002), 239&lt;/ref&gt; It endorses [[Witch trials in the early modern period|extermination of witches]] and for this purpose develops a detailed legal and theological theory.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=175|ps=: "Institoris and Sprenger's innovation was not their insistence that women were naturally prone to practice maleficium – in this they were simply following long-standing clerical traditions. Rather, it was their claim that harmful magic belonged exclusively to women that was new. If this assertion was granted, then the presence of maleficium indicated decisively the presence of a female witch. In the ''Malleus'', the field of masculine magic is dramatically limited and male magicians are pointedly marginalized; magic is no longer seen as a range of practices, some of which might be more characteristic of men, some of women, and some equally prevalent among both sexes. Instead, it was the effects of magic that mattered most, and harmful magic, the magic most characteristic of witches, belonged to women. Men might be learned magicians, anomalous archer wizards, or witch-doctors and superstitiosi, but very seldom did they work the broad range of maleficium typical of witches."}}{{sfnb|Pavlac|2009|p=57|ps=: "Many historians also blame Krämer for encouraging witch hunters to target women more than men as witches. Even his spelling of "maleficarum," with an a in a feminine gender instead of the usual masculine-gender "maleficorum" with an o, seems to emphasize his hostility toward women. Krämer's misogynistic arguments list many reasons why women were more likely to be witches than men. They were less clever, vainer, and more sexually insatiable. While these were not new criticisms against women, Krämer helped to entrench them in strixological literature."}}{{sfnp|Guiley|2008|p=223|ps=: "Kramer in particular exhibited a virulent hatred toward women witches and advocated their extermination. The ''Malleus'' devotes an entire chapter to the sinful weakness of women, their lascivious nature, moral and intellectual inferiority and gullibility to guidance from deceiving spirits. In Kramer's view, women witches were out to harm all of Christendom. &lt;br&gt;Scholars have debated the reasons for Kramer's misogyny; he may have had a fear of the power of women mystics of his day, such as Catherine of Siena, who enjoyed the attentions of royalty as well as the church."}}{{sfnp|Burns|2003|p=160`|ps=: "One element distinguishing ''Malleus Maleficarum'' from other demonologies is its obsessive hatred of women and sex, which seems to reflect Kramer's own twisted psyche. &lt;br&gt;[...] Kramer's interpretation of why women were more likely to be witches also differed somewhat from the standard. Kramer did accept the standard argument of misogynist demonologists that the female propensity for witchcraft was in part due to female weakness. He even derived the Latin word for woman, femina, from ''fe minus'' — 'less in faith.' He placed more emphasis on supposedly insatiable female sexuality than on female weakness, however. Kramer saw sex as the root of all sin, as that for which Adam and Eve originally fell. [...] He also suspected that the reluctance of many great ones in the land to prosecute witches was caused by their reception of demonic sexual favors. Kramer also discussed witch-caused impotence at length, going so far as to claim that witches had the ability to steal men's penises through illusion."}}{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|pp=35-36|ps=: "Kramer and Sprenger present an array of observations from the Bible, the church fathers, and the poets and philosophers of antiquity to support their contention that women are by nature greedy, unintelligent, and governed by passions. They argue that the evil of women stems from their physical and mental imperfections, a notion derived from Aristotle's theory that matter, perfection, and spirituality are purely expressed in the male body alone, and that women are misbegotten males produced by defective sperm. Women speak the language of idiots, Aristotle contends; like slaves, they are incapable of governing themselves or developing into the 'zoon politicon'. Thomas Aquinas adapted these views to Christianity, arguing that because woman is less perfect than man, she is but an indirect image of God and an appendix to man. Citing such views, Kramer and Sprenger find that women are 'intellectually like children,' credulous and impressionable, and therefore easily fall prey to the devil. 'Since [women] are feebler both in mind and body,' the ''Malleus'' concludes, 'it is not surprising that they should come more [than men] under the spell of witchcraft.&lt;br&gt;Lack of intelligence prevents women not only from distinguishing good from evil, but from remembering the rules of behavior. Amoral and undisciplined, women are governed primarily by passion. 'And indeed,' Kramer and Sprenger declare, 'just as thorough the first defect in their intelligence women are more prone to abjure the faith; so through their second defect of inordinate affections and passions they search for, brood over, and inflict various vengeances, either by witchcraft, or by some other means.' [...] 'Wherefore it is no wonder that so great a number of witches exist in this sex,' concludes the ''Malleus''."}}&lt;ref&gt;''[[#BritannicaW|Britannica]]'': "By 1435–50, the number of prosecutions had begun to rise sharply, and toward the end of the 15th century, two events stimulated the hunts: Pope Innocent VIII's publication in 1484 of the bull ''Summis desiderantes affectibus'' ("Desiring with the Greatest Ardour") condemning witchcraft as Satanism, the worst of all possible heresies, and the publication in 1486 of Heinrich Krämer and Jacob Sprenger's ''Malleus maleficarum'' ("The Hammer of Witches"), a learned but cruelly misogynist book blaming witchcraft chiefly on women. Widely influential, it was reprinted numerous times."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Levack|2006|p=145|ps=: "Explanations for the predominance of women as witches often focus on the treatises written by demonologists, many of which comment on the fact that most witches were women. This literature is in most cases intensely misogynistic, in the sense that it is demeaning, if not blatantly hostile, to women. The common theme in these demonological treatises is that women were more susceptible to demonic temptation because they were morally weaker than men and more likely, therefore, to succumb to diabolical temptation. This idea, which dates from the earliest days of Christianity, is expressed most forcefully in the ''Malleus Maleficarum'', but it can be found in many places, even in the sceptical demonological treatise of Johann Weyer."}} It was a bestseller, second only to the [[Bible]] in terms of sales for almost 200 years.{{sfnb|Guiley|2008|p=223``|ps=: "Published first in Germany in 1486, the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' proliferated into dozens of editions throughout Europe and England and had a profound impact on European witch trials for about 200 years. [...] It was second only to the Bible in sales until John Bunyan's ''Pilgrim's Progress'' was published in 1678"}} The top theologians of the Inquisition at the [[University of Cologne|Faculty of Cologne]] condemned the book as recommending unethical and illegal procedures, as well as being inconsistent with Catholic doctrines of [[demonology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), "Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages", page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Malleus'' elevates sorcery to the criminal status of heresy and prescribes inquisitorial practices for secular courts in order to extirpate witches. The recommended procedures include torture to effectively obtain confessions and the death penalty as the only sure remedy against the evils of witchcraft.{{sfnb|Brauner|2001|pp=33-34}}{{sfnb|Broedel|2003|p=33|ps=: "Ultimately, however, the bewitched cannot hope for an infallible remedy, for the power of witches is too strong. There is only one completely reliable way to combat witchcraft, and this is to eliminate the witches, the course of action Institoris and Sprenger endorse in one of the most impassioned passages of the ''Malleus'' [...]"}} At that time, it was typical to burn heretics alive at the stake{{sfnb|Mackay|2009|p=28|ps=: "but it was understood by everyone that the heretic was to be executed (normally by being burned alive) in accordance with secular laws against heresy"}} and the ''Malleus'' encouraged the same treatment of witches. The book had a strong influence on culture for several centuries.{{efn|Amongst the authors on witchcraft it had an ultimate authority{{sfnp|Summers|2012|p=xxxviii|loc=Introduction to 1928 edition|ps=: "There can be no doubt that this work had in its day and for a full couple of centuries an enormous influence. There are few demonologists and writers upon witchcraft who do not refer to its pages as an ultimate authority."}} and even 17th century "[[Dominican Order|Dominican]] chroniclers, such as [[Jacques Quétif|Quétif]] and [[Jacques Échard|Échard]], number Kramer and Sprenger among the glories and heroes of their [[Order of Preachers|Order]]".{{sfnp|Summers|2012|p=ix|loc=Introduction to 1948 edition|ps=: "The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] chroniclers, such as [[Jacques Quétif|Quétif]] and [[Jacques Échard|Échard]], number Kramer and Sprenger among the glories and heroes of their [[Order of Preachers|Order]]"}} The ''Malleus'' was ubiquitous, but at the end of the 16th century its role as a theoretical authority was superseded by ''[[Daemonolatreiae libri tres|Demonolatry]]'' by witch-hunter [[Nicholas Rémy]] and ''[[Magical Investigations]]'' by [[Jesuit]] [[Martin Delrio|Martin del Rio]].{{sfnb|Burns|2003|p=160|ps=: "In the Catholic world, the works of Nicholas Remy and Martin del Rio replaced the ''Malleus'' as a theoretical authority in the late sixteenth century. Its ubiquity, however, must have made it an important contributor to the ideas that many educated people held of witches and the proper way to deal with them.}}}}

[[Jacob Sprenger]]'s name was added as an author beginning in 1519, 33 years after the book's first publication and 24 years after Sprenger's death;&lt;ref name="Behringer, Wolfgang p. 2"&gt;Behringer, Wolfgang. ''Malleus Maleficarum'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; but the veracity of this late addition has been questioned by many historians for various reasons.{{attribution needed|date=November 2018}}

Kramer wrote the ''Malleus'' following his expulsion from [[Innsbruck]] by the local bishop, due to charges of illegal behavior against Kramer himself, and because of Kramer's obsession with the sexual habits of one of the accused, Helena Scheuberin, which led the other tribunal members to suspend the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, William. ''Witch Hunts in Europe and America: An Encyclopedia'', pp. 143-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was later used by royal courts during the Renaissance, and contributed to the increasingly brutal prosecution of witchcraft during the 16th and 17th centuries.

== Background ==
{{See also|Witch trials in the early modern period|Summis desiderantes affectibus|Demonology#Christianity|European witchcraft}}

Magical acts and witchcraft had long been forbidden by the Church, whose attitude towards witchcraft was explained in the ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'' written in about AD 900. It stated that witchcraft and magic were just delusions and that those who believed in such things "had been seduced by the Devil in dreams and visions".{{sfnp|Pavlac|2009|p=29}} However, in the same period supernatural intervention was accepted in the form of [[ordeals]] that were later also used during witch trials.{{sfnp|Pavlac|2009|p=31'|ps=: "Both compurgation and ordeal were believed to take place under the beneficent care of God, who would ensure that the guilty would be punished and the innocent freed. Such trials accepted a degree of the miraculous. Quite common until the twelfth century, they went into decline after improved legal procedures reestablished themselves in western Europe at that time. The cold water ordeal, however, would rise again during the witch hunts."}} [[Demonic Possession|Possessions by the Devil]] are considered real even in present times by some [[Christians]] and it is a part of doctrine that demons may be cast out by appropriate sacramental [[Exorcism in Christianity|exorcisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohr, M. D., &amp; Royal, K. D. (2012). "Investigating the Practice of Christian Exorcism and the Methods Used to Cast out Demons", Journal of Christian Ministry, 4, p. 35. Available at: http://journalofchristianministry.org/article/view/10287/7073.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|not a sacrament, but sacramental}} In the ''Malleus'', exorcism is, for example, one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of [[incubus|incubi]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Heinrich and Sprenger, James (1486), Summers, Montague (translator&amp;nbsp;– 1928), ''The Malleus Maleficarum'', Part 2, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/mm/mm02b01a.htm Chapter 1], ''The Remedies prescribed by the Holy Church against Incubus and Succubus Devils'', at [http://www.sacred-texts.com sacred-texts.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prayer]] and [[transubstantiation]] are traditionally excluded by Christians from the category of magical rites.{{sfnb|Mackay|2009|p=30|ps=: "First, we have to be specific about the concept that is understood by the terms "witchcraft" and "magic." For present purposes, we will take it to mean the manipulation of the physical world through the use of special words and procedures. It could easily be argued that the practices of the medieval Church would fall under this definition, but since most contemporaries would have excluded such practices from the category, we will also ignore these here, and consider as "magical" only such practices as would not have been considered legitimate rites of the Church."}}

In 1484 clergyman [[Heinrich Kramer]] made one of the [[Die Scheuberin|first attempts at prosecuting alleged witches]] in the [[History of Tyrol|Tyrol]] region. It was not a success: he was expelled from the city of Innsbruck and dismissed by the local bishop as "senile and crazy".&lt;ref name="Behringer, Wolfgang p. 2"/&gt;  According to [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], writing the book was Kramer's act of self-justification and revenge.&lt;ref name="reform"&gt;{{cite book |last=MacCulloch |first=Diarmaid |title=Reformation: Europe's House Divided |pages=563–68 |year=2004 |isbn=0-14-028534-2 |publisher =Vintage Books, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ankarloo and Clark claim that Kramer's purpose in writing the book was to explain his own views on witchcraft, systematically refute arguments claiming that witchcraft did not exist, discredit those who expressed skepticism about its reality, claim that those who practised witchcraft were more often women than men, and to convince [[magistrate]]s to use Kramer's recommended procedures for finding and convicting witches.{{sfnp|Ankarloo|Clark|2002|p=240}}

Some scholars have suggested that following the failed efforts in Tyrol, Kramer requested explicit authority from the Pope to prosecute witchcraft. Kramer received a [[papal bull]] ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'' in 1484. It allegedly gave full papal approval for the [[Inquisition]] to prosecute what was deemed to be witchcraft in general and also gave individual authorizations to Kramer and Dominican Friar Jacob Sprenger specifically.&lt;ref name="Russell, 229"&gt;Russell, 229&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have disputed the idea that Sprenger was working with Kramer, arguing that the evidence shows that Sprenger was actually a persistent opponent of Kramer, even going so far as to ban him from Dominican convents within Sprenger's jurisdiction while also banning him from preaching. In the words of Wolfgang Behringer: "Sprenger had tried to suppress Kramer's activities in every possible way. He forbade the convents of his province to host him, he forbade Kramer to preach, and even tried to interfere directly in the affairs of Kramer's Séléstat convent... The same day Sprenger became successor to Jacob Strubach as provincial superior (October 19, 1487), he obtained permission from his general, Joaquino Turriani, to lash out adversus m[agistrum] Henricum Institoris inquisitorem (against Master Heinrich Kramer, inquisitor)." &lt;ref&gt;Behringer, Wolfgang. ''Malleus Maleficarum'' pp 2 - 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The preface also includes an alleged unanimous [[approbation]] from the [[University of Cologne]]'s Faculty of Theology.  Nevertheless, many historians have argued that it is well established by sources outside the "Malleus" that the university's theology faculty condemned the book for unethical procedures and for contradicting Catholic theology on a number of important points : "just for good measure Institoris forged a document granting their apparently unanimous approbation." &lt;ref name="Jolly, Karen p. 115"&gt;Jolly, Karen et al., ''Witchcraft and Magic In Europe'', p. 115 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book became the handbook for secular courts throughout [[Renaissance]] Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which "denied any authority to the ''Malleus''" in the words of historian Wolfgang Behringer.&lt;ref&gt;Behringer, Wolfgang. ''Malleus Maleficarum'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the book has often been viewed as a typical inquisitorial manual, a perception that many historians have refuted. According to historian Jenny Gibbons:{{quote|in the 1970s, when feminist and Neo-Pagan authors turned their attention to the witch trials, the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' (''Hammer of Witches'') was the only manual readily available in translation. Authors naively assumed that the book painted an accurate picture of how the Inquisition tried witches. Heinrich Kramer, the text's demented author, was held up as a typical inquisitor. His rather stunning sexual preoccupations were presented as the Church's "official" position on witchcraft. Actually the Inquisition immediately rejected the legal procedures Kramer recommended and censured the inquisitor himself just a few years after the Malleus was published. Secular courts, not inquisitorial ones, resorted to the ''Malleus''.&lt;ref name="Gibbons, Jenny pp 2 - 16"&gt;Gibbons, Jenny. "Recent Developments in the Study of The Great European Witch Hunt", in ''Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies'', issue number 5, August 1998; pp 2 - 16"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Before 1400 it was rare for anyone to be persecuted for witchcraft, but the increasingly common persecution of heresy and failure to fully defeat those heretics paved the way for later criminal prosecution of witchcraft.{{sfnp|Pavlac|2009|p=31}} By the 15th century belief in witches was widely accepted in European society. Previously, those convicted of witchcraft typically suffered penalties no more harsh than public penances such as a day in the [[stocks]],&lt;ref name="reform"/&gt; but their persecution became more brutal following the publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'', as witchcraft became widely accepted as a real and dangerous phenomenon.{{sfnp|Trevor-Roper|1969|pp=102–105}} The most vigorous persecutions took place between years 1560 and 1630, ending in Europe around 1780.{{sfnp|Levack|2013|p=74}}

Particularly in the 16th and 17th centuries an intense discourse on the nature of witches preoccupied [[demonologist]]s across Europe and they published many printed sermons, books and tracts. The [[Catholic Church]] played an important role in shaping of debate on demonology, but the discourse was not much affected by the Reformation. [[Martin Luther]] was also convinced about the reality and evil of witches, and facilitated development of [[Protestant]] demonology.{{sfnp|Levack|2013|pp=75-76}} Catholic and Protestant demonologies were similar in their basic beliefs about witches {{sfnp|Levack|2013|p=79|ps=: "As noted, Catholic demonologists did not differ much from their Protestant counterparts in their basic beliefs concerning witches."}} and most writers agreed on the severity of the crime of witchcraft.{{sfnp|Levack|2013|p=77}}{{efn|According to Summers, the ''Malleus'' "lay on the bench of every judge, on the desk of every magistrate".{{sfnb|Summers|2012|p=viii|loc=Introduction to 1948 edition}}}} It was accepted by both Catholic and Protestant legislatures{{sfnb|Summers|2012|p=viii|loc=Introduction to 1948 edition}} and witch-hunting was undeniably sponsored by both Protestant and Catholic governments.{{sfnb|Ankarloo|Clark|2002b|p=10|ps=: "It is undeniable that both Protestant and Catholic governments sponsored witch-hunting. Sometimes, as in the Saarland, Catholic overlords (the Duke of Lorraine and the Archbishop of Trier) were more likely to sponsor witch-hunts than Protestant sovereigns (in this case, the Lutheran Count of Nassau and the Calvinist Count of Zweibrucken). But in other regions, for example French-speaking western Switzerland, Protestant rulers were more severe than Catholic overlords in prosecuting witches (Monter 1976)."}}{{efn|Additional note: "Such thinking was also mirrored in the groundbreaking work of the German scholars Wilhelm Gottfried Soldan (1803-1869) and Joseph Hansen (1862-1943) both of whom blamed witchhunts on the overweening power of the Roman Catholic Church and saw the demise of witch trials as a natural corollary of the progress of reason and science."{{sfn|Levack|2013|p=550}}}}{{efn|Additional note: "But although Catholics have been fed comforting errors by overeager apologists about the Church's part in persecuting witches, we must face our own tragic past.

[[File:Lucifer Liege Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|upright|''Lucifer ([[Le génie du mal]])'' by [[Guillaume Geefs]] ([[Liège Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Paul]], Liège, Belgium)]]

In this part it is briefly explained that prevalence of sorcery which is a method of Satan's final assault motivated authors to write the ''Malleus Maleficarum'':{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=8}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] [ [[Devil in Christianity|Lucifer]] ] attacks through these heresies at that time in particular, when the evening of the world declines towards its setting and the evil of men swells up, since he knows in great anger, as John bears witness in the [[Book of Apocalypse]] [12:12], that he has little time remaining. Hence, he has also caused a certain unusual heretical perversity to grow up in the land of the Lord – a Heresy, I say, of Sorceresses, since it is to be designated by the particular gender over which he is known to have power. [...] In the midst of these evils, we Inquisitors, Jacobus Sprenger together with the very dear associate [Institoris] delegated by the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]] for the extermination of so destructive a heresy [...] we will bring everything to the desired conclusion. [...] naming the treatise the "Hammer for Sorceresses," we are undertaking the task of compiling the work for an associate [presumably, an ecclesiastic] [...]{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=69|ps=: excerpts from translation}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Papal bull ===
&lt;!-- This is a summary of content AS IS. Please place objections elsewhere --&gt;
Copies of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' contain a reproduction of a [[papal bull]] known as ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'' that is addressed to Heinrich Institoris and Jakob Sprenger.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=8}} According to it, [[Pope Innocent VIII]] acknowledges that sorceresses are real and harmful through their involvement in the acts of Satan.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=8'|ps=: "the general harm that sorceresses are inflicting in Germany is first described at some length, and the connection of these activities with Satan is emphasized."}} As Mackay writes "It is then noted that ''Institoris'''s and Sprenger's efforts to stamp these activities out had met with opposition in the form of technical objections relating to the specific offenses that were covered by their appointment as inquisitors, which the pope then overrides by reiterating and amplifying the terms of the inquisitors' appointment."{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=8}}

According to the date on a document, the papal bull had been issued in 1484, two years before the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' was finished. Therefore, it is not an endorsement of a specific final text of the ''Malleus''. Instead, its inclusion implicitly legitimizes the handbook by providing general confirmation of the reality of witchcraft and full authority to Sprenger and Institoris in their preachings and proceedings:{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=10}}{{sfnp|Halsall|1996|loc=Innocent VIII: BULL ''Summis desiderantes'', Dec. 5th, 1484}} {{Pull quote|And they shall also have full and entire liberty to propound and preach to the faithful Word of God, as often as it shall seem to them fitting and proper, in each and all of the parosh churches in the said provinces, and to do all things necessary and suitable under the aforesaid circumstances, and likewise freely and fully to carry them out.|author=Summis desiderantes affectibus{{sfnp|Halsall|1996|loc=Innocent VIII: BULL ''Summis desiderantes'', Dec. 5th, 1484}}}}

=== Approbation ===

&lt;!-- This is a summary of content AS IS. Please place objections elsewhere --&gt;
This part of the ''Malleus'' is titled "The Approbation of The Following Treatise and The Signatures Thereunto of The Doctors of The Illustrious University of Cologne Follows in The Form of A Public Document"{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=74}} and contains unanimous approval of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' by all the Doctors of the Theological Faculty of the [[University of Cologne]]{{sfnp|Summers|2012|p=xxxvii|loc=Introduction to 1928 edition|ps=: "The ''Malleus Maleficarum'' when submitted by the authors to the University of Cologne was officially approved by all the Doctors of the Theological Faculty on 9 May 1487."}} signed by them personally.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|pp=76–79|ps=: phrases like "with his own hands" are used}} The proceedings are attested by [[notary public]] Arnold Kolich of [[Euskirchen]], a sworn cleric of Cologne with inclusion of confirmatory testimony by present witnesses Johannes Vorda of Mecheln a sworn [[beadle]], Nicholas Cuper de Venrath the sworn notary of [[Curia]] of Cologne and Christian Wintzen of Euskirchen a cleric of the [[Diocese of Cologne]].{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=80}}

Text of approbation mentions that during proceedings Institoris had a letter from [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] which is summarized in the approbation: "[... Maximilian I] takes these Inquisitors under his complete protection, ordering and commanding each and every subject of the Roman Empire to render all favor and assistance to these Inquisitors and otherwise to act in the manner that is more fully contained and included in the letter."{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=79}}

The approbation consists of a [[preamble]] and is followed by a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] in two parts.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|pp=74–79}}

====Preamble====
&lt;!-- This is a summary of content AS IS. Please place objections elsewhere --&gt;
It begins with a general statement about circumstances: &lt;blockquote&gt;IN THE NAME OF Our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Let all those who will read, see or hear the present public document know that in the year since the Birth of Our Lord 1487, in the fifth indiction, on Saturday, the nineteenth day of May, at five in the afternoon or thereabouts, in the third year of the Pontificate of Our Lord, the Most Holy Father in Christ, Lord Innocent VIII, by Divine Providence Pope, in the presence of my notary public and of the witnesses written below who had been specifically summoned and asked for this purpose, the venerable and religious Brother Henricus Institoris, Professor of Holy Theology and member of the [[Order of Preachers]], who was appointed as Inquisitor into Heretical Depravity by the [[Holy See]] along with his colleague, the venerable and religious Brother Jacobus Sprenger, also a Professor of Holy Theology and [[Prior]] of the Convent of Preachers in Cologne[...]{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|pp=74–75}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then, signatories complain that "Some curates of souls and preachers of the Word of God feel no shame at claiming and affirming in their sermons to the congregation that sorceresses do not exist"{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=75}} and notice that the intention of the authors of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' is not primarily to alleviate this ignorance but rather "toil to exterminate the sorceresses by explaining the appropriate methods of sentencing and punishing them in accordance with the text of the aforementioned Bull and the regulations of the Holy Canons, thereby achieving their extermination";{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=75}} finally, signatories explain why they are providing their expertise: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is consonant with reason that those things that are done on behalf of the common good should also be confirmed through the common approval of the Doctors, and therefore, lest the aforementioned poorly educated curates and preachers think, in their ignorance of [[Bible|Holy Scripture]], that the aforesaid treatise, which was composed in the manner mentioned above, is poorly supported by the determinations and pronouncements of the Doctors, they offered it for examination and comparison against Scripture to the illustrious University of Cologne or rather to certain Professors of Holy Theology, in order that if any things were found to be worthy of censure or incompatible with the Catholic Truth, they should be refuted by the judgment of those Professors, and that those things found to be compatible with the Catholic Truth should be approved. This was in fact done in the ways written below.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|pp=75–76}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Resolution====
&lt;!-- This is a summary of content AS IS. Please place objections elsewhere --&gt;
There are two signings, sometimes also referenced as two approbations. The difference is that four signatories of the first part testify that they have examined the treatises and endorse its text while in the second signing signatories do not assert that they have read the treatises but nonetheless express approval by explicitly restating some general propositions of the treatises and endorsing them instead.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|pp=74–80}}

In the first part, the opinion of a "temporary Dean of the Faculty of Holy Theology at Cologne" namely [[Lambertus de Monte]] of [['s-Heerenberg]]{{efn|{{harvnb|Broedel|2003|p=93}}: He was one of the advocates of Aristotelian thought and opponents of ''via moderna'', he was "one of Sprenger's most distinguished colleagues at Cologne, and the man whose name appears first on the faculty endorsement of the ''Malleus'', [he] even went so far as to lead an abortive drive to obtain beatification for Aristotle."}} is expressed and then professors [[Jacobus Straelen]] of Noetlinck, [[Andreas Schermer]] of [[Ochsenfurt]] and [[Thomas Lyel]] of [[Scotland]] testify that they agree with his opinion.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=77}} The following is an excerpt from the opinion: &lt;blockquote&gt;[I proclaim] that this three part treatise, which has been examined by me and carefully compared against [[Bible|Scripture]] with regard to its first two parts, contains nothing, in my humble judgment at least, that is contrary to the pronouncements of the non-erroneous philosophers, or against the Truth of the Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Faith, or against the determinations of the Doctors approved or admitted by the Holy Church, and that the third part should certainly be upheld and approved in regard to the punishments of those heretics whom it treats, in that it does not contradict Holy Canons, and also because of the personal experiences described in this treatise, which are believed to be true because of the reputation of such great men, particularly since they are inquisitors. It should be ensured that this treatise will become known to learned and zealous men, who will then, on the basis of it, provide various healthy and appropriate advice for the extermination of sorceresses [...]{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=76}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second part is signed by those from the first signing and in addition by professors [[Ulrich Kridweiss]] of [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], [[Konrad Vorn]] of [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]], [[Cornelius Pays]] of [[Breda]] and Dietrich of Balveren (Bummel).{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=78}} Signatories attest that: &lt;blockquote&gt;1) The Masters of Holy Theology written below commend the Inquisitors into Heretical Depravity appointed by the authority of the Apostolic See in conformity with the Canons, and urge that they think it right to carry out their office zealously.&lt;br&gt;2) The proposition that acts of sorcery can happen with God's permission through sorcerers or sorceresses when the Devil works with them is not contrary to the Catholic Faith, but consonant with the statements of Holy Scripture. Indeed, according to the pronouncements of the Holy Doctors it is necessary to admit that such acts can sometimes happen.&lt;br&gt;3) It is therefore erroneous to preach that acts of sorcery cannot happen, because in this way preachers impede, to the extent that they can, the pious work of the inquisitors, to the prejudice of the salvation of souls. Nonetheless, secrets that are heard at any time by inquisitors should not be revealed to everyone.&lt;br&gt;4) All princes and Catholics should be urged to think it right to assist such pious vows on the part of the Inquisitors in defense of the Holy Catholic Faith.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|pp=77–78}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:J. Sprenger and H. Institutoris, Malleus maleficarum. Wellcome L0000980.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of an edition dated 1669]]
The ''Malleus Maleficarum'' asserts that three elements are necessary for witchcraft: the evil intentions of the witch, the help of the Devil, and the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 232&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise is divided into three sections. The first section is aimed at clergy and tries to refute critics who deny the reality of witchcraft, thereby hindering its prosecution.  The second lays the foundation for the next section by describing the actual forms of witchcraft and its remedies. The third section is to assist judges confronting and combating witchcraft, and to aid the inquisitors by removing the burden from them. However, each of these three sections has the prevailing themes of what is witchcraft and who is a witch.

==== Section I {{anchor|section1}} &lt;!-- do not remove the anchor --&gt;====
Section I examines the concept of witchcraft theoretically, from the point of view of [[natural philosophy]] and theology.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=20}} Specifically it addresses the question of whether witchcraft is a real phenomenon or imaginary, perhaps "deluding phantasms of the devil, or simply the fantasies of overwrought human minds".{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=22}} The conclusion drawn is that witchcraft must be real because the Devil is real. Witches entered into a pact with Satan to allow them the power to perform harmful magical acts, thus establishing an essential link between witches and the Devil.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=22}}

==== Section II {{anchor|section2}} &lt;!-- do not remove the anchor --&gt;====
Matters of practice and actual cases are discussed, and the powers of witches and their recruitment strategies.&lt;ref name="Broedel, 30"&gt;Broedel, 30&lt;/ref&gt; It states that it is mostly witches, as opposed to the Devil, who do the recruiting, by making something go wrong in the life of a respectable matron that makes her consult the knowledge of a witch, or by introducing young maidens to tempting young devils.&lt;ref name="Broedel, 30"/&gt; It details how witches cast spells, and remedies that can be taken to prevent witchcraft, or help those who have been affected by it.{{sfnp|Mackay|2006|p=214}}

==== Section III {{anchor|section3}} &lt;!-- do not remove the anchor --&gt;====
Section III is the legal part of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' that describes how to prosecute a witch. The arguments are clearly laid for the lay magistrates prosecuting witches. The section offers a step-by-step guide to the conduct of a witch trial, from the method of initiating the process and assembling accusations, to the interrogation (including torture) of witnesses, and the formal charging of the accused.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=34}} Women who did not cry during their trial were automatically believed to be witches.{{sfnp|Mackay|2006|p=502}}

==Theological foundations and major themes==
{{See also|Thomas Aquinas|Formicarius|Directorium Inquisitorum|Book of Exodus|Canon Episcopi}}
Jakob Sprenger was an appointed [[inquisitor]] for the [[Rhineland]], theology professor and a [[Dean (education)|dean]] at the [[University of Cologne]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[#Britannica|Britannica]]'': "The ''Malleus'' was the work of two Dominicans: Johann Sprenger, dean of the University of Cologne in Germany, and Heinrich (Institoris) Kraemer, professor of theology at the University of Salzburg, Austria"&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfnp|Burns|2003|p=158'|ps=: "Sprenger, a theology professor at Cologne, had already been appointed inquisitor for the Rhineland in 1470."}} Heinrich Kraemer (Institoris) was an appointed inquisitor of south Germany, a professor of theology at the University of Salzburg, the leading [[demonologist]] and [[witch-hunt]]er in late medieval Germany.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;{{sfnp|Burns|2003|p=158|ps=: "The fifteenth-century German Dominican inquisitor Heinrich Kramer, was a leading demonologist and witch-hunter in late medieval Germany."}} [[Pope Innocent VIII]] in [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'' refers to them both as "beloved sons" and "professors of theology";{{sfnp|Halsall|1996|loc=Innocent VIII: BULL ''Summis Desiderantes'', Dec. 5th, 1484 (2)|ps=: "And, although our beloved sons Henricus Institoris and Jacobus Sprenger, of the order of Friars Preachers, professors of theology, have been and still are deputed by our apostolic letters as inquisitors of heretical pravity, the former in the aforesaid parts of upper Germany, including the provinces, cities, territories, dioceses, and other places as above, and the latter throughout certain parts of the course of the Rhine;"}} also authorizes them to extirpate [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Britannica|Britannica]]'': "In 1484 Pope Innocent VIII issued the bull ''Summis Desiderantes'', in which he deplored the spread of witchcraft in Germany and authorized Sprenger and Kraemer to extirpate it."&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Malleus Maleficarum'' was intended to implement [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:18: "You shall not permit a sorceress to live."&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Britannica|Britannica]]'': "The ''Malleus'' codified the folklore and beliefs of the Alpine peasants and was dedicated to the implementation of Exodus 22:18: "You shall not permit a sorceress to live.""&lt;/ref&gt; and explicitly argues that ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'' does not apply to the new, formerly unknown [[heresy]] of "modern witchcraft".{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|pp=33–34}} &lt;blockquote&gt;Kramer and Sprenger were the first to raise harmful sorcery to the criminal status of heresy. [...] If harmful sorcery is a crime on the order of heresy, Kramer and Sprenger argue, then the secular judges who prosecute it must do so with the same vigor as would the ''[[Inquisition]]'' in prosecuting a heretic. The ''Malleus'' urges them to adopt torture, leading questions, the admission of denunciation as valid evidence, and other Inquisitorial practices to achieve swift results. Moreover, the authors insist that the death penalty for convicted witches is the only sure remedy against withcraft. They maintain that the lesser penalty of banishment prescribed by ''Canon Episcopi'' for those convicted of harmful sorcery does not apply to the new breed of witches, whose unprecedented evil justifies capital punishment.{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|pp=33–34}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The treatise often makes references to the Bible and Aristotelian thought, and it is heavily influenced by the philosophical tenets of [[Neoplatonism]].{{sfnp|Kieckhefer|2000|p=145}} The first section of the book's [[#main|main text]] is written using the scholastic methodology of [[Thomas Aquinas]] characterized by a mode of ''disputed questions'' most notably used in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. It was a standard mode of argumentation in scholastic discourse with a long tradition.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=28|ps=: for information that only the first part is written using scholastic methodology of disputed questions}}{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|pp=17–18}} Most of the citations in the ''Malleus'' come from multiple works of Aquinas, a highly influential author in theology. Aquinas is a main source for [[#section1|Section I]] but is cited in all sections; ''[[Formicarius]]'' by [[Johannes Nider]] is the important source for [[#section2|Section II]], and ''[[Directorium Inquisitorum]]'' by Spanish inquisitor [[Nicholas Eymeric]] is a crucial source for [[#section3|Section III]].{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|pp=16–17}}

The ancient subjects of [[astronomy]], [[philosophy]], and [[medicine]] were being reintroduced to the West at this time, as well as a plethora of ancient texts being rediscovered and studied.  The ''Malleus'' also mentions [[astrology]] and astronomy, which had recently been reintroduced to the West through the ancient works of [[Pythagoras]].{{sfnp|Kieckhefer|2000|p=146}} The ''Malleus'' is also heavily influenced by the subjects of [[divination]], [[astrology]], and healing rituals the Church inherited from antiquity.{{sfnp|Ankarloo|Clark|2002|p=77}}

Importantly, Kramer and Sprenger were convinced that God would never permit an innocent person to be convicted of witchcraft.{{sfnp|Guiley|2008|p=224|ps=: "Kramer and Sprenger piously maintained that God would never permit an innocent person to be convicted of witchcraft"}}{{sfnp|Burns|2003|p=159|ps=: "Kramer and Sprenger endorsed deception and torture to win confessions from accused witches, pointing out that God would never allow an innocent person to be convicted."}}

=== Torture and confessions ===
{{See also|Strappado (torture)|Rack (torture)|:Category:Medieval instruments of torture}}
[[File:Wickiana5.jpg|thumb|[[Death by burning|Burning]] of three alleged witches in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], Switzerland (1585), by [[Johann Jakob Wick]].]]
The ''Malleus'' recommended not only torture but also deception in order to obtain confessions: "And when the implements of torture have been prepared, the judge, both in person and through other good men zealous in the faith, tries to persuade the prisoner to confess the truth freely; but, if he will not confess, he bid attendants make the prisoner fast to the [[strappado]] or some other implement of torture. The attendants obey forthwith, yet with feigned agitation. Then, at the prayer of some of those present, the prisoner is loosed again and is taken aside and once more persuaded to confess, being led to believe that he will in that case not be put to death." {{sfnp|Halsall|1996|loc=Extracts from THE HAMMER OF WITCHES [''Malleus maleficarum''], 1486}}

All confessions acquired with the use of tortures had to be confirmed: "And note that, if he confesses under the torture, he must afterward be conducted to another place, that he may confirm it and certify that it was not due alone to the force of the torture." {{sfnp|Halsall|1996|loc=Extracts from THE HAMMER OF WITCHES [''Malleus maleficarum''], 1486}}

However, if there was no confirmation, tortures could not be repeated, but it was allowed to continue them at the specified day: "But, if the prisoner will not confess the truth satisfactorily, other sorts of tortures must be placed before him, with the statement that unless he will confess the truth, he must endure these also. But, if not even thus he can be brought into terror and to the truth, then the next day or the next but one is to be set for a continuation of the tortures – not a repetition, for it must not be repeated unless new evidences produced. The judge must then address to the prisoners the following sentence: We, the judge, etc., do assign to you, such and such a day for the continuation of the tortures, that from your own mouth the truth may be heard, and that the whole may be recorded by the notary."{{sfnp|Halsall|1996|loc=Extracts from THE HAMMER OF WITCHES [''Malleus maleficarum''], 1486}}

=== Victims ===
The treatise describes how women and men become inclined to practice witchcraft. The text argues that women are more susceptible to demonic temptations through the manifold weaknesses of their gender. It was believed that they were weaker in faith and more carnal than men.{{sfnp|Bailey|2003|p=49}} Michael Bailey claims that most of the women accused as witches had strong personalities and were known to defy convention by overstepping the lines of proper female decorum.{{sfnp|Bailey|2003|p=51}} After the publication of the ''Malleus'', it seems as though about three quarters of those individuals prosecuted as witches were women.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 145&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- 75% to 85% --&gt;

[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Execution of alleged witches in Central Europe, 1587]]

Witches were usually female. The reasons for this is the suggestion that women are "prone to believing and because the demon basically seeks to corrupt the faith, he assails them in particular."{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=164}} They also have a "temperament towards flux" and "loose tongues".{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=164}} They "are defective in all the powers of both soul and body"{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p = 164}} and are stated to be more lustful than men. The major reason is that at the foundation of sorcery is denial of faith and "woman, therefore, is evil as a result of nature because she doubts more quickly in the faith."{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p = 166}} Men could be witches, but were considered rarer, and the reasons were also different. The most common form of male witch mentioned in the book is the sorcerer-archer. The book is rather unclear, but the impetus behind male witches seems to come more from desire for power than from disbelief or lust, as it claims is the case for female witches.

Indeed, the very title of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' is feminine, alluding to the idea that it was women who were the villains. Otherwise, it would be the ''Malleus Malefic&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;rum'' (the masculine form of the Latin noun ''maleficus'' or ''malefica,'' 'witch'). In Latin, the feminine ''maleficarum'' would only be used for women, while the masculine ''maleficorum'' could be used for men alone or for both sexes if together.{{sfnp|Maxwell-Stewart|2001|p=30}} The ''Malleus Maleficarum'' accuses male and female witches of [[infanticide]], [[cannibalism]] and casting evil spells to harm their enemies as well as having the power to [[Koro (medicine)#U.S. and Europe|steal a man's penis]]. It goes on to give accounts of witches committing these crimes.

Arguments favoring [[Misogyny|discrimination against women]] are explicit in the handbook. Those arguments are not novel but constitute a selection from the long tradition of Western [[misogynist]] writings. However, according to Brauner, they are combined to produce new meanings and result in a comprehensive theory. It mixes elements borrowed from ''[[Formicarius]]'' (1435), ''[[Preceptorium divinae legis]]'' (1475) and ''[[Lectiones super ecclesiastes]]'' (1380).{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|p=38}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Kramer and Sprenger develop a powerful gender-specific theory of witchcraft based on a hierarchical and dualistic view of the world. Everything exists in pairs of opposites: God and Satan, Mary and Eve, and men (or virgins) and women. Each positive principle in a pair is delineated by its negative pole. Perfection is defined not as the integration or preservation of opposites, but rather as the extermination of the negative element in a polar pair. Because women are the negative counterpart to men, they corrupt male perfection through witchcraft and must be destroyed.{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|p=38}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although authors give many examples of male witchery in the second part of the handbook, those witchcraft trials that are independently confirmed and that were led by Kramer himself are related to persecution of women almost exclusively. They took place in Ravensburg near Constance (1484) and Innsbruck (since 1485).{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|p=45}}{{sfnb|Burns|2003|p=143|ps=: "there were only 2 men among 50 accused" (Innsbruck)}} According to Brauner, trial records confirm that Kramer believed that women are by nature corrupt and evil. His position was in harmony with the scholastic theory at the time.{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|p=47}} In contrast, Sprenger never conducted a witch trial{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|p=44}} though he was consulted in a few cases.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=3}} Kramer and Sprenger use a metaphor of a world turned upside down by women of which concubines are the most wicked, followed by midwives and then by wives who dominate their husbands. Authors warn of imminent arrival of the apocalypse foretold in the Bible and that men risk bewitchment that leads to impotence and sensation of castration.{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|pp=42–43}} Brauner explains authors' prescription on how a woman can avoid becoming a witch: &lt;blockquote&gt;According to the ''Malleus'', the only way a woman can avoid succumbing to her passions – and becoming a witch – is to embrace a life of devout chastity in a religious retreat. But the monastic life is reserved to the spiritually gifted few. Therefore, most women are doomed to become witches, who cannot be redeemed; and the only recourse open to the authorities is to ferret out and exterminate all witches.{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|p=41}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Elaborated concept of witchcraft === &lt;!-- this is a scientific term Mackay, 2009 --&gt;
[[File:Museo del Prado - Goya - Caprichos - No. 43 - El sueño de la razon produce monstruos.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'', c. 1797, 21.5 cm × 15 cm.]]

[[Strixology]] in the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' is characterized by a very specific conception of what a witch is, one that differs dramatically from earlier times. The word used, malefica, carries an explicit condemnation absent in other words referring to women with supernatural powers. The conception of witches and of magic by extension is one of evil. It differs from earlier conceptions of witchcraft that were much more generalized. This is the point in history where "witchcraft constituted an independent antireligion". The witch lost her powerful position vis-a-vis the deities; the ability to force the deities comply with her wishes was replaced by a total subordination to the devil. In short, the witch became Satan's puppet."{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} This conception of witches was "part of a conception of magic that is termed by scholars as 'Satanism' or 'diabolism'". In this conception, a witch was a member of "a malevolent society presided over by Satan himself and dedicated to the infliction of malevolent acts of sorcery (''maleficia'') on others."{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p = 19}}

According to Mackay, this concept of sorcery is characterized by the conviction that those guilty engage in six activities:{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p = 19}} &lt;blockquote&gt;
# A pact entered into with the Devil (and concomitant apostasy from Christianity),

[[File:Lilith (John Collier painting).jpg|thumb|upright|The female demon [[Lilith]] under the appearance of a snake cavorting with herself as personified within the [[Garden of Eden]], by [[John Collier (Pre-Raphaelite painter)|John Collier]], 1892]]

In the ''Malleus'' demons are the ones who tempt humans to sorcery and are the main figures in the witches' vows. They interact with witches, usually sexually. The book claims that it is normal for all witches "to perform filthy carnal acts with demons."{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=125}} This is a major part of human-demon interaction and demons do it "not for the sake of pleasure, but for the sake of corrupting."{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=283}} It is worth noting that not all demons do such things. The book claims that "the nobility of their nature causes certain demons to balk at committing certain actions and filthy deeds."{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=309}} Though the work never gives a list of names or types of demons, like some demonological texts or spellbooks of the era, such as the ''[[Liber Juratus]]'', it does indicate different types of demons. For example, it devotes large sections to [[incubus|incubi]] and [[succubus|succubi]] and questions regarding their roles in pregnancies, the submission of witches to incubi, and protections against them.

==Controversies==
===Approbation and authorship===
Joseph Hansen, a historian who was appalled by the witch-craze and those who carried it out, proposed that coauthorship by Sprenger was a falsehood presented by Institoris (Kramer) and that approbation is ''partially'' a forgery.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=5}} This had never been proposed before until Joseph Hansen in the nineteenth century.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=5}}

Christopher Mackay, author of the modern academic translation of the ''Malleus'' into English offers rebuttals to arguments of proponents of this theory{{sfnp|Mackay|2006|p=128}}{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=5}} and in an interview gives an accessible summary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument was made in the nineteenth century by a scholar hostile to what the Malleus stood for that the approbation was a forgery by Institoris and that Sprenger had nothing to do with the composition. The evidence for this is in my view very tenuous (and the main argument is clearly invalid). Nonetheless, once the argument was put forward, it took on a life of its own, and people continue to advance arguments in favor of the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this argument was vitiated from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Christopher Mackay by John W. Morehead, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition, Mackay points out that allegations raised in support of this theory that supposedly two of the signatories had not in fact signed the approbation are unsubstantiated.{{sfnp|Mackay|2009|p=5}}

A similar response is offered by the author of the first translation of the ''Malleus'' into English [[Montague Summers]]. In his introduction, he ignores completely the theory that joint authorship or approbation could be a mystification. Nonetheless, he mentions briefly that it was questioned whether Kramer or Sprenger contributed more to the work. He comments that "in the case of such a close collaboration any such inquiry seems singularly superfluous and nugatory".{{efn|According to Summers, "It has been asked whether Kramer or Sprenger was principally responsible for the ''Malleus'', but in the case of so close a collaboration any such inquiry seems singularly superfluous and nugatory."{{sfnb|Summers|2012|p=viii|loc=Introduction to 1948 edition}}}}

Broedel, a historian who writes that it is likely that Sprenger's contribution was minimal, nonetheless says that "Sprenger certainly wrote the [[#apologia|''Apologia auctoris'']] which prefaces the ''Malleus'' and agreed to be a coauthor.{{sfnb|Broedel|2003|p=18}}

''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and ''The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca'' ignore completely Hansen's theory and list Sprenger and Kramer as co-authors.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;''[[#Britannica|Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnb|Guiley|2008|pp=223–224}}

Wolfgang Behringer argues that Sprenger's name was only added as an author beginning in 1519, thirty-three years after the book was first published and decades after Sprenger's own death.&lt;ref name="Behringer, Wolfgang p. 2"/&gt;  One of Sprenger's friends who was still alive denounced the addition of Sprenger's name as a forgery, stating that Sprenger had nothing to do with the book.&lt;ref name="Klose, Hans-Christian pp. 197"&gt;Klose, Hans-Christian. ''Die angebliche Mitarbeit des Dominikaners Jakob Sprenger am Hexenhammer, nach einem alten Abdinghofer Brief''. pp. 197–205 in ''Paderbornensis Ecclesia. Beiträge zur Geschichte des Erzbistums Paderborn''. Festschrift für Lorenz Kardinal Jäger zum 80. Geburtstag. Edited by Paul-Werner Scheele.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians have also pointed out that Sprenger's actual views in his confirmed writings are often the opposite of the views in the ''Malleus'', and Sprenger was unlikely to have been a colleague of Kramer since Sprenger in fact banned Kramer from preaching and entering Dominican convents within his jurisdiction, and spoke out against him on many occasions.&lt;ref name="Behringer, Wolfgang p. 3"&gt;Behringer, Wolfgang. ''Malleus Maleficarum'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged approval from the theologians at Cologne, which Kramer included in the ''Malleus'' with a list of names of theologians who he claimed approved the book, has also been questioned by many historians, since In 1490 the clergy at Cologne condemned the book and at least two of the clergy listed by Kramer, Thomas de Scotia and Johann von Wörde, publicly denied having approved the ''Malleus''.&lt;ref name="Jolly, Raudvere page 241"&gt;Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), ''Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: The Middle Ages'', page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Behringer, Wolfgang. ''Malleus Maleficarum'' p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacob Sprenger]]'s name was added as an author beginning in 1519, 33 years after the book's first publication and 24 years after Sprenger's death.&lt;ref name="Behringer, Wolfgang p. 2"/&gt;

Jenny Gibbons, a Neo-Pagan and a historian, writes:  "Actually the Inquisition immediately rejected the legal procedures Kramer recommended and censured the inquisitor himself just a few years after the ''Malleus'' was published. Secular courts, not inquisitorial ones, resorted to the ''Malleus''".&lt;ref name="Gibbons, Jenny pp 2 - 16"/&gt;

The preface also includes an allegedly unanimous [[approbation]] from the [[University of Cologne]]'s Faculty of Theology.  Nevertheless, many historians have argued that it is well established by sources outside the ''Malleus'' that the university's theology faculty condemned the book for unethical procedures and for contradicting Catholic theology on a number of important points : "just for good measure Institoris forged a document granting their apparently unanimous approbation." &lt;ref name="Jolly, Karen p. 115"/&gt;

==Authors' whereabouts and circumstances==
===Preceding publication===
&lt;!-- todo: properly describe trials in Innsbruck and Ravensburg near Constance --Asterixf2 --&gt;
In 1484 [[Heinrich Kramer]] had made one of the first attempts at prosecuting alleged witches in the [[History of Tyrol|Tyrol]] region. It was not a success and he was asked to leave the city of Innsbruck. According to [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]], writing the book was Kramer's act of self-justification and revenge. Ankarloo and Clark claim that Kramer's purpose in writing the book was to explain his own views on witchcraft, systematically refute arguments claiming that witchcraft does not exist, discredit those who expressed skepticism about its reality, claim that those who practiced witchcraft were more often women than men, and to convince [[magistrate]]s to use Kramer's recommended procedures for finding and convicting witches.{{sfnp|Ankarloo|Clark|2002|p=240}}

Kramer wrote the ''Malleus'' following his expulsion from [[Innsbruck]] by the local bishop, due to charges of illegal behavior against Kramer himself, and because of Kramer's obsession with the sexual habits of one of the accused, Helena Scheuberin, which led the other tribunal members to suspend the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, William. ''Witch Hunts in Europe and America: An Encyclopedia'', pp. 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer received a [[papal bull]], ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', in 1484. It directed [[Prince-Bishopric of Strasbourg|Bishop of Strasburg]] (then [[Albert of Palatinate-Mosbach]]) to accept the authority of [[Heinrich Kramer]] as an Inquisitor, although the motivation of the papal bull was likely political.&lt;ref&gt;Darst, 1979, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Malleus Maleficarum'' was finished in 1486 and the papal bull was included as part of its preface, implying papal approval for the work.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 229–231&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' received an official condemnation by the Church three years later, and Kramer's claims of approval are seen by modern scholars as misleading.{{efn|See ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]''.}}{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Post-publication===
Kramer was intensely writing and preaching until his death in [[Bohemia]] in 1505.{{sfnb|Summers|2012|pp=viii–ix|loc=Introduction to 1948 edition}} He was asked by [[Nuremberg]] council to provide expert consultation on the procedure of witch trial in 1491.{{sfnp|Burns|2003|p=160'}} His prestige was not fading. In 1495 he was summoned by the [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General of the Order]], [[Gioacchino Torriani|Joaquin de Torres]], [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]] to [[Venice]] and gave very popular public lectures and disputations. They were worthy of presence and patronage of [[Patriarch of Venice]]. He also wrote treatises ''Several Discourses and Various Sermons upon the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist'' (Nuremberg, 1496); ''A Tract Confuting the Errors of Master Antonio degli Roselli'' (Venice, 1499); followed by ''The Shield of Defence of the Holy Roman Church Against the Picards and Waldenses'' which were quoted by many authors. He was appointed as [[papal nuncio]] and his assignment as inquisitor was changed to [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in 1500.{{sfnb|Summers|2012|pp=viii–ix|loc=Introduction to 1948 edition}}

Sprenger continued his work as Inquisitor Extraordinary for the Provinces of [[Mainz]], [[Trier|Trèves]] and [[Cologne]]. Later, he was elected [[Provincial Superior]] of the whole German Province (in 1488). He had enormous responsibilities. He received a letter from [[Pope Alexander VI]] praising his enthusiasm and energy in 1495 and died in the same year.{{sfnb|Summers|2012|p=ix'|loc=Introduction to 1948 edition}}

Summers observes that 17th century "[[Dominican Order|Dominican]] chroniclers, such as [[Jacques Quétif|Quétif]] and [[Jacques Échard|Échard]], number Kramer and Sprenger among the glories and heroes of their [[Order of Preachers|Order]]".{{sfnp|Summers|2012|p=ix|loc=Introduction to 1948 edition|ps=: "The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] chroniclers, such as [[Jacques Quétif|Quétif]] and [[Jacques Échard|Échard]], number Kramer and Sprenger among the glories and heroes of their [[Order of Preachers|Order]]"}}

== Popularity and influence ==
Gender-specific theory developed in the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' laid the foundations for widespread consensus in early modern Germany on the evil nature of women as witches.{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|p=49}} Later works on witchcraft have not agreed entirely with the ''Malleus'' but none of them challenged the view that women were more inclined to be witches than men.{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|p=48}} It was perceived as intuitive and all-accepted so that very few authors saw the need to explain why women are witches. Those who did, attributed female witchery to the weakness of body and mind (the old medieval explanation) and a few to female sexuality.{{sfnp|Brauner|2001|p=48}}

Some authors argue that the book's publication was not as influential as earlier authors believed.&lt;ref&gt;"The effect that the book had on witch-hunting is difficult to determine. It did not open the door 'to almost indiscriminate prosecutions' or even bring about an immediate increase in the number of trials. In fact its publication in Italy was followed by a noticeable reduction in witchcraft cases", Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt In Early Modern Europe'', p. 55 (2nd edition 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnb|Jolly|Peters|Raudvere|2001|p=241|ps=: "Nor was the ''Malleus'' immediately regarded as a definitive work. Its appearance triggered no prosecutions in areas where there had been none earlier, and in some cases its claims encountered substantial scepticism (for Italy, Paton 1992: 264–306). In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the ''Malleus'' said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence. Long before then, however, the ''Malleus'' was the subject of considerable debate among both clerics and lay thinkers (Caro Baroja 1990: 19–43). Indeed, the chief function of the work was to serve as a centerpiece in demonological theory whose arguments might be expanded and added to by such works as that of Grillandus, as well as a focus for arguments and debates concerning particular points it made, some of the latter reflecting traditional rivalry between religious orders and ecclesiastical schools of theology. For example, an attack on some of the central arguments of the ''Malleus'' was made by the Francisan Samuel de Cassini in 1505 and answered in favour of the ''Malleus'' by the Dominican Vincente Dodo in 1507 (Max 1990: 55–62; Lea 1957: 366–8; Hansen 1901: 262–84; ''Bibliotheca Lamiarum'' 1994: 114–15; Clark 1997: 486–7, 538). A similar criticism by Gianfrancesco Ponzinibio of Florence in 1520 was countered by the support of the ''Malleus'' position by the Dominican Bartolommeo de Spina in 1523 (Caro Boja 1990: 32; Max 1993: 55–62; Lea 1957: 385–95; Hansen 1901: 326–7; ''Bibliotheca Lamiarum'' 1994: 120–2). The cautionary advice of the Spanish Inquisition in 1538 was merely another instance of the kinds of interests, and objections, that ''Malleus'' raised."}}{{refn|"In its own day it was never accorded the unquestioned authority that modern scholars have sometimes given it. Theologians and jurists respected it as one among many informative books; its particular savage misogyny and its obsession with impotence were never fully accepted", Monter, ''The Sociology of Jura Witchcraft'', in ''The Witchcraft Reader'', p. 116 (2002)}} According to MacCulloch, the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' was one of several key factors contributing to the witch craze, along with popular [[superstition]], and tensions created by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref name="reform"/&gt; However, according to ''Encyclopædia Britannica'':{{pull quote|The ''Malleus'' went through 28 editions between 1486 and 1600 and was accepted by Roman Catholics and Protestants alike as an authoritative source of information concerning Satanism and as a guide to Christian defense [against acts of Satan].|author=[[#Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}

=== Factors stimulating widespread use ===
Between 1487 and 1520, twenty editions of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' were published, and another sixteen between 1574 and 1669.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 79&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Malleus Maleficarum'' was able to spread throughout Europe rapidly in the late 15th and at the beginning of the 16th century due to the innovation of the [[printing press]] in the middle of the 15th century by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]. The invention of printing some thirty years before the first publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' instigated the fervor of witch hunting, and, in the words of Russell, "the swift propagation of the witch hysteria by the press was the first evidence that Gutenberg had not liberated man from [[original sin]]."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 15th century was also a period of religious turmoil. The ''Malleus Maleficarum'' and the witch craze that ensued took advantage of the increasing intolerance of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] in Europe, where the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and Catholic camps respectively, pitted against one another, each zealously strove to maintain what they each deemed to be the purity of faith.
The Catholic Counter-Reformation would eventually even out this religious turmoil, but until then both the Catholics and Protestants constantly battled for what they believed was right. {{sfnp|Henningsen|1980|p=15}} &lt;!-- contra: Both Protestants and Catholics were involved in the prosecutions, as the theology of the Protestant Reformers on the Devil and witchcraft was virtually indistinguishable from that of the Catholics. More differences existed among Protestants and among Catholics than between the two religious groups, and regions in which Protestant-Catholic tensions were high did not produce significantly more trials than other regions. https://www.britannica.com/topic/witchcraft#ref414829 --&gt;

== Reception ==
{{See also|Strixology|#Approbation}}
As the authors of the first significant book on witchcraft that was widely available, Institoris and Sprenger almost immediately started to be treated as "accepted authorities on the subject" by other demonologists.{{efn|According to Broedel{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=7`|ps=: "The simple presence of a comprehensive, authoritative guidebook created a certain uniformity of discourse in subsequent witchcraft debate. Almost immediately, authors of witch-treatises began to refer to Institoris and Sprenger as accepted authorities on the subject."}}}} By 1505 treatise was abundant in Germany, but also widespread across other European libraries and present in many judicial collections.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=7|ps=: "By the time of Institoris’ death around 1505, his work could be found in many libraries and judicial reference collections throughout Europe, although especially in Germany."}} The ''Malleus Maleficarum'' was a cornerstone of theological discourse in the domain of demonology. Its various points and arguments were debated, what in part was fueled by rivalry between schools of theology.{{sfnp|Jolly|Peters|Raudvere|p. 241|ps=: "Indeed, the chief function of the work was to serve as a centerpiece in demonological theory whose arguments might be expanded and added to by such works as that of Grillandus, as well as a focus for arguments and debates concerning particular points it made, some of the latter reflecting traditional rivalry between religious orders and ecclesiastical schools of theology."}} 
[[File:Démonomanie des sorciers Bodin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title page of ''[[On the Demonomania of Sorcerers]]'' (1580)]]
[[Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola|Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola]] extensively complimented authors and compared them to [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Gregory the Great]] as equal authorities.{{efn|According to Broedel{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=7``}}}} The book was also highly praised by a Dominican inquisitor [[Sylvester Prieras]] who perceived it as an ultimate authority.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=7``}} One of the critics was [[franciscan]] [[Samuel de Cassini]] who attacked some of the propositions (1505). His arguments were challenged by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Vincente Dodo]] two years later who argued in favor of the ''Malleus''.{{sfnp|Jolly|Peters|Raudvere|p. 241`}} Another example of such exchange is the one between [[Gianfrancesco Ponzinibio]] (1520) who was strongly emphasizing weaknesses of the manual. Three years later, counterarguments to his position and in support of the ''Malleus'' were provided by Dominican inquisitor [[Bartolommeo Spina|Bartolommeo de Spina]].{{sfnp|Jolly|Peters|Raudvere|p. 241`}} According to Jolly, when in 1538 the [[Spanish Inquisition]] advised not to treat the ''Malleus'' as an ultimate authority, it was not a rejection but merely a part of the naturally ongoing debate and cautionary advice.{{sfnp|Jolly|Peters|Raudvere|p. 241``|ps=: "In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the ''Malleus'' said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence. Long before then, however, the ''Malleus'' was the subject of considerable debate among both clerics and lay thinkers [... description of discourse]. The cautionary advice of the Spanish Inquisition in 1538 was merely another instance of the kinds of interests, and objections, that the ''Malleus'' raised."}}{{efn|{{harvp|Pavlac|2009|p=150}}: "The Spanish Inquisition is notorious as one of the most cruel efforts ever carried out by Christians. It is also often misunderstood. The Spanish Inquisition was unique to Spain. It was not medieval; indeed, it had nothing to do with the Middle Ages but rather lasted through much of the early modern period. Although it did carry out much of the witch-hunting, its main effort was to guarantee that every subject in the kingdom was a faithful Roman Catholic. The Spanish Inquisition acted on behalf of the rulers in Spain, not the pope in Rome."}}

A second wave of heated debate started in the latter half of the sixteenth century. It was accompanied by a sharp increase in the popularity of the treatise. This time, the essential question was to what extent witches are real, not that they are. In this context, the first attack directly against the ''Malleus'' was conducted by [[Johann Weyer]] (''[[On the Tricks of Demons]]'', 1563) which met with strong response by royal attorney [[Jean Bodin]] (''[[On the Demonomania of Sorcerers]]'', 1580) in support of the treatise.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=8}}{{sfnp|Pavlac|2009|p=60|ps=: for translation of Weyer work's title to English}}{{sfnp|Pavlac|2009|p=91|ps= :for translation of Bodin work's title to English, his profile and a note}}{{efn|{{harvp|Pavlac|2009|p=91}}: "Bodin feared that women were especially vulnerable to Satan’s temptations. Witches were such a danger that the concept of a ''crimen exceptum'' applied, namely the idea that guilt could be established with very limited evidence, including the refusal to confess under torture. Witches should be killed in particularly long and painful ways, such as roasted over a slow smoky fire of green wood, because evil people needed longer to be killed."}}

About a century after its first publication, the ''Malleus'' was an old classic. By the end of the sixteenth century, new developments in theology such as ''[[Daemonolatreiae libri tres|Demonolatry]]'' (1595) by witch-hunter [[Nicholas Rémy]] and ''[[Martin Delrio#Magical Investigations|Magical Investigations]]'' (1599) by [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Martin Delrio|Martin del Rio]] began to replace the aged ''Malleus'' as a primary reference.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=8}}{{sfnb|Burns|2003|p=160|ps=: "In the Catholic world, the works of Nicholas Remy and Martin del Rio replaced the Malleus as a theoretical authority in the late sixteenth century. Its ubiquity, however, must have made it an important contributor to the ideas that many educated people held of witches and the proper way to deal with them.}} However, as early as in 1580s, multi-volume selections of books on demonology began to appear. Those voluminous collections contained books from various periods but they all started with epoch-making{{efn|{{harvnb|Mackay|2009|p=33}}: "The twelve reprintings of the ''Malleus'' that were undertaken in Germany and France in the years 1486–1519 attest to a regular demand for the work, and while, in the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it was the works of other authors (e.g. Jean Bodin and Martin del Rio) that whipped up the frenzy for witch hunting, those works were effective only because of the shift in paradigm that the ''Malleus'' had brought about in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries." See also: [[paradigm shift]]}} The ''Malleus Maleficarum''. Broedel concludes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Thus for generations of scholars, investigations into the problem of witchcraft began quite literally with Institoris and Sprenger’s famous text, and appropriately too, since the very notion of “witchcraft” owed so much to their fertile imaginations.{{sfnp|Broedel|2003|p=8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Mid-Continent Public Library''', officially known as '''Consolidated Library District #3''',  is a consolidated [[public library]] system serving [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]], [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte]], and [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson]] Counties in [[Missouri]], with headquarters in [[Independence, Missouri]].

Mid-Continent Public Library is the largest public library system in the U.S. state of Missouri by number of volumes and size of budget. Its collection ranks among the 100 largest libraries in America, which includes university, public, and private collections,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/professionalresources/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm American Library Association: ''ALA Fact Sheet No. 22 - Top 100 Libraries'']&lt;/ref&gt; and is among the nation's 20 largest public library systems.&lt;ref name=IMLS&gt;{{cite news|last=Dittmer|first=Ryne|title=Mid-Continent receives IMLS National Medal|newspaper=Gladstone Dispatch|date=22 May 2014|page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LibTrib&gt;{{cite web|last=Dittmer|first=Ryne|title=Mid-Continent receives IMLS National Medal|url=http://www.libertytribune.com/news/article_c10cdec0-5f23-5347-a4d8-afbdba7b3e02.html|work=Liberty Tribune|publisher=News-Press &amp; Gazette Company|accessdate=23 May 2014|date=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: The [[Kansas City Public Library]] is a separate library system with facilities primarily serving [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in Jackson County, Missouri.)

On May 8, 2014, the Mid-Continent Public Library received the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140514103032/http://www.imls.gov/news/2014_medals_midcontinent_public_library.aspx National Medal for Museum and Library Service] during a ceremony at the [[White House]] in [[Washington D.C.]]&lt;ref name=IMLS /&gt; The medal is the country's highest honor awarded by the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]].&lt;ref name=IMLS /&gt;&lt;ref name=LibTrib /&gt;

==Background==
Mid-Continent Public Library's roots go back to the Independence Public Library, formed by the Independence Library Association in 1892 and the creation of the Citizens Improvement Association Library (later the Carnegie Library) in Excelsior Springs in the 1890s.

After [[World War II]], Clay, Platte and Jackson counties formed countywide library systems. They began collaborating in the early 1960s, and on November 10, 1965 Clay and Jackson formed the Mid-Continent Public Library Service as a joint administrative body, though each library retained separate governing boards and budgets. 

Even though they remained separate, their combined resources allowed them to merge administrative costs. Gaining the name Mid-Continent Public Library in 1968, the library system was well on its way to achieving its goal. Separating library services from school districts enabled them to expand library services to rural areas, which presently did not have services. 

Platte County joined the group in 1968. In 1978, seven years after the state legislature passed a law allowing for consolidated multi-county library systems, the Clay and Jackson libraries officially merged to form Consolidated Library District No. 3. Platte County joined a year later.

A notable librarian, James A. Leathers, was influential in the creation of a regional library system and became the first Director of Mid-Continent Public Library Service. His focus was to provide education, information, and recreation to the public. His desire was for the library to serve all individuals regardless of age, and he aimed to provide services for the young as well as the elderly. 

The library system is overseen by a Library Board of twelve members, four appointed by County Commissioners in each of the service region's three counties. It currently has 31 branches in the [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]] of Missouri located in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Independence, [[Liberty, Missouri|Liberty]], [[Gladstone, Missouri|Gladstone]], [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|Lee’s Summit]], [[Grandview, Missouri|Grandview]], [[Blue Springs, Missouri|Blue Springs]], [[Grain Valley, Missouri|Grain Valley]], and other cities. It also hosts two installations at community centers in partnership with the Kansas City Parks and Recreation Department that provide automated library services and public Internet access.

In 1994, the Mid-Continent Public Library began to see advances in technology. It made improvement with circulation, intra-library loan, and online catalogs. In 1995, dial-up Internet access was provided for catalog use. In 1996, the full access to Internet was provided. In 2001, WorldCat was added to the online databases. 

In [[fiscal year|fiscal]] 2008-2009, the collection held 3,544,072 items. Total annual [[library circulation|circulation]] was 9,183,005 items, and it filled 1,773,586 intra- and [[interlibrary loan]]s. Branch libraries served 4,673,737 visitors. Total attendance at live programming events for adults and families and for children was 318,639 patrons. The system has 466,344 registered borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mymcpl.org/_uploaded_resources/2008-2009.pdf ''Mid-Continent Public Library Annual Report, 2008-2009''], By the Numbers, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual circulation for the year exceeded one-half million items for each of the Mid-Continent Library’s five busiest branches: Liberty, Lee’s Summit, Colbern Road, North Independence, and Blue Springs South.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report 2008-2009, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The system has one of the nation’s largest Summer Reading Programs, which was completed by 106,846 patrons in fiscal 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report 2008-2009, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for its array of services, including more than 250 online learning tools and research databases with remote access, downloadable [[audiobook]]s, and Library-by-Mail for homebound patrons. Library branches offer self-checkout machines and self-service hold pick-ups, and [[LCD]] flat-panel monitors on every on-site public access computer. Most branches also offer free wi-fi access. The library system collaborates and partners with local [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundations]].

'''Mindat.org''' is a non-commercial online [[mineralogy|mineralogical]] database, claiming to be the largest mineral database and mineralogical reference website on the internet. It is used by professional mineralogists and amateur mineral collectors alike.

It contains a significant [[database]] of minerals, localities and mineral photographs, and is updated constantly by registered users adding and editing entries.

{{As of|2016}}, it included:

*45,289 mineral names (this includes mineral varieties, [[synonym]]s and discredited names), of which 5,091 are [[mineral]]s or [[mineraloid]]s recognized by the [[International Mineralogical Association]].
*261,955 mineral localities worldwide, with information on 903,204 mineral occurrences within these sites.
*Over 647,000 photos of minerals have been uploaded, arranged into galleries from collectors and institutions worldwide who wish to share their mineral collections online.
*48,657 users registered to upload photos and/or edit data.

== History of Mindat.org ==

Mindat was started in 1993 as a personal database project by Jolyon Ralph. He then developed further versions as a [[Microsoft Windows]] application before launching a community-editable database web site in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manual.mindat.org/index.php/History_of_Mindat History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mindat.org is now part of the Hudson Institute of Mineralogy, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit educational foundation incorporated in the state of New York.

Jolyon Ralph was awarded the [[Mineralogical Society of America]]'s Distinguished public service medal in 2011 for his work on Mindat.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minsocam.org/msa/awards/public_service.html Mineralogical Society of America]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The idea for the book came up when Myhrvold acquired a temperature-controlled water bath for [[sous vide]] cooking in 2003. He tried to find information about this new cooking technique, which had been invented in the 1960s&lt;ref name="MC1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Myhrvold |first1= Nathan |authorlink1= Nathan Myhrvold|last2= Young|first2= Chris|last3= Bilet|first3= Maxime|title= Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking|url= http://modernistcuisine.com|accessdate= 20 May 2011|year= 2011|publisher= The Cooking Lab|location= Bellevue, Washington|isbn= 978-0-9827610-0-7|pages= 1·40–42|chapter= Chapter 1: History}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was in use at many restaurants by 2003. He could find only a few articles and one book (in Spanish) on sous vide, however. He posted messages on eGullet, a high-end cooking forum, asking for recipes or sources, but found that the process was poorly understood.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

Myhrvold has attended Ecole de Cuisine la Varenne, a cooking school in Burgundy, France&lt;ref name="Hallock"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-modernist-cuisine-20100923,0,7059582.story?track=rss|title=The extremist: Nathan Myhrvold and 'Modernist Cuisine'|last=Hallock|first=Betty|date=September 23, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also cooked part-time at Rover's, a French restaurant in Seattle owned by [[Thierry Rautureau]]. He is also a scientist, having earned advanced degrees in geophysics, space physics, and theoretical and mathematical physics, done post-doctoral research with [[Stephen Hawking]] at Cambridge University, and worked for many years as the chief technology officer and chief strategist of [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name="IV"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.intellectualventures.com/WhoWeAre/OurTeam/Bio/Nathan_Myhrvold.aspx|title= Bio Detail|publisher= IntellectualVentures.com|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on his food and science skills, Myhrvold performed experiments and calculations to generate tables of times and temperatures for cooking various foods sous vide. When he posted these tables to eGullet, answering the question that he himself had asked in that forum about one year earlier, someone suggested that he should write a book. In 2006 he began to do so, but soon realized that he could not write the book he wanted himself, and that it would require a team using proper equipment.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

Myhrvold started buying equipment for the research kitchen in the [[Intellectual Ventures]] lab. Much of the equipment was standard cooking equipment, but it also included items such as rotor-stator [[homogenizer]]s, ultrahigh-pressure homogenizers, [[Freeze-drying|freeze-dryers]], a 50,000 [[Gravitational constant|G]] [[centrifuge]],&lt;ref name="sav"/&gt; [[ultrasonic bath]]s, and rotary evaporators.&lt;ref name="popsci"&gt;{{cite web|title= A Tour of The Modernist Cuisine Kitchen Laboratory|last= Adams|first= Paul|url= http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-02/tour-modernist-cuisine-kitchen-laboratory|publisher= Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory already included other high-tech and industrial equipment,&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite web|title= Billionaire Nathan Myhrvold's $625 Cookbook|last=Greenfeld|first=Karl Taro|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/content/10_47/b4204089237326.htm|publisher=Bloomberg BusinessWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 100-ton [[hydraulic press]],&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt; a large water-jet cutter, an [[electrical discharge machining|electrical discharge machine]], and automated [[milling machine]]s.

Myhrvold and Wayt Gibbs, an executive editor at Intellectual Ventures who served as the editor-in-chief and project manager for the book, also hired writers and editors, research assistants, photo editors, and an art director. First hired was Chris Young, who had just stopped his work of leading the development kitchen in [[Heston Blumenthal]]'s restaurant [[The Fat Duck]] in England. Young recruited Maxime Bilet, also from The Fat Duck, who led the team of research chefs that developed and tested the 1,522 recipes in the book.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;  Photographer Ryan Matthew Smith joined the team after answering an advert on [[Craigslist]] seeking a photo editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Zavos |url=http://www.featureshoot.com/2010/11/qa-ryan-matthew-smith-seattle/ |title=Ryan Matthew Smith's photographs from 'Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking' |publisher=Feature Shoot |date=2010-11-29 |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book team ultimately grew to include more than 50 staff and freelance contributors plus 14 outside experts who reviewed various chapters of the book.&lt;ref name="MC2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Myhrvold |first1= Nathan |authorlink1= Nathan Myhrvold|last2= Young|first2= Chris|last3= Bilet|first3= Maxime|title= Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking|year= 2011|publisher= The Cooking Lab|location= Bellevue, Washington|isbn= 978-0-9827610-0-7|pages= 5·XLVI-LII|chapter= The ''Modernist Cuisine'' Team}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the high point of the project, 36 researchers, chefs, and editors were working simultaneously on the book.&lt;ref name=Wall&gt;{{cite news|title=The Game-Changing Cookbook|last= McLaughlin|first= Katy|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704709304576124353978673570|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the book was planned to be 150 pages on cooking sous vide in water baths and [[combi steamer|combi ovens]], along with some scientific fundamentals relevant to those techniques.&lt;ref name="Hallock"/&gt; It gradually grew in scope, and by late 2009 the book plan had expanded to 1,500 pages,&lt;ref name="Hallock"/&gt; before finally being printed at 2,438 pages.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt; The book cost more than {{Currency|1000000|US}} to produce the first printing of 6,000 copies, which sold out shortly after the publication date in March 2011.&lt;ref name="bloom"/&gt; In April 2011, The Cooking Lab ordered a second printing of 25,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite news|title= Microsoft Guru Myhrvold Cooks Burger, Sonic Fries in $625 Book|last= Vines|first= Richard|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-22/microsoft-tech-guru-cooks-ultimate-burger-ultrasonic-fries-in-625-book.html|publisher= Bloomberg|date=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cooking Lab published a less expensive, two-volume sequel, titled ''Modernist Cuisine at Home'', coauthored by Myhrvold and Bilet, in October 2012.&lt;ref name="Eater2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eater.com/archives/2012/10/25/modernist-cuisine-at-home-preview.php|title= Here's a Massive Preview of 'Modernist Cuisine at Home'|publisher=Eater.com|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Photography of Modernist Cuisine'', with 405 photographs and background details for each, including 127 from the 6-volume set and unpublished ones, was published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Myhrvold |first1= Nathan |authorlink1= Nathan Myhrvold|title= The Photography of Modernist Cuisine|url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=wikipedia&amp;q=isbn%3A9780982761021|accessdate= 26 June 2016|year= 2013|publisher= The Cooking Lab|location= Bellevue, Washington|isbn= 978-0-9827610-2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
''Modernist Cuisine'' consists of five major volumes plus a spiral-bound kitchen manual, which reprints recipes and reference tables from the major volumes on water-resistant paper for use while cooking.

# History and Fundamentals, includes a chapter that chronicles the intellectual history of culinary movements, culminating with a detailed history of the Modernist movement as it appeared in cooking beginning in the 1980s. Also in Volume 1 are chapters on [[microbiology]], [[food safety]], food and health, heat and energy, and the physics of food and water.
# Techniques and Equipment, includes a chapter on the science and techniques of traditional cooking, which it explains by making extensive use of illustrations and photography. This volume also contains chapters on modern cooking approaches, including baking in [[combi steamer|combi ovens]] and water-vapor ovens, cooking [[sous-vide]], and cooking with a wide range of advanced equipment and ingredients, from homogenizers and vacuum pumps to [[liquid nitrogen]] and [[dry ice]].
# Animals and Plants, contains just two chapters: one on meat and another on plant foods. Scientific fundamentals about these ingredients are presented along with basic cooking techniques, advanced cooking techniques, and many recipes.
# Ingredients and Preparations, explains the use of ingredients more commonly associated with Modernist cooking, including  [[Thickening agent|thickening and gelling agent]]s, [[emulsion]]s, and [[foam]]s. This volume also contains chapters on [[wine]] and [[coffee]].
# Plated-Dish Recipes, consists primarily of 48 more complex recipes, each of which includes both a main dish and various accompaniments. The index to the set appears in this volume, along with two glossaries and a set of reference tables.

== Response ==
The critical reception was generally positive, citing detail on molecular gastronomic techniques and strong illustrations. However, the book was criticized by reviewers in the New York Times and the New Yorker for being dryly written and of limited utility to cooks without an expensive array of kitchen tools at their disposal.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruhlman|first=Michael|title=Book Review: Cook From It?

== Awards ==
In 2010 the book was inducted into the [[Gourmand Cookbook]] Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://old.cookbookfair.com/pdf/winners_cook_2010.pdf GOURMAND AWARDS 2010 COOKBOOKS]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the book won the [[James Beard Foundation]]'s "Cookbook of the Year" and "Cooking from a Professional Point of View" awards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesbeard.org/sites/default/files/static/additional/050712_JBF_WINNERS.pdf 2012 James Beard Foundation Book Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Association of Culinary Professionals]]' "Professional Kitchens", "Design" and "Visionary Achievement" awards.

==Exhibition==
The Photography of Modernist Cuisine: The Exhibition opened at [[Pacific Science Center]] on October 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Photography Of Modernist Cuisine: The Exhibition|url=http://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/Exhibits/ModernistCuisine|publisher=Pacific Science Center|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a photo exhibition that features food processes, large scale views, and modern cooking techniques.

'''Music Boulevard''', or '''musicblvd.com''', was a retail music information and sales website founded in 1995 by Telebase Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NOW+OPEN!+MUSIC+BOULEVARD+AT+WWW.MUSICBLVD.COM+THE+INTERNET'S+LARGEST...-a017182281 |title=Now Open!

''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''. 10 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally associated with Telebase Systems and its president Jim Coane, who was the [[CEO]] of the company, MusicBlvd went public in October 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=18717 |title=Silicon Investor Technology Stocks |publisher=Silicon Investor 1/2/1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1996-10-07/news/18022054_1_n2k-music-boulevard-tower-records |title=Facing The Music |publisher=[[NY Daily News]] | accessdate = October 8, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website offered more than 300,000 music titles and generated more than 80 million views in its first quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Row |first=Heath |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/36137/music-boulevard |title=Music Boulevard &amp;#124; Fast Company &amp;#124; Business + Innovation |publisher=Fast Company |date=1998-11-30 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1998 Music Boulevard was described by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' as one of the "big three" online music sellers alongside [[CDNow]] and [[Amazon.com]], and it was lauded for its extras including artist biographies, reviews, and feature stories from national music publications.&lt;ref&gt;Anderman, Joan. "Wired for sound shopping Web site music retailers offer guidance, discounts,and even some rarities". ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. 25 December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, the company was ranked 9th among all electronic commerce sites, with around 2.7 million visitors in the month of December alone.&lt;ref&gt;Wieffering, Eric. "Business: K-tel posts loss, but still avoids Nasdaq delisting; Retailer loses $6 million as 2nd-quarter sales drop 9.5 percent.." ''[[Star Tribune]]''. 11 February 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; MusicBlvd was also partnered with [[CBS Cable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Szadkowski | first = Joseph | title = Business Times: The Browser - TV broadcasters, advertisers chase consumers to Internet.| publisher = [[The Washington Times]]|date=23 February 1998| quote = CBS Cable, a programmer of country entertainment through the Nashville Network and Country Music Television cable networks, is moving into on-line country music sales through a strategic partnership with N2K's Music Boulevard (www.musicblvd.com).}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hotlinked to sponsors including ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=InformationToday&gt;{{Citation| title = Music Boulevard: Telebase launches WWW multimedia music service.| publisher = [[Information Today]]|date=1 September 1995| quote = At the trendy @ cafe in New York last month, Telebase systems launched what they're touting as "the ultimate record store, as close by as the nearest computer."

"In constructing Music Boulevard we have capitalized upon our 11 years of experience in the design and support of online services," said Jim Coane, CEO and president of Telebase Systems.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 1999 MusicBlvd was acquired by [[CDNow]],  at which time its website became defunct and customers were redirected to the CDNow website.&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/CDnow,-N2K-strike-first-note-after-merger/2100-1017_3-225985.html|title=CDnow, N2K strike first note after merger|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 18, 1999|work=E-Business|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/41660674.html?dids=41660674:41660674&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+12%2C+1999&amp;author=Bruce+Haring&amp;pub=USA+TODAY&amp;desc=Music+merger+seeks+harmonious+blend+of+sales%2C+sounds&amp;pqatl=google | first=Bruce | last=Haring | newspaper=USA Today | title=Music merger seeks harmonious blend of sales, sounds | date=May 12, 1999 | page=8D}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book ''The Cdnow Story: Rags to Riches on the Internet'', Music Boulevard was CDNow's "number one competitor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olim|first1=Jason|last2=Olim|first2=Matthew|last3=Kent|first3=Peter|title=The Cdnow Story: Rags to Riches on the Internet|year=1999|publisher=Top Floor Pub|isbn=978-0966103267|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''National Atlas of the United States''''' was an [[atlas]] published by the [[United States Department of the Interior]]. Older editions were printed, but the most recent edition was available online.  Since it is a publication of the [[United States government]], the atlas and the maps contained therein remain in the [[public domain]].

According to the U.S. National Atlas website, this atlas "provided a comprehensive, maplike view into the enormous wealth of geospatial and geostatistical data collected for the United States."&lt;ref name="natatlus"&gt;{{cite web |author=The National Atlas of the United States of America |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/about.html |title=Learn about the National Atlas |publisher=Nationalatlas.gov |date=2013-01-14 |accessdate=2013-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526151708/http://nationalatlas.gov/about.html |archivedate=2013-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was also to increase "geographic knowledge and understanding and to foster national self-awareness."&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; Information used to develop the ''National Atlas of the United States'' was also used in conjunction with Canadian and Mexican information to produce continental-scale tools such as the ''[[North American Environmental Atlas]]''.

The online ''National Atlas of the United States'' contained thousands of printable maps, fully documented digital cartographic datasets, wall maps, Web map and features services that complied with Open Geospatial Consortium standards, wall maps, multimedia dynamic maps, and innovative mapping applications.

In late 2013, mapping managers at the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] decided to end the program despite the fact that nationalatlas.gov received three times the use of its other mapping service nationalmap.gov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmap.gov|title=The National Map|website=nationalmap.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of the ''National Atlas'' was announced in February 2014 and nationalatlas.gov was taken offline on October 1, 2014.

Since the Atlas' retirement, its data remains available in two places:

==History==

===1874 edition===
The first national atlas of the United States, titled the ''Statistical Atlas of the United States Based on the Results of the Ninth Census 1870'', was published in 1874.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; Francis A. Walker, the Superintendent of the [[1870 U.S. Census]] compiled this atlas "with contributions from many eminent men of science and several departments of the government."&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; The 1874 U.S. National Atlas contained population maps as well as economic and natural resources maps (including maps of forests, precious metals, coal, climate, and crops).&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt;

===1920 edition===
[[Henry Gannett]], who worked as the Chief Geographer of both the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] and the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS), led the production of three additional national atlases of the United States after 1874, with the last of these atlases being published in 1920.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt;

[[Image:National Atlas of the United States Logo.svg|thumb|left|185px|''National Atlas'' Logo]]

===1970 edition===
The next edition of the national atlas of the United States was issued in 1970—half a century later.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; The USGS and its chief [[geographer]] Dr. Arch C. Gerlach oversaw the preparation and production (which took several years to complete) of the 1970 ''U.S. National Atlas'' as well.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970 atlas weighed twelve pounds, contained four hundred pages, and had a collection of 765 maps.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; These maps showed "scientific information from a variety of Federal sources and depicted the principal characteristics of the country, including its physical features, historical evolution, economic activities, sociocultural conditions, administrative subdivisions, and place in world affairs."&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt;

The 1970 atlas was primarily created for use by United States government officials, researchers, and others who need "to visualize country-wide patterns and relationships between environmental phenomena and human activities".&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; 15,000 copies of the 1970 atlas were printed, and its price of {{USD|100|1970|round=0}} made it cost-prohibitive for most Americans.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; A majority of those 15,000 copies were bought by schools and libraries.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; The 1970 atlas has been out of print since the early 1970s, but the [[Library of Congress]] posted it online as part of its [[American Memory]] collection.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; ''The 1970 '''National Atlas of the United States of America'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/census3.html|title=About this Collection - General Maps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; page describes the development of this atlas briefly and gives a link to the Library of Congress archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3701gm.gct00013|title=Title page|publisher=[[Library of congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997 edition===
The final ''National Atlas'' of the United States was created in 1997 and was published online through the first nine months of 2014.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt; The [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] led the creation of this edition of the ''National Atlas'', but more than twenty [[U.S. federal agencies]] cooperated in producing it. Its varied products and services included the first online interactive mapping program offered by the Federal government.&lt;ref name = "natatlus"/&gt;

====Current Availability of 1997-2014 Atlas Data====

The ''National Atlas'' data is now archived as ''1997-2014 Edition of The National Atlas of the United States''&lt;ref name="data.gov"/&gt; on the U.S. government's&lt;ref name="data.gov1"/&gt; website.

The [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] continues to make at least a subset of the ''National Atlas'' data available under its ''National Map Small Scale Collection.''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] has updated a handful of the ''Atlas'' datasets on its pages since the Atlas retired.  The [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] groups the datasets it hosts into six "chapters" as follows:
# '''Land Cover:''' Impervious Surface, Land Cover, Tree Canopy
# '''Governmental Units/Boundaries:''' Congressional Districts, Counties, Federal lands, States...
# '''Elevation:''' Contours, Elevation, Natural Earth, Satellite View, Shaded Relief...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1780">In [[Islam]], '''nazr''' is a vow or commitment to carry out an act. The failure to fulfill the commitment results in the need to take a compensating action, often of a charitable nature, such as feeding the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1741|title=Nazr|quotation=Vow. Considered a serious commitment in Islam. Failure to fulfill a vow is seen as a grievous offense for which expiation must be made, for example, by feeding or clothing the poor or fasting. Most common vows are those that are conditional upon the occurrence of an event, such as “If God heals my mother, I will prepare a feast for fifty people.”|website=Oxfordislamicstudies.com|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazr can also take the form of [[tribute]] to a superior or the payment of a fee when taking office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rekhta.org/urdudictionary?keyword=nazr|title=Meaning of nazr|website=Rekhta.org|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is ancient and recurs throughout the history of the [[Islamic world]]. For instance in 1632, [[Mirza Zulqarnain]], a Christian official in the [[Mughul Empire]], paid nazr of five elephants to the Mughal Court.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/44146996 "Mirza Zulqarnain - An Armenian Noble"] by Ruquiya K.

'''''Nomina Anatomica''''' ('''''NA''''') was the international standard on human anatomic terminology from 1955 until it was replaced by ''[[Terminologia Anatomica]]'' in 1998.

In the late nineteenth century some 50,000 terms for various body parts were in use.  The same structures were described by different names, depending (among other things) on the anatomist’s school and national tradition.  Vernacular translations of Latin and Greek, as well as various eponymous terms, were barriers to effective international communication.  There was disagreement and confusion among anatomists regarding anatomical terminology.

==Editions==
The first and last entries in the following table are not NA editions, but they are included for the sake of continuity. Although these early editions were authorized by different bodies, they are sometimes considered part of the same series.&lt;ref name="pmid18488135"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kachlik D, Baca V, Bozdechova I, Cech P, Musil V |title=Anatomical terminology and nomenclature: past, present and highlights |journal=Surg Radiol Anat |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=459–66 |date=August 2008 |issn=0930-1038  |pmid=18488135 |doi=10.1007/s00276-008-0357-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before these codes of terminology, approved at anatomists congresses, the usage of anatomical terms was based on authoritative works of scholars like [[Galen]], [[Berengario da Carpi]], [[Gaspard Bauhin]], [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle|Henle]], [[Hyrtl]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Sakai, T.

| 1895 
| Work on a new international system of anatomical terminology began in 1887.  The system was approved in 1895 by the ''Ninth Congress'' of the ''Anatomische Gesellschaft'' in [[Basel]] (then "Basle"), Switzerland.  It became known as the Basle Nomina Anatomica (BNA).  The BNA reduced the number of anatomical terms from 50,000 down to 5,528.

The [[International Federation of Associations of Anatomists]] (IFAA) is the international body representing anatomical societies from throughout the world.  The ''First Federative International Congress of Anatomy'' met in Geneva in 1903.

| 1933–1935
| The BNA was adopted by anatomists from many countries including Spain and the United States, but the reception was far from universal.

* French anatomists preferred to continue in their own tradition.
* British anatomists broke away from the BNA in 1933, adopting the '''[[Birmingham]] Revision (BR)'''.&lt;ref&gt;Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland. ''Final Report of the Committee Appointed by the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland on June 22nd, 1928 "to Consider Proposals to the Society for the Revision of the B.N.A., with the View of Bringing the Matter Before the Next Meeting of an International Congress of Anatomists"''.

| 1955
| The ''Fifth Congress'' (Oxford, 1950) established a committee, the '''International Anatomical Nomenclature Committee (IANC)''', to work on standardized anatomical terminology.  The IANC’s revision of the BNA was approved in 1955 at the ''Sixth Congress'', meeting in [[Paris]].  It was originally called the '''Parisiensia Nomina Anatomica (PNA)''' but later became known simply as the '''Nomina Anatomica (NA)'''.

It contained 5,640 terms, of which 4,286 were unchanged from the BNA.&lt;ref name="pmid18521806"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gielecki J, Zurada A, Osman N |title=Terminologia anatomica in the past and the future from perspective of 110th anniversary of Polish Anatomical Terminology |journal=Folia Morphol.

The committee favored the BNA's orthograde orientation ([[anatomical position]]) over the JNA's pronograde orientation, which led to a schism with veterinary anatomists, and the subsequent publication of the [[Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

==The IANC and the FCAT==

===Twelfth congress===
Around the time of the ''Twelfth Congress'' ([[London]], 1985), a dispute arose over the [[editorial independence]] of the IANC.  The IANC did not believe that their work should be subject to the approval of IFAA Member Associations.

The types of discussion underlying this dispute are illustrated in an article by Roger Warwick, then Honorary Secretary of the IANC:&lt;ref name="pmid649501"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Warwick R |title=The future of Nomina Anatomica--a personal view |journal=J. Anat. |volume=126 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=221–3 |date=May 1978 |pmid=649501 |pmc=1235726 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:  An aura of scholasticism, erudition and, unfortunately, pedantry has therefore often impeded attempts to rationalize and simplify anatomical nomenclature, and such obstruction still persists.  The preservation of archaic terms such as ''Lien,'' ''Ventriculus,'' ''Epiplooon'' and ''Syndesmologia,'' in a world which uses and continues to use ''Splen, Gaster, Omentum'' and ''Arthrologia'' (and their numerous derivatives) provides an example of such pedantry.

:  We have inherited a number of archaic and now somewhat irrational terms which are confusing to the non-Latinistic students and scientists of today ... Knowledge of Latin is extremely limited today, and thus any Latin nomenclature must be simplified to the utmost to achieve maximum clarity, usefulness, and hence acceptance.

:  Unless anatomical nomenclature is subject to a most rigorous revision, in terms of simplification and rationalization, general use of such an internationally official nomenclature as ''Nomina Anatomica'' will decline rather than increase.

What declined, however, was the influence of the IANC on anatomical terminology.  The IANC published a ''sixth'' edition of ''Nomina Anatomica,''&lt;ref name="isbn0-443-04085-0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nomina anatomica: authorised by the Twelfth International Congress of Anatomists in London, 1985: together with Nomina histologica, third edition, and Nomina embryologica, third edition |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=978-0-443-04085-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was never approved by the IFAA.

===Thirteenth congress===
Instead, at the ''Thirteenth Congress'' ([[Rio de Janeiro]], 1989), the IFAA created a new committee – the '''Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT)'''.&lt;ref name="isbn3-13-114361-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=Federative Committee on Anatomical Termi |title=Terminologia Anatomica: International Anatomical Terminology |publisher=Thieme Stuttgart |location= |year=1998 |pages=161  |isbn=978-3-13-114361-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCAT took over the task of revising international anatomical terminology.  The result was the publication, in 1998,&lt;ref name="pmid10321431"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitmore I |title=Terminologia anatomica: new terminology for the new anatomist |journal=Anat. Rec. |volume=257 |issue=2 |pages=50–3 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10321431|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0185(19990415)257:2&lt;50::AID-AR4&gt;3.0.CO;2-W}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a "new, updated, simplified and uniform anatomical terminology", the '''Terminologia Anatomica (TA)'''&lt;ref&gt;Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology.  ''Terminologia Anatomica''.  Thieme, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
.  The IANC was acknowledged in this work as follows:

:  Since the first meeting, the FCAT made several contacts with the IANC aiming at the natural transition from the old approach to the approach established by the General Assembly of the IFAA.  Such initiatives, however, did not result in a ''[[modus vivendi]]'' for harmonious collaboration.&lt;ref name="anatomickenazvoslovi.cz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anatomickenazvoslovi.cz/ta.htm |title=anatomickenazvoslovi.cz |website= |accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Terminologia Anatomica'' (''TA'')==
The ''[[Terminologia Anatomica]] '' is the joint creation of the FCAT (now FICAT&amp;mdash;the [[Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology]]) and the Member Associations of the [[International Federation of Associations of Anatomists]] (IFAA). The first edition, published in 1998, supersedes all previous lists. It is the international standard for anatomical terminology.

The 39th edition of ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (2005) explicitly recognizes ''Terminologia Anatomica''.&lt;ref&gt;Standring S. ''Gray’s Anatomy'', 39th edition. Elsevier Churchill Livingstone, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
''NA'' and its derivatives are still used in some contexts (even the controversial sixth edition), and there remain some obstacles to universal adoption of ''TA'':

* The ''TA'' is only available in Latin, English, and Spanish, while the ''NA'' is available in many additional languages,&lt;ref name="pmid16203172"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fabry P, Baud R, Burgun A, Lovis C |title=Amplification of Terminologia anatomica by French language terms using Latin terms matching algorithm: a prototype for other language |journal=Int J Med Inform |volume=75 |issue=7 |pages=542–52 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16203172 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.08.008 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1386-5056(05)00175-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has had an impact upon international adoption of TA.
* ''[[Terminologia Embryologica]]'' is under development, but is not yet available. By contrast, multiple editions of ''[[Nomina Embryologica]]'' were published.
* ''[[Nomina Histologica]]'' underwent several editions. Until recently, there was no ''[[Terminologia Histologica]]''. However, an edition was published in 2008.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-7537-X"&gt;{{cite book |title=Terminologia Histologica: International Terms for Human Cytology and Histology, Book/CD-ROM Bundle |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7817-7537-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is no "Terminologia" equivalent to the ''[[Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria]]''.

[[File:Дворцовая набережная через Неву.jpg|thumb|300px|The Palace Quay, as seen from the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]]]
The '''Palace Embankment''' or '''Palace Quay''' is a street along the [[Neva River]] in [[Central Saint Petersburg]] which contains the complex of the [[Hermitage Museum]] buildings (including the [[Winter Palace]]), the [[Hermitage Theatre]], the [[Marble Palace]], the [[Vladimir Palace]], the [[New Michael Palace]], the [[Saltykov Mansion]] and the [[Summer Garden]].

The street was laid out between 1763 and 1767, when it used to be a preferred place of residence for the [[Russian Imperial]] Nobility. The street begins at the [[Palace Bridge]], where the [[Admiralty Embankment]] becomes the Palace Embankment, and the street ends at the [[Fontanka]], where it becomes the [[Kutuzov Embankment]].

The Palace Embankment is a very popular street among tourists, as it has a wonderful view of the Neva, the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] and [[Vasilievsky Island]]. Many [[sightseeing]] boats are available for hire there.

==Pushkin associations==

In his novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', [[Alexander Pushkin]] depicted himself walking along Palace Quay with his hero, Eugene Onegin:

[[Image:Pushkin&amp;onegin.jpg|thumb|150px|Pushkin's sketch representing himself and Onegin on Palace Quay.]]
&lt;div style="font-size:90%"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;''Filled with his heart's regrets, and leaning
&lt;br&gt;''Against the rampart's granite shelf,
&lt;br&gt;''Eugene stood lost in pensive dreaming
&lt;br&gt;''(As once some poet drew himself).
&lt;br&gt;''The night grew still... with silence falling;
&lt;br&gt;''Only the sound of sentries calling,
&lt;br&gt;''Or suddenly from [[Millionnaya Street|Million Street]]
&lt;br&gt;''Some distant droshky's rumbling beat;
&lt;br&gt;''Or floating on a drowsy river,
&lt;br&gt;''A lonely boat would sail along,
&lt;br&gt;''While far away some rousing song
&lt;br&gt;''Or plaintive horn would make us shiver.
&lt;br&gt;''But sweeter still, amid such nights,
&lt;br&gt;''Are [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s octaves' soaring flights.
&lt;/div&gt;

For the first edition of this chapter, the poet commissioned an illustration depicting him and Onegin walking together along the quay. Upon receiving the illustration, which represented him leaning on a parapet with his back turned towards the Peter and Paul Fortress, he was exceedingly displeased with the result (which had little in common with his own preliminary sketch, illustrated to the right) and scribbled the following [[epigram]] underneath:

&lt;div style="font-size:90%"&gt;
&lt;br&gt; ''Here, after crossing Bridge Kokushkin,
&lt;br&gt; ''With bottom on the granite propped,
&lt;br&gt; ''Stands Aleksandr Sergeich Pushkin;
&lt;br&gt; ''Near M'sieur Onegin he has stopped.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; ''Ignoring with a look superior
&lt;br&gt; ''The [[Peter and Paul Fortress|fateful Power's citadel]],
&lt;br&gt; ''On it he turns a proud posterior:
&lt;br&gt; ''My dear chap, poison not the well!''
&lt;/div&gt;

(translated by [[Vladimir Nabokov]])

The court determined, accordingly, that the causal chain was complete.

'''{{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzeːnˌzʊxt}}) is a [[German language|German]] noun translated as "longing", "pining", "yearning", or "craving",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dict.leo.org/german-english/sehnsucht |title=LEO Results for "sehnsucht"}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some psychologists use the word {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} to represent thoughts and feelings about all facets of life that are unfinished or imperfect, paired with a yearning for ideal alternative experiences.&lt;ref name="Reference 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kotter-Grühn |first=D. |last2=Wiest |first2=M. |last3=Zurek |first3=P. |last4=Scheibe |first4=S. |title=What is it we are longing for?

Psychologists have worked to capture the essence of {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} by identifying its six core characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheibe |first=S. |last2=Freund |first2=A. M. |last3=Baltes |first3=P. B. |title=Toward a developmental psychology of Sehnsucht (life longings): The optimal (utopian) life |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2007 |volume=43 |pages=778–795 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.3.778 |pmid=17484587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# utopian conceptions of ideal development;
# sense of incompleteness and imperfection of life;
# conjoint time focus on the past, present, and future;
# ambivalent (bittersweet) emotions;
# reflection and evaluation of one's life; and
# symbolic richness.

In a cross-cultural study conducted to determine whether the German concept of {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} could be generalized to the United States, four samples of American and German participants “rated their 2 most important life longings and completed measures of subjective well-being and health.”&lt;ref name="Reference 2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheibe |first=S. |last2=Blanchard-Fields |first2=F. |last3=Wiest |first3=M. |last4=Freund |first4=A. M. |title=Is longing only for Germans? A cross-cultural comparison of sehnsucht in Germany and the United States |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2011 |doi=10.1037/a0021807 |volume=47 |pages=603–618 |pmid=21219068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German and American participants did not differ in their ability to identify life longings or the intensity of their {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}. However, German participants associated it more with unattainable, utopian states while Americans reported the concept as not as important to everyday life.

Some researchers posit that {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} has a developmental function that involves life management. By imagining overarching and possibly unachievable goals, individuals may be able to create direction in their life by developing more tangible goals, or “stepping stones” that will aid them on their path toward their ideal self. "[{{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} has] important developmental functions, including giving directionality for life planning and helping to cope with loss and important, yet unattainable wishes by pursuing them in one's imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheibe |first=S. |last2=Freund |first2=A. M. |title=Approaching Sehnsucht (life longings) from a life-span perspective: The role of personal utopias in development |journal=Research in Human Development |year=2008 |pages=121–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also operate as a self-regulatory mechanism.

However, in a study that attempted to discover whether {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}} played an active role in one’s ability to influence their own development, psychologists asked 81 participants to report “their most important personal goals and life longings, and [evaluate] these with respect to their cognitive, emotional, and action-related characteristics.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayser |first=S. |last2=Scheibe |first2=S. |last3=Riediger |first3=M. |title=(Un)reachable? An empirical differentiation of goals and life longings |journal=European Psychologist |year=2008 |volume=13 |pages=126–140 |doi=10.1027/1016-9040.13.2.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results showed that goals were perceived as more closely linked to everyday actions, and as such more controllable. {{lang|de|Sehnsucht}}, on the other hand, was reported as more related to the past and future, and therefore more emotionally and developmentally ambiguous.

Also, in a study conducted in 2009, 168 middle-aged childless women were asked to rate their wish for children according to intensity and attainability. If the women rated their wish as intense and long-standing, their wish was considered a life-longing. If they rated their wish as intense and attainable, it was simply a goal. “The pursuit of the wish for children as a life longing was positively related to well-being only when participants had high control over the experience of this life longing and when other self-regulation strategies (goal adjustment) failed.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kotter-Grühn |first=D. |last2=Scheibe |first2=S. |last3=Blanchard-Fields |first3=F. |last4=Baltes |first4=P. B. |title=Developmental emergence and functionality of Sehnsucht (life longings): The sample case of involuntary childlessness in middle-aged women |journal=Psychology and Aging |year=2009 |volume=24 |pages=634–644 |doi=10.1037/a0016359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
"{{lang|de|Sehnsucht|italic=no}}" is a poem by {{lang|de|[[Friedrich Schiller]]|italic=no}} that inspired composers like {{lang|de|[[Franz Schubert]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|de|[[Siegfried Wagner]]|italic=no}}. {{lang|de|[[Goethe]]|italic=no}}'s "{{lang|de|[[Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt]]|italic=no}}" was set to music by multiple composers including Ludwig van Beethoven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=17759 "Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt"] at LiederNet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Richard Strauss]] composed a setting of [[Detlev von Liliencron]]'s poem "Sehnsucht" in 1896 ([[Sehnsucht (Strauss)|Opus 32, number 2]]).

''[[Sehnsucht_(Rammstein_album)|Sehnsucht]]'' (1997) is the title of the second album, and title track of that album, by the German metal band, {{lang|de|[[Rammstein]]|italic=no}}.
 
In 2011 the film director Badran Roy Badran treated the concept of ''Sehnsucht'' in his feature film ''A Play Entitled Sehnsucht''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2248661/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1|title=A Play Entitled Sehnsucht}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/user/ur32552023/comments?ref_=tt_urv|title=Reviews written by Khourysara6|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13863">In non-functional [[linguistics]], a '''sentence''' is a textual unit consisting of one or more [[word|words]] that are grammatically linked. In functional linguistics, a '''sentence''' is a unit of written texts delimited by graphological features such as upper case letters and markers such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. This notion contrasts with a curve, which is delimited by phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses; and with a clause, which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]''. Arnold: p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This entry is mainly about ''sentence'' in its non-functional sense, though much work in functional linguistics is indirectly cited or considered such as the categories of Speech Act Theory.

A sentence can include words grouped meaningfully to express a statement, [[question]], exclamation, request, [[Imperative mood|command]] or [[suggestion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sentence |title='Sentence' – Definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A sentence is a set of words that in principle tells a complete thought (although it may make little sense taken in isolation out of [[context (language use)|context]]) It may be a simple [[phrase]], but it conveys enough [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] to imply a [[clause]], even if it is not explicit; for example, "Two" as a sentence (in answer to the question "How many were there?") implies the clause "There were two." Typically a sentence contains a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. A sentence can also be defined purely in orthographic terms, as a group of words starting with a capital letter and ending in a full stop.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JM3KAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Introduction to Functional Grammar]''. Arnold: p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the teaching of writing skills ([[composition (language)|composition]] skills), students are generally required to express (rather than imply) the elements of a sentence, leading to the schoolbook definition of a sentence as one that must [explicitly] include a subject and a verb. For example, in [[second-language acquisition]], teachers often reject one-word answers that only imply a clause, commanding the student to "give me a complete sentence," by which they mean an explicit one.

As with all language expressions, sentences might contain [[function word|function]] and [[content word|content]] words and contain properties such as characteristic [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and timing patterns.

Sentences are generally characterized in most languages by the inclusion of a [[finite verb]], e.g. "[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog|The quick brown fox ''jumps'' over the lazy dog]]."

== Typical associates ==

=== Clauses ===
In non-functional linguistics, a '''simple complete sentence''' consists of a '''single clause'''. In functional linguistics, a sentence is typically associated with a clause and a clause can be either a '''clause simplex''' or a '''clause complex'''. A clause is a clause simplex if it represents a single process going on through time and it is a clause complex if it represents a logical relation between two or more processes and is thus composed of two or more clause simplexes.

A [[clause|clause (simplex)]] typically contains a predication structure with a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] noun phrase and a [[finite verb]]. Although the subject is usually a noun phrase, other kinds of [[phrase]]s (such as [[gerund]] phrases) work as well, and some languages allow subjects to be omitted. In the examples below, the subject of the outmost clause simplex is in italics and the subject of ''boiling'' is in square brackets. Notice that there is clause embedding in the second and third examples.

:''[Water]'' boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
:''It'' is quite interesting ''that [water] boils at 100 degrees Celsius''.
:''The fact that [water] boils at 100 degrees Celsius'' is quite interesting.

There are two types of clauses: ''independent'' and ''non-independent''/''interdependent''. An independent clause realises a speech act such as a statement, a question, a command or an offer. A non-independent clause does not realise any act. A non-independent clause (simplex or complex) is usually logically related to other non-independent clauses. Together they usually constitute a single independent clause (complex). For that reason, non-independent clauses are also called ''interdependent''. For instance, the non-independent clause ''because I have no friends'' is related to the non-independent clause ''I don't go out'' in ''I don't go out, because I have no friends''. The whole clause complex is independent because it realises a statement. What is stated is the causal nexus between having no friend and not going out. When such a statement is acted out, the fact that the speaker doesn't go out is already established, therefore it cannot be stated. What is still open and under negotiation is the reason for that fact. The causal nexus is represented by the independent clause complex and not by the two interdependent clause simplexes.

See also [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] for the consequences of the verb ''to be'' on the theory of sentence structure.

== Classification ==

=== By structure ===
One traditional scheme for classifying [[English language|English]] sentences is by [[Sentence clause structure|clause structure]], the number and types of clauses in the sentence with finite verbs.
* A ''simple sentence'' consists of a single [[independent clause]] with no [[dependent clause]]s.
* A ''compound sentence'' consists of multiple independent clauses with no dependent clauses. These clauses are joined together using [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]], [[punctuation]], or both.
* A ''complex sentence'' consists of one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
* A ''compound–complex sentence'' (or ''complex–compound sentence'') consists of multiple independent clauses, at least one of which has at least one dependent clause.

=== By purpose&lt;!--linked from 'Statement' and 'Visibilités'--&gt;===
Sentences can also be classified based on their purpose:
* A ''declarative sentence'' or declaration, the most common type, commonly makes a statement: "I have to go to work."
* An ''interrogative sentence'' or [[question]] is commonly used to request information—"Do I have to go to work?"—but sometimes not; see [[rhetorical question]].
* An ''exclamatory sentence'' or exclamation is generally a more emphatic form of statement expressing emotion: "I have to go to work!"
* An ''imperative sentence'' or [[Imperative mood|command]] tells someone to do something (and if done strongly may be considered both imperative and exclamatory): "Go to work." or "Go to work!"
*An "instructive sentence" or instruction is used to provide information on what something is or how something can be done.

=== Major and minor sentences ===
A major sentence is a ''regular'' sentence; it has a subject and a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], e.g. "I have a ball.". In this sentence, one can change the persons, e.g. "We have a ball.". However, a minor sentence is an irregular type of sentence that does not contain a main clause, e.g. "Mary!", "Precisely so.", "Next Tuesday evening after it gets dark.". Other examples of minor sentences are headings (e.g. the heading of this entry), stereotyped expressions ("Hello!"), emotional expressions ("Wow!"), proverbs, etc. These can also include [[nominal sentence]]s like "The more, the merrier". These mostly omit a main verb for the sake of conciseness, but may also do so in order to intensify the meaning around the nouns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.unitecnology.ac.nz/resources/resources/exp_lang/sentence.html Exploring Language: Sentences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005246/http://english.unitecnology.ac.nz/resources/resources/exp_lang/sentence.html |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences that comprise a single word are called word sentences, and the words themselves [[sentence word]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reflections on Language and Language Learning|editor1=Marcel Bax |editor2=C. Jan-Wouter Zwart |editor3=A. J. van Essen |author=Jan Noordegraaf|pages=24|chapter=J. M. Hoogvliet as a teacher and theoretician|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|isbn=90-272-2584-2|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Length ==
The 1980s saw a renewed surge in interest in sentence length, primarily in relation to "other syntactic phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eiUEh5OYgIC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bz7pTu_IE_CPiAehsP3nCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=Quantitative Linguistics | year=1992 | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Těšitelová, Marie | pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One definition of the average sentence length of a prose passage is the ratio of the number of words to the number of sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/lv7b7/language_log_on_twitter_and_real_trends_in_word/ | title=Calculate Average Sentence Length | publisher=Linguistics Forum | date=Jun 23, 2011 | accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}
The textbook ''Mathematical linguistics'', by András Kornai, suggests that in "journalistic prose the median sentence length is above 15 words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VCHgEpVXysC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Yj_pTvPuFuyUiQfKvdWFDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=Mathematical linguistics | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Kornai, András | pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The average length of a sentence generally serves as a measure of sentence difficulty or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Zw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4zjpToblNOGaiAfFh5jPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=The assessment of sentence difficulty | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Perera, Katherine | pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, as the average sentence length increases, the complexity of the sentences also increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0KuDYr-lU0C&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics+history&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jULpTo7UGqKjiAebq-HOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics%20history&amp;f=false | title=Instruction and assessment for struggling writers: evidence-based practices | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Troia, Gary A. | pages=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of "sentence length" is the number of clauses in the sentence, whereas the "clause length" is the number of [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]] in the clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODC4ZTwn81wC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4zjpToblNOGaiAfFh5jPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=Quantitative Linguistics | year=2005 | accessdate=December 15, 2011 |author1=Reinhard Köhler |author2=Gabriel Altmann |author3=Raĭmond Genrikhovich Piotrovskiĭ | page=352 | quote=(Caption) Table 26.3: Sentence length (expressed by the number of clauses) and clause length (expressed by the number of phones) in a Turkish text }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Erik Schils and Pieter de Haan by sampling five texts showed that two adjacent sentences are more likely to have similar lengths than two non-adjacent sentences, and almost certainly have a similar length when in a work of fiction. This countered the theory that "authors may aim at an alternation of long and short sentences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/20.abstract | title=Characteristics of Sentence Length in Running Text | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1993 | accessdate=December 12, 2011 |author1=Erik Schils |author2=Pieter de Haan }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sentence length, as well as word difficulty, are both factors in the readability of a sentence; however, other factors, such as the presence of conjunctions, have been said to "facilitate comprehension considerably".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Zw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4zjpToblNOGaiAfFh5jPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=The assessment of sentence difficulty | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Perera, Katherine | pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eer_Pg7ZAGAC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22sentence+length%22+linguistics&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4zjpToblNOGaiAfFh5jPCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sentence%20length%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false | title=Sentence Length, Sentence Complexity, and the Noun Phrase in 18th-Century News Publications | accessdate=December 15, 2011 | author=Fries, Udo | pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Suzdal Kremlin''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Суздальский кремль) is the oldest part of the Russian city of [[Suzdal]], dating from the 10th century.&lt;ref name="musvladcit"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Russian [[Kremlin (fortification)|Kremlin]]s, it was originally a fortress or citadel and was the religious and administrative center of the city.  It is most notably the site of the [[Cathedral of the Nativity in Suzdal|Cathedral of the Nativity]].

Together with several structures in the neighboring city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], it was named a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

== History ==
While archeological evidence suggests that the Suzdal Kremlin was settled as early as the 10th century, the fortress itself was built in the late 11th or early 12th century.  The fortress was strategically located on a bend of the Kamenka river on three sides and a moat to the east.  It was surrounded by earthen ramparts that remain to the present day.&lt;ref name="musvlad"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  A settlement (''posad'' [[Russian language|Russian]]: посад) to the east became home the secular population - shopkeepers and craftsmen, while the Kremlin proper was the home of the prince, the archbishop, and the high clergy.&lt;ref name="musvladcit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

From the 13th to the 16th centuries, several monasteries and churches were constructed, including the [[Cathedral of the Nativity in Suzdal|Cathedral of the Nativity]], the Convent of the Intercession, and the Monastery of Our Saviour and St. Euthymius.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1701">{{unreferenced|date=June 2009}} [[File:Far Above Cayuga's Waters 1906.png|thumb|right|"[[Far Above Cayuga's Waters]]" written in a TTBB arrangement.]] In musical [[choral notation]], '''TTBB''' denotes a four-part [[men's chorus]]. Its configuration is [[Tenor]] 1, Tenor 2, Bass 1 ([[Baritone]]), Bass 2.

The Tanunda Liedertafel 1861 employs this method of notation in their music.

Typically (but not always) the 1st Tenor part is the melody, with the other parts as harmony(s). In music for [[barbershop quartet]]s, which use the TTBB arrangement almost exclusively, the 2nd Tenor is almost always the melody.

The Tanunda Liedertafel in parts are expressed as;
1st Tenor,
2nd Tenor,
1st Bass,
2nd Bass.

The way traditional German music notation is expressed with two staves:
T1 - treble clef 8va - up stem,
T2 - treble clef 8va - down stem,
B1 - bass clef - up stem,
B2 - bass clef - down stem.

This is usually classed as a 'closed score'.

The above may not be true for some recently written (composed) music, however writers make it is easy to see which part sings their respective pitch. For example, T1 and B1 the highest pitch on each stave. Most of the time, this occurs where T1(B1) and T2(B3) are singing at the same time (in time and in unison).

Sometimes (rarely) the melody part (or lead) is sung as a solo, with the choir singing the harmony parts (support or backing vocals).
(The recent rendition of The Holy City sung by the Liedertafel demonstrates this - though no audio recording of this exists)

The '''Thessaloniki Programme''' is a [[manifesto]] adopted by the Greek [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA), first presented by party leader [[Alexis Tsipras]] at the [[Thessaloniki International Fair]] on 13 September 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=631486|title=Tsipras presents SYRIZA program at International Fair in Thessaloniki|date=15 September 2014|access-date=26 January 2015|newspaper=[[To Vima]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposing a set of policies oriented towards reversing [[austerity]] measures while maintaining a [[balanced budget]]. At the start of 2015, while still [[Leader of the Opposition (Greece)|Leader of the Opposition]], Tsipras stated that the programme is "not negotiable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/01/12/syriza-leader-tsipras-promises-restoration-of-returnee-expatriates-pensions/|title=SYRIZA Leader Tsipras Promises Restoration of Returnee Expatriates’ Pensions|author=Aggelos Skordas|publisher=[[Greek Reporter]]|date=12 January 2015|access-date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Syriza won a plurality in [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|legislative elections held on 25 January 2015]], Tsipras became [[Prime Minister of Greece]] and brokered a coalition with the right-wing anti-austerity [[Independent Greeks]] with the shared goal of immediate realisation of the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_26/01/2015_546550|title=Tsipras forms government, plans new legislation|date=26 January 2015|access-date=26 January 2015|newspaper=[[Kathimerini]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official Syriza statement promised that the "new government will implement the Thessaloniki program to end the humanitarian crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.efe.com/efe/noticias/english/portada/syriza-wins-general-elections-greece/4/63/2519473|title=Syriza wins general elections in Greece|publisher=[[EFE]]|date=26 January 2015|access-date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July 2015, the Greek government and the European creditors reached an agreement under which the government had to implement harsh austerity measures, which effectivelly made the major economic measures proposed by the Thessaloniki programme virtually impossible to implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Euro Summit statement, 12 July 2015|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/07/12-euro-summit-statement-greece/|website=[[European Council]]|publisher=[[Euro Summit]]|date=12 July 2015|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The Four Pillars of the National Reconstruction Plan==

The programme is based on four pillars:
# Confronting the humanitarian crisis
# Restarting the economy and promoting tax justice
# National plan to regain employment
# Transforming the political system to deepen democracy

At the European level, the programme demands a "European [[New Deal]]" of large-scale [[public investment]] by the [[European Investment Bank]], extended [[quantitative easing]] by the [[European Central Bank]], and a conference for the reduction of Greek and southern European debt modeled on the [[London Debt Agreement]] of 1953. Domestically, the programme sets out a "National Reconstruction Plan" based on the rebuilding and extending of the [[welfare state]], and the strengthening of democratic institutions alongside the implementation of forms of [[direct democracy]]. These policies would be financed through revenues raised by combatting [[tax evasion]] and appropriating European funds from bodies such as the [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.syriza.gr/article/id/59907/SYRIZA---THE-THESSALONIKI-PROGRAMME.html|title=SYRIZA - THE THESSALONIKI PROGRAMME|publisher=[[SYRIZA]]|date=September 2014|access-date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
At the time of its publication, the programme was criticised by the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]&amp;ndash;led government for underestimating the costs of its pledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_16/09/2014_542962|title=Finance Ministry challenges SYRIZA's economic pledges|newspaper=[[Kathimerini]]|date=16 September 2014|access-date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has also been criticised from within Syriza. In January 2015, Central Committee member Stathis Kouvelakis stated that the programme "was based on very over-optimistic estimates (or even simply wrong ones)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/01/syriza-greece-victory-kouvelakis-left/|author=Stathis Kouvelakis|title=After Syriza’s Victory, Confrontation or Capitulation|newspaper=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=26 January 2015|access-date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Harrison Ainsworth - Project Gutenberg eText 12369.png|thumb|[[William Harrison Ainsworth]]'s novel ''[[The Tower of London (novel)|The Tower of London]]'' was particularly influential in shaping the public's view of the Tower of London.]]
The [[Tower of London]] has been represented in popular culture in many ways. As a result of 16th and 19th century writers, the Tower has a reputation as a grim fortress, a place of torture and execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Impey|Parnell|2000|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest traditions associated with the Tower was that it was built by [[Julius Caesar]]; the story was a popular amongst writers and antiquaries. The earliest recorded attribution of the Tower to the Roman ruler dates to the mid-14th&amp;nbsp;century in a poem by [[Thomas Grey (chronicler)|Sir Thomas Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nearing|1948|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the myth is uncertain, although it may be related to the fact that the Tower was built in the corner of London's Roman walls. Another possibility is that someone misread a passage from [[Gervase of Tilbury]] in which he says Caesar built a tower at Odnea in France. Gervase wrote Odnea as Dodres, which is close to the French for London, Londres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nearing|1948|pp=231–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the story survives in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard&amp;nbsp;II]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard&amp;nbsp;III]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nearing|1948|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as late as the 18th&amp;nbsp;century some still regarded the Tower as built by Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nearing|1948|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[The Tower of London (novel)|The Tower of London]]'' (1840) by [[William Harrison Ainsworth]] though written in fictional form, contrives to give a detailed account of the history and architecture of the Tower. He however included extensive underground passages and dungeons which did not actually exist.
* The Tower of London, as a place of death, treachery and sorrow, is most famously evoked in [[William Shakespeare's]] play, [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], where it forms the backdrop of Richard's seizure of the throne and the scene of the notorious murder of the [[Princes in the Tower]], and other victims (see above). A classic film version of this is ''[[Richard III (1955 film)|Richard III]]'' (1955) with [[Laurence Olivier]] in the title role. This story is also reprised in the historical horror film ''[[Tower of London (1939 film)|Tower of London]]'' (1939) and its [[Tower of London (1962 film)|1962 remake]].
* [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1888 comic opera ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', set at the Tower,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischler|1996|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; has familiarised people throughout the English-speaking world with the Tower for over a century. This is the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera involving an actual historical person, [[Richard Cholmondeley|Sir Richard Cholmondeley]], Lieutenant of the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|1996|p=772}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Apparitions of Anne Boleyn at the Tower are the theme of the song "[[With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm]]".
* ''[[The Mad Hatter Mystery]]'', a detective novel by [[John Dickson Carr]], where the Tower serves as scene of a murder (Harper &amp; Row Inc., New York, 1933, 1961).
* ''[[A Night in Terror Tower]]'', the twenty-sixth book in the ''[[Goosebumps]]'' series by [[R. L. Stine]] (Scholastic, January 1995).  Also adapted into a two-part episode, an audiobook, and a board game.
* There was an adventure computer game called Traitors Gate released by Swedish [[Daydream Software]] in 1999. In the game, the player is an American agent who must secretly steal the crown jewels in 12 hours. The game took place in a CGI recreation of the whole Tower area.
* The Tower of London features frequently, and is described in exhaustive detail, in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s [[Baroque Cycle]], especially [[The System of the World (novel)|The System of the World]], in which the tower is the setting for one of the series' grandest set pieces.
* The Tower of London has featured multiple times in the long-running [[BBC]] television [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'': 
** in the 1964 [[First Doctor]] serial "[[The Sensorites]]", the Doctor claims to have been sent to the Tower of London by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] after an argument ended with the king throwing a lump of chicken at him.
** in the 1971 [[Third Doctor]] serial "[[The Mind of Evil]]", the Doctor mentions having previously met [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] in the Tower of London after the latter had gotten in trouble with [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].
** in the 2005 Christmas special "[[The Christmas Invasion]]", it was the secret headquarters of the fictional military organization [[UNIT]]. The UNIT base also reappeared in the 2012 episode [[The Power of Three (Doctor Who)|The Power of Three]].
** in the 2010 episode "[[The Beast Below]]" it was shown to be present on "Starship UK", a massive spaceship containing the population of Britain in the 29th century. 
** the Tower plays a key role in the show's 50th anniversary special, [[The Day of the Doctor]]:
*** in 1562, the [[Tenth Doctor]], [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[War Doctor]] are imprisoned in the Tower by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] while she is impersonating the commander of a group of shape-shifting alien invaders called [[Zygon]]s.
*** by 2013, the Tower houses UNIT's Black Archives, a storehouse of dangerous extraterrestrial or time displaced technology, where the Doctors and UNIT personnel confront the Zygons and conclude a treaty.
*** in an early scene, the head of UNIT remarks that the [[Ravens of the Tower of London|Tower's ravens]] are "looking a little sluggish" and "need new batteries."
*The Tower of London is seen many times in the Roland Emmerich's 2011 movie ''[[Anonymous (film)|Anonymous]]''.
* The Tower is the setting for the final battle in the anime version of [[Hellsing]], where Alucard faces against Incognito.
* The Tower is the setting for [[Johnny English]] when the crown jewels are stolen by Pascal Sauvage.

* In [[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)]], [[John, King of England|Prince John]] is shown as resident in and holding court in the tower.  John's presence in The Tower is established through the use of photographs of the structure.
* "Towers of London" is a song by the British rock band [[XTC]] from their 1980 album [[Black Sea (XTC album)|''Black Sea'']].  The song was written by [[Andy Partridge]].
* The novel "Balthazar Jones and the Tower of London Zoo" by [[Julia Stuart]] is almost entirely set inside the Tower of London.
*In [[Charlie Higson]]'s [[post-apocalyptic]] young adult [[Horror (genre)|horror]] novel [[The Enemy (Higson novel)|''The Enemy'']] (2009), Small Sam escapes being kidnapped, twice, each by cannibalistic adults, and ultimately joins up with a group that takes refuge in the [[Tower of London]].
*[[Walter Raleigh]] - Royal favour with Queen Elizabeth had been restored by this time, but his good fortune did not last. The Queen died in 1603, and Raleigh was arrested at Exeter Inn, Ashburton, Devon, and imprisoned in the Tower of London on 19 July 1603. On 17 November, Raleigh was tried in the converted Great Hall of Winchester Castle for treason, due to his involvement in the Main Plot against King James.

'''Transatlantic migration''' refers to the movement of people across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in order to settle on the continents of [[North America|North]] and [[South America|South]] America. It usually refers to migrations after [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage to the Americas in 1492. For earlier [[Transatlantic crossing]]s, see: [[Norse colonization of North America]] and [[Theory of Phoenician discovery of the Americas]].

== 16th to 18th century ==
{{further|List of crossings of the Atlantic Ocean}}

*The [[European colonization of the Americas]]—from 1836 to 1914, over 30 million Europeans migrated to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Evans, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21533369.2001.9668313 Indirect passage from Europe: Transmigration via the UK, 1836–1914]", in ''Journal for Maritime Research'', Volume 3, Issue 1 (2001), pp. 70-84&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Great Migration (Puritan)]] of English to North America, from 1650 onward.
*The [[forced migration]] of Africans: See [[Slave trade]] and [[Atlantic slave trade]]
*The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]

== 19th century onward ==
Among the various transatlantic migrations, the period of time between the mid-19th century to the early 20th century marks the “Age of Mass Migration” where 40% of U.S. population growth was due to the inflow of immigrants.  Economic theory sought to explain, however, if immigrants were positively or negatively selected from the sending pool into the United States.  
[[Ingrid Semmingsen]] in her book, ''Norway to America: a History of the Migration'', wrote “Many have asked if it was the more capable, the more enterprising and energetic persons who left, or if it was those who fell behind in the struggle for bread, the losers, the maladjusted, and the deviant” in reference to the composition of those who migrated into the United States.  
The [[Roy Model]] of comparative advantage suggests that where there are higher wages for skilled workers in one location, the most able will migrate to that country and earn that income.  Moreover, if there are higher wages for unskilled workers in one location, the least able will leave their own country and migrate to earn that income.    

As a result of the improvements in transportation after the [[Industrial Revolution]], long-distance migrations increased in the 19th century. For example, the duration of the Atlantic passage fell from 5 weeks (1725) to one week (1900). In addition, the length of indentured servitude necessary to pay for the fare decreased from 4 years to approximately 4 weeks, substantially decreasing one of the main deterrents for making the trek. Between 1846 and 1940, some 55 million migrants moved from Europe to America. 65% went to the United States. Other major receiving countries were Argentina, Canada, Brazil and Uruguay. Also, 2.5 million Asians migrated to the Americas, most as [[indentured servant]] to the plantations of the [[Caribbean]], but some also, notably Japanese, arrived in Brazil and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Adam|last=McKeown|author-link=Adam McKeown|title=Global migrations 1846-1940|journal=Journal of Global History|volume=15|issue=2|pages=155–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3857">'''TrueSkill''' is a skill-based ranking system developed by [[Microsoft]] for use with video game matchmaking on [[Xbox Live]]. Unlike the popular [[Elo rating system]], which was initially designed for [[chess]], TrueSkill is designed to support games with more than two players.&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective|last=Murphy|first=Kevin|publisher=MIT Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0262018029|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{Citation|last=Herbrich|first=Ralf|title=TrueSkill™ : A Bayesian Skill Rating System|date=2007|url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3079-trueskilltm-a-bayesian-skill-rating-system.pdf|work=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 19|pages=569–576|editor-last=Schölkopf|editor-first=B.|publisher=MIT Press|access-date=2018-10-11|last2=Minka|first2=Tom|last3=Graepel|first3=Thore|editor2-last=Platt|editor2-first=J. C.|editor3-last=Hoffman|editor3-first=T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
A player's skill is represented as a [[normal distribution]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt; characterized by a mean value of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; ('''mu''', representing perceived skill) and a variance of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; ('''sigma''', representing how "unconfident" the system is in the player's &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; value).&lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paper" /&gt; As such &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}(x)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the probability that the player's "true" skill is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paper" /&gt;

On Xbox Live, players start with &lt;math&gt;\mu = 25&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 25/3&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; always increases after a win and always decreases after a loss. The extent of actual updates depends on each player's &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and on how "surprising" the outcome is to the system. Unbalanced games, for example, result in either negligible updates when the favorite wins, or huge updates when the favorite [[Upset (competition)|loses surprisingly]].

[[Factor graph]]s and [[expectation propagation]] via [[moment matching]] are used to compute the [[Belief propagation|message passing equations]] which in turn compute the skills for the players.&lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paper" /&gt;

Player ranks are displayed as the conservative estimate of their skill, &lt;math&gt;R = \mu - 3 \times \sigma&lt;/math&gt;. This is conservative, because the system is 99% sure that the player's skill is actually higher than what is displayed as their rank.

The system can be used with arbitrary scales, but Microsoft uses a scale from 0 to 50 for Xbox Live. Hence, players start with a rank of &lt;math&gt;R = 25 - 3 \cdot \frac{25}{3} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This means that a new player's defeat results in a large sigma loss, which partially or completely compensates their mu loss. This explains why people may gain ranks from losses.

==History==
=== Van Gogh's unsold works ===
[[File:WLANL - artanonymous - Portret van Johanna van Gogh-Bonger.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]]'' (1925) by [[Isaac Israëls]]]]

Upon [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s death in 1890, his work not sold fell into the possession of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]. Theo died six months after Vincent, leaving the work in the possession of his widow, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]].&lt;ref name=nga&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/vgmsm.shtm |title=Van Gogh's Van Goghs: The Van Gogh Museum |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selling many of Vincent's paintings with the ambition of spreading knowledge of his artwork, Johanna maintained a private collection of his works.

The collection was inherited by her son Vincent Willem van Gogh in 1925, eventually loaned to the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in Amsterdam where it was displayed for many years, and was transferred to the state-initiated Vincent van Gogh Foundation in 1962.&lt;ref name=nga/&gt;

=== Dedicated museum ===
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with pipe - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Vincent van Gogh, ''Self-portrait with pipe'', 1886, Van Gogh Museum]]

Design for a Van Gogh Museum was commissioned by the Dutch government in 1963 to Dutch architect and furniture designer [[Gerrit Rietveld]].&lt;ref name=artnews&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/2011_02_13_23_02_13_the_van_gogh_museum_in_amsterdam_hosts_our_editor_the_worlds_largest_collection_of_van_goghs_artwork.html |title=The Van Gogh Museum In Amsterdam Hosts Our Editor ~ The World's Largest Collection of Van Gogh’s Artwork |publisher=Art Knowledge News |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rietveld died a year later, and the building was not completed until 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sfmoma.org/artists/4283 |title=Gerrit Thomas Rietveld |publisher=SFMOMA |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728024532/http://www.sfmoma.org/artists/4283 |archivedate=28 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the museum opened its doors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=215&amp;lang=en&amp;section=sectie_museum The Organization], Van Gogh Museum. Retrieved 30 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 and 1999, the building was renovated by the Dutch architect [[Martien van Goor]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=13886&amp;lang=en The museum's architecture in overview], Van Gogh Museum. Retrieved 6 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and an exhibition wing by the Japanese modernist architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]] was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.kisho.co.jp/page.php/220 |title=New Wing of the Van Gogh Museum |publisher=Kisho Kurokawa architect &amp; associates |year=2006 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in late 2012, the museum was closed for renovations for six months. During this period, 75 works from the collection were shown in the [[Hermitage Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Saltzstein, "[http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/amsterdams-van-gogh-museum-to-close-for-renovations/ Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum to Close for Renovations]", ''[[New York Times]]'', 2011. Retrieved 5 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2013, the museum unveiled a long-lost Van Gogh painting that spent years in a Norwegian attic believed to be by another painter. It is the first full-size canvas by him discovered since 1928. ''[[Sunset at Montmajour]]'' depicts trees, bushes and sky, painted with Van Gogh's familiar thick brush strokes. It can be dated to the exact day it was painted because he described it in a letter to his brother, Theo, and said he painted it the previous day 4 July 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Van Gogh Painting Unveiled in Amsterdam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/arts/design/new-van-gogh-painting-discovered-in-amsterdam.html?_r=0|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art thefts===
In 1991, twenty paintings were stolen from the museum, among them Van Gogh's early painting ''[[The Potato Eaters]]''. Although the thieves escaped from the building, 35 minutes later all stolen paintings were recovered from an abandoned car. Three paintings – ''[[Wheatfield with Crows]]'', ''[[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands)#Personal items|Still Life with Bible]]'', and ''[[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)#Assorted fruit|Still Life with Fruit]]'' – were severely torn during the theft.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L.

The '''Vrba–Wetzler report''', also known as the '''Auschwitz Protocols''', the '''Auschwitz Report''' and the '''Auschwitz notebook''', is a 40-page document about the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in [[German-occupied Poland]] during the [[Holocaust]].

[[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfréd Wetzler]], two Slovak Jews who escaped from Auschwitz on 10 April 1944, wrote the report by hand or dictated it, in [[Slovak language|Slovak]], between 25 and 27 April, in [[Žilina]], [[Slovakia]]. Oscar Krasniansky of the Slovak [[Judenrat|Jewish Council]] typed up the report and simultaneously translated it into German.

The Allies had known since November 1942 that Jews were being killed ''en masse'' in Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=NYT25Nov1942/&gt; The Vrba-Wetzler report was an early attempt to estimate the numbers and the most detailed description of the gas chambers to that point.&lt;!--The original is kept in the War Refugee Board archives of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library]] in New York.&lt;ref name=Conway2002&gt;Conway (2002), Appendix I, 292–293, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The publication of parts of the report in June 1944 is credited with helping to persuade the Hungarian regent, [[Miklós Horthy]], to halt the deportation of that country's Jews to Auschwitz, which had been proceeding at a rate of 12,000 a day since May 1944. The first full English translation of the report was published in November 1944 by the United States [[War Refugee Board]].

==Auschwitz Protocols==
{{further|Auschwitz Protocols}}
The Vrba-Wetzler report is sometimes referred to as the ''Auschwitz Protocols'', although in fact the ''Protocols'' incorporated information from three reports, including Vrba–Wetzler. Under the title "German Extermination Camps—Auschwitz and Birkenau",&lt;!--was first published in German, as ''Tatsachenbericht über Auschwitz under Birkenau'', in May 1944 in Geneva by Abraham Silberschein of the Jewish World Congress.&lt;ref name=Szabo2011/&gt;--&gt; the ''Auschwitz Protocols'' was first published in full in English on 25 November 1944 by the Executive Office of the United States [[War Refugee Board]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert1989p305&gt;Gilbert (1989), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wBHAaRhXDUEC&amp;pg=PA305 305].&lt;/ref&gt; Miroslav Kárný writes it was published on the same day the last 13 prisoners, all women, were gassed or shot in crematorium II in Auschwitz-Birkenau.&lt;ref&gt;Kárný (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mub823JQrdUC&amp;pg=PA564 564].&lt;/ref&gt; The document combined the material from the Vrba–Wetzler report and two others, which were submitted together in evidence at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] as document no.&amp;nbsp;022-L, exhibit no.&amp;nbsp;294-USA.&lt;ref name=Conway2002&gt;Conway (2002), Appendix I, 292–293, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Vol-XXIV.pdf "Document index"], Trial of the Major War Criminals"], Nuremberg: The International Military Tribunal, 1949, 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Protocols'' included a seven-page report from Arnost Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz and an earlier report, known as the "Polish Major's report", written by [[Jerzy Tabeau]]. Tabeau escaped from Auschwitz on 19 November 1943 and compiled his report between December 1943 and January 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Szabó (2011), 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; This was presented in the ''Protocols'' as the 19-page "Transport (The Polish Major's Report)".&lt;ref name=Gilbert1989p305/&gt; Rosin and Mordowicz escaped from Auschwitz on 27 May 1944, using the demotion they received after Vrba and Wetzler's escape a month earlier, and met up with those escapees in Slovakia to contribute to the ''Protocols.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-auschwitz-escapee-told-the-world-about-nazi-genocide/|title=Auschwitz escapee told the world about Nazi genocide|last=Ha|first=Tu Thanh|date=2018-07-05|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full text of the English translation of the ''Protocols'' is in the archives of the War Refugee Board at the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Vanden Heuvel (2011), v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
===How it was written===
[[File:Alfred Wetzler.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=photograph|[[Alfréd Wetzler]]]]
According to the report's first post-war Slovak edition, ''Oswiecim, hrobka štyroch miliónov ľudí'' ("Auschwitz, the tomb of four million"), published in Bratislava in 1946,&lt;ref&gt; ''Oswiecim, hrobka štyroch miliónov ľudí'', Bratislava, 1946, cited in Kárný (1998), 564, n.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; the report was first written in Slovak by Vrba and Wetzler, beginning on 25 April 1944, and simultaneously translated into German by Oscar Krasniansky of the Slovakian Jewish Council in Žilina. It was written and re-written several times. Wetzler wrote the first part, Vrba the third, and they wrote the second part together. They then worked on the whole thing together.&lt;ref name=Karny1998p564n5/&gt; Wetzler confirmed this version of how the report was written in a letter to [[Miroslav Kárný]], dated 14 April 1982.&lt;ref name=Karny1998p564n5&gt;Kárný (1998), 564, n. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Oscar Krasniansky, an engineer and stenographer, translated it from Slovak into German with the help of Gisela Steiner.&lt;ref name=Karny1998p564n5/&gt; They produced a 40-page report in German, which was completed by Thursday, 27 April. Vrba wrote that the report was also translated into Hungarian.&lt;ref name=Vrba2002p402&gt;Vrba (2002), 402–403.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Slovak version of the report was not preserved.&lt;ref name=Karny1998p564n5/&gt; Historians studying the Holocaust today usually base their research on the German translation, which Allied forces also used when translating the report into English shortly after the end of the war.

The Vrba-Wetzler report contains a detailed description of the geography and management of the camps, and of how the prisoners lived and died. It lists the transports that had arrived at Auschwitz since 1942, their place of origin, and the numbers "selected" for work or the gas chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Karny (1998), 554; van Pelt (2011), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Kárný writes that the report is an invaluable document because it provides details that were known only to prisoners, including, for example, that discharge forms were filled out for prisoners who had been gassed, indicating that death rates in the camp were actively falsified.&lt;ref name=Karny1998p554&gt;Kárný (1998), 555.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crematoria===
[[File:Vrba-Wetzler report sketch (crematoria).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=diagram|A sketch from the report, showing the rough layout of the crematoria]]
The report contains sketches and information about the layout of the gas chambers, describing the large room where victims were made to undress before being pushed into the gas chambers, as well as the attached crematoriums. In a deposition for the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, and in his book ''I Cannot Forgive'' (1964), Vrba said that he and Wetzler obtained the information about the gas chambers and crematoria from the ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' [[Filip Müller]] and his colleagues, who worked there. Müller confirmed Vrba's story in his ''Eyewitness Auschwitz'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;Van Pelt (2002), 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The report offered a description of the camp's four crematoria.{{efn|Vrba-Wetzler report (two paragraph breaks have been inserted for ease of reading): "At present, there are four crematoria in operation at BIRKENAU, two large ones, I and II, and two smaller ones, III and IV. Those of type I and II consist of 3 parts, i. e.,: (A) the furnace room; (B) the large halls; and (C) the gas chamber. A huge chimney rises from the furnace room around which are grouped nine furnaces, each having four openings. Each opening can take three normal corpses at once and after an hour and a half the bodies are completely burned. This corresponds to a daily capacity of about 2,000 bodies. Next to this is a large "reception hall" which is arranged so as to give the impression of the antechamber of a bathing establishment. It holds 2,000 people and apparently there is a similar waiting room of the floor below. From there a door and a few steps lead down into the very long and narrow gas chamber. The walls of this chamber are also camouflaged with simulated entries to shower rooms in order to mislead the victims. This roof is fitted with three traps which can be hermetically closed from the outside. A track leads from the gas chamber to the furnace room.{{pb}}

"The gassing takes place as follows: The unfortunate victims are brought into hall (B), where they are told to undress. To complete the fiction that they are going to bathe, each person receives a towel and a small piece of soap issued by two men clad in white coats. They are then crowded into the gas chamber (C) in such numbers there is, of course, only standing room. To compress this crowd into the narrow space, shots are often fired to induce those already at the far end to huddle still closer together.{{pb}}

"When everybody is inside, the heavy doors are closed. Then there is a short pause, presumably to allow the room temperature to rise to a certain level, after which SS men with gas masks climb on the roof, open the traps, and shake down a preparation in powder form out of tin cans labeled 'CYKLON For use against vermin', which is manufactured by a Hamburg concern. It is presumed that this is a 'CYANIDE' mixture of some sort which turns into gas at a certain temperature. After three minutes everyone in the chamber is dead. No one is known to have survived this ordeal, although it was not uncommon to discover signs of life after the primitive measures employed in the Birch Wood. The chamber is then opened, aired, and the 'special squad' carts the bodies on flat trucks to the furnace rooms, where the burning takes place. Crematoria III and IV work on nearly the same principle, but their capacity is only half as large. Thus, the total capacity of the four cremating and gassing plants at BIRKENAU amounts to about 6,000 daily."&lt;ref&gt;Świebocki (1997), 218, 220, 224; also see [http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/othercamps/auschproto.html "The Vrba-Wetzler Report"], part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jean-Claude Pressac]], a French specialist on the gas chambers, concluded in 1989 that, while the report was wrong on certain issues, it "has the merit of describing exactly the gassing process in type II/III Krematorien as from mid-March 1943. It made the mistake of generalizing internal and external descriptions and the operating method to Krematorien IV and V. Far from invalidating it, the discrepancies confirm its authenticity, as the descriptions are clearly based on what the witnesses could actually have seen and heard."&lt;ref name=Pressac1989p464&gt;Pressac (1989), 464,&lt;/ref&gt; Auschwitz scholar [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] agreed, writing in 2002: "The description of the crematoria in the War Refugee Board report contains errors, but given the conditions under which information was obtained, the lack of architectural training of Vrba and Wetzlar [sic], and the situation in which the report was compiled, one would become suspicious if it did not contain errors.&amp;nbsp;... Given the circumstances, the composite 'crematorium' reconstructed by two escapees without any architectural training is as good as one could expect."&lt;ref name=VanPelt2002p151&gt;van Pelt (2002), 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
===Background===
{{Vrba-Wetzler timeline}}
The dates on which the report was distributed became a matter of importance within Holocaust historiography. Vrba alleged that lives were lost in Hungary because it was not distributed quickly enough by Jewish leaders, particularly [[Rudolf Kastner]] of the Budapest [[Aid and Rescue Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;For Vrba's allegations, see Braham (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ATpHs6fgr_YC&amp;pg=PA276 276], n. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Mike Thomson (BBC, 13 November 2012): "The BBC broadcast every day, giving updates on the war, general news, and opinion pieces on Hungarian politics. But among all these broadcasts, there were crucial things that were not being said, things that might have warned thousands of Hungarian Jews of the horrors to come in the event of a German occupation. A memo setting out policy for the BBC Hungarian Service in 1942 states: 'We shouldn't mention the Jews at all.' By 1943, the BBC Polish Service was broadcasting about the exterminations. And yet, his policy of silence on the Jews was followed right up until the German invasion in March 1944. After the tanks rolled in, the Hungarian Service did then broadcast warnings.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Thompson (13 November 2012).

The Allies had been told on 12 November 1942 that Jews were being killed ''en masse'' in Auschwitz;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2014b), 258.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''New York Times'' published a report to that effect on 25 November 1942.&lt;ref name=NYT25Nov1942&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1942/11/25/archives/details-reaching-palestine.html "Details Reaching Palestine"], ''The New York Times'', 25 November 1942, 10.{{pb}}
James MacDonald (25 November 1942). [https://www.nytimes.com/1942/11/25/archives/himmler-program-kills-polish-jews-slaughter-of-250000-in-plan-to.html "Himmler Program Kills Polish Jews"], ''The New York Times'', 10. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=PVW0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 full text])&lt;/ref&gt; From March 1943, the Polish government-in-exile forwarded intelligence about what was happening inside the camp. But it remained an "inside story", according to historian Michael Fleming, unpublished or not published prominently, as a result of [[anti-Semitism]] and the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]'s refusal to confirm the reports as genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2014b), 258–260.&lt;/ref&gt; A document named ''Aneks 58'' from the Polish underground (which named its report ''Aneks'') was received by Britain's [[Special Operations Executive]] in November 1942 and noted that, by the end of 1942, 468,000 Jews had been killed at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/hgs/article/28/1/31/649765/Allied-Knowledge-of-Auschwitz-A-Further-Challenge Fleming 2014(a)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming writes: "[N]ews of the true function of Auschwitz was effectively embargoed by British government policy."&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2014b), 260.&lt;/ref&gt; By issuing advice to newspaper owners and editors, by refusing to confirm Polish intelligence, and by insisting that Jews were simply citizens of the country in which they lived like any other citizen, the British government "was able to choreograph news of the Holocaust".&lt;ref&gt;Fleming (2014b), 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
Oscar Krasniansky of the Jewish Council, who translated the report into German as Vrba and Wetzler were writing and dictating it, made conflicting statements about the report after the war, according to Israeli historian [[Yehuda Bauer]]. In his first statement he said he had handed the report to Rudolf Kastner on 26 April 1944 during the latter's visit to Bratislava, but Bauer writes that the report was not finished until 27 April. In another statement, Krasniansky said he had passed it to Kastner on 28 April in Bratislava, but [[Hansi Brand]], Kastner's lover and the wife of [[Joel Brand]], said that Kastner was not in Bratislava until August. It is clear from Kastner's post-war statements that he did have early access to the report, Bauer writes, but perhaps not in April.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer (2002), 231.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Randolph L. Braham]], Kastner had a copy by 3 May, when he paid a visit to [[Kolozsvár]] (Cluj), his home town.&lt;ref name=Braham2000p95&gt;Braham (2000), 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georg Klein 01.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Hungarian biologist [[George Klein (biologist)|George Klein]] saved his life by fleeing, rather than boarding a [[Holocaust train]], after he read the Vrba–Wetzler report as a teenager.&lt;ref name=Klein2011pp258-263/&gt;]]
Kastner's reasons for not making the document public are unknown. Vrba believed until the end of his life that Kastner withheld it in order not to jeopardize negotiations between the Aid and Rescue Committee and [[Adolf Eichmann]], the SS officer in charge of the transport of Jews out of Hungary. Shortly after Vrba arrived in Slovakia from Auschwitz in April 1944, Eichmann proposed—to Kastner, Joel Brand and Hansi Brand in Budapest—that the Nazis trade up to one million Hungarian Jews for 10,000 trucks and other goods from the Western Allies. The proposal came to nothing, but Kastner did obtain safe passage to Switzerland for 1,684 Jews on what became known as the [[Kastner train]]. Vrba believed that Kastner suppressed the Vrba–Wetzler report in order not to damage these negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Vrba (2002), 419–420&lt;/ref&gt;

Kastner copied the German translation of the report to Géza Soós, a Hungarian Foreign Ministry official who ran a resistance group, writes Bauer. Soós gave it to József Éliás, head of the Good Shepherd Mission, and Éliás's secretary, Mária Székely, translated it into Hungarian and prepared six copies. These copies made their way to several Hungarian and church officials, including [[Miklós Horthy]]'s daughter-in-law.&lt;ref name=Bauer1994p157&gt;Bauer (1994), 157; Braham (2000), 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Braham writes that this distribution occurred before 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;Braham (2000), 97.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bauer, Ernő Pető, a member of the Budapest Jewish Council, said he gave copies to Horthy's son; the papal nuntius [[Angelo Rotta]]; and the finance minister [[Lajos Reményi-Schneller]].&lt;ref name="Bauer1994p157"/&gt;

The Jewish Council in Budapest did hand the report out to individuals. The Hungarian biologist [[George Klein (biologist)|George Klein]], as a teenager in Budapest, was working for the Jewish Council as a junior secretary at the time. One day in late May or early June, his boss, Dr. Zoltán Kohn, gave him a carbon copy of the report, and told him that he should tell only his closest family and friends about it. Klein told his uncle, a well-known physician, who "became so angry that he nearly hit me", and asked how he could believe such nonsense. It was the same with other relatives and friends. The older ones refused to believe it, while the younger ones believed it and wanted to act. When it came time for Klein to get on the train, he chose to run instead, and that saved his life.&lt;ref name=Klein2011pp258-263&gt;Klein (2011), 258–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[USHMM]] (United Stated Holocaust Museum) the US [[War Refugee Board]] released the report after an unusually long delay. "''In November 1944, the WRB released a report written by escapees from the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, alerting Americans to the details of Nazi mass murder using gas chambers.''"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007411&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deportations to Auschwitz continue===
On 6 June 1944, the day of the [[Normandy Landings|Normandy landings]], Arnošt Rosin and Czesław Mordowicz arrived in Slovakia, having escaped from Auschwitz on 27 May. Hearing about the Battle of Normandy and believing the war was over, they got drunk using dollars they had smuggled out of Auschwitz. As a result they were arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent time in jail before the Jewish Council paid their fines.&lt;ref name=Vrba2002p406&gt;Vrba (2002), 406.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 June, the men were interviewed by Oscar Krasniansky. They told him that, between 15 and 27 May, 100,000 Hungarian Jews had arrived at Birkenau, and that most were killed on arrival, apparently with no knowledge of what was about to happen to them. [[John S. Conway (historian)|John Conway]] writes that Vrba and Wetzler concluded that their report had been suppressed.&lt;ref name=ConwayWiesenthal/&gt;

===Report's arrival in Switzerland, press coverage===
&lt;!--check this: The report was first published, in German, in May 1944 in Geneva by Abraham Silberschein of the Jewish World Congress as ''Tatsachenbericht über Auschwitz under Birkenau''.&lt;ref name=Szabo2011&gt;Szabó (2011), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
Braham writes that the report was taken to Switzerland by Florian Manoliu of the Romanian Legation in Bern, and given to [[George Mantello]], a Jewish businessman from Transylvania who was working as the first secretary of the El Salvador consulate in Geneva. It was thanks to Mantello, according to Braham, that the report received, in the Swiss press, its first wide coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Braham (2000) 95, 214.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Kranzler]], Mantello asked for the help of the Swiss-Hungarian Students' League to make around 50 mimeographed copies of the Vrba–Wetzler and other Auschwitz reports (the ''Auschwitz Protocols''), which by 23 June he had distributed to the Swiss government and Jewish groups. The students went on to make thousands of other copies, which were passed to other students and MPs.&lt;ref&gt;Kranzler (2000), 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the Swiss press coverage, details appeared in the ''New York Times'' on 4 June,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1944/06/04/archives/senators-appeal-on-hungarys-jews-foreign-relations-committee-pleads.html "Senators appeal on Hungary's Jews; Foreign Relations Committee Pleads With People to Stop 'Cold-Blooded Murder'"], ''The New York Times'', 4 June 1944.{{pb}}

On 19 June, Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva, who had received a copy of the report from Mantello,&lt;ref name=Kranzler2000p104&gt;Kranzler (2000), 104.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote to the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem to say that they knew "what has happened and where it has happened", and reported the Vrba–Wetzler figure that 90 percent of Jews arriving at Birkenau were being killed.&lt;ref&gt;van Pelt (2002), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Kranzler places the cable to Jerusalem on 26 June 1944, and writes that Lichtheim referred in the cable to 12,000 Jews being deported daily from Budapest.&lt;ref name=Kranzler2000p104/&gt;}} Vrba and Oscar Krasniansky met [[Holy See|Vatican]] Swiss legate Monsignor Mario Martilotti at the [[Svätý Jur]] monastery in Bratislava on 20 June. Martilotti had seen the report and questioned Vrba about it for six hours.&lt;ref name=Karny1998p556&gt;Kárný (1998), 556–557&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bauer, Martilotti said he was travelling to Switzerland the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer (2002), 230.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June [[Pope Pius XII|Pope Pius]] sent a public cable to Horthy, asking that he "do everything in&amp;nbsp;...[his] power to save as many unfortunate people from further pain and sorrow". Other world leaders followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer 2000, 107; Braham (2000), 95, 214; Bauer (2002), 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Brigham, ''New York Times'' correspondent in Geneva, published a longer story on 3 July, "Inquiry Confirms Nazi Death Camps", and on 6 July a second, "Two Death Camps Places of Horror; German Establishments for Mass Killings of Jews Described by Swiss".&lt;ref&gt;van Pelt (2002), 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Brigham (6 July 1944).

===Deportations halted===
[[File:784648 Oświęcim obóz zagłaby "Birkenau", Brama Śmierci 01.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] in 2012]]
On 26 June, Richard Lichtheim of the Jewish Agency in Geneva sent a telegram to England calling on the Allies to hold members of the Hungarian government personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted by the Hungarian government and shown to Prime Minister [[Döme Sztójay]], who passed it to Horthy. Horthy ordered an end to the deportations on 7 July, and they stopped two days later.&lt;ref name=Rees2006p242&gt;Rees (2006), 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler instructed the Nazi representative to Hungary, [[Edmund Veesenmayer]], to relay an angry message to the Admiral.&lt;ref&gt;Dwork and van Pelt (2002), 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Horthy resisted Hitler's threats, and Budapest's 200,000–260,000 Jews were temporarily spared from deportation, until the pro-Nazi [[Arrow Cross Party]] seized power in Hungary in a coup on 15 October 1944. Henceforth, the deportations resumed, but by then, the diplomatic involvement of the Swedish, Swiss, Spanish, and Portuguese embassies in Budapest, as well as that of the papal nuncio, [[Angelo Rotta]], saved tens of thousands until the arrival of the Soviet Union in Budapest in January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Paldiel (2007), ''Diplomat Heroes of the Holocaust'', {{ISBN|0881259098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwork &amp; van Pelt, 317–318.&lt;/ref&gt;. Swiss diplomat [[Carl Lutz]] rescued tens of thousands of Jews (according to Yad Vashem museum display on the order of 50,000) with help of [[Moshe Krausz]] (then Director of the Jewish Agency’s Palestine Office in Budapest) and the Zionist Youth Underground&lt;ref&gt;http://eng.thepartisan.org/home/doc.aspx?mCatID=68457&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Raoul Wallenberg]] and others in the Swedish delegation also saved tens of thousands of Jews (according to some 70,000 to 100,000). As can be expected there are varying estimates of the number of Jews rescued.
