'''Aggregates''' are used in [[Dimensional modeling|dimensional models]] of the [[data warehouse]] to produce positive effects on the time it takes to query large sets of [[data (computing)|data]]. At the simplest form an '''aggregate''' is a simple summary table that can be derived by performing a ''[[Group by]]'' SQL query. A more common use of aggregates is to take a [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimension]] and change the granularity of this dimension. When changing the granularity of the dimension the [[Fact (data warehouse)|fact]] table has to be partially summarized to fit the new [[Granularity|grain]] of the new [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimension]], thus creating new [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensional]] and fact tables, fitting this new level of grain. Aggregates are sometimes referred to as pre-calculated summary data, since aggregations are usually precomputed, partially summarized data, that are stored in new aggregated tables. When facts are aggregated, it is either done by eliminating dimensionality or by associating the facts with a rolled up dimension. Rolled up dimensions should be shrunken versions of the dimensions associated with the granular base facts. This way, the aggregated dimension tables should conform to the base dimension tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ralph Kimball |author2= Margy Ross |title=The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling |edition= Second Edition, |publisher=Wiley Computer Publishing |year=2002| isbn=0-471-20024-7|ref={{harvid|Kimball|Data Warehouse Toolkit}} |p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the reason why aggregates can make such a dramatic increase in the performance of the data warehouse is the reduction of the number of rows to be accessed when responding to a query.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Adamson, ''Mastering Data Warehouse Aggregates: Solutions for Star Schema Performance'', Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-471-77709-0}}, Page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ralph Kimball]], who is widely regarded as one of the original architects of data warehousing, says:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rkimball.com/html/articles_search/articles1996/9608d54.html |title=Aggregate Navigation With (Almost) No Metadata |date=1995-08-15 |accessdate=2010-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211114831/http://www.rkimball.com/html/articles_search/articles1996/9608d54.html |archivedate=2010-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The single most dramatic way to affect performance in a large data warehouse is to provide a proper set of aggregate (summary) records that coexist with the primary base records. Aggregates can have a very significant effect on performance, in some cases speeding queries by a factor of one hundred or even one thousand. No other means exist to harvest such spectacular gains.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Having aggregates and atomic data increases the complexity of the dimensional model. This complexity should be transparent to the users of the data warehouse, thus when a request is made, the data warehouse should return data from the table with the correct grain. So when requests to the data warehouse are made, aggregate navigator functionality should be implemented, to help determine the correct table with the correct grain. 
The number of possible aggregations is determined by every possible combination of dimension granularities. Since it would produce a lot of overhead to build all possible aggregations, it is a good idea to choose a subset of tables on which to make aggregations. The best way to choose this subset and decide which aggregations to build is to monitor queries and design aggregations to match query patterns.{{sfn|Kimball|Data Warehouse Toolkit |p=355}}

==Aggregate navigator==
Having aggregate data in the dimensional model makes the environment more complex. To make this extra complexity transparent to the user, functionality known as aggregate navigation is used to query the dimensional and fact tables with the correct grain level. The aggregate navigation essentially examines the query to see if it can be answered using a smaller, aggregate table.{{sfn|Kimball|Data Warehouse Toolkit |p=137}}

Implementations of aggregate navigators can be found in a range of technologies:
*[[Online analytical processing|OLAP]] engines
*[[Materialized view]]s
*Relational OLAP ([[ROLAP]]) services
*[[Business intelligence|BI]] application servers or query tools
It is generally recommended to use either of the first three technologies, since the benefits in the latter case is restricted to a single front end [[Business intelligence|BI]] tool{{sfn|Kimball|Data Warehouse Toolkit |p=354}}

==Problems/challenges==
*Since dimensional models only gain from aggregates on large data sets, at what size of the data sets should one start considering using aggregates?
*Similarly, is a data warehouse always handling data sets that are too large for direct queries, or is it sometimes a good idea to omit the aggregate tables when starting a new data warehouse project? Thus, will omitting aggregates in the first iteration of building a new data warehouse make the structure of the dimensional model simpler?

[[File:Ames Monument Panorama.jpg|thumb|Ames Monument Panorama, September 2015]]
The '''Ames Monument''' is a large [[pyramid]] in [[Albany County, Wyoming]], designed by [[Henry Hobson Richardson]] and dedicated to brothers [[Oakes Ames]] and [[Oliver Ames, Jr.]], [[Union Pacific Railroad]] financiers.  The brothers garnered credit for connecting the nation by rail upon completion of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. Oakes, a U.S. representative to the [[United States Congress]] from Massachusetts, asserted near total control of its construction, whereas Oliver became president of the Union Pacific Railroad (1866 - 1871).&lt;ref name="richardson" /&gt; In 1873 investigators [[Credit Mobilier scandal|implicated Oakes in fraud]] associated with financing of the railroad. Congress subsequently [[Censure in the United States|censured]] Oakes, who resigned in 1873.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;State wants to attract more visitors to railroad monument, by JODI ROGSTAD. Associated Press. December 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He died soon thereafter.

The Ames Monument marked the highest point on the transcontinental railroad at {{convert|8247|ft|m}}&lt;ref name="wyo" /&gt; However, Union Pacific Railroad Company twice relocated the tracks further south, causing the town of [[Sherman, Wyoming|Sherman]] that arose near the monument to become a [[ghost town]].

==Richardsonian design==
The Ames Monument is located about {{convert|20|mi|km}} east of [[Laramie, Wyoming]], on a wind-blown, treeless summit south of [[Interstate 80]] at the [[Vedauwoo]] exit. The monument is a four-sided, random [[ashlar]] pyramid, {{convert|60|ft|m}} square at the base and {{convert|60|ft|m}} high, constructed of light-colored native [[granite]]. The pyramid features an interior passage, now sealed, alongside the perimeter of the structure's base.&lt;ref name="boomerang1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Handler|first=Carrie|title=Ames Monument represents 'enormous feat'|url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/wyoming/article_dd73ee7a-1b7f-11e0-81a1-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=9 January 2011|newspaper=Laramie Boomerang|date=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted American architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H. H. Richardson]] designed the pyramid, which includes two {{convert|9|ft|m}} tall bas-relief portraits of the Ames brothers by sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] on the east and west sides of the pyramid's top. Saint-Gaudens chiseled the bas-reliefs from Quincy, Massachusetts, granite.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt; The north side, which at one time faced the railroad tracks, displays one-foot-high letters grouted in the granite noting: "In Memory of Oakes Ames and Oliver Ames". The monument is one of a half-dozen or more projects that Richardson did for the Ames family.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt;

The pyramid is one of only two examples of Richardson's work west of the [[Mississippi River]], the other being the [[Isaac H. Lionberger House]] in St. Louis less than two miles from the river.&lt;ref name="ames"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sISEV9XGarkC | title=Source Book of American Architecture |first=George Everard Kidder |last=Smith |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson's monolithic structure employed rough-hewn granite boulders in its construction. The monument's stones at the base are five feet by eight feet and weigh thousands of pounds each.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt; The pyramid narrows from the base to become progressively smaller towards the top at a ratio of four inches to the foot.

==History==
The audacity of building a transcontinental railroad in the 1860s was "today's equivalent of the mission to Mars: Big, expensive and impossible," according to University of Wyoming historian Phil Roberts.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; President Abraham Lincoln reportedly told Oakes Ames that if he could get the transcontinental railroad built then he would be "the most remembered man of the century."&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; Lincoln personally recruited Oakes after progress by and financial support for [[Credit Mobilier of America]], the construction company charged with building the railroad, ground to a halt.&lt;ref name ="national" /&gt; The Ames brothers succeeded where others failed and completed the transcontinental railway. However, in 1873 [[Credit Mobilier scandal|charges of financial fraud]] were leveled at Oakes, tarnishing his and the Union Pacific Railroad Company's reputation.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt;

Public outcry towards Oakes and other "Kings of Frauds" associated with scandal threatened the Ames family reputation and the Ames Company that dated back to 1774 when the company started making steel-edged shovels.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt; The Ames Company later sold axes and shovels to miners during the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name="uprr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uprr.com/aboutup/history/sig-indv.shtml | title=UP: Significant individuals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company continued its heritage as earth movers by supplying the government shovels during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], for excavating the [[Panama Canal]], for mining [[Pennsylvania]] coal fields, and for digging the [[New York City Subway]].&lt;ref name="national" /&gt;

[[File:Historical Marker No. 3 Ames Monument.JPG|thumb|Image of the Ames Monument new Landmark signage 3 of 3.]]
Memory of the financial scandal that surfaced in 1873 had not been forgotten when the [[Union Pacific Railroad Company]] built the monument honoring the Ames brothers during 1881-1882.&lt;ref name="ames" /&gt; The Union Pacific Railroad Board of Directors voted in 1875 to erect the grand Ames Monument, in part to help reclaim some of the company's luster lost during implications of fraud leveled earlier at Oakes Ames.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; Union Pacific stockholders subsequently authorized the construction at a meeting held in [[Boston]] on March 10, 1875.&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBDXfLHsnc4C | title=H.H. Richardson, complete architectural works |first=Jeffrey Karl |last=Ochsner |publisher=MIT Press |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norcross Brothers]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] built the monument, employing some 85 workers who lived on site, "where reportedly no liquor or gambling was allowed."&lt;ref name="richardson" /&gt; Workers cut the stone for the pyramid from a granite outcropping common in the area. They then used oxen teams to skid the stone a half-mile to the work site. The rough-faced granite blocks used to construct the monument in many cases weigh several tons.&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web | url={{NRHP url|id=72001296}} | title=National Registry of Historical Places Inventory Nomination Form.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers constructed the pyramid about 300 yards south of the tracks on a small knoll.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt; When completed in 1882, the Ames Monument stood {{convert|300|ft|m}} south of, and {{convert|32|ft|m}} above, the highest elevation of the original tracks of Union Pacific transcontinental railroad at {{convert|8247|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="wyo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyoparks.state.wy.us/Site/SiteInfo.asp?siteID=26 |title=Ames Monument |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925045716/http://wyoparks.state.wy.us/Site/SiteInfo.asp?siteID=26 |archivedate=2010-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] underscored the importance of the transcontinental railroad and thereby the Ames brothers by attending the monument's dedication ceremony.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
However, when completed in 1882, the Ames Monument was visited by many persons who were allowed to momentarily leave their trains in order to view the monolithic curiosity. It was said that when the construction of the monument was almost completed, some people had the opportunity of being lifted to the top of the monument by a special rig and from their breezy perch could view the surrounding area for a hundred miles in all directions.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Sherman==
{{main|Sherman, Wyoming}}
The small town of Sherman arose at the site north of the tracks where trains stopped to change engines on their transcontinental journey. The stop provided a [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] with five stalls and a [[railway turntable|turntable]], two section houses, and a [[windmill]] with water tank. Trains were inspected at Sherman before beginning the long descent from the Sherman Pass summit, either east towards Cheyenne or west across the {{convert|130|ft|m}} high [[Dale Creek Bridge]] to the Laramie Valley. The town's death knell came in 1918. The railroad company closed its station house and relocated the tracks about three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) south.&lt;ref name="uprr" /&gt; Residents soon abandoned Sherman, leaving behind a small cemetery that is still present today.

==The monument today==
[[File:Ames Monument Pictures from September 2015.JPG|thumb|Image of the Ames Monument near Laramie, Wyoming showing site improvements September 2015.]]
Union Pacific donated the railroad monument to the state of Wyoming in 1983.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; The structure is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and is maintained as a Wyoming state historic site. Time and possible vandalism have destroyed some of the features of the [[bas-relief]] portraits of the Ames brothers on the monument. The Ames Monument is open year-round, weather permitting.

Work took place in 2010 and 2011 to restore the monument.  On October 31, 2016, the site received [[National Historic Landmark]] status.&lt;ref name="boomerang1"/&gt;

'''Antonín Petrof''' (August 15, 1839 – September 9, 1915) was a Czech piano maker.&lt;ref&gt;Palmieri, R., ''The Piano: An Encyclopedia''
([[Oxfordshire]]: [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
==Biography==
In 1857, when Petrof was 18 years old, he was visited by his maternal uncle Jan Heitzmann at his family's [[Hradec Králové]] home. Heitzmann and his partner Hölzl were already known piano manufacturers in [[Vienna]]. Petrof learned the trade in Vienna and in 1864 returned to Bohemia, where he built his first piano. In 1865 he transformed his father's cabinetry enterprise in the old town square, behind the [[Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, Hradec Králové|Cathedral of the Holy Spirit]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;Marchal, J., [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/recession/4930704/Luxury-piano-maker-Petrof-turns-to-furniture-in-global-economic-crisis.html "Luxury piano maker Petrof turns to furniture in global economic crisis"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Mar 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; into a piano-making workshop.

In 1866, a few months before the enveloping [[Battle of Königgrätz]], Petrof registered his company, A. Petrof. After a brief compulsory interruption, during which the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] defeated the [[Austrian Empire]], production resumed. In 1874 his company relocated to new premises on the outskirts of Hradec Králové.

The company grew, and in 1880 an auxiliary factory opened in Temesvár, Austria-Hungary (today [[Timișoara]], [[Romania]]). A year later, in 1881, Petrof premiered his own keyboard and mechanical design. In 1883, production of the piano began.

In 1894–95 the first instruments were exported, and A. Petrof was quickly able to establish itself. A warehouse and comptoir were opened in Vienna. Clients included nobility and the imperial court. By the early 20th century, A. Petrof was the largest piano manufacturer in the [[Austria-Hungary|monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Veselinovic, M., [https://www.economist.com/news/business/21591243-chopins-piano-maker-gives-up-others-are-fighting-chinese-rivals-major-challenges-minor "Piano-makers: Major challenges, minor successes"], ''[[The Economist]]'', Dec 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Petrof's 1915 death, the company was supplying living rooms, concert halls and royal families across Europe. Its 30,000th piano had been delivered to [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], two weeks before his [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauerova, L. M., [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-19/czech-piano-maker-petrof-focuses-on-china-sales-to-survive "Czech Piano Maker Petrof Focuses on China Sales to Survive"], [[Bloomberg_L.P.#Bloomberg_News|Bloomberg]], Sep 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the company began making luxury furniture, using the same skills and technology used to build grand pianos, in an effort to branch out and dodge ingravescent effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]]. Since that time, production has settled at 50% pianos, 50% furniture. Such diversification is characteristic of a survival strategy that has seen Petrof through two world wars and the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi invasion]], as well as 40 years of the [[Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia|communist regime]], during which, following forced nationalisation in 1948, it was incorporated into the state concern "Piano and Organ Factory".&lt;ref&gt;Anon., [https://books.google.com/books?id=FtwJAQAAMAAJ ''Czech Music''] (Prague: Czech Music Foundation, 2006), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Under communist rule, though factory installations were expanded and production figures increased, instrument quality concomitantly declined. The current company president, Zuzana Ceralová Petrofová, was among tens of thousands of peaceful protesters who successfully demanded an end to the communist regime in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesverband Klavier e.V. , [https://www.pianos.de/en/the_instrument/index.php?id=27 "History: 1915"], 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; "During the [[Great Depression|1930s crisis]] Petrof manufactured [[Railroad tie|wooden railway sleepers]]," says Ms. Ceralová Petrofová, "and during [[World War II]] it focused on [[grenade]] boxes."&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

__NOTOC__
The '''Berne Convention''' (formally, the '''International Convention respecting the Prohibition of the Use of White (Yellow) Phosphorus in the Manufacture of Matches''' ({{lang-fr|Convention internationale sur l'interdiction de l'emploi du phosphore blanc (jaune) dans l'industrie des allumettes}})) of 1906 is a [[multilateral treaty]] negotiated in [[Berne]], [[Switzerland]], which prohibits the use of [[white phosphorus]] in the manufacture of [[matches]]. The treaty also prohibits the import and sale of such matches.

The background to the treaty was the extensive medical problems such as [[phossy jaw]] facing workers in match production. The treaty was concluded on 26 September 1906. It entered into force on 1 January 1912. The Convention remains in force for 48 states. Switzerland is the depositary for the treaty.

In 1925 [[Edward J. Phelan]], future Director General of the [[International Labour Organization]], stated that the establishment of the ILO "may in one sense be traced to the Berne Convention of 1906", partly as a result of lobbying by the International Association for Labour Legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Jinnahavenueislamabad.jpg|thumb|right|View of Blue Area from Jinnah Avenue [[Islamabad]]]]

'''Jinnah Avenue''' is an important road located in Blue Area, the main business district of [[Islamabad]]. The '''Blue Area''' is the commercial and business hub of [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.com.pk/islamabad/01-Aug-2014/islamabad-ministry-of-religious-affairs-opens-library-in-blue-area Islamabad: Ministry of Religious Affairs opens library in Blue Area], The Nation (newspaper), Published 1 August 2014, Retrieved 19 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location in the city==
It is called the "Blue Area" because it was represented in blue color in the original design (master plan) of the planned city. The area is actually a corridor that runs along Islamabad's Khayaban-e-Quaid-e-Azam (also known as '''Jinnah Avenue'''), Islamabad's primary arterial road which leads up to the main government buildings. It is characterized by clean, wide roads and tall buildings among the panoramic greenery of the adjacent areas. It is limited by Nazimuddin Road to the northwest and A.K.M. Fazl-ul-Haq Road to the southeast and Ibn-e-sina road to the south west. The Blue Area has recently received a significant amount of [[foreign direct investment]]. Recently, construction completed on [[The Centaurus]], a multi-purpose complex in the Blue Area which has residential and office towers, and a luxury hotel.
==National Database and Registration Authority mega center==
It was reported on 4 July 2016, the first state-of-the-art National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) mega center would open in Islamabad's Blue Area with a capacity of processing 2000 applicants daily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.com.pk/islamabad/04-Jul-2016/capital-to-have-mega-nadra-centre Islamabad Blue Area to have mega NADRA centre], The Nation (newspaper), Published 4 July 2016, Retrieved 19 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamabad Stock Exchange==
The [[Islamabad Stock Exchange Tower|Islamabad Stock Exchange building]] is also situated in the Blue Area. On 11 January 2016, the three stock exchanges namely Islamabad Stock Exchange (ISE), [[Lahore Stock Exchange]] (LSE) and [[Karachi Stock Exchange]] (KSE) all merged to become [[Pakistan Stock Exchange]] (PSX).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fp.brecorder.com/2015/12/201512291259917/ Pakistan Stock Exchange: a quantum leap for Pakistan's capital market], Business Recorder (newspaper), Published 29 December 2015, Retrieved 19 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Centaurus Mall==
{{Main|The Centaurus}}
Designed by British architectural firm WS Atkins, it consists of three skyscrapers, containing corporate offices, residential apartments, and a hotel. It is between Sectors F-8 and G-8, primarily situated at the junction of the two main artery roads of Islamabad, ''Jinnah Avenue'' and ''Faisal Avenue''. ''The Centaurus Mövenpick Hotel'' is under-construction and is expected to open in the first quarter of 2018. The estimated cost for building the complex was $350 million USD. On 28 April 2013, a ''Mothers Day March'' (Mamta March) was organized in three major cities of Pakistan where people gathered at ''[[The Centaurus]] Mall'' in Islamabad, [[Fortress Stadium (Lahore)|Fortress Stadium]] in Lahore and [[Port Grand]] in Karachi to participate in this march.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fp.brecorder.com/2013/05/201305031182118/ Dalda launches 'Vote Aap Ka' campaign for mothers], Business Recorder (newspaper), Published 3 May 2013, Retrieved 19 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">A '''breakup fee''' (sometimes called a '''termination fee''') is a penalty set in [[takeover]] agreements, to be paid if the target backs out of a deal (usually because it has decided instead to accept a more attractive offer). The breakup fee is ostensibly to compensate the original acquirer for the cost of the time and resources expended in negotiating the original agreement. A breakup fee also serves to inhibit competing bids, since such bids would have to cover the cost of the breakup fee as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of finance and investment terms.

== Reverse breakup fee ==

A reverse breakup fee is a [[Penalty (contract)|penalty]] to be paid to the target company if the acquirer backs out of the deal, usually because it can’t obtain financing. Reasons for such fees include the possibility of lawsuits, disruption of business operations, and the loss of key personnel during the period when the company is "in play."

== Notable Examples ==

* As a result of the failed 2011 merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, AT&amp;T will have to pay a reverse breakup fee of $3 billion in cash and $1–3 billion in wireless spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/att-and-t-mobile-whats-2-billion-among-friends/&lt;/ref&gt;
* If Japanese corporation [[SoftBank]]'s $20 billion bid to buy 70% of [[Sprint Nextel]] fell through, SoftBank would have had to pay a $600 million breakup fee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/sprint-nextel-takeover-by-softbank-could-save-unlimited-data-plans-from-extinction/2012/10/15/4b153d04-16e1-11e2-8792-cf5305eddf60_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; SoftBank completed the deal with Sprint and is no longer subject to the reverse termination fee.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsroom.sprint.com/news-releases/sprint-and-softbank-announce-completion-of-merger.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Before embarking on his career as a writer for [[pulp magazine]]s, Cartmill had a wide number of jobs including [[journalist|newspaperman]], [[Old-time radio|radio operator]] and [[accountant]], as well as, ironically, a short spell at the American [[Radium]] Products Company.&lt;ref name="Silverberg2"&gt;{{cite magazine | url= http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0311/ref2.shtml | magazine= Asimov's Science Fiction | date= October–November 2003 | title= Reflections: The Cleve Cartmill Affair: Two | first= Robert | last= Silverberg | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141006183638/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0311/ref2.shtml | archivedate= 2014-10-06 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his earliest stories, from 1941 onwards, were published in [[John W. Campbell]]'s magazines ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' and ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''. This was at the start of [[World War II]], when Campbell found himself short of material because many of his regular writers were away on [[military service]], from which Cartmill was exempt for medical reasons.&lt;ref name ="Silverberg1"/&gt;

==Writing career==

Cartmill's writing career was undistinguished but competent. In his book ''A Requiem for Astounding'', Alva Rogers expresses the opinion that "Cartmill wrote with an easy and colloquial fluidity that made his stories eminently readable".&lt;ref name = "Rogers"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rogers |first=Alva |title=A Requiem for Astounding |year=1964 |publisher=Advent |isbn=0-911682-16-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Fred Smith's history of ''Unknown Worlds'', Smith praises several of Cartmill's [[dark fantasy]] stories as such as "No Graven Image", "The Bargain" and "Hell Hath Fury", describing them as "original and entertaining". Cartmill's ''Unknown'' stories, like others appearing in that publication, tend to be either humorous tales or [[Horror fiction|horror]] stories. They deal with concepts such as [[ghouls]], [[demons]] and [[Death (personification)|Death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Fred |year=2002 |title=Once There Was a Magazine: A Personal View of "Unknown" and "Unknown Worlds" |publisher=Beccon Publications |pages=39, 42–3, 45–6 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside his writing career Cartmill was likely best known, at the time, for being the co-inventor of the Blackmill system of high speed [[typography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mm8fAQAAIAAJ|title=Twentieth Century Science Fiction Writers|last=Smith|first=Curtis C.|date=1986-01-01|publisher=St. James's Press|isbn=9780912289274|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Blackmill typography|date=August 2010}}

His son, Matt Cartmill, is a Professor of Biological Anthropology at [[Boston University]] and a science writer&lt;ref&gt;M.

{{For|the job position related to building and managing (online) communities|Online community manager}}
A '''community association manager''' is a [[management|manager]] of a [[condominium]] or [[homeowners association]] (including [[single-family detached home|single-family home]] subdivisions, townhouses, or [[mixed-use development]]).  The position is frequently confused with a [[property manager]], who deals with individual rental units or a group of rental units, like an [[Apartment building|apartment complex]]. The community manager deals with property owners and homeowners.

People with this position are also sometimes called '''community managers''', which is distinct from [[online community manager]]s.

==Types==

On-site manager: This type of manager works in the community which he or she manages.

Portfolio manager: This type of community manager oversees several communities and is often paid on a [[commission (remuneration)|commission basis]].

Large-scale manager: Typically, large scale managers are also on-site managers. The [[Community Associations Institute]] offers certification for Large-scale managers and notes the following description: This designation allows a professional holding the PCAM (Professional Community Association Manager) designation to specialize in issues facing larger community associations. To be considered for this designation, the candidate must already be a manager of a large-scale community of over 1200 units, {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} and a budget of at least $1.5m.

==Florida Specific==

The state of Florida requires community association managers to hold a license. Performing duties as a CAM without a license is a violation of Florida Statutes. 

A link to the Department of Professional and Business Regulation, as well as a Frequently Asked Question PDF file, is included in the Reference section below.

==Credentials==
Organizations like the Community Associations Institute offer rigorous courses for professional managers to obtain their certification. The Community Association Managers International Certification Board's (CAMICB) (A different organization) provides internationally accredited certifications. Some common certifications include Certified Manager of Community Associations (CMCA) offered through the CAMICB, Association Management Specialist (AMS), and Professional Community Association Manager (PCAM).  Being able to find a professional management company is an important task for many board members.

Boulder: Sounds True. {{ISBN|978-1591795179}}&lt;/ref&gt; enterprises and people (also sometimes referred to under the label '''conscious capitalism'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/01/15/john-mackey-why-companies-should-embrace-conscious-capitalism/ John Mackey: Why Companies Should Embrace Conscious Capitalism.] [[Forbes]], 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;) are those that choose to follow a business strategy, in which they seek to benefit both human beings and the environment. The Conscious Business movement in the US, which emerged from the theory of [[corporate social responsibility]], pushes for "values-based" economic values where [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] represent social and environmental concerns at both global and local scales.  This effort is related to not-just-for-profit business models, conscious consumerism, and [[socially responsible investing]].

There is an alternative way of thinking about Conscious Business emerging in the UK, and perhaps other countries, which tries to avoid [[wikt:reification|reification]], regarding it less as a thing or a type of business which can be categorised, and more as an ongoing process including [[awareness]], [[self-awareness]], awareness of purpose, [[practice (social theory)]] and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amed.org.uk/page/welcome-to-e-o-p-winter-2013/ Pete Burden and Rob Warwick: Exploring Conscious Business Practice: Sensing as we act, reacting to what we sense] AMED, 2 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conscious business criteria==

===Doing no harm===
It is generally agreed upon that the product or service of a conscious business should not be intrinsically harmful to humans or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howes|first1=Lewis|title=5 Secrets to Building a Business{{snd}}With Heart|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236171|website=Entrepreneur Magazine|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for such a business to be taking part in the conscious business movement if it is taking conscious steps to be more aware of its social and environmental effects, and to adopt more beneficial social or environmental practices.

===Triple Bottom Line Model===
Most conscious businesses subscribe to a [[Triple Bottom Line]] model of success. They aim to provide positive value in the domains of people, planet, and [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Triple bottom line|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14301663|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=The Economist|publisher=The Economist|date=Nov 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Profit ====

This is what distinguishes the entity as a [[business]] from the general social enterprise. The degree of understanding or "consciousness" of any [[conflict of interest]] between the [[profit motive]] and social goods varies widely from the standard sloganeering capital accumulating firm ("[[don't be evil]]") to those who seek nothing more than [[break-even]] to pay for their operations, are completely employee owned, etc..

==== People ====
A conscious business seeks to benefit both the external livelihood as well as the internal lives of its shareholders and employees.  Furthermore, the business seeks to benefit all stakeholders including manufacturers, affected communities, and humanity at large. Some trends in conscious business which have arisen out of these efforts include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLMLcyR0B2sC|title=Maximizing the Triple Bottom Line Through Spiritual Leadership|last=Fry|first=Louis|last2=Nisiewicz|first2=Melissa|date=2013-01-09|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804784290|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  The forming of wellness affirming workplace cultures
*  Improved employee benefit programs
*  Use of [[fair trade]] materials for manufacture or sale
*  Assistance to communities who supply raw materials
*  Assistance to communities who manufacture materials
*  Local community outreach programs

==== Planet ====
A conscious business will seek to minimize its impact on the environment, and replenish the environment where it is able. Conscious businesses may choose to benefit the environment in many different ways, some trends include:
*  Robust recycling programs
*  Building "green" or "zero-impact" workplace facilities
*  Using solar or wind energy in the workplace
*  Purchasing materials from organic or sustainable farmers
*  Purchasing renewable and sustainable materials
*  Working with environmentally conscious distributors
*  Urging manufacturers and distributors to adopt better environmental practices
*  Adopting sustainable product packaging

===Above and beyond===
Many conscious businesses choose to use their resources to benefit social and environmental programs that are not directly related to the creation or distribution of the product or service.  Frequently, a conscious business will donate employee paid time, money, or products towards various non-profit organizations. Sometimes a conscious business will create a foundation, which works with one particular cause.  Also, some conscious businesses will become involved with social or political campaigns to protect the environment, animals, or people. Conscious businesses will sometimes use significant amounts of their profit towards these causes.
Furthermore, a conscious business will sometimes work closely with suppliers in either a farming or manufacturing community in a developing country, and help to develop the community economically and replenish it environmentally.

=== The Conscious Business Declaration ===
In 2015 [https://www.humanitysteam.org/ Humanity’s Team], an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], engaged with the [https://www.goipeace.or.jp/en/ Goi Peace Foundation of Japan], the [[Club of Budapest]], and the [https://weatherhead.case.edu/centers/fowler/ Fowler Center for Business as an Agent of World Benefit] at [[Case Western Reserve University]] to draft the [http://www.consciousbusinessdeclaration.org/ Conscious Business Declaration]. Self-described as "A New Standard for Business in the 21st Century," it took over a year to write the declaration, and it was officially made public in early 2016. People can show their support for the declaration by "signing" it online.

==== The Conscious Business Declaration consists of a preamble and seven principles ====

===== Preamble =====
As a global community of business leaders we are committed to developing the awareness and skills needed to consciously evolve our organizations in alignment with these principles:

===== The Principles =====
# We Are One with humanity and all of life.  Business and all institutions of the human community are integral parts of a single reality{{snd}}interrelated, interconnected and interdependent.
# In line with this reality, the purpose of Business is to increase economic prosperity while contributing to a healthy environment and improving human wellbeing.
# Business must go beyond sustainability and the philosophy of “do no harm” to restoring the self-renewing integrity of the Earth.
# Business must operate with economic, social, and ecological transparency.
# Business must behave as a positive and proactive member of the local and global communities in which it operates.
# Business that sees, honors, and celebrates the essential interconnected nature of all human beings and all life maximizes human potential and helps create a world that works for all.
# When aligned with Oneness, Business is the most powerful engine on Earth for creating prosperity and flourishing for all.

==Conscious business versus social responsibility==
To term a business a conscious business is different from the concept of a [[socially responsible business]]: although, of course, a conscious business is likely to be socially responsible. Being a conscious business does not only mean implementing a local community program, or creating a company foundation.  A business could implement one of these programs and still not be aware or respond to the fact that the business as a whole is doing more harm than good.

The term conscious business implies that a business will seek to be conscious of its impact on the world in various spheres, and continue this inquiry over time. It is concerned with both its impact on a human’s inner and outer world as well as animal and environmental well-being.  Furthermore, a conscious business considers both short-term and long-term effects of its actions or inactions.  A conscious business evolves as does the methods that a business can and chooses to be of benefit to the world and to function with awareness. Therefore, though conscious businesses will be socially responsible, the term "conscious business" holds larger connotations for the businesses' actions than does social responsibility.

==Conscious businesses movement==

Many believe that [[Anita Roddick]] pioneered the conscious business movement with her company, [[The Body Shop]] in 1976.  This company has been an environmental leader, and worked to support various activist causes including putting an end to animal testing, and defending human rights.

An overwhelming amount of conscious businesses can be found in the health food industry as well as the [[LOHAS]] (lifestyles of health and sustainability) market. However, today conscious businesses can be found emerging in almost all aspects of the business world.

Whole Foods cofounder, John Mackey, is another pioneer in the movement along with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. Large corporations as well as small boutique agencies and individuals embrace the movement despite pressure to earn money at any cost. They see business based on ethics and social responsibility versus personal gain. Public relations and brand specialist Sarni Jaye based her business on working only with conscious brands to help them grow and achieve their desired mission. USA Today reported about the wave of millennials embracing conscious business. Other businesses cited are Trader Joe's, The Container Store, Nordstrom, and more.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/21/starbucks-face-conscious-capitalism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/03/25/kindness-panera-bread-nordstrom-starbucks/1965183/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various agencies and companies that catalogue the social and environmental practices of businesses for consumer use, as well as companies which consult with businesses to increase their awareness and beneficial practices in the world.

Conscious business is about people who are aware of the impact each of their habits and actions has on their environment (people and planet). It is about people who live their lives based on knowing that everything is interconnected. It is about people, who know who they are:
*who know about their strengths and weaknesses and
*who desire to live and work with joy, creativity and ease instead of fear, power and domination.

==Conscious business versus sustainability==
There's a huge trend towards more sustainable business practices. Environmental sustainability, however, has little to do with conscious business. Organizations can be highly sustainable, but still run in an unconscious way. A conscious business, however, will not maintain unsustainable business practices.

==Reification==
Some&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amed.org.uk/page/welcome-to-e-o-p-spring-2014 Pete Burden and Rob Warwick: The Purpose and Practice of Conscious Business] AMED, Spring 2014&lt;/ref&gt; are expressing caution about the way that conscious business might be reduced to a formulaic framework and schema. The concern is that these play down the attention that we give to everyday practices and how people relate to each other.

The alternative view is that the practice of conscious business aims to raise awareness of the hurly-burly of everyday life and help people notice those assumptions that influence our perceptions and practice – to become more aware. From that emerges consciousness of purpose; it also leads to adoption of many of the approaches outlined by Kofman, Mackey and others, and to the outcomes they point to (better long term business performance, for example).

This approach is aligned with a view of business derived from [[Complexity theory and organizations]].

==Impact on Professionals==

The idea of conscious business as a reflexive approach – through noticing and awareness as we act – suggests that there are practical implications for OD ([[Organization Development]]) and HR ([[Human Resources]]) professionals. For example, such professionals may find it useful to highlight the importance of noticing group dynamics, power, and other group phenomena. And ultimately to question their own assumptions about the purpose of business.

In this way, this reflexive approach links back to the more ethical, but perhaps sometimes reified definitions, of conscious business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://app.croneri.co.uk/strategic-briefings/conscious-business-impact-and-implications-hr-and-od?product=3 Pete Burden and Rob Warwick: Conscious business – impact and implications for HR and OD], Croner, January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dov Moran''' ({{lang-he|דב מורן}}; born 1955) is an Israeli entrepreneur, [[inventor]] and investor, best known as the inventor of the [[USB memory stick]], and one of the most prominent Israeli hi-tech leaders in the world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technion-alumni.org/content/%D7%93%D7%91-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%9F-%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%90-disk-key|title=דב מורן-ממציא Disk On Key|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nocamels.com/2013/03/dov-moran-talks-to-nocamels-about-sandisk-comigo-modu/|title=Dov Moran, The Israeli Who Sold The DiskOnKey For $1.6B, Shares His Thoughts On Success, Startups And Working Until The Very End|last=Sánchez Keighley|first=Paul|date=March 11, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-dov-moran-sets-up-100m-venture-capital-fund-1001125895|title=Dov Moran sets up $100m venture capital fund|last=Globes correspondent|date=20 May 2016|website=globes.co.il|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.israel21c.org/20-top-technology-inventions-born-of-conflict/|title=20 top tech inventions born of conflict|last=Leichman|first=Abigail Klein|date=August 7, 2014|website=israel21c|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dov-moran|title=Dov Moran - Persona|last=Crunchbase's editors|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and early years==
Moran was born in [[Ramat Gan]], Israel, to a family of [[Holocaust]] survivors who immigrated to Israel from [[Poland]]. His father, Baruch Mintz, came from a well-off family from [[Krosno]]. The only Mintz family members who managed to survive the Holocaust were Dov's father and grandfather who began a new life in Israel. Dov's mother, Bina Gever, immigrated to Israel with her family who escaped [[Błonie|Blonie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.calcalist.co.il/local/articles/0,7340,L-3700338,00.html|title=בגיל 90, בבית החולים, אבא התעקש להמשיך לנהוג: "העיקר שביום ראשון אוכל לחזור לעבוד"|last=Bechor Nir|first=Diana|date=27 October 2016|website=Calcalist.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His interest in technology was obvious from his childhood days. At the age of ten he used to order electronic components and digital watch parts from MAD magazine, with the intention to create new improved devices, however, as he later testified, no significant results were achieved. In the following years, his curiosity and talent started to lead to breakthroughs. At the age of 16 he was sent to an annual course in computers held in Tel-Aviv University. Back then, in order to write a program you needed to mark cards dedicated to that with a pen. After three months of struggling to deal with that system, he wrote his first program.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nocamels.com/2013/03/dov-moran-talks-to-nocamels-about-sandisk-comigo-modu/|title=Dov Moran, The Israeli Who Sold The DiskOnKey For $1.6B, Shares His Thoughts On Success, Startups And Working Until The Very End|last=Sánchez Keighley|first=Paul|date=March 11, 2013|website=NoCamels|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His programming skills improved while obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering (with honors) at the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]] in Haifa. That was when he decided "to start his own company”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Moran served in the [[Israeli Navy]] for seven years and was commander of its advanced microprocessor department. Prior to becoming an entrepreneur, Moran was an independent consultant in the computer industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eugro.com/comigos-dov-moran/|title=Interview with Comigo’s Dov Moran|date=30 August 2014|website=eugro.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Entrepreneurship ===
Moran formed [[M-Systems]] in 1989, a pioneer in the flash data storage market. The company invented the [[USB flash drive]] ([[DiskOnKey]]), the FlashDisk (DiskOnChip) as well as several other innovative flash data storage devices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Moran's leadership, M-Systems grew to $US1 billion revenue within 18 years, and at the end of 2006 it was acquired by [[SanDisk]] Corp (NSDQ: SNDK) for $US1.6 billion.

After the sale of M-Systems, Moran founded [[Modu]], a company with a new modular phone concept, which eventually sold its patents to [[Google]] in 2011. These patents are the basis for Google's modular phone project, called [[Project Ara#cite note-Modu-15|Project Ara]]. After Modu was sold to Google, more than 30 hi-tech innovative companies were founded by Modu's ex-employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarker.com/technation/1.2069244|title=המפץ הגדול של מודו: החברה מתה - 30 סטארט־אפים נולדו|last=Orpaz|first=Inbal|date=July 2013|website=The marker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Modu, Dov was also the chairman of [[Tower Semiconductor]], a developer and manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. During his tenure, he turned the struggling company around towards profitability. Moran was also chairman of Biomas, a developer of innovative pharmaceuticals.

In 2011, Moran founded [[Comigo]], a company with a vision of revolutionizing the TV viewing experience. The company developed a multi-screen platform for Pay TV operators. Moran is acting as the chairman of the company.

=== Inventions ===
Moran has been involved with a number of inventions, mostly in the field of infrastructure technologies. He says he has filed over 40 patents and patent applications.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Inventions he's been involved with include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ybook.co.il/book/6794/100-%D7%93%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%95%D7%90-%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA 100 Doors - An introduction to entrepreneurship], "Yedioth Books" website (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/business-40706984/dov-moran-the-man-behind-the-memory-stick|title=Dov Moran: The man behind the memory stick|date=24 July 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/interview-hi-tech-guru-dov-moran-inventor-usb-flash-drive-dullaway|title=An interview with hi-tech guru Dov Moran, the inventor of the USB flash drive|last=Dullaway|first=Natasha|date=July 24, 2017|website=.4yfn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5426">'''Employment practices liability''' is an area of [[United States labor law]] that deals with [[Wrongful dismissal|wrongful termination]], [[sexual harassment]], [[discrimination]], [[invasion of privacy]], [[false imprisonment]], [[breach of contract]], [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]], and [[Wage theft|wage]] and hour law violations. It may be categorized as a form of professional liability. Employment practices [[liability insurance]] (EPL) is sold as a type of management liability insurance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irmi.com/term/insurance-definitions/management-liability-insurance|title=Management Liability Insurance {{!}} Insurance Glossary Definition {{!}} IRMI.com|last=|first=|date=|website=www.irmi.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124205710/https://www.irmi.com/|archive-date=2018-11-24|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is related to [[professional liability insurance]].

Most commonly, employment practices [[Legal liability|liability]] deals with laws and protections brought under [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the ADA ([[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]]) of 1990, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], ADEA ([[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]]) of 1967, and [[Family and Medical Leave Act]] (FMLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wage and Hour Division (WHD)|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm|publisher=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.property-casualty.com/Issues/2010/June-1421-2010/Pages/EPL-Insurers-Still-Avoid-WageHour-Coverage-Grants-For-Large-Employers.aspx |EPL Insurers Still Avoid Wage-&amp;-Hour Coverage Grants For Large Employers&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) interprets and enforces these laws.

The EEOC recognizes eleven types of employment practices discrimination: age, disability, equal pay/compensation, genetic information, national origin, pregnancy, race/color, religion, retaliation, sex, and sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discrimination by Type|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/index.cfm|publisher=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of annual claims totals suggests that EPL claims rates correspond to unemployment rates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creditunionmagazine.com/articles/37782-tough-economy-fuels-rise-in-employment-liability|title=Tough Economy Fuels Rise in Employment Liability|publisher=CreditUnionMagazine.com|accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2007 to 2008, total claims in the U.S. jumped 13%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2009/05/01/no-surprises-high-unemployment-makes-the-case-for-epli|title=No Surprises!

==EPL insurance==
A growing product on the [[insurance]] markets is employment practices [[liability insurance]] (EPL), a type of [[insurance policy|policy]] that business owners can buy to protect their organizations against employee suits for rights protected under acts above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI)|url=http://www.eperils.com/employment-practices-liability-insurance-epl/|publisher=Executive Perils|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, with the expansion of [[privacy law]](s), employee privacy concerns have come to the fore as private employee data is stored electronically. This is not always covered under an EPL policy, but the insurance industry has responded by offering cyber liability and network security policies.

Importantly, there are both federal and state statutes that govern an employer's liability to its employees. Laws also differ from state to state; e.g., California, is often considered a pro-employee state when it comes to employers' liability.

Like most kinds of [[professional liability insurance]], EPL insurance policies operate on a claims-made basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/features/2005/10/03/61167.htm|title=The Ins and Outs of Claims-Made Policies|publisher=Insurance Journal|accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that policyholders can only receive insurance benefits if they are covered both at the time of the discrimination incident that triggered the claim and at the time when the claim is filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insureon.com/blog/post/2013/08/05/what-is-claims-made-coverage.aspx|title=What Is Claims-Made Coverage?|publisher=insureon.com |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Small and Medium Enterprises]] (SMEs) are defined by the [[European Commission]] as having less than 250 employees, independent (with no shareholder having over a 25% stake in the business) and with an annual turnover of no more than €50 million or annual balance sheet of €43 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs): SME Definition|url=http://ec.europa.ec/enterprise/politices/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMEs  have been identified as a problem area in the field of [[environmental regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=David|author2=Lynch-Wood Gary|title=Drivers of environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs and implications for CSR|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Del Brío|first=Jesús|author2=Junquera Beatriz|title=A review of the literature on environmental innovation management in SMEs: implications for public policies|journal=Technovation|year=2003|volume=23|issue=12|pages=939–948|doi=10.1016/s0166-4972(02)00036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the individual environmental impacts of SMEs are generally small in comparison to those of large corporations, the cumulative environmental impacts of the sector are large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petts|first=Judith|title=The regulator-regulated relationship and environmental protection: perceptions in small and medium sized enterprises|journal=Environment and Planning|year=2000|volume=18|issue=3|pages=191–192|doi=10.1068/c9861}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also pose particular problems for [[environmental governance]], showing little reception to new environment policy instruments (NEPIs) such as [[market-based instruments]], voluntary agreements and informational devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=David|author2=Lynch-Wood Gary|title=Drivers of environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs and implications for CSR|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problem areas==

There are approximately 4.7 million [[businesses]] in the UK of which 99.7% are [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enterprise Directorate Analytical Unit Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/enterprise/enterprisesmes/research-and-statistics/statistics/page38573.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090902162944/http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/enterprise/enterprisesmes/research-and-statistics/statistics/page38573.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 September 2009 |publisher=Department for Business and Innovation Skills |accessdate=16 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The large size of the sector lends itself to the idea that environmental impacts are cumulatively large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=David|author2=Lynch-Wood Gary|title=Drivers of environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs and implications for CSR|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there has been limited research into the [[Quantitative data|quantitative]] impacts of SMEs, the Marshall Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marshall Report|title=Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy|year=1998|publisher=(Report to Chancellor of the Exchequer, HM Treasury, London)}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimates that 60% of total [[carbon emissions]] in the UK are attributable to SMEs. SMEs are also responsible for around 60% of [[commercial waste]] and 43% of all serious industrial pollution incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From green to black and white: embedding sustainability in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)|url=http://www2.accaglobal.com/general/activities/library/small_business/sb_pubs|publisher=Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of [[Small and medium enterprises|SME]] environmental behaviour is generally poor. Failure to pursue [[eco-efficiency|eco-efficient]] measures has often been attributed to low levels of awareness and lack of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petts|first=Judith|author2=Herd Andrew |author3=Gerrard Simon |author4=Horne Chris |title=The climate and culture of environmental compliance within SMEs|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|year=1999|volume=8|issue=1|pages=14–30|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0836(199901/02)8:1&lt;14::aid-bse175&gt;3.0.co;2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that as the majority of SMEs serve local markets they are less likely to be exposed to international pressures or incentives, including those likely to promote [[eco-innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Del Brío|first=Jesús|author2=Junquera Beatriz|title=A review of the literature on environmental innovation management in SMEs: implications for public policies|journal=Technovation|year=2003|volume=23|issue=12|pages=939–948|doi=10.1016/s0166-4972(02)00036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that [[civil society]] has less concern for smaller firms’ actions, being more likely to direct their concern towards larger organisations which are seen to have the biggest impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=David|author2=Lynch-Wood Gary|title=Drivers of environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs and implications for CSR|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the 1980s and 1990s saw a shift in the perceived relationship between the [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[business practice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidheiny|first=Stephan|title=Changing Course: A Global Business Perspective on Development and the Environment|year=1992|publisher=MIT Press|location=Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it has only translated into actions for prominently large firms. This change in environmental [[business ethics]] stems mainly from ideas of ‘[[ecological modernisation]]', a school of thought advanced most notably by German scholars [[Joseph Huber (economist)|Joseph Huber]] and Martin Janicke. They challenged Max Weber’s theory of bureaucratic rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|year=1968|publisher=Bedminister Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theory which positions [[government]] as best placed to resolve [[environmental problems]].  Instead, the [[discourse]] of [[ecological modernisation]] claims that sufficient innovative capacity will come only from industry itself as it has the expertise and means to do so. This is posited with the idea of ‘steering’ industry onto more environmentally beneficial pathways through financial incentives.

This shift is clearly visible in the 1980 World Conservation Strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UCN, UNEP &amp; WWF|title=World ConservationStrategy|year=1980|publisher=(Gland, International Union for the Conservation of Nature)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which pushes environmental actions from reactive to anticipatory. The shift towards thinking in terms of ‘[[ecological modernisation]]’ has also involved a movement to ‘smart’ regulatory instruments involving more reflexive forms of law (law which pushes businesses to reflect on  and regulate their own practices) such as [[Environmental Management System]]s, Environmental Reporting and Disclosure Strategies, Market-Based Instruments and the social license. The latter of these being important in Corporate Social Responsibility.

Whilst ‘smart’ [[regulation]] is a promising concept, [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]] have been slow on the uptake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillary|first=Ruth|title=Environmental Management Systems and the smaller enterprise|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2004|volume=12|issue=6|pages=561–569|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2003.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have generally been observed to retain a reactive approach to positive environmental actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Del Brío|first=Jesús|author2=Junquera Beatriz|title=A review of the literature on environmental innovation management in SMEs: implications for public policies|journal=Technovation|year=2003|volume=23|issue=12|pages=939–948|doi=10.1016/s0166-4972(02)00036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has often suggested that a more comprehensive approach will be needed to improve environmental performance in the SME sector,&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Ole Erik|last2=S⊘nderga˚rd |first2=Bent|last3=Meredith |first3=Sandra|title=Environmental innovations in Small and Medium Sized Enterprises|journal=Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management|year=2002|volume=14|issue=1|pages=37–56|doi=10.1080/09537320220125874}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are based on three distinct theoretical perspectives;

* The strategic perspective highlights the importance of the way in which environmental issues are communicated and perceived by actors involved with SME [[governance]].
* The network perspective advances improving the environment from which SMEs obtain knowledge relating to new [[technological innovation]]s and;
* The internal competence perspective underlines a need to build the receptive capacity of SMEs in adjusting to new technological innovation.

==Structural issues==

It has been suggested that there is not yet a substantial structure in the [[UK]] which forces environmental matters onto the business agendas of UK SMEs. The choice of policy instruments in the UK has tended not to acknowledge the structural differences between large firms and [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]. For example, the EU White Paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Europa|title=White Papers|url=http://europa.eu/documentation/official-docs/white-papers/index_en.htm|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has often promoted a sectoral and ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to addressing the environmental impacts of business activities. Although acknowledging structural differences between industries is important, this distinction alone may undermine the recognition of important differences in large corporations and SMEs that may affect the way in which environmental issues are perceived or acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=Allan|title=Small firms’ training and competitiveness: building upon the small business as a learning organisation|journal=International Small Business Journal|year=1997|volume=15|issue=3|pages=13–29|doi=10.1177/0266242697153001}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to policy action, the White Paper has influenced the creation of ‘sectoral sustainability strategies’, voluntary conglomerates of firm representatives from specific industrial sectors. Such associations have been criticised for being unrepresentative of the interests due to the unequal power relations between large and small firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=Allan|title=Small firms’ training and competitiveness: building upon the small business as a learning organisation|journal=International Small Business Journal|year=1997|volume=15|issue=3|pages=13–29|doi=10.1177/0266242697153001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMEs are also perceived to often lack characteristics that would otherwise enable them to engage effectively with the [[sustainable development]] agenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petts|first=Judith|author2=Herd Andrew |author3=Gerrard Simon |author4=Horne Chris |title=The climate and culture of environmental compliance within SMEs|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|year=1999|volume=8|issue=1|pages=14–30|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0836(199901/02)8:1&lt;14::aid-bse175&gt;3.0.co;2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; barriers for effective engagement being both internal and external to the firm. It is thought that a lack of institutional enfranchisement of SMEs in the [[UK]] is also a key factor in understanding why [[environmental policies]] may be ineffective at encouraging proactive environmental performance within smaller firms.

==Corporate social responsibility==

Whilst [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] strategies have been intensively adopted by large and publicly visible corporations, the effectiveness of this type of social regulation with [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]] remains questionable. This is partly due to their size, as their smaller-scale activities are less visible within society. It is thought that many larger firms develop CSR strategies voluntarily to avoid disclosure for bad practice and to maintain and develop a [[shareholder]] base. Small firms however are not subject to the same incentives for practicing CSR. This is because they are defined by a limited [[shareholder]] base&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs): SME Definition|url=http://ec.europa.ec/enterprise/politices/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are unlikely to exhibit environmental and social bad practice on a scale worthy of media attention. These ideas are exemplified in a study by Lynch-Wood and Williamson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=David|author2=Lynch-Wood Gary|title=Drivers of environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs and implications for CSR|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has suggested that SME environmental practice is driven by ‘business performance’ and ‘[[regulation]]’, rather than the ‘business case’ (i.e. maintaining and improving shareholder base)  which CSR practice stems from. It is also apparent that smaller firms may not have the available financial resources for pursuing costly CSR strategies (CSR programmes typically involving funding community projects).

Voluntary measures as a whole have been problematized by some scholars with a suggestion that environmental practice in SMEs is often constrained by free-market decision-making frames that encourage [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] to the detriment of beyond compliance social and environmental behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibb|first=Allan|title=Small firms’ training and competitiveness: building upon the small business as a learning organisation|journal=International Small Business Journal|year=1997|volume=15|issue=3|pages=13–29|doi=10.1177/0266242697153001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental management systems==

[[Environmental Management System|Environmental Management Systems (EMS)]] such as [[ISO 14001]] and [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]] seek to provide all businesses (regardless of size and [[industry]]) with the means to develop systematic approaches to improving environmental performance. [[ISO 14001]] was purportedly written with the chipshop owner in mind so as to defend its use across the entire EU business community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillary|first=Ruth|title=An Assessment of the Implementation Status of Council Regulation (No 1836/93) Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) in the European Union Member States (AIMS-EMAS)|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/emas|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst EMS is supposed to be suited for SME use, rates of uptake have been marginal. It is estimated that in 1999 only 24% of [[UK]] [[businesses]] registered with EMAS were SMEs, whilst no figures are available for [[ISO 14001]] based on company size&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillary|first=Ruth|title=An Assessment of the Implementation Status of Council Regulation (No 1836/93) Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) in the European Union Member States (AIMS-EMAS)|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/emas|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most promoted incentive for businesses implementing EMS is generally cost-savings. A pan-EU survey of businesses using EMAS identified that cost-savings were indeed the biggest perceived benefit to arise from implementation across [[Business|enterprises]] in [[Europe]] however SMEs placed this second claiming EMAS mainly benefited corporate image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillary|first=Ruth|title=Environmental Management Systems and the smaller enterprise|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|year=2004|volume=12|issue=6|pages=561–569|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2003.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst [[ISO 14001]] was designed with the chip shop man in mind, the requirements of EMS should not be underestimated. The ISO 14001 follows a basic structure requiring business to define an [[environmental policy]], environmental aspects register (detailing applicable environmental legislation) and annually reviewed objectives and targets (in reference to environmental aspects). Without support or training, these elements can be difficult to understand. ISO 14001 requires [[internal auditing]](on an annual basis) meaning extra constraints such as time dedicated to staff training (as it cannot be undertaken by the individual responsible for overseeing the management system). Certification and Validation are expensive and SMEs especially may require support from consultants, further adding to costs.

Whilst these financial burdens may have minimal impact on larger corporations, for smaller firms the costs of implementation and upkeep may out-weigh the cost savings achieved through the EMS. If SMEs are to pursue EMS it is likely to be a result of [[supply chain]] pressure rather than ideas of financial gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=David|author2=Lynch-Wood Gary|title=Drivers of environmental behaviour in manufacturing SMEs and implications for CSR|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|year=2006|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental innovation==

The diffusion of cleaner technologies and [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] (i.e. through the use of EMS) has been limited in the SME sector. This is thought to offer a key challenge to policy makers as [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]] lack sufficient network relations.&lt;ref name=Hansen /&gt; A lack of resources often entails that the firm will only participate in limited network activities for example with only one prominent customer or supplier. This limited network activity limits the scope for transferring information on [[technological innovation]]s.

==Changing legislation==

More recently structural problems regarding SME [[governance]] have been recognised by the [[European Union]]. In June 2008 the ‘[[Small Business Act for Europe|Small Business Act]]’ (SBA) for Europe was adopted. The act seeks to promote a greater range of incentives for SME good practice with the aim of bringing the sector in line with the [[sustainable development]] agenda.

Principle 9 ‘Turning environmental challenges into opportunities’ is seen as pivotal in steering SMEs onto more environmentally active pathways.  In line with this principle several member states have provided energy efficiency funding either through subsidies or encouraging loan conditions as well as varying degrees of cost-free consultancy support to SMEs.

The SBA review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SBA review: what has been done and what is to be done for European SMEs|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/11/109&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=fr|publisher=Europa|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  invites [[member states]] to use an "SME test" to assess whether disproportionate effects will be realised in relation to enterprise size. It has also been recognised that greater regulatory incentives need to be given for SMEs to adopt [[ISO 14001]] or [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]]. The review paper sets out to provide greater networking support to SMEs. It is theorised that by facilitating the use of networks it will be possible for information resources regarding [[eco-innovation]]s to be transferred across a broader array of firms, including those from the SME sector.&lt;ref name=Hansen /&gt; The  SBA review also recognises that ‘whilst SMEs have some market incentives to optimise their resource use, in many cases the market signals are not easy to identify’ they also state that ‘SMEs face challenges of limited information, time and human and financial resources’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SBA review: what has been done and what is to be done for European SMEs|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/11/109&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=fr|publisher=Europa|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that to overcome these challenges it will be necessary to develop incentives such as financial assistance. It is said that the Enterprise Europe Network will provide incentives for good environmental practice by offering assistance to SMEs marketing products and services resulting from best practice, particularly those adopting [[Low-carbon economy|low carbon technologies]].

Although the aims of the [[Small Business Act for Europe|SBA]] for [[Europe]] are seen as necessary for catalysing positive change in the environmental business performance of the SME sector it is not legally binding.

'''European Digital SME Alliance''' is a [[community]] of ICT small and medium enterprises ([[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SME]]s). Its members are national sectorial digital SME associations in 28 countries and regions in the [[EU]] and neighboring countries, all together it associates more than 20.000 SMEs. DIGITAL SME was established in 2007 (back then it was named Pan European ICT &amp; eBusiness Network for SME) to represent the voice of ICT SMEs and their interests in the European institutions and other international organisations. DIGITAL SME is the first European association of the ICT sector exclusively.  A current president is [[Oliver Grün]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/pin-sme-changed-name-european-digital-sme-alliance/ European Digital SME Alliance], PIN-SME changed its name into European DIGITAL SME Alliance, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holacloud.eu/launch-of-the-european-digital-sme-alliance-at-cebit2016/ Hola Cloud], Launch of the European Digital SME Alliance at CEBIT2016, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/oliver-grun-elected-president-european-digital-sme-association/ European Digital SME Alliance], Oliver Grün elected President of the European Digital SME Association Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and main achievements ==

Following a prominent public discussion on patentability of software, the Pan European ICT &amp; eBusiness Network for SMEs was founded in 2007. Its establishment was initiated by [[UEAPME]] (European Association of Craft, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ueapme.com/ Official website UEAPME],  Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; whose member DIGITAL SME has been from then on.

In 2013, the Pan European ICT &amp; eBusiness Network for SMEs was among the founding members of SBS (Small Business Standards).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs-sme.eu/ SBS], The European association representing and supporting SMEs in the standardisation process. Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, DIGITAL SME representatives have always been appointed to SBS Board, and its experts have been taking part in the technical committees of European [[standardisation]] bodies: George Sharkov – [[ETSI]] TC CYBER expert, Massimo Vanetti – OneM2M expert, Fabio Guasconi – ISO/IEC JCT 1 SC 27 expert, George Babinov – ETSI ATTM expert, Emil Dimitrov – ETSI TCCE expert. In addition, DIGITAL SME and SBS representative prof. Vladimir Poulkov was elected as a vice chairman of the ETSI general assembly in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsi.org/news-events/news/1146-2016-12-news-etsi-s-general-assembly-chairman-reappointed-new-vice-chair-representing-smes?highlight=YToxOntpOjA7czo3OiJwb3Vsa292Ijt9 ETSI], ETSI’s General Assembly chairman reappointed, new vice chair representing SMEs Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/etsi-elects-vladimir-poulkov-digital-sme-new-vice-chairman/ European Digital SME Alliance], ETSI elects Vladimir Poulkov (DIGITAL SME) as new Vice Chairman Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Pan European ICT &amp; eBusiness Network for SMEs has changed its name to European DIGITAL SME Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/pin-sme-changed-name-european-digital-sme-alliance/ European Digital SME Alliance], PIN-SME changed its name into European DIGITAL SME Alliance Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, it became a founding member of another important body – European Cyber Security Organisation ([[ECSO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ecs-org.eu/cppp ESCO], About the cPPP, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/commissioner-oettinger-launches-eu-cyber-security-partnership-digital-sme-founding-partner/ European Digital SME Alliance], Commissioner Oettinger launches EU Cyber Security Partnership – DIGITAL SME as founding partner Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; DIGITAL SME is particularly active also in the management of ECSO: its President Oliver Grün was appointed as SME member of ECSO Managing Board and of the Partnership Board,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/digital-sme-president-oliver-grun-appointed-sme-board-member-ecso-european-cyber-security-organisation/ Digital SME], DIGITAL SME President Oliver Grün appointed SME Board Member at ECSO, the European Cyber Security Organisation Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; while DIGITAL SME’s Secretary General Sebastiano Toffaletti is chairing the WG4 - Support to SMEs, coordination with countries (in particular East and Central EU) and regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecs-org.eu/working-groups/wg4-support-to-smes-coordination-with-countries-in-particular-east-and-central-eu-and-regions ESCO], WG4: Support to SMEs, coordination with countries (in particular East and Central EU) and regions, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year (2016), DIGITAL SME has also became a member and a pledger &lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-4081_en.htm European Commission], Commission launches Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition to help Europeans in their career and daily life, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.neweurope.eu/press-release/commission-launches-digital-skills-and-jobs-coalition-to-help-europeans-in-their-career-and-daily-life/ New Europa], Commission launches Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition to help Europeans in their career and daily life Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; of the newly created Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/become-member-digital-skills-and-jobs-coalition European Commission], Become a member of the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; - an initiative created by the European Commission to tackle e-skills gap in Europe.

In the period of 2015-2016, DIGITAL SME was campaigning for the creation of an open market for data usage, where both manufacturers and users of data-producing machines are entitled to use the data. DIGITAL SME’s recommendations were taken up by the [[European Commission]] that announced the Communication on Building a European Data Economy&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-5_en.htm?locale=en European Commission], Commission outlines next steps towards a European data economy, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanying Staff Working document.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/staff-working-document-free-flow-data-and-emerging-issues-european-data-economy European Commission], Staff Working Document on the free flow of data and emerging issues of the European data economy, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The reference was made to DIGITAL SME’s position paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/digital/uploads/PS056-DIGITAL-SME_Position_Paper_Data_Economy.pdf  European Digital SME Alliance], Data Economy: an open data market unleashing

The campaign calls European SMEs to train young professionals and help them gaining digital skills through Apprenticeship schemes. In addition, DIGITAL SME President Oliver Grün joined the Coalition’s governing board.

In July 2017, reacting to the upcoming review of European Cybersecurity Strategy, European DIGITAL SME Alliance has published its position paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/digital/uploads/20170731-DIGITAL-SME-Cybersecurity-Position.pdf European Digital SME Alliance], European Cybersecurity Strategy: Fostering the SME ecosystem, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; on cybersecurity, developed in a cooperation with ECSO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsme.eu/europe-needs-cybersecurity-strategy-foster-sme-ecosystem/ European Digital SME Alliance], Europe needs a cybersecurity strategy to foster its SME ecosystem, Retrieved 2017-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extrusion coating''' is the coating of a molten web of [[synthetic resin]] onto a substrate material. It is a versatile coating technique used for the economic application of various [[plastics]], notably [[polyethylene]], onto [[paperboard]], [[corrugated fiberboard]], [[paper]], [[aluminium foil]]s, [[cellulose]], [[Non-woven]]s, or [[Plastic wrap|plastic films]].

==Process==
===Coating===
The actual process of extrusion coating involves extruding resin from a slot [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] at temperatures up to 320°C directly onto the moving web which may then passed through a nip consisting of a [[Elastomer|rubber]] covered pressure roller and a [[Chrome plating|chrome plated]] cooling roll. The latter cools the molten film back into the solid state and also imparts the desired finish to the plastic surface.  The web is normally run much faster than the speed at which the resin is extruded from the die, creating a coating thickness which is in proportion to the speed ratio and the slot gap. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite patent

| inventor      =Irion
| url =https://patents.google.com/patent/US2714571A/en
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laminating===
Extrusion [[laminating]] is a similar process except that the extruded hot molten resin acts as the [[Adhesive|bonding medium]] to a second web of material.

===Co-extrusion===
Co-extrusion is, again, a similar process but with two, or more, extruders coupled to a single die head in which the individually extruded melts are brought together and finally extruded as a multi-layer film.

==Uses==
The market for extrusion coating includes a variety of end-use applications such as liquid packaging, photographic, flexible packaging,  mill and industrial wrappings, transport packaging, sack linings, building, envelopes, medical/hygiene, and release base.

'''Felisa Rincón de Gautier''' (born '''Felisa Rincón Marrero''')&lt;ref group=note&gt;This name uses Spanish marriage naming customs; the first is the maiden family name ''''' "Rincón"''''' and the second or matrimonial family name is '''''"Gautier"'''''.&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''Doña Fela''') (January 9, 1897 &amp;ndash; September 16, 1994) was the first woman to be elected as the [[Mayor]] of a capital city in The [[Americas]].&lt;ref name="nuevodia2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/laalcaldesaquetrajolanieve-1344369.html|title=La alcaldesa que trajo la nieve|work=[[El Nuevo Día]]|author=Pérez, Jorge|date=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Rincón de Gautier was born on January 9, 1897 in [[Ceiba, Puerto Rico]]. The oldest of all siblings (Felisa, Josefina, Cecilia, Esilda, Ramón, Rafael, Enrique and Rita), she was politically influenced by her father, attorney Enrique Rincón Plumey, family of an earlier Mayor of Yabucoa.{{who|date=June 2015}} Her mother, teacher Rita Marrero Rivera, died when she was around 11 years old. However, her father was determined to give her the best education possible. She went to school in [[Fajardo, Puerto Rico|Fajardo]], [[Humacao, Puerto Rico|Humacao]] and [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] although she did not graduate from high school; in the summers she visited her uncle in San Lorenzo where she learned how to prepare medications [[pharmacy]] and became a [[pharmacist]].&lt;ref name="nuevodia2012"/&gt; 
Of Spanish descent; her direct paternal grandfather Francisco Rincón Martín came from [[Salamanca]], Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QV1Y-JQ2M Enrique Rincon Plumey] (shows grandparents names) - mentioned in the record of Maria Esilda Rincon Marrero&lt;/ref&gt;

After her mother died, her father married Mercedes Acha, the mother of her half brother Manuel. Felisa ran the household and raised her younger brothers and sisters.

In the early 20th Century, "there was no welfare on the island; no social department to provide money or clothing or food for the poor (but) no jíbaro would let another jíbaro starve. This was the most important truth she learned. The jíbaros were a people steeped in tradition, the noblest of which was their hospitality" (Ruth Gruber, Felisa Rincon de Gautier: The Mayor of San Juan).

An expert seamstress, Felisa set herself the goal of creating employment in Puerto Rico by launching a local clothing factory. In order to master necessary skills she worked for two years in New York City during the Great Depression, living with relatives, including her sister Josefina.

Upon her return to San Juan, she entered the wholesale/retail business and opened Felisa's Style Shop on Calle Fortaleza in Old San Juan. She also managed a flower shop called Miles de Flores. Throughout her lifetime, she remained closely tied to the Roman Catholic Church as she directed her efforts to raising the standards of living for impoverished Puerto Ricans.

==Women's rights activist==
Rincón de Gautier was a firm believer in the women's right to vote and was an active participant in the [[suffragist]] movement, motivating many women to register. When the law allowing women to vote was passed, Rincón de Gautier was the fifth woman to officially register.  In 1932, she joined the [[Liberal Party of Puerto Rico]], which believed in Puerto Rico's independence, and was named representative by the party's president [[Antonio R. Barceló]]. Motivated by the political ideas of [[Luis Muñoz Marín]], she left the Liberal Party and in 1938 helped organize the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="nuevodia2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preb.com/biog/felisare.htm|title=Felisa Rincón de Gautier: Official Biography|website=www.preb.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prboriken.com/felisa.htm|title=Felisa Rincon de Gautier|first=Hector|last=Davila|website=www.prboriken.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==

In 1940, Rincón de Gautier married the San Juan lawyer Genaro A. Gautier, who served as the Assistant [[Attorney General]] of Puerto Rico and [[Secretary General]] of the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Popular Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="nuevodia2012"/&gt; They had no children.

==Political career==

In 1946, she was elected mayor of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] - the first woman mayor of a capital city in the Americas. Under her leadership, San Juan was transformed into a Latin-American urban center. Rincón de Gautier designed innovative public services and established the first preschool centers called "Las Escuelas Maternales", which would eventually become the model for the [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museofelisarincon.com/english.htm|title=Fundación Felisa Rincón de Gautier Casa Museo San Juan Puerto Rico|website=www.museofelisarincon.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also renovated the public health system and was responsible for the establishment of the School of Medicine in San Juan.

Rincón worked with [[Ricardo Alegría]] to restore and conserve the historical structures of [[Old San Juan]] and provided housing and basic services to thousands of people. In 1951, during the [[Cold War]] era, she ordered the establishment of the island's first Civil Defense system which was under the directorship of Colonel [[Gilberto José Marxuach]].&lt;ref&gt;"heroe del 65 Satisfecho de Haber Cumplido su Deber"; ''El Mundo''; May 2, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; She often opened City Hall to the public and listened to concerns of the residents of the city. In 1959, San Juan was awarded the '''All American City Award'''.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

Rincón de Gautier started a Christmas tradition, which would be continued every year by the governors of Puerto Rico. On the ''[[Día de los Reyes]]'' (''Three Kings Day''), celebrated on January 6, she would bring gifts and treats to the poor and needy children.  In 1952, 1953 and 1954, she had plane loads of snow delivered to San Juan so that the children who had never seen or played in snow would be able to do so.&lt;ref name="nuevodia2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museofelisarincon.com/biografia.htm|title=Fundación Felisa Rincón de Gautier Casa Museo San Juan Puerto Rico|website=www.museofelisarincon.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Rincón was mayor of San Juan for 22 years, from 1946 to 1968.&lt;ref name="nuevodia2012"/&gt; Upon retiring, she served as the American [[Goodwill Ambassador]] for four United States Presidents. She served in Latin America, Asia, and Europe promoting friendship between those regions and the United States. When Felisa Rincón de Gautier died in San Juan, aged 97, on September 16, 1994, she was given the burial honors of a head of state. Dignitaries from all over the world attended her funeral service. Felisa Rincón de Gautier was buried at the Municipal Cemetery Monacillos in [[Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico|Río Piedras, Puerto Rico]]&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

==Honors==
In both Puerto Rico and the United States, numerous public structures and avenues have been named in honor of Rincón de Gautier. There is a Felisa Rincón de Gautier Museum and a parking lot with the name of Doña Fela on Calle Recinto Sur in Old San Juan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foursquare.com/v/estacionamiento-do%C3%B1a-fela/4c22b10eaa8e9c744d85f4d4 Estacionamiento Doña Fela]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico.com/museums/felisa-rincon-de-gautier/|title=Felisa Rincon de Gautier Museum, San Juan  - By Puerto Rico Channel|website=www.puertorico.com|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, both the Felisa Rincón de Gautier Institute for Law &amp; Public Policy in the [[Bronx]] and a public school (PS 376) in [[Brooklyn, New York]] are named in her honor.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

In May 29, 2014, The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored 12 illustrious women with plaques in the "La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorriqueña" (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women) in San Juan. According to the plaques the 12 women, who by virtue of their merits and legacies, stand out in the history of Puerto Rico. Rincón de Gautier was among those who were honored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://temascontroversialesvargas.blogspot.com/2014/05/la-mujer-en-nuestra-historia_2376.html} La Mujer en nuestra historia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fred Chase Koch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|k}}; September 23, 1900 – November 17, 1967) was an [[United States|American]] [[chemical engineer]] and [[entrepreneur]] who founded the [[oil refinery]] firm that later became [[Koch Industries]], a privately held company which, under the principal ownership and leadership of Koch's sons, [[Charles Koch|Charles]] and [[David Koch|David]], is listed by ''Forbes,'' as of 2015, as the second-largest [[privately held company]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | editor = Murphy, Andrea | year = 2015 | title = America's Largest Private Companies | format = online | journal = [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] | issue = October 28 | url=https://www.forbes.com/largest-private-companies/ | access-date = 19 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wayne_NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=Pulling the Wraps Off Koch Industries |first=Leslie |last=Wayne |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=Section 3; Page 1; Column 2 |date=20 November 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/business/pulling-the-wraps-off-koch-industries.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Fred C. Koch was born in [[Quanah, Texas]], the son of Mattie B. (née Mixson) and a Dutch immigrant, [[Harry Koch (businessman)|Harry Koch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEg6AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Mattie+B.+Mixson+Koch&amp;dq=Mattie+B.+Mixson+Koch&amp;hl=en |title=The Mixon-Mixson family, Volume 3 |first=John Leslie |last=Mixson |publisher=American Reference Publishers |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry began working  as a printer's apprentice in [[Workum]], [[Netherlands]].  He worked over a year at  printers' shops in The Hague and in Germany before coming to the U.S. in 1888,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= |journal=Discovery |title=Making Headlines |page=7 |url=http://www.kochind.com/files/discovery/DiscoveryApril2009.pdf |publisher=Koch Industries |date=April 2009 |format=Adobe Acrobat (*.PDF) }}&lt;/ref&gt; and owned the ''Tribune-Chief'' newspaper.&lt;ref name=Fisher_Forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOS_KochA&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Science of Success]]: How Market-Based Management Built the World's Largest Private Company |last=Koch |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles G.

==Business career==
Koch started his career with the [[Texaco#History|Texas Company]] in [[Port Arthur, Texas]],&lt;ref name=FMK/&gt; and later became chief engineer with the Medway Oil &amp; Storage Company on the [[Isle of Grain]] in [[Kent, England]]. In 1925 he joined a fellow MIT classmate, P.C. Keith, at Keith-Winkler Engineering in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Following the departure of Keith in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 2 |coauthors= |year=1984 |publisher=[[National Academy of Engineering]] |location= |isbn=0-309-03482-5 |page=148 |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=565&amp;page=148 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the firm became Winkler-Koch Engineering Company.&lt;ref name=Beacon/&gt;&lt;ref name=FMK/&gt;

In 1927, Koch developed a more efficient thermal [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] process for turning crude oil into gasoline which allowed smaller players in the industry to better compete with the oil majors. The larger oil companies quickly sued in response, filing 44 different lawsuits against Koch, and embroiling him in litigation for years. Koch was to prevail in all but one of the suits (which was later over-turned due to the fact that the judge had been bribed).&lt;ref name=Continetti&gt;{{cite news|first=Matthew |last=Continetti |authorlink=Matthew Continetti |title=The Paranoid Style in Liberal Politics |work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |date=April 4, 2011 |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/paranoid-style-liberal-politics_555525.html?nopager=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Koch's partner Lewis Winkler's former employer, Universal Oil Products (now [[UOP LLC]]), sued Winkler-Koch for [[patent infringement]]. Also that year, nearly three years before the patent case went to trial, Winkler-Koch signed contracts to build petroleum distillation plants in the [[Soviet Union]], which did not recognize intellectual property rights.&lt;ref name=cmd20140710&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Center for Media and Democracy]] |authorlink=Lisa Graves |first=Lisa |last=Graves |title=The Koch Brothers: The Extremist Roots Run Deep |url=http://www.prwatch.org/news/2014/07/12531/koch-brothers-roots-run-deep |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extended litigation effectively put Winkler-Koch out of business in the U.S. for several years. "Unable to succeed at home, Koch found work in the Soviet Union".&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer |title=Covert Operations: The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=August 30, 2010 |first=Jane |last=Mayer |authorlink=Jane Mayer }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1929 and 1932 Winkler-Koch "trained Bolshevik engineers&lt;ref name=TRAINING&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.oilru.com/or/26/466/ |title=Learning From American Experience |author=Prof. Alexander Igolkin |newspaper=Oil of Russia |date=1 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped [[Stalin]]'s regime set up fifteen modern oil refineries" in the [[Soviet Union]]. "Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch was deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration."&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; The company also built installations in countries throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia.&lt;ref name=Beacon&gt;{{cite news |title=Fred Koch, Industrialist, Dies in Utah |author=Dick Dilsaver |newspaper=The Wichita Beacon |date=18 November 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koch partnered with [[William Rhodes Davis]] to build the third-largest oil refinery serving the [[Third Reich]], a project which was personally approved by [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name=Confessore11Jan&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/us/politics/father-of-koch-brothers-helped-build-nazi-oil-refinery-book-says.html|title=Father of Koch Brothers Helped Build Nazi Oil Refinery, Book Says|first=Nicholas |last=Confessore |authorlink=Nicholas Confessore |accessdate=January 12, 2016|date=January 11, 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koch President and [[Chief Operating Officer|COO]] David L. Robertson acknowledged that Winkler-Koch provided the [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] unit for the 1934 [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]] refinery, but said that it was but one of many "iconic" American companies doing business in Germany at the time.&lt;ref name=Confessore12Jan&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/12/koch-industries-disputes-books-account-of-founders-role-in-building-a-nazi-refinery/|title=Koch Executive Disputes Book's Account of Founder's Role in Nazi Refinery |date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 13, 2016|first=Nicholas|last=Confessore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having succeeded in securing the family fortune, Koch joined new partners in 1940 to create the Wood River Oil and Refining Company, which later became known as [[Koch Industries]].

Fred Koch had a long history of heart problems. His son David described in 2010 how he received word that his father had died: "Father was on a hunting trip bird-shooting in Utah. He was in a blind with a gun loader next to him. He was having heart palpitations and wasn't shooting that well. Finally a lone bird came over. He took the shot and hit it square. The duck falls from the air. He turns to the loader and says, 'Boy, that was a magnificent shot,' and then keels over dead."&lt;ref name=NYMagParty/&gt;

==Political views==

In 1928, Koch traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] to build oil refineries, but he came to despise [[communism]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime.&lt;ref name=Fisher_Forbes&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr. Big |author=Daniel Fisher |magazine=Forbes |date=13 March 2006 |url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2006/0313/024.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TSOS_Koch&gt;{{cite book |title=The Science of Success: How Market-Based Management Built the World's Largest Private Company |last=Koch |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles G.

According to journalist [[Daniel Schulman (writer)|Daniel Schulman]], writing in ''[[Sons of Wichita|Sons of Wichita: How the Koch Brothers Became America's Most Powerful and Private Dynasty]]'', upon his return to the United States, Koch "saw evidence for communist infiltration everywhere" and the pamphlet was "a forceful, though deeply paranoid polemic intended to jar Americans from their apathy."&lt;ref name=sonsofwichita&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Sons of Wichita|Sons of Wichita: How the Koch Brothers Became America's Most Powerful and Private Dynasty]] |first=Daniel |last=Schulman |authorlink=Daniel Schulman (writer)|isbn=978-1455518739 |publisher=Hachette Book Group |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41,46}} According to his son, Charles, "Many of the Soviet engineers he worked with were longtime Bolsheviks who had helped bring on the revolution." It deeply bothered Fred Koch that so many of those so committed to the Communist cause were later purged.&lt;ref name=Continetti/&gt; According to his son, David, his father "was a very conservative Republican and was not a fan of big government,"&lt;ref name=Continetti/&gt; and was paranoid about communism.&lt;ref name=NYMagParty/&gt; David told author [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]] his father "was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong with government and government policy.

In 1958, Koch became a founding member of the [[John Birch Society]], an American political [[advocacy group]] that opposes [[entryism|communist infiltration]] and supports [[limited government]].&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYMagParty/&gt;&lt;ref name=JBS&gt;{{cite book |title=Roads to Dominion: Right-Wing Movements and Political Power in the United States |last=Diamond |first=Sara |year=1995 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=NY |isbn=0-89862-862-8 |page=324 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koch held John Birch Society chapter meetings in the basement of his family's home in [[Wichita, Kansas]].&lt;ref name=sonsofwichita/&gt;{{rp|49}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=17 things you didn't know about the Koch brothers |first= Matea |last=Gold |work=Washington Post|date=May 20, 2014 |accessdate=July 28, 2015 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/05/20/17-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-koch-brothers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gershon Shafat''' ({{lang-he|גרשון שפט}}, born 6 December 1927) is an [[Israel]]i former politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Tehiya]] during the mid–1980s and early 1990s.

==Biography==
Born '''Gershon Staub''' in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] in 1927, Shafat [[aliyah|emigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1934. He was educated at the Moria high school in [[Tel Aviv]], and spent two years studying history and sociology at university.

He became a member of the [[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, and later joined the [[National Religious Party]]. In 1946 he was amongst the founders of kibbutz [[Ein Tzurim]]. After the kibbutz was conquered by the [[Jordan]]ian Army, he was a [[prisoner of war]] for ten months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=659 Gershon Shafat: Public Activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; When released, he was a member of the group that re-established Ein Tzurim in a new location.

From 1956 until 1958 he worked as the manager of the Purchasing Organisation, and as the Co-ordinator of the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]'s political committee. Between 1961 and 1977 he managed a Tadmor factory

In 1974 he became a member of the [[Gush Emunim]] [[Israeli settlement|settlement]] movement's secretariat, and held the post of political secretary between 1976 and 1979. He joined the new [[Tehiya]] party in 1979, and served as its secretary-general until 1985. Placed fifth on the party's list,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Lustick|Lustick, IS]] (1988) [http://www.polisci.upenn.edu/faculty/data/lustick/for_the_land/lustick13.html For The Land and The Lord: The Evolution of Gush Emunim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612150545/http://www.polisci.upenn.edu/faculty/data/lustick/for_the_land/lustick13.html |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was elected to the Knesset in [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]], as Tehiya won five seats. Although he lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]], he returned to the Knesset on 31 January 1990 as a replacement for [[Yuval Ne'eman]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexbyknesset_eng.asp?knesset=12 Knesset Members in the Twelfth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; who had resigned his seat. Shafat lost his seat again in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1992|1992 elections]], in which Tehiya failed to cross the electoral threshold.

'''Harry Frank Guggenheim''' (August 23, 1890 – January 22, 1971) was an [[Americans|American]] businessman, diplomat, publisher, philanthropist, aviator, and horseman.

==Life==
He was born August 23, 1890, in [[Long Branch, New Jersey|West End, New Jersey]] to Florence Shloss and [[Daniel Guggenheim]]. He graduated in 1907 from the [[Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School|Columbia Grammar School]] in Manhattan, and then he attended the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] of [[Yale University]]. He later left Yale and served a three-year apprenticeship at the [[American Smelting and Refining Company]] in Mexico. The company was owned by the Guggenheim family. He resumed his education in 1910 at England's [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from Cambridge, both in 1913.

In 1917 he bought a [[Curtiss flying boat]] and moved to [[Manhasset, New York]]. In September 1917 he joined the [[United States Navy Reserve]] and served overseas in [[France]], [[England]] and [[Italy]] as a member of the [[First Yale Unit]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=Trimble&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, his parents established the [[Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation]] and he was made a director and later president. He sponsored [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s&lt;ref name="lehm"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehman|first=Milton|date=Oct 4, 1963|title=How Lindbergh Gave a Lift to Rocketry|journal=LIFE Magazine|volume=55|issue=14|pages=118ff|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uFIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; private research into liquid fuel rocketry and space flight.

He provided funds for the establishment of the first Guggenheim School of Aeronautics at [[New York University]] in 1925. He became president of the [[Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics]] a year later. This fund, totaling $3 million, included an equipment loan for operating the first regularly scheduled commercial airline in the United States. It also provided for the establishment of the first weather reporting exclusively for passenger airplanes.

He was the United States ambassador to [[Cuba]] from 1929 until his resignation in 1933.

==National Advisory Committee of Aeronautics==
In 1929, President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed Guggenheim to serve on the National Advisory Committee of Aeronautics, a position that he held until 1938. In 1948, as president of the [[Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation]], he continued to support United States aviation progress when he helped organize the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Center at the [[California Institute of Technology]] and the Guggenheim Laboratories for Aerospace Propulsion Sciences at [[Princeton University]].

==''Newsday''==
Guggenheim, with his third wife, [[Alicia Patterson]], founded the newspaper ''[[Newsday]]'' in 1940.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Guggenheim was president of the company, while his wife was editor and publisher until her death in 1963, then he assumed those duties until 1967.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The circulation of Newsday reached 450,000 and received the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1954.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1967, he turned over the [[publisher]] position to [[Bill Moyers]] and continued as president and editor-in-chief. But Guggenheim was disappointed by the liberal drift of the newspaper under Moyers, criticizing the "left-wing" coverage of Vietnam War protests.&lt;ref name="time42770"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909136,00.html|title=The Press: How Much Independence?

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
Harry Guggenheim was a participant in the founding of the [[New York Racing Association]]. From 1929 he was a major [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] owner and breeder. His [[Cain Hoy Stable]] raced in the United States and was the owner of numerous successful horses including the 1953 [[Kentucky Derby]] winner [[Dark Star (horse)|Dark Star]], the only horse ever to defeat the legendary [[Native Dancer]], and [[Eclipse Award]] winner [[Bald Eagle (horse)|Bald Eagle]]. Also he was the breeder and owner (until his death) of [[Ack Ack (horse)|Ack Ack]], who is in the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame]] and was [[American Horse of the Year]] in 1971.

==Death==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
Guggenheim died of [[cancer]] on January 22, 1971 at "Falaise", his home at [[Sands Point, New York|Sands Point]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was buried in [[Salem Fields Cemetery, Brooklyn|Salem Fields Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/01/23/archives/harry-guggenheim-dead-newsday-founder-was-80-harry-f-guggenheim.html ''New York Times'' January 3, 1971 article titled "Harry Guggenheim Dead; Newsday Founder Was 80"] Retrieved September 19, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6818718/harry-f.-guggenheim Findagrave memorial #6818718] Retrieved September 19, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4682">{{Marxism}}

In [[Marxist theory]] and [[Marxian economics]], the '''immiseration thesis''' (also referred to as '''emiseration thesis''') is derived from Karl Marx's analysis of economic development in [[capitalism]], implying that the nature of capitalist production stabilizes [[real wage]]s, reducing wage growth relative to total value creation in the economy, leading to worsening [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] in the workplace.

The immiseration thesis is related to Marx's analysis of the rising [[organic composition of capital]] and reduced demand for labor relative to capital equipment as technology develops.

==Marx==

Concerning the evolution of the worker's living conditions, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] argued that:

{{quotation|Within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productivity of labour are put into effect at the cost of the individual worker [...] All means for the development of production undergo a [[dialectic]]al inversion so that they become a means of domination and [[Rate of exploitation|exploitation]] of the producers; they distort the worker into a fragment of a man, they degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine, they destroy the actual content of his labour by turning it into a torment, they [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienate]] from him the intellectual potentialities of the labour process [...], they transform his life into working-time, and {{clarify|text=his wife and child beneath the wheels of the juggernaut of capital.|reason=missing verb|date=February 2018}} But all methods of the production of [[Surplus value|surplus-value]] are at the same time methods of [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]], and every extension of accumulation becomes, conversely, a means for the development of these methods. It follows therefore that in proportion as capital accumulates, the situation of the worker, be his payment high or low, ''must grow worse''.|Karl Marx, ''[[Das Kapital|Das Kapital: Kritik der politischen Ökonomie]]'', 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Marx, Karl (2007): ''Capital: A Critique of Political Economy: The Process of Capitalist Production''. Volume I, part 2. Cosimo Inc., pp. 708-709&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Marx argued that, in accordance with the labour theory of value, capitalist competition would necessitate the gradual replacement of workers with machines, allowing an increase in productivity, but with less overall value for each product produced, as more products can be made in a given amount of time, meaning that economic output would increase, but real wages would stay stable, because the input of human labour  stays the same.

Marx also noted that this movement is not merely an abstract relation, but that it is a result of class struggle, and it could be temporarily stopped should wages dip below an amount that the proletariat deem acceptable.

==Diverging views==
===Frankfurt School===
{{main|Frankfurt School}}

The immiseration thesis was equally questioned by later theorists, notably by early members of the [[Frankfurt School]]. For [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] in the economy had effectively abolished the tension in capitalism between the "[[relations of production]]" and "material [[productive forces]] of society"—a tension which, according to traditional Marxist theory, constituted the primary contradiction within capitalism. The previously "free" market (as an "unconscious" mechanism for the distribution of goods) and "irrevocable" [[private property]] of Marx's epoch have gradually been replaced by the [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and socialized ownership of the [[means of production]] in contemporary Western societies. The dialectic through which Marx predicted the emancipation of modern society is thus suppressed, effectively being subjugated to a positivist rationality of domination:

{{quotation|[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe.

'''Jabez Abel Bostwick''' (September 23, 1830 – August 16, 1892) was an American businessman who was a founding partner of [[Standard Oil]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Delhi (town), New York|Delhi, New York]], while still a boy his family moved to a farm in [[Ohio]]. As a young man, Jabez Bostwick first worked in a hardware store then opened his own. He next ventured into the [[cotton]] brokerage business in [[Cincinnati]] but soon moved to [[New York City]] where he became involved in the production side of the [[oil]] business through his firm, Tilford &amp; Bostwick established in 1866. He bought out Tilford and in 1878 went into successful partnership with [[Henry Flagler]] and the Rockefeller brothers, [[John D. Rockefeller|John]] and [[William Rockefeller|William]]. Jabez Bostwick served as the Secretary-Treasurer of the Standard Oil Trust.

Jabez Bostwick was also a major shareholder and President of the [[New York and New England Railroad]], a substantial shareholder in the [[Housatonic Railroad]], a member of the [[New York Cotton Exchange]], and who sat on numerous other corporate boards. In spite of the enormous wealth he obtained, Bostwick was known as a modest man of exemplary character who was a devout member of the [[Baptist Church]]. He donated money to his church and to educational institutions such as [[Wake Forest College]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] and [[University of Richmond|Richmond College]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].

Jabez Bostwick died in a freak [[stable]] fire at Friedheim, his summer residence in Mamaroneck, New York, in Westchester County. During the fire he tried to save his horses and carriages. As he and the stable hands pushed a coach from the carriage house he got overrun by a [[Private Coach]] weighing 2000/3000 lbs. His widow, Helen C. Bostwick, upon her death on April 27, 1920 left an estate per public record that was valued at $29,264,181.00,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1921/11/05/archives/29264181-to-heirs-of-mrs-bostwick-widow-of-the-standard-oil-man.html $29,264,181 TO HEIRS OF MRS.

'''Jennifer A. Chatman''' is the Paul J. Cortese Distinguished Professor of [[Management science|Management]] at the [[Haas School of Business]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Chatman received her BA and PhD from UC Berkeley and began her career at the [[Kellogg School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago, Illinois, before returning to UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. She served as the Marvin Bower Fellow at the [[Harvard Business School]].

== Research ==

Professor Chatman's research focuses on 1) how a culture emphasizing innovation and adaptation buffers firms from economic volatility, 2) how CEO’s personality influences organizational culture, and 3) how diverse groups perform in high pressure situations. Professor Chatman has developed the Organizational Culture Profile (OCP) for assessing organizational culture strength and content as well as the gaps between an organization’s current and desired culture.

Professor Chatman’s research has been highlighted in ''the Atlantic'', ''Business Week'', ''Business 2.0'', the ''Financial Times'', ''Fortune'', ''Inc.'', ''Glamour'', ''The Jungle'', the ''New York Times'', the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', the ''Los Angeles Times'', the ''Wall Street Journal'', and ''Working Mother''. She was a keynote speaker for the Private Equity Women’s Conference, the AACSB Dean’s Conference, and the Economist Innovation Summit. She interviewed Jack Welch for the Commonwealth Club, Comcast, and NPR, and has appeared on television and radio over the years to talk about her research and consulting work. She has written articles that have appeared in numerous academic journals.

=== Culture, adaptability, and firm performance ===

Chatman's research explores how [[organizational culture]] relates to organizational performance and also focuses on providing a conceptually rigorous and valid approach to assessing culture.

Relevant papers:

Parsing organizational culture: The joint influence of culture content and strength on performance in high-technology firms, ''Journal of Organizational Behavior'', 35 (6): 785-808.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/chatman/papers/Chatman-2014-JOB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

''Group and Organization Management'', 39 (6): 595–625.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/chatman/papers/GOM-OReilly-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norms and group composition ===

Classic research in psychology, dating back to Sherif’s pioneering work on the so-called "Robber's Cave" experiments showed that social norms, particularly those that orient group members toward group goals, are remarkably strong predictors of behavior. Professor Chatman’s work has been part of a more recent effort to link norms to processes and outcomes among diverse work groups.

Relevant papers:

* Goncalo, J., Chatman, J., Duguid, M., &amp; Kennedy, J. (2015) Creativity from constraint: How the PC norm influences creativity in mixed-sex work groups. ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 60: 1-30.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/chatman/papers/ASQ-2015-Goncalo-1-30.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership reconceptualized as influence and status ===

Professor Chatman’s research on leadership focuses on reconceptualizing traditional theories of leadership which have, by many accounts, reached a point of stagnation. By stripping  down the psychological basis of leadership in influence she is able to make more progress in understanding how leaders affect followers in organizations.

Relevant papers:

Teece and M. Augier. ''Palgrave Encyclopedia of Strategic Management''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palgraveconnect.com/esm/doifinder/10.1057/9781137294678.0362&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speaking and board memberships ==

Professor Chatman's research and consulting focus on the business advantages of leveraging organizational culture and leading strategic change, and she has worked with a variety of organizations including Adobe, Apple University, Boise-Cascade, British Telecom, Chiron, Citigroup, Cisco Systems, The Coca-Cola Company, ConocoPhillips, DNV, eBay, Fannie Mae, First Data, Franklin Templeton, Freddie Mac, Gallo Winery, Genentech, Goldman Sachs, Hotwire, Intel, Kaiser-Permanente, Maersk, Mars Inc., Microsoft, New York Life, Novartis, Office of Hawaiian Affairs, PG&amp;E, Pixar, the Portland Trailblazers, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Qualcomm, Roche, Sandia National Laboratories, Salesforce.com, Silver Spring Networks, Statoil, the U.S. Postal Service,  the U.S. Treasury, True Ventures, and Warburg Pincus.

She is a member of the Board of Directors of Simpson Manufacturing (NYSE: SSD) and a Trustee of Prospect Sierra School. She is an academic partner with The Trium Group. She teaches a variety of executive management and MBA courses focusing on leveraging high performance cultures, leading change, and making effective decisions. She has taught in executive education programs at a number of universities, and is faculty director of UC Berkeley’s Center for Executive Education (CEE) flagship program for senior executives, The Berkeley Executive Leader Program.

Jock’s paternal grandfather, [[William Middleton Campbell|William Middleton]], was [[Governor of the Bank of England]] between 1907 and 1909, a man of great prestige. His mother Mary was of aristocratic Irish stock.  Jock was born on 8 August 1912 and at the age of three was sent to the opulent family seat of his mother’s family, [[Glenstal Castle]] in southern Ireland, to be safe from the bombs of the German [[Zeppelins]]. After the war Jock returned to the family home in Kent. He later attended [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]].

==Family background: the slave trade==
It was John Campbell (Senior), Jock’s great-great-grandfather, ship owner and merchant of Glasgow, who, towards the end of the 18th century, first established the fortunes of the Campbell family in the [[West Indies]], through the [[slave trade]]. At the time, Glasgow trading houses, long-experienced in servicing the needs of North American slave plantations, were ready to capitalise on new opportunities in the sugar industry arising on the West Indies. By the 1780s they were supplying the two most important British exports to the West Indies, herring and coarse linen goods.&lt;ref name="Alastair Campbell P282"/&gt;

Among the principal beneficiaries of this booming trade were John Campbell (Senior) and Company, which supplied merchandise to the slave plantations along the coast of Guiana, then in Dutch hands. It was in this role of supplier that the company first began to acquire plantations along the Essequibo Coast of Guiana, from planters facing bankruptcy.

Jock Campbell later remarked often that, in acquiring estates through foreclosure, his ancestors became ''de facto'' slave-owners. Campbell himself abhorred slavery, and it was in fact the urge to make good the misdeeds of his own family that was the catalyst for his own reformist ideals.

On 5 May 1971, in the House of Lords, Campbell dissociated himself from his ancestors, arguing that "maximising profits cannot and should not be the sole purpose, or even the primary purpose, of business."

By the 20th century, the company of Curtis, Campbell and Co had its established place in the British Guiana plantocracy; it owned Ogle Plantation in Demerara and Albion Estate, up the Atlantic coast in the Corentyne district, and a wharf in Georgetown. When Jock’s great-grandfather, Colin Campbell of Colgrain, died in 1919 he left £1 million, a fortune at the time. When his grandfather, William Middleton Campbell, died, he left £1.5 million – all of it from the cane fields of British Guiana.

==Arriving in British Guiana==
Jock went to British Guiana for the first time to take charge of the family estates, arriving in 1934. The Campbells owned Las Penitence Wharf on the Demerara River, Georgetown, where they were agents for the Harrison line of shipping. They also owned Ogle Estate, up the East Coast from Demerara, and Albion, further Eastward in the Berbice district. In his first few months in the colony Jock worked at the family’s wharf, assessing the claims made by merchants whose goods had been broached, broken or stolen.

After several months on the wharf he went to continue his apprenticeship at Albion Estate in the Essequibo District. One anecdote of this time is characteristic of the shock he suffered on seeing the appalling conditions of the workers:

When shown around the family plantation at Albion, in the Corentyne district of British Guiana, Jock was appalled by the living conditions of the coolies, the East Indian cane cutters. The East Indians had been brought into the country after the liberation of the slaves, and were housed in the same tiny, dark, vermin-infested, earth-floored “logies”. Next to the logies was a more pretentious building, clean, painted, smart-looking, a mansion in comparison to the shacks. “Jock enquired who lived in the hovels: 'Our coolies,' replied Bee (the estate manager). He then asked of the residents of the trimmed building. Bee said, 'Oh! We keep our mules there.' A naïve 22-year-old Jock asked flippantly: 'Why don’t you move your coolies to the mules’ palace and put your mules in the hovels?' A stunned Bee exclaimed cryptically: 'Mules cost money, sir!'"

==Reform of the sugar estates==
As the son of the estate owner, Jock had enormous influence in spite of his youth and soon embarked on a mission of reform, and this became his life work.
As the first step of plan, Jock urged his father and uncle to merge the family company the giant company Booker Brothers, McConnell and Co. The take-over took place in 1934, after which Jock quickly rose to chairman.

Bookers, as it was then known, at the time was a state within a state, owning almost all the colony’s sugar plantations and dominating the economic life of the country so much it was called “Booker’s Guiana”.  As head of this state, Jock went about implementing his reforms.

Jock was partly driven by the guilt of his family background, but also by the conviction that every business has a responsibility towards its workers; and that profit alone should not be the guiding principle of society. His reforms continued on a grander scale.

According to [[Ian McDonald (Guyanese writer)|Ian McDonald]], one of his employees: “All Jock’s abundant energy was converted to a faith that Booker had to mean something in a new deal for the West Indies… Demerara was his Damascus.”

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I believe that there should be values other than money in a civilised society.
I believe that truth, beauty and goodness have a place. Moreover, I believe that if businessmen put money, profit, greed and acquisition among the highest virtues, they cannot be surprised if, for instance, nurses, teachers and ambulance men are inclined to do the same.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In effect, Jock Campbell became a socialist-capitalist. He initiated a process in which Bookers was completely reorganised and recreated.

The sugar industry was transformed from a run-down, unprofitable, inhuman, paternalistic and plantocratic expatriate family concern into a rehabilitated, forward-looking, productive and dynamic enterprise. Guianese were placed in the highest positions; if they did not have the skills for these positions, they were sent away for training.

Sugar production grew from 170,000 tons to 350,000 tons. Estates were consolidated and factories modernised. Drainage and irrigation facilities and the whole infrastructure of field works were completely revamped. Agricultural practices and applications were overhauled in line with current world-class technology. The first sugar bulk-loading terminal in the Caribbean was established to replace the drudgery of loading sugar in bags.

The people side of the industry was revolutionised: remuneration vastly increased, the old logies eliminated and 15,000 new houses in 75 housing areas built with roads and water supplied. Medical services were upgraded to cater for all sugar workers and their families and the scourge of malaria was eradicated, Community Centres were established on all estates and welfare, sporting and library activities expanded. Training and education were immensely improved; scholarship programs initiated, and all along Guianisation moved forward until the time came when the industry was being run almost entirely by Guianese. It was an era of tremendous growth and change.

As a member of the [[Fabian Society]], Jock Campbell's key message was quite simple: &lt;blockquote&gt;
People are more important than ships, shops and sugar estates.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; Employees were greatly inspired by him. Said one: &lt;blockquote&gt;
We tried to act in the belief that business could not possibly just be about making money if only because that would be soul-destroyingly boring. Business had to be about making the lives of people better and more fulfilled. People in any case always came first however you considered what you were trying to do in business. You had a fourfold responsibility to people: to shareholders, to employees, to customers, to the community of people in which business operated and found its meaning. Creating profit was vital but not just for its own sake but for good, everyday, ordinarily human, immediately flesh and blood, life-enhancing purposes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Politics==

===British Guiana/Guyana===
In British Guiana, Jock met his foil in [[Cheddi Jagan]]. Jagan, himself the son of Indian indentured servants, quickly gained the confidence of the sugar workers, and in Guyana’s first general elections in 1953 became Prime Minister.

Jock was willing to work with Jagan, as both had the same aims, but Jagan made it clear that the sugar industry would be nationalised after independence. Jagan was removed from power by the British due to his Marxist leanings;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyana.org/govt/declassified_british_documents_1953.html The Suspension of the British Guiana Constitution – 1953 (Declassified British documents)]&lt;/ref&gt;
in his place came [[Forbes Burnham]].

===United Kingdom===
In 1966, Campbell was created a [[life peer]] by [[Harold Wilson]] and was active in the [[House of Lords]] on behalf of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=54790|first=Jonathan F.|last=Taylor|title=Campbell, John Middleton [Jock], Baron Campbell of Eskan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Booker Prize==
{{Main|Booker Prize}}
It is after leaving Guyana that Jock, who had always loved great literature, became instrumental in the initiation of a British literature prize.

Jock was an old friend and golfing partner of [[Ian Fleming]], author of the [[James Bond]] spy novels, who had recently been diagnosed as terminally ill with less than a year to live. During a game of golf Fleming turned to Jock for advice on securing his estate for his family from heavy taxation. Jock initially advised Fleming to turn to accountants and merchant bankers, but then had a new idea: Bookers could act as bankers for Fleming, beneficially for both parties.

As a result, Bookers acquired a 51% share in the profits of Glidmore Productions, the company handling the profits from worldwide royalties on Fleming's books, and the associated  merchandising rights – but not the film rights.

Thus was born the Bookers Author Division, with the injunction: &lt;blockquote&gt;
It should make money, not to mention being entertaining, and there could be advertising interest in it for some of our companies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bookers later acquired the copyrights of other well-known authors, including novelists [[Agatha Christie]], [[Dennis Wheatley]], [[Georgette Heyer]] and the playwrights [[Robert Bolt]] and [[Harold Pinter]]. It was the copyrights of Agatha Christie which, over time, contributed most to the profit of the Authors Division.

The [[Booker Prize]] was launched in 1969, after the publishers Jonathan Cape suggested that Bookers might sponsor a major fiction prize. A new sponsor for the prize was announced in April 2002, the Man Group, after which it became known as the [[Man Booker Prize]].

==New Statesman and Nation: The Jock Campbell/New Statesman Prize==
Jock was for a time Chairman of the [[New Statesman|New Statesman and Nation]]. &lt;!-- Does anybody know from when to when?  How did the "Jock Cammpbell/New Statesman Prize come about? --&gt;
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

==Milton Keynes Development Corporation==
{{Main|Milton Keynes Development Corporation|History of Milton Keynes}}
Jock was chairman for the [[Milton Keynes]] Development Corporation from 1967. The large, central park initially called City Park, was renamed [[Campbell Park]] in his honour. There is a memorial stone by the fountain in his honour which reads simply ''"Si monumentum requiris, circumspice"''. ("If you seek a monument, look about you", referring to the urban landscape created by his team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cobr.co.uk/e-cobr_information/cycling_initiatives/sections/cycle_routes/cycling_in_milton_keynes/cycling_in_milton_keynes.shtml Cycling in Milton Keynes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1973 he was awarded an honorary degree from the [[Open University]] as Doctor of the University.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

He stepped down from the post of chairman of Milton Keynes Development Corporation in 1983 and was replaced by Sir Henry Chilver, who remained in post until Milton Keynes Development Corporation was wound up on 1 April 1992.

From 1965 to 1966, he was a teacher in Jefferson Parish [[State school|public schools]]. In 1966, he began work as an accountant. By 1972, he started his own tax consulting firm, John A. Alario, Jr. Income Tax Service. He is a member of the [[National Society of Public Accountants]]. In 1973, he became a delegate for the Louisiana Constitutional Convention. From 1979 to 1985, he was chairman of the Louisiana Exposition Authority.&lt;ref name=votesmart /&gt;&lt;ref name=senate /&gt;

Alario has membership in the [[Knights of Columbus]], Louisiana Epilepsy Association, Louisiana International Deep Water Gulf Transfer Terminal Authority and the [[Westwego, Louisiana|Westwego]] Volunteer Fire Department. He was a delegate at the [[1972 Democratic National Convention|1972]], [[1996 Democratic National Convention|1996]] and [[2000 Democratic National Convention|2000]] [[Democratic National Convention]]s.&lt;ref name=votesmart /&gt;&lt;ref name=senate /&gt; He is a recipient of the [[Hale Boggs]] Memorial Award, named for the late Democrat [[U.S. Representative]] for [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]].&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;"Louisiana: Alario, John, ''Who's Who in American Politics, 2007-2008'' (Marquis Who's Who: [[New Providence, New Jersey|New Providence]], [[New Jersey]], 2007), p. 648&lt;/ref&gt;

Alario and his wife, the former Alba Williamson, have four children, John W., Jan M., Christopher Brian, and Kevin George Alario.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

==State Representative==
Alario became a member of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] in 1972. As a Representative, Alario was the chairman of the Appropriations, House Executive, and Ways and Means committees. He also served as chairman to the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget and the Joint Legislative Committee on Capital Outlay. He was a member of the House Commerce, House and Governmental Affairs, Legislative Budgetary Control, Municipal, Parochial, and Cultural Affairs, Natural Resources, Judiciary B, and Judicial committees.&lt;ref name=votesmart /&gt;&lt;ref name=senate /&gt;

He was selected by [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Edwin Edwards]] as [[Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] twice, from 1984 to 1988 and from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref name=votesmart /&gt; As the House Speaker, Alario was described by a colleague, [[Ron Gomez]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], as "a master of adding just the right degree of levity to defuse almost any potentially explosive situation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Gomez]], ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative'', [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Louisiana]]: Zemog Publishing, 2000, {{ISBN|0-9700156-0-7}}, pp. 59-70&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Alario removed Representative [[Kevin Reilly (Louisiana politician)|Kevin P. Reilly, Sr.]], of Baton Rouge from the chairmanship of the House Appropriations Committee after thirteen years of service when Reilly, an unsuccessful candidate for [[state treasurer]] the following year, criticized Governor Edwards.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

With the election of [[Buddy Roemer]] as governor, Alario was replaced as Speaker by [[Jimmy N. Dimos]] of [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]]. Ron Gomez explained that Alario and Senate President [[Sammy Nunez]] of [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]] nevertheless attempted to maintain their leadership posts. He explained: "Alario immediately had the backing of [[organized labor]], the black caucus, many member from the New Orleans and Jefferson Parish delegations and a healthy number of other House members whom he had helped and to whom he had ingratiated himself over the years."&lt;ref&gt;Ron Gomez, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Alario served nine terms in the House of Representatives before being [[term limits|term limited]] from the body in 2007.&lt;ref name=votesmart /&gt;

==State senate==
In 2007, Alario was elected to the [[Louisiana State Senate]]. He began his first term as Senator in 2008. As Senator, Alario served on the Senate Finance and Commerce Committees.&lt;ref name=votesmart /&gt; On October 25, 2011, Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] endorsed Alario for the position of [[President|President of the Senate]]. This came one year after he [[Party switching in the United States|changed his party affiliation]] from [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and despite previous GOP hostility toward Alario.&lt;ref name="Jindal"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/10/gov_b0obby_jindal_endorses_wes.html|title=Ed Anderson, "Gov.

Ultimately, only one of the thirty-nine senators, freshman Republican [[Barrow Peacock]] of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], voted against the Alario selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessreport.com/article/20120123/BUSINESSREPORT0203/301239986 |title=John Maginnis, "Standing Up to Jindal", January 23, 2012 |publisher=businessreport.com |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005003607/http://www.businessreport.com/article/20120123/BUSINESSREPORT0203/301239986 |archivedate=October  5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jindal had supported Peacock's Republican rival, term-limited State Representative [[Jane H.

In June 2017, [[political science]] Professor [[Jeffrey D. Sadow ]] of [[Louisiana State University in Shreveport]] wrote an article critical of two [[Rockefeller Republican|Moderate Republicans]] in the state legislature: [[Rob Shadoin]], a representative from [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]], and Senate President Alario, who Sadow contends, sends [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] legislation, such as support for [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] monuments, to committees with Democratic majorities. Sadow went on to claim that this works to the advantage of Democratic Governor [[John Bel Edwards]] because Edwards does not have to [[veto]] popular measures to please his base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/jeff_sadow/article_a1b27e48-464c-11e7-9927-fbda1d83117c.html|title=Republican pretenders - of RINOs - really serving Gov .

In April, 2018, Alario was one of 10 senators who voted against criminalizing sexual abuse of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1084427|title=SBS 3rd Reading and Final Passage SBS 236 By Morrell Crime/Punishment Final Passage Roll Call|last=|first=|date=April 9, 2018|website=Louisiana State Legislature|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413180130/http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1084427|archive-date=April 13, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Alario's opposition, the bill passed with 25 votes in favor of the ban.

'''Jonathan James Bush''' (born May 6, 1931) is an American banker.

==Early life==
Bush was born in Greenwich, Connecticut,&lt;ref name="NEWYORKMAGAZINE10081990"&gt;[[Howard Kurtz|Kurtz, Howard]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=h7VasQrBnm8C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22It%27s+Jonathan+Bush,+a+chatty,+modest+ex-actor+who%27s+now+playing+the+role+of+First+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NN5CUt7rHvW84APD8YGABg&amp;redir_esc=y "The First Brother"], ''New York Magazine'', October 8, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Prescott Bush|Prescott Sheldon Bush]], a politician, and Dorothy Walker Bush. He graduated from [[The Hotchkiss School]] and [[Yale University]], where he was a member of [[Skull and Bones]].&lt;ref name="robbins"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Alexandra Robbins|Robbins, Alexandra]] | title=Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power |publisher=[[Little, Brown]] | location=Boston | year=2002 |isbn=0-316-72091-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145, 179}} The fourth child in the family, he is the brother of [[Prescott Bush, Jr.|Prescott "Pressy" Bush, Jr.]] (1922–2010), the 41st [[President of the United States]] [[George H. W. Bush]] (1924–2018), [[Nancy Walker Bush Ellis|Nancy Bush Ellis]] (b. 1926), and [[William H. T. Bush|William "Bucky" Bush]] (1938–2018). He is the uncle of the 43rd President [[George W. Bush]]. Like his brother George H. W. Bush, he was a member of [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity at Yale.

Bush and his wife Josephine are the parents of former [[NBC]] entertainment reporter [[Billy Bush]] and health care executive [[Jonathan S. Bush]].&lt;ref name=biography.com&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biography.com/people/billy-bush-060116|title=Billy Bush: Television Personality (1971–)| publisher=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (TV network)|FYI]] / [[A&amp;E Networks]]) | accessdate= May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
As of 2013, Jonathan Bush is a Senior Officer at Fairfield, Bush &amp; Co., an Investment Advisory Firm, with offices in [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] and New Haven, Connecticut, as well as Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldbush.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Bush founded J. Bush &amp; Co., which provided discreet banking services for the [[Washington, D.C.]], embassies of foreign governments for many years. In 1997, [[Riggs Bank]] bought J. Bush &amp; Co. and made Bush [[CEO]] &amp; President of Riggs Investment, a firm based in New Haven, Connecticut.

In the early 1980s, Jonathan Bush helped organize investors for [[George W. Bush]]'s first oil venture, [[Arbusto Energy]], later called Bush Explorations.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]], Bush was a major contributor and fundraiser to his nephew's election and was named a "[[Bush Pioneer]]" for raising more than $100,000 for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;b=78928 |title=Page at americanprogress.org |accessdate=2005-01-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613185518/http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;b=78928 |archivedate=June 13, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On May 15, 2004, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published an article that said, "A political Web site written by a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] operative drew attention yesterday to the fact that President Bush's uncle, Jonathan J. Bush, is a top executive at Riggs Bank, which this week agreed to pay a record $25 million in civil fines for violations of law intended to thwart [[money laundering]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28396-2004May14.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Web Site Cites Bush-Riggs Link |date=May 15, 2004 |accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank accounts under investigation may have been [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]], though the article did not say so. It did, however, go on to say: "a source familiar with the multiple federal investigations of the bank's Saudi accounts and other embassy accounts say Jonathan Bush's investment advice unit has 'no relationship whatsoever' with any of the Riggs's Saudi accounts." Moreover, the newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as saying "any suggestion of political influence in the Riggs situation is 'preposterous.'"

In 1991, Bush was fined $30,000 in [[Massachusetts]] and several thousand dollars in [[Connecticut]] for violating registration laws governing [[securities]] sales. He was barred from securities brokerage with the general public in Massachusetts for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mass.

'''Just cause''' is a common standard in [[United States labor law]] [[arbitration]] that is used in [[Trade union|labor union]] contracts in the United States as a form of [[job security]].

==Labor union contracts==
The standard of just cause provides important protections against arbitrary or unfair termination and other forms of inappropriate workplace discipline. Just cause has become a common standard in labor arbitration, and is included in labor union contracts as a form of [[job security]]. Typically, an employer must prove just cause before an arbitrator in order to sustain an employee's termination, suspension, or other discipline. Usually, the employer has the burden of proof in discharge cases or if the employee is in the wrong.

In the workplace, just cause is a [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] or standard that an employer must meet to justify discipline or discharge. Just cause usually refers to a violation of a company policy or rule. In some cases, an employee may commit an act that is not specifically addressed within the employers' policies but one of which the employer believes warrants discipline or discharge. In such instances, the employer must be confident that they can defend their decision.

When an arbitrator looks at a discipline dispute, the arbitrator first asks whether the employee's wrongdoing has been proven by the employer, and then asks whether the method of discipline should be upheld or modified. In 1966, an arbitrator, Professor Carroll Daugherty, expanded these principles into seven tests for just cause.&lt;ref&gt;In re Enterprise Wire Co. and Enterprise Independent Union, 46 LA 359 (March 28, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts encompassed within his seven tests are still frequently used by arbitrators when deciding discipline cases.

Daugherty's seven tests are as follows:
* Was the employee forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions?
* Are the employer's rules reasonably related to business efficiency and performance the employer might reasonably expect from the employee?
* Was an effort made before discipline or discharge to determine whether the employee was guilty as charged?
* Was the investigation conducted fairly and objectively?
* Did the employer obtain substantial evidence of the employee's guilt?
* Were the rules applied fairly and without discrimination?
* Was the degree of discipline reasonably related to the seriousness of the employee's offense and the employee's past record?

The last test, the degree of discipline, is important because arbitrators want to ensure that the "punishment fits the crime." An employer's use of progressive discipline often gives the employer an advantage in arbitration.

The culture of the community or community standards sometimes play an important role in how just cause is defined, especially if there are issues of [[Morality|immorality]]. What is accepted in an urban and liberal community may not be accepted in a rural and religiously conservative community. The courts or arbitrator who will rule on a challenge to the discipline may be a product of those communities. Just cause can become controversial in instances when the employers personnel policies do not address a specific act but the employer believes that just cause exists. For example, if an employee is arrested and charged with a misdemeanor, the employer may deem that sufficient cause for dismissal, even if the employee is not incarcerated or is not convicted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="193637">The '''[[S&amp;P 500]]''' [[stock market index]], maintained by [[S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices]], comprises '''505''' [[common stock]]s issued by '''500''' [[market capitalization|large-cap]] companies and traded on American stock exchanges, and covers about 80 percent of the American equity market by capitalization. The index is weighted by free-float market capitalization, so more valuable companies account for relatively more of the index. The index constituents and the constituent weights are updated regularly using rules published by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Although the index is called the S&amp;P "500", the index contains 505 stocks because it includes two share classes of stock from 5 of its component companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://americasmarkets.usatoday.com/2014/07/30/the-sp-500-is-becoming-the-sp-502/|title=The S&amp;P 500 is becoming the S&amp;P 502.|work=USA Today|date=2014-07-30|accessdate=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spice-indices.com/idpfiles/spice-assets/resources/public/documents/134544_v5methodologychgmultisecondary2.pdf

&lt;!--                                                EDITORS PLEASE TAKE NOTE:

 If you are updating the following table due to a change which occurred in the components of the S&amp;P 500 please consider the following.

 1.  S&amp;P rarely adds or removes a stock in isolation, it's almost always "AAA replaces BBB".
     If this is the case, please do not simply add or remove a component;  Rather, make sure you record both parts of the change.

 2.  If you record a change, please also make an entry down below in the table "Recent changes to the list of S&amp;P 500 Components"
     Keeping these two tables in sync should make it much easier for editors to keep track of which changes have/haven't been entered.

 3.  Most of the dates in the "Date first added" column agree with the date in the Standard &amp; Poors spreadsheet that first included the new company, but others list the last day of trading when the replaced company was considered part of the index (i.e., the prior business day).  Interested parties are invited to participate in the discussion near the end of the "talk" page in the section titled "Dates of changes for newly added S&amp;P 500 components".

     Thanks                       --&gt;

==Recent changes to the list of S&amp;P 500 Components==

&lt;!--                                                EDITORS PLEASE TAKE NOTE:

 If you are updating the following table due to a change which occurred in the components of the S&amp;P 500 please consider the following.

 1.  S&amp;P never does adds or removes a stock in isolation, it's always "AAA replaces BBB".
     Please do not simply add or remove a component;  Rather, make sure you record both parts of the change.

 2.  If you record a change here, please also make the corresponding changes in the above table "S&amp;P 500 Component Stocks"
     Keeping these two tables in sync should make it much easier for editors to keep track of which changes have/haven't been entered.

 3.  Company name changes or ticker changes are not changes to the index and should not be in this table.

     Thanks!                       --&gt;

S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices updates the components of the S&amp;P 500 periodically, typically in response to acquisitions, or to keep the index up to date as various companies grow or shrink in value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandp500changes.whw1.com/

'''Managing by Wire''' is a [[management]] strategy for enterprises of a dynamically changing [[Market (economics)|markets]] with a high level of concurrency.

The concept forces switching from a conventional make-and-sell model to sense and response to the rapidly changing customer needs using most modern [[Information technology|information technologies]]. As an analogue a [[fly-by-wire]] concept invented in 1950s for jets is presented. According to fly-by-wire a pilot must focus on general flight parameters while information technologies control the plain and reacts to changing environment.

== History ==
Managing by Wire was first presented in [[Harvard Business Review|''Harvard Business Review'']] in 1993 by [[Stephan H. Haeckel|Stephan Haeckel]] and Richard Nolan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1993/09/managing-by-wire|title=Managing by Wire|author=Stephan H. Haeckel and Richard Nolan|first=|date=1993-10-13|work=|access-date=|publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key principles ==
The key principle is to create a digital model of the enterprise describing (at the most available detail level) processes taking part. As a digital model is created managing of the enterprise must move their focus from manipulating real-world processes to the programming procedures and changes to the digital model, which in turn influence to the real-world processes.

'''Market intelligence''' is the information relevant to a company’s markets, gathered and analyzed specifically for the purpose of accurate and confident [[decision-making]] in determining strategy in areas such as [[market opportunity]], [[market penetration]] strategy, and [[market development]].&lt;ref name="Cornish"&gt;Cornish, S. L. “Product Innovation and the Spatial Dynamics of Market Intelligence: Does Proximity to Markets Matter?” Economic Geography. Volume: 73, Issue 2 (April 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Market intelligence includes the process of gathering data from the company’s external environment, whereas the [[Business intelligence]] process primarily is based on internal recorded events – such as sales, shipments and purchases. The purpose of incorporating Market Information or intelligence into the Business Intelligence process is to provide decision makers with a more “complete picture” of ongoing corporate performance in a set of given market conditions.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;Prescott, John and others, Proven Strategies in Competitive Intelligence (Wiley, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gathering market intelligence data ==
Effective market intelligence needs accurate market information that is gathered with right tools and methods. To gather information companies can conduct [[survey (human research)|survey]]s, [[interview]]s, visit and monitor competitors outlets or gather and buy data from different sources.

Traditional interviews and surveys can be done either in-house or by using specialists agencies. As more and more markets are digitalized the market intelligence space has seen a lot of new digital tools that companies can use. There are tools such as [https://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/home Google Consumer Survey] that enables companies to ask web users a question through Google network of online publishers. There are also specialist sites companies can buy market intelligence information and market intelligence software that companies can use to collect and monitor data from the internet.

The '''Merchant Shipping Act 1988''' c.12 was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. It aimed to prevent foreign fishing fleets from fishing in British territorial waters. In the [[Factortame case]], its provisions in Parts I and II, Registration of British Ships, were disapplied by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] when they were found to conflict with [[European Community law]] and the [[Common Fisheries Policy]].  Part II dealt only with '''fishing vessels''' and was found to be repugnant by the [[European Court of Justice]]. The subsequent definition of British Ships is found in the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1995]].

He was known as ''' Fahim ElGindy'''. He was the man who established and developed the industry of furniture during the 20th century in  [[Damietta]]  and [[Egypt]].  In 1926, he got the Kingdom Golden Prize from the Conference of Industrial and Agriculture of Fabricating the Furniture in Cairo. Also, He was the first Arab who got Diplomas and golden medals from [[Rome|Roma]] and [[Paris]] for his wonderful art and initiations in fabricating the furniture in 1926. 

He was a pioneer in establishing the Furniture Industry. He learnt this art to many manufacturers who are very famous now in Egypt. He made two furniture centers. The first was in Damietta in 1910. The second was in Cairo in 1920. During the second Conference of Furniture Industry in Damietta in 1986, the Egyptian government appropriated his efforts by providing a certificate to his name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="904">The '''National Association of British Manufacturers''' ('''NABM'''), formerly the '''National Union of Manufacturers''' ('''NUM'''), was an [[employers' association]] in the United Kingdom.

Founded in 1915 as the '''British Manufacturers' Association''' ('''BMA'''), it was renamed the National Union of Manufacturers in 1917 and the National Association of British Manufacturers in 1961. It was particularly strong among small and middle-sized firms. It merged with the [[Federation of British Industries]] and the [[British Employers' Confederation]] in 1965 to form the [[Confederation of British Industry]].

'''Peter David Aitchison''' is a former New Zealand [[Rowing (sport)|rower]] and manufacturer of farming equipment.

A member of the Union Boat Club in [[Whanganui]], Aitchison was a member of the victorious Union crew—along with [[Donald Gemmell]], [[Frank Crotty]], [[Graeme Moran]] and [[Richard Tuffin]] ([[Coxswain (rowing)|coxswain]])—that won the coxed fours title at the New Zealand national rowing championships in 1958. The same crew went on to represent New Zealand at the [[New Zealand at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in Cardiff, finishing fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://unionboatclub.co.nz/2017/01/08/passing-of-frank-crotty/ | title=Passing of Frank Crotty | date=8 January 2017 | publisher=Union Boat Club Whanganui | accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.taradalerotary.co.nz/paul_harris_rotary_awards.htm | title=Paul Harris Fellows | publisher=Rotary Club of Taradale | accessdate=14 January 2017 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406061006/http://taradalerotary.co.nz/paul_harris_rotary_awards.htm | archivedate=6 April 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org.nz/athletes/peter-aitchison/ |title=Peter Aitchison |year=2016 |website= |publisher=New Zealand Olympic Committee |accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aitchison went on to have a successful career as a manufacturer, importer and exporter of farming equipment, founding Aitchison Industries based in Whanganui. The company produces and exports [[seed drill]]s, [[cultivator]]s, fertiliser spreaders and other farming equipment around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=River City flush with business prosperity | date=19 November 1996 | work=The Dominion | page=9 | first=Jon |last=Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reesegroup.co.nz/Aitchison/about.html |title=About Aitchison |year=2009 |website= |publisher=Reese Group |accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Soil conservation equipment ready | date=March 1998 | work=Southerner | page=9 | first=Lyn | last=McKinnon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Drill 'marriage' opens up new seed methods | date=12 October 1994 | work=New Zealand Farmer | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Aitchison and his wife, Sylvia, retired to the [[Wellington]] suburb of [[Roseneath, Wellington|Roseneath]]. In 2015, the couple made national headlines after their neighbour built a four-metre high fence blocking their view of Wellington harbour. After a legal battle, the [[Environment Court of New Zealand|Environment Court]] ordered the fence be removed in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fence decision brings relief but no celebrations | date=2 October 2015 | work=Dominion Post | page=3 | first1=Joel | last1=Maxwell | first2=Tom | last2=Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/home-property/76143162/environment-court-judge-rules-on-objectionable-wellington-viewblocking-fence | title=Environment Court judge rules on 'objectionable' Wellington view-blocking fence  | date=22 January 2016 | work=Stuff.co.nz | accessdate=14 January 2017 | first=David | last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3183">'''Product forecasting''' is the science of predicting the degree of success a new product will enjoy in the [[marketplace]].  To do this, the forecasting model must take into account such things as [[product awareness]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[price]], fulfilling unmet needs and competitive alternatives.

==Bass model==
Bass model is one type of forecasting method primarily used in new product forecasting. In general, there will be no historical demand for new product. Then, Bass model tries to capture shape of demand of existing product and apply new product.
{{main|Bass diffusion model}}

&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = p + \frac{q}{m} N(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where,
* F(t) is the probability of adoption at time t
* f(t) is the rate at which adoption is changing with respect to t
* N(t) is the number of adopters at time t
* m is the total number of consumers who will eventually adopt
* p is the coefficient of innovation
* q is the coefficient of imitation

Multivariate techniques such as regression can be used to determine the values of p, q and N if historical sales data is available.

==Fourt-Woodlock model==
The [[Fourt-Woodlock_equation|Fourt-Woodlock]] model is another method used to estimate product sales.

&lt;math&gt;V = (HH \cdot TR \cdot TU) + (HH\cdot TR\cdot MR \cdot RR \cdot RU)&lt;/math&gt;

The left-hand-side of the equation is the volume of purchases per unit time (usually taken to be one year).  On the right-hand-side, the first parentheses describes trial volume, and the second describes repeat volume.  

HH is the total number of households in the geographic area of projection, and TR ("trial rate") is the percentage of those households which will purchase the product for the first time in a given time period.  TU ("trial units") is the number of units purchased on this first purchase occasion.  MR is "measured repeat," or the percentage of those who tried the product who will purchase it at least one more time within the first year of the product's launch.  RR is the repeats per repeater: the number of repeat purchases within that same year.  RU is the number of repeat units purchased on each repeat event.

==Assessor Model (Promotional Content)==

===Preference===
By examining the brand preference for each brand in a competitive context, preference shares for each brand can be determined.
Assessor is owned by M/A/R/C Research ( http://www.marcresearch.com/ ) and can be used for concept screening, testing and volumetric forecasting.  In combination with Choice Modeling it can be used to optimize offers and products.

===Awareness Model===
Based on the brands planned [[marketing mix]] of advertising in multiple vehicles, the ultimate brand awareness can be projected through time.

A '''root cause''' is an initiating [[cause]] of either a condition or a [[causal chain]] that leads to an outcome or effect of interest. The term denotes the earliest, most basic, 'deepest', cause for a given behavior; most often a fault. The idea is that you can only see an error by its manifest signs. Those signs can be widespread, multitudinous, and convoluted, whereas the '''root cause''' leading to them often is a lot simpler.

A "root cause" is a "cause" (harmful factor) that is "root" (deep, basic, fundamental, underlying, initial or the like).

The term "root cause" appeared in professional journals as early as 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date = 18 November 1905 | volume = 166 | title=The Present State of Medical Practice in the Rhondda Valley| journal=The Lancet | pages = 1507 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)68499-4 | issue = 4290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantin (2014) describes the root cause as the result of the drill-down [[root cause analysis]] required to discover which is the process that is failing, defining it as "MIN Process" (meaning a process that is Missing, Incomplete or Not followed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ivan |last=Fantin |year=2014 |title=Applied Problem Solving: Method, Applications, Root Causes, Countermeasures, Poka-Yoke and A3 |location=Milan, Italy |publisher=Createspace, an Amazon company |isbn=9781499122282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, projects may fail due to unrealistic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pitagorsky|first1=George|title=The Zen Approach to Project Management: Working from Your Center to Balance Expectations and Performance|publisher=IIL Publishing|isbn=9780970827692|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbtDSBxeqC0C&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Unrealistic%20expectations%20root%20cause&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism, the [[three poisons]] are the root causes of suffering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2419">The term '''shareholder yield''' captures the three ways in which the management of a public company can distribute cash to shareholders: [[cash dividend]]s, [[stock repurchase]]s and [[debt reduction]].

==Overview==
[[Dividends]] are the most obvious form of distributing cash. [[Stock repurchase]]s also increase [[shareholder value]] provided that the shares purchased are cancelled or held in treasury but not used as a device to make up for dilution from option issuances to management and others. [[Debt reduction|Reducing debt]] can also produce a de facto dividend; assuming the value of the firm remains the same, shareholder value is increased as debt is reduced.

To understand how debt reduction increases [[shareholder value]], it is helpful to consider the 1958 paper by Nobel laureates [[Franco Modigliani]] and [[Merton H. Miller]] entitled ''The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment''.&lt;ref&gt;Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller (June 1958), “The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment,” The American Economic Review, Vol. 48, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper proved that a firm’s value is independent of how it is financed, provided that one ignores the tax effect of debt interest. If [[Franco Modigliani|Modigliani]] and [[Merton H. Miller|Miller]] are correct, the use of [[free cash flow]] to repay debt results in a transfer of wealth from the debtor to the shareholder.

==History of term==
The term shareholder yield was coined by William W. Priest of Epoch Investment Partners in a paper in 2005 entitled ''The Case for Shareholder Yield as a Dominant Driver of Future Equity Returns'' as a way to look more holistically at how companies allocate and distribute cash rather than considering dividends in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Priest (December 2005), ''The Case for Shareholder Yield as a Dominant Driver of Future Equity Returns'', Epoch Investment Partners.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was further detailed in the 2007 book, ''Free Cash Flow and Shareholder Yield: New Priorities for the Global Investor'', by William W. Priest and Lindsay H. McClelland.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Priest and Lindsay H. McClelland (2007) ''Free Cash Flow and Shareholder Yield: New Priorities for the Global Investor'', Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-12833-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ricketts is the son of Marlene Margaret (Volkmer) and [[J. Joseph Ricketts]], who founded Ameritrade when Tom was eight years old. Ricketts Senior let it be known that he wanted his children to establish themselves through their own hard work and would not be allowed to join TD Ameritrade until they reached the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Henry J. |last=Cordes |title=For Ricketts, it's about earning what you get |work= |publisher=[[Omaha World-Herald]] |page=1 |date=19 March 2006 |accessdate=30 January 2009 |quote= |url=http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_pg=1673&amp;u_sid=2136058&amp;u_rnd=5261989 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QChnnFzV?url=http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_pg=1673 |archivedate=July 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricketts is one of four children. His brother [[J.

===University of Chicago===
In 1983, Ricketts moved from Omaha to [[Chicago]] in order to attend the [[University of Chicago]]. Just out of high school, he moved in with his older brother Peter, also a student at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=SunTim&gt;{{cite news |first=DAVID |last=ROEDER |authorlink= |title=Thomas Ricketts:'My family and I are Cubs fans' |url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/1395680,CST-NWS-ricketts25.article |work= |publisher=[[Sun Times]] |date=24 January 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090127050620/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/1395680,CST-NWS-ricketts25.article |archive-date=2009-01-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricketts received a [[bachelor's degree]] from the university in 1988 and returned to receive his [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1993. Ricketts was awarded the ‘Distinguished Young Alumni’ award from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, recognizing graduates that achieve extraordinary career success and outstanding leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alumniandfriends.uchicago.edu/alumni-association/alumni-awards/past-award-winners|title=Past Award Winners|date=2014-12-01|work=Alumni Association: Alumni, Parents, Families &amp; Friends|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricketts has given generous donations to the University of Chicago and established the ‘New Year Scholarship Fund,’ which awards an incoming student a full undergraduate scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chicagoinitiative.uchicago.edu/honoring/recognition/ricketts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125104555/http://chicagoinitiative.uchicago.edu/honoring/recognition/ricketts|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-01-25|title=Giving to Chicago {{!}} Thomas S.

==Chicago Cubs==
[[File:Cubs World Series Victory Parade (30142887113) (Tom Ricketts).jpg|thumbnail|Ricketts during the victory parade following the Cubs [[2016 World Series]] victory]]
In April 2007, [[Sam Zell]] announced his intention to acquire the Chicago-based [[Tribune Company]]. After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.&lt;ref name=SunTim/&gt;&lt;ref name=ForbCub&gt;{{cite news |first=Carl |last=Gutierrez |authorlink= |title=Ricketts Wriggling Into Wrigley Field |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/01/25/ricketts-chicago-cubs-face-markets-cx_cg_0123markets04.html |work= |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=25 January 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under bankruptcy protection, the sale of the Cubs and the 25% interest in SportsNet Chicago would raise needed funds for the ailing Tribune company. In a campaign led by Ricketts, the family was selected for the winning bid on January 22, 2009.&lt;ref name="cbn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009-01-22/news/28521810_1_ricketts-family-cubs-purchase-consistent-championship-tradition|title=Ricketts family is winning Cubs bidder: $875M|last=Sachdev|first=Ameet|date=22 January 2009|work=|accessdate=30 January 2009|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author2=Michael Oneal|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid made by Ricketts.&lt;ref name=ForbCub/&gt;

Tom Ricketts has said that his love for the Chicago Cubs started during the [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|1984 season]] when he was 18 years old and moved to Chicago to attend university.  Later, Tom and his brother Pete lived in an apartment over the "Sports Corner" at Addison and Sheffield, across the street from [[Wrigley Field]]. He met his wife Cecelia in the Wrigley bleachers and simply states that "my family and I are Cubs fans".&lt;ref name=SunTim/&gt; The bid was reviewed by [[Major League Baseball]] and other stake holders. Although several close friends told the press about Ricketts's deep love for the Cubs, the Ricketts family decided not to court media attention until the bid was accepted by all parties.&lt;ref name=SunTim/&gt;

On July 6, 2009, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported that Tom Ricketts and family had reached an agreement with the [[Tribune Company]] to purchase the Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% of [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago]] for close to $900 million, as was originally reported. The contract was sent to commissioner [[Bud Selig]] for approval.&lt;ref&gt;http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090706&amp;content_id=5724780&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc&lt;/ref&gt; Final approval came by a unanimous vote of the other MLB owners in an October 6, 2009 conference call.&lt;ref name="MLB approval"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/news/story?id=4537317|title=Cubs sale unanimously approved|author=Associated Press|date=2009-10-06|accessdate=2009-10-06|publisher=''ESPN.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, 2009, the Ricketts family, with Thomas S. Ricketts as board chairman, officially took over 95% ownership of the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Wrigley Field]], and 25% ownership of [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago]]. The Tribune opted to retain a 5% ownership stake in the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricketts takes control of the Cubs|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/05/03/flashback-88-ricketts-takes-control-of-cubs-2009/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 108 years of waiting, the Cubs won the 2016 World Series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-cubs-win-world-series-sullivan-spt-1103-20161102-story.html|title=Chicago Cubs win World Series championship with 8-7 victory over Cleveland Indians|last=Sullivan|first=Paul|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a wild 8-7, 10-inning Game 7 victory over the Indians on Wednesday night at Progressive Field. The triumph completed their climb back from a 3-1 Series deficit to claim their first championship since 1908.

==Real Estate Development Around Wrigley Field==
Since acquiring the Chicago Cubs in Oct. 2009, the Ricketts family placed a priority on renovating [[Wrigley Field]] as part of their plan to put a championship-caliber team on the field. In 2014, the nearly $1 billion renovation project of Wrigley Field and the collateral land finally broke ground after winning city approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/cubs/news/cubs-moving-forward-with-wrigley-restoration-plan/c-76326626|title=Cubs moving forward with Wrigley restoration plan|website=MLB.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides preserving Wrigley Field as promised, the objective was to also leverage the Wrigley investment to create something special for the city and the neighborhood – a public space adjacent to the stadium that would function as a town square, offering year-round attractions for neighbors, families, fans and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-wrigley-field-plaza-opens-spt-0411-20170410-story.html|title=New plaza outside Wrigley Field envisioned as neighborhood's town square|last=Skrbina|first=Paul|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Opening Day of the 2017 season, with Cubs fans celebrating its first in a century role as the defending world champions of baseball, the Ricketts family delivered The Park at Wrigley. Chairman Tom Ricketts, President of business operations [[Crane Kenney]], Chicago Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]], numerous elected officials, neighbors and community leaders cut the ribbon at the Park at Wrigley. To meet the team’s goal of being a good neighbor, the area outside Wrigley Field had to transform into a year-round, family-friendly destination that generated economic, social and tax benefits for the area. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20170410/BLOGS04/170419991/photos-chicago-cubs-open-the-park-at-wrigley%5D%20%5Bhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ct-wrigley-field-plaza-kamin-met-0411-20170410-story.html|title=Photos: Cubs open the Park at Wrigley|website=Crain's Chicago Business|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, the Ricketts family opened their first hotel, located on Clark Street just across from the front entrance of Wrigley Field. The 173-room Hotel Zachary is the first full-scale hotel to open within a half mile of the ballpark. It’s also a striking addition to an iconic corner of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/March-2018/First-Look-Wrigleyvilles-New-Hotel-Zachary/#/0|title=First Look: Wrigleyville’s New Hotel Zachary|work=Chicago magazine|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"By the end of the 2018 off-season and next, our initial plan [will be] complete," said Ricketts, whose family bought the team from Tribune Company in 2009. "That doesn't mean we're done, because it's a 100-year- old ballpark. There will be something else we have to fix after that. But it will be great to have the major construction done a year from now. We'll get the upper-deck renovation done after the 2018 season, and that will really help the ballpark a lot." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/cubs/news/cubs-wrigley-field-renovations-progressing/c-264680766|title=Cubs' Wrigley Field renovations progressing|website=MLB.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business history==
Ricketts is the Chairman, co-founder and former CEO of [[Incapital]] LLC.&lt;ref name=ForbsBio/&gt; Ricketts spent one summer early in life working at TD Ameritrade, giving customers stock quotes over the phone. This was his only work experience with the company before being invited to join as a director later in life.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite news |first=Adrienne |last=Carter |authorlink= |title=Building Bonds For The Little Guy  |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_24/b3937096_mz020.htm |work= |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=13 June 2005 |accessdate=30 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Mesirow Financial and ABN AMRO===
When Ricketts finished undergraduate studies (1988), he joined the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] as a [[market maker]]. Ricketts held this position until 1994, shortly after finishing his MBA. From 1995 to 1996, he served as vice president with [[Mesirow Financial]] until moving to [[ABN AMRO]] as vice president in their brokerage division.&lt;ref name=ForbsBio/&gt; Ricketts is credited with pioneering the idea of using the Internet and other technologies to help companies sell their investment-grade bonds directly to retail investors, as opposed to limiting sales only to institutions.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Kruger |title=At A Standstill |work= |page=1 |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=4 February 2002 |accessdate=30 January 2009|quote= |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0204/078.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped launch the first successful version of this system while at ABN AMRO. In 1999 he left ABN AMRO to found Incapital.&lt;ref name=ForbsBio/&gt;

===Incapital LLC===
Thomas Ricketts co-founded Chicago-based [[Incapital]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=ForbsBio/&gt; The securities and investment banking firm has since expanded with two additional offices in [[Boca Raton, Florida]] and [[London, England]].&lt;ref name=IncapitalHome&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.incapital.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.main |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021208180717/http://www.incapital.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Home.main |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-12-08 |title=Incapital Information Page |accessdate=2009-01-30 |work= |publisher=Incapital |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Ricketts serves as Incapital [[Chairman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.incapital.com/About/Executive_Team.aspx|title=Incapital - Executive Team|website=www.incapital.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' describes the company as a "technologically-oriented investment bank focused exclusively on the underwriting and distribution of fixed income products to individual investors. Incapital underwrites for several major U.S. corporations through its InterNotesSM product platform." &lt;ref name=ForbsBio/&gt;

[[File:Map of Texas highlighting Winkler County.svg|thumb|right|Winkler County, Texas]]
The '''Winkler County nurse whistleblower case''' was a series of legal proceedings in [[West Texas]] that centered on the retaliation upon two nurses who submitted an anonymous state medical board complaint against a physician in 2009. The case attracted national attention for its implications on [[whistleblowing]] by nurses. After witnessing what they believed to be unsafe medical care, nurses Anne Mitchell and Vicki Galle submitted an anonymous complaint against Dr. Rolando Arafiles to the [[Texas Medical Board]] (TMB).

When he learned of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of [[Winkler County, Texas|Winkler County]], who was his friend and one of his patients. Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the medical board constituted harassment. The sheriff investigated and obtained the TMB complaint, which provided enough information about Mitchell and Galle to make them identifiable. Galle and Mitchell were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of official information. Galle's charges were dropped before trial and Mitchell was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a hospital administrator all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against the nurses.

The case raised questions about the extent of whistleblower protection for healthcare providers who report patient care concerns to licensing authorities. Texas law included remedies against retaliation for whistleblowers, but no known U.S. state had whistleblower laws that addressed appropriate prosecutorial conduct. According to the Texas Nurses Association, "No one ever imagined that a nurse would be criminally prosecuted for reporting a patient care concern to a licensing agency."&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; After the Mitchell case, protection from prosecution was incorporated into Texas whistleblower laws. The TMB stopped investigating anonymous complaints about physicians in September 2011.

==Background==
The case originated at Winkler County Memorial Hospital (WCMH), a 15-bed hospital in [[Kermit, Texas]].&lt;ref name=Blesch&gt;{{cite web|last=Blesch|first=Gregg|title=Lone Star State showdown: Trial looms for nurses who reported concerns about doctor|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20100201/MAGAZINE/100129957|work=[[Modern Healthcare]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell and Galle were registered nurses at WCMH. The two nurses held multiple roles at the hospital and both were employed there for more than 20 years. Galle was an administrator over [[quality improvement]] and [[utilization management]] for the hospital, while Mitchell served as its [[compliance officer]]. Galle and Mitchell also served as medical staff co-coordinators at WCMH. Mitchell held a part-time role as the county's emergency management coordinator.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; She also had experience as a [[travel nursing|travel nurse]] and as an instructor and director in a [[licensed practical nurse|licensed vocational nursing]] program.&lt;ref name=TTU/&gt;

In April 2008, Arafiles arrived at WCMH.&lt;ref name=Texas/&gt; He had earned a medical degree in the Philippines before coming to the United States; he continued his training in [[Baltimore]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].&lt;ref name=PPG&gt;{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|title=In Texas, a trial and possible prison time for reporting a doctor|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/us/in-texas-a-trial-and-possible-prison-time-for-reporting-a-doctor-232462/|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013|date=February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas issued a medical license to him in 1998.&lt;ref name=Wiley&gt;{{cite web|last=Blaney|first=Betsy|title=Former Winkler County hospital administrator Stan Wiley takes plea in retaliation case|url=http://lubbockonline.com/texas/2011-03-22/former-winkler-county-hospital-head-takes-plea-retaliation-case#.UmMfw1CTh50|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year before Arafiles came to Winkler County, the TMB restricted his ability to supervise [[nurse practitioner]]s and [[physician assistant]]s for three years and fined him $1,000. In that case, the TMB expressed concerns about the manner in which he oversaw a physician assistant at a weight loss clinic and the way that he applied the clinic's patient care protocols.&lt;ref name=Lowes&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowes|first=Robert|title=Physician in whistle-blower case charged by Texas Medical Board|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/725195|website=[[Medscape]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell and Galle became concerned about the appropriateness of Arafiles' medical decision making soon after he arrived at WCMH.&lt;ref name=Texas/&gt; The doctor's practice in Kermit included the use of [[alternative medicine]] therapies such as herbal remedies. Witnesses later said that Mitchell made comments at work which characterized Arafiles as a "witch doctor".&lt;ref name=Whistle/&gt; Other coworkers said that Mitchell had legitimate concerns about the quality of the physician's patient care; they said that Mitchell first raised the issues with the hospital's administration, but that her concerns were not addressed. In one incident, Arafiles was alleged to have performed a [[skin grafting|skin graft]] on an emergency room patient even though he was not credentialed to perform surgery at the facility.&lt;ref name=Whistle&gt;{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|title=Whistle-blowing nurse is acquitted in Texas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/us/12nurses.html|accessdate=October 19, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another patient came to the hospital with a crushed finger and Arafiles allegedly took a rubber tip off of a pair of medical scissors and [[surgical suture|stitched]] it onto the patient's finger.&lt;ref name=OA&gt;{{cite web|last=Mustian|first=Jim|title=Discipline still unclear for Arafiles|url=http://www.oaoa.com/news/article_c4a64052-5874-5956-aaaa-3e1b1223dca5.html?TNNoMobile|work=[[Odessa American]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell and Galle sent an anonymous complaint to the TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The letter said that the nurses feared losing their jobs if their identities were revealed in connection with the complaint.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Winkler County Case: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.texasnurses.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=509#faq|publisher=Texas Nurses Association|accessdate=October 19, 2013||archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328012256/http://www.texasnurses.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=509| archivedate=March 28, 2014| deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to [[harassment]]. The TMB issued a copy of the complaint to Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the complaint to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the complaint.&lt;ref name=Veteran&gt;{{cite web|title=Veteran Texas sheriff sentenced to jail in nurse retaliation case|url=http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/123842324.html|publisher=[[KWTX-TV]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts obtained warrants to search the nurses' computers and he found the letter to the TMB. The sheriff was friends with Arafiles. The doctor had treated Roberts in the emergency room for a heart attack. Roberts credited Arafiles with saving his life. He referred to the doctor as "the most sincerely caring person I have ever met."&lt;ref name=Sack&gt;{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|title=Nurse to stand trial for reporting doctor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/us/07nurses.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=March 28, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts later commented on the board report, saying, "If it’s made to destroy somebody’s reputation or forcing them to leave town, then I don’t believe it is good faith."&lt;ref name=Sack/&gt;

==Termination and criminal charges==
Mitchell and Galle were terminated from WCMH in June 2009.&lt;ref name=Wiley/&gt; A few days later, both nurses were arrested.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Winkler County nurse saga|url=http://www.oaoa.com/article_e03c4962-8869-5d66-b970-561b8c3efd59.html?mode=jqm|work=[[Odessa American]]|accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta rather than as a [[good faith]] reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|patient privacy laws]].&lt;ref name=FWST/&gt;

The case attracted national attention in July 2009 when the [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA) and Texas Nurses Association (TNA) began to raise awareness of the plight of the nurses. Galle later said, "We didn't have any support - emotional or financial - until TNA and ANA stepped in."&lt;ref name=ANA&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice is Served: Texas Physician Pleads Guilty|url=http://nursingworld.org/FunctionalMenuCategories/MediaResources/PressReleases/2011-PR/Justice-is-Served-Texas-Physician-Pleads-Guilty.pdf|publisher=[[American Nurses Association]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; TNA filed a complaint with the [[Texas Department of State Health Services]] (DSHS) that resulted in an onsite investigation of the hospital.&lt;ref name=TNA&gt;{{cite web|title=Winkler County Hospital Faces $15,850 Fine|url=http://www.texasnurses.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=538|publisher=Texas Nurses Association|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2010, the TNA Legal Defense Fund had collected more than $45,000 in donations to the defense of Galle and Mitchell.&lt;ref name=Acquits&gt;{{cite web|title=Not Guilty - Texas Jury Acquits Winkler County Nurse|url=http://www.texasnurses.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=509|publisher=Texas Nurses Association|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMB executive director Mari Robinson commented that such prosecution could have "a significant chilling effect" on the reporting of physician practice issues.&lt;ref name=Sack/&gt;

The charges against Galle were dropped before her case went to trial. Mitchell's case was tried by county attorney Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts and the personal attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby [[Andrews County, Texas|Andrews County]] discouraged Tidwell from trying the case.&lt;ref name=Inglis/&gt; At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to his patients. Roberts sold the supplements, but he said that his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with the nurses and that he did not have a business relationship with Arafiles.&lt;ref name=FWST&gt;{{cite web|last=Berard|first=Yamil and Darren Barbee|title=Whistle-blower nurse is acquitted in West Texas|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2010/02/11/v-print/1963997/whistle-blower-nurse-is-acquitted.html|work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorneys with the office of the [[Texas Attorney General]] took on Mitchell's case after being contacted by the TMB. Assistant Attorney General David Glickler later said that the case was the most bizarre he had seen in an 11-year stint with the office. "We're used to dealing with cases where public officials have enriched themselves at the expense of the office and the public trust, like bribery and theft. But there was no financial benefit to the bad actors in this case."&lt;ref name=Inglis2&gt;{{cite web|last=Inglis|first=Toni|title=Whistle-blower nurses see justice in the end|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/opinion/inglis-whistle-blower-nurses-see-justice-in-the-en/nRqPw/|work=Austin American-Statesman|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury returned with a not guilty verdict after an hour of deliberation. Those present in the courtroom said that each juror approached Mitchell after the verdict and hugged her.&lt;ref name=FWST/&gt; In comments he made after the trial, jury foreman Harley Tyler said he wondered why the nurses were arrested. ANA president Rebecca Patton said that the verdict was "a resounding win on behalf of patient safety."&lt;ref name=Whistle/&gt;

==Aftermath==
TNA asserted that state laws, including the Texas Nursing Practice Act and the Public Employee Whistleblower Law, gave any health care provider the right to report concerns about the patient care of other providers. Under these protections, a termination could be presumed improper if it occurred within 60 days of filing such a complaint. Mitchell and Galle filed a civil lawsuit against Winkler County, WCMH, Wiley, Roberts, Tidwell and Arafiles. The lawsuit alleged violations of civil rights, breaches of due process and improper termination.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; 

A few months after Mitchell's trial, Galle and Mitchell split a $750,000 settlement in the civil suit.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; The nurses, who both live in [[Jal, New Mexico]], were unable to find employment in nursing after being terminated from WCMH.&lt;ref name=Texas&gt;{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|title=Texas Nurses Fired for Alleging Misconduct Settle Their Suit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/us/11whistle.html|accessdate=October 19, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing the settlement, Wiley reinforced his support of Arafiles, saying, "He’s done a lot of good in this county.

Several officials faced criminal charges for their involvement in the prosecution or termination of Galle and Mitchell. Wiley was the first to go to trial after he was indicted on two felony counts of [[retaliation]]. He pleaded guilty to the lesser of the two charges. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a $2,000 fine and agreed to cooperate in the prosecution of other involved officials.&lt;ref name=Inglis/&gt; Wiley terminated Galle and Mitchell after they submitted the anonymous medical board complaint.&lt;ref name=Wiley/&gt; He submitted his resignation from the hospital in August 2010, but the WCMH board of directors declined to accept it.

Roberts was convicted on two counts of misuse of official information, two counts of retaliation and two counts of official oppression. In June 2011, he was sentenced to 100 days in jail, four years of felony probation and a $6,000 fine. After the sentence, Roberts was removed as sheriff and forced to surrender his license as a peace officer.&lt;ref name=Sheriff&gt;{{cite web|title=Winkler County Sheriff Found Guilty on All Counts, Sentence Handed Down|url=http://www.newswest9.com/story/14905816/winkler-county-sheriff-found-guilty-on-all-counts|publisher=[[KWES-TV]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convicted on similar charges, Tidwell was removed from office and sentenced to 120 days in jail, ten years of probation and a $6,000 fine.&lt;ref name=Tidwell&gt;{{cite web|title=Scott Tidwell Sentenced for Retaliating Against Kermit Nurses|url=http://www.newswest9.com/story/15615919/scott-tidwell-sentenced-for-retaliating-against-kermit-nurses|publisher=[[KWES-TV]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tidwell's trial publicly uncovered a 2004 guilty plea he entered after being charged with soliciting a prostitute.&lt;ref name=Inglis&gt;{{cite web|last=Inglis|first=Toni|title=Final of four Winkler County 'good ol' boys' faces charges in court|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/opinion/inglis-final-of-four-winkler-county-good-ol-boys-1/nRgHR/|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DSHS assessed a $15,850 fine against the hospital for inadequate supervision of Arafiles and illegal termination of Galle and Mitchell.&lt;ref name=Texas/&gt;

By mid-2011, Arafiles had moved his practice to [[East Texas]] and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in [[Grand Saline, Texas|Grand Saline]]. A hospital administrator there said that she had looked into some of the allegations against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about the doctor.&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Beau|title=Dr. Rolando Arafiles Working at East Texas Hospital 6/9/11|url=http://www.cbs7kosa.com/news/details.asp?ID=26316|publisher=CBS 7 News|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.&lt;ref name=Sentenced&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas: Doctor who retaliated against whistle-blowers is sentenced|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/us/texas-doctor-who-retaliated-against-whistle-blowers-is-sentenced.html?_r=0|accessdate=January 29, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the people involved in the nurses' case had assumed new employment by the summer of 2012. Mitchell found a position in New Mexico working with the developmentally disabled. Galle, who said in 2010 that the case had "derailed our careers",&lt;ref name=Sack/&gt; entered early retirement.&lt;ref name=Inglis2/&gt; Galle and Mitchell earned the Dean's Advocacy Award from the [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=TTU&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Nursing Distinguished Alumni 2010|url=http://www.ttuhsc.edu/communications/pulse/winter10/DistinguishedAlumni.aspx|publisher=[[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]]|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arafiles passed away in [http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Rolando-Arafiles++M.D.&amp;lc=4619&amp;pid=169484217&amp;mid=5840571# January of 2014]. Wiley left Winkler County for Lubbock. Tidwell appealed the revocation of his license to practice law&lt;ref name=Inglis2/&gt; but in 2014 he resigned from the bar rather than face further disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Bar of Texas|url=https://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Find_A_Lawyer&amp;template=/Customsource/MemberDirectory/MemberDirectoryDetail.cfm&amp;ContactID=189607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New legislation stopped the TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians as of the fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.&lt;ref name=Roser&gt;{{cite web|last=Roser|first=Mary Ann|title=New law bans anonymous complaints about doctors|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/new-law-bans-anonymous-complaints-about-doctors/nRfcR/|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
