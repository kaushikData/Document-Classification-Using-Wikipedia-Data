'''Alasdair Ian Fenton Urquhart''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|s|d|ər|_|ˈ|ɜr|k|ər|t}}; born 20 December 1945) is an [[emeritus]] [[Professor]] of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. He has made contributions to the field of [[logic]], especially [[non-classical logic]].  One of his ideas is proving the [[decidability (logic)|undecidability]] of the [[relevance logic]] '''R'''. He also published papers in [[theoretical computer science]] venues, mostly on [[mathematical logic]] topics of [[logic in computer science|relevance to computer science]].

A native of Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whockey.com/work/dcs/dcs/people/faculty/urquhart.html|title="Alasdair Urquhart was born in Scotland in 1945"|publisher=Department of Computer Science - University of Toronto|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urquhart received his [[MA (Scotland)|MA]] in Philosophy from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1967, and his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1973 under the supervision of [[Alan Ross Anderson]] and [[Nuel Belnap]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4798">[[File:Thomas Paine.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Paine]]
'''Asset-based egalitarianism''' is a form of [[egalitarianism]] which theorises that [[social equality|equality]] is possible by a redistribution of resources, usually in the form of a [[Financial capital|capital]] grant provided at the [[age of majority]]. Names for the implementation of this theory in [[policy]] include '''universal basic capital''' and '''stakeholding''', and are generally synonymous within the equal opportunity egalitarian framework.&lt;ref name="Cunliffe, J 2004"&gt;Cunliffe, J &amp; Erreygers, G (2004) The Origins of Universal Grants: An Anthology of Historical Writings on Basic Capital and Basic Income&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==

The idea has been around since [[Thomas Paine]] (January 29, 1737 – June 8, 1809) in his work ''[[Agrarian Justice]]'' 1795, and complemented his other thesis of [[basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;Paine, T (1795) Agrarian Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

Two independent schools of thought were developed on the subject, involving individuals from the [[American labor movement|American Labour Movement]] and scholars of the Belgian School.&lt;ref name="Cunliffe, J 2004" /&gt; However, the same reasoning (given by both schools) behind the basic capital proposal is the redistribution of wealth usually funded by an [[inheritance tax]] in order to provide a universal and unconditional sum of money (or capital assets) at the age of majority. From most authors, the intention was to create a nominal grant for everyone based on a deserved natural inheritance of the earth.

==Relationship with policy==

In the policy format, asset-based egalitarianism is usually seen as the opposite policy proposal of [[Philippe Van Parijs]] and his thesis of [[basic income]],&lt;ref&gt;Van Parijs, P (1995) Real Freedom for All: what if anything can justify capitalism?&lt;/ref&gt; but asset-based egalitarian proposals have received less academic attention. However, more recently the wave of [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] politics has seen much more emphasis placed on [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] and [[equality of opportunity]] and has reopened an old debate.

Some famous recent work on the policy efficaciousness of universal basic capital or asset-based egalitarianism has been conducted by [[Bruce Ackerman]] and Anne Alstott in ''The Stakeholder Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-300-07826-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this policy proposal, the method of funding the 'stake' was by means of a [[wealth tax]] and provides a sum of $80,000 for those reaching the age of majority.

In actual policy, [[Gordon Brown]] and the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] initiated the United Kingdom [[Child Trust Fund]], while in the [[United States]] the idea has been implemented in the form of [[Individual Development Accounts]] and argued for by Michael Sherraden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pegasus.xssl.net/~admin315/assets/files/reports/ABW.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923055039/http://pegasus.xssl.net/~admin315/assets/files/reports/ABW.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These remain the nearest practical examples.

One of the motivations of the related policy such as the Child Trust Fund is clear from this excerpt:
{{quotation|The account can give your child a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] as a young adult. It will help your child understand personal finance and the importance of saving for their future. The account belongs to them and when they turn 18, the money is theirs to use as they think best.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.childtrustfund.gov.uk/templates/Page____1171.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==

Asset-based egalitarian policies, such as the Ackerman and Alstott proposals, are often criticised as not being egalitarian. Due to different people having different abilities and talents to utilise financial wealth, there is always a risk that those without formal financial education would alienate their own freedom by dissipating their capital or "stakeblowing". Stuart White argued that unless education corrected for this, there would be an inegalitarian outcome, as people fundamentally have different asset-management capacities.&lt;ref&gt;White, S (2006) “The Citizen’s Stake and Paternalism” in Ackerman, B et al. (eds) Redesigning Distribution&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Time preference]] and [[Deferred gratification]].

He was a follower of [[John Pecham]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorge J. E. Gracia, Timothy B. Noone, ''A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages'' (2003), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at the [[University of Bologna]], and then for a degree at the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.bart.nl/~roestb/franciscan/franautb.htm#_Toc427589412 Franaut-B&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He preached in Paris in (what was thought to be) 1270.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.sandiego.edu/~macy/Bartholomew%20of%20Bologna.html Bartholomew of Bologna&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617080504/http://home.sandiego.edu/~macy/Bartholomew%20of%20Bologna.html |date=June 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works include the ''Tractatus de luce'', on [[optics]] but from a spiritual angle.

'''Bruce Manning Metzger''' (February 9, 1914 – February 13, 2007) was an American [[biblical scholar]], [[Bible translator]] and [[textual critic]] who was a longtime professor at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] and Bible editor who served on the board of the [[American Bible Society]] and [[United Bible Societies]]. He was a scholar of Greek, [[New Testament]], and New Testament textual criticism, and wrote prolifically on these subjects. Metzger is one of the most influential New Testament scholars of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="NYT2007"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Margalit Fox]] |title=Bruce Metzger, Scholar and Bible Translator, Dies at 93 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/16/obituaries/16metzger.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130728083543/http://www.pres-outlook.com/news-and-analysis3/1-news-a-analysis/4073.html New Testament Scholar and Bible Translator Bruce Metzger Dies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncccusa.org/news/070214metzger.html|title=Bruce Metzger dies at 93|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/3831/20130820184059/http://www.ncccusa.org/news/070214metzger.html|archivedate=August 20, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Metzger was born in [[Middletown, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania|Middletown, Pennsylvania]], and earned his BA (1935) at [[Lebanon Valley College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.ptsem.edu/index.aspx?id=25769807030|title=A Centennial Tribute to Bruce Metzger: Remembering His Achievements, Influence, and Legacy|date=24 January 2014|publisher=Princeton Seminary|accessdate=12 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209021650/http://ptsem.edu/index.aspx?id=25769807030|archivedate=February 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzger had strong academic training in Greek before enrolling in Princeton Seminary, and in the summer prior to entering the Seminary, he completed reading through the entire Bible consecutively for the twelfth time.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Manning Metzger, ''Reminiscences of an Octogenarian'' (1997), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Bachelor of Theology|ThB]] in 1938 at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], and in the autumn of 1938 began teaching at Princeton as a [[Fellow|Teaching Fellow]] in [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]]. On April 11, 1939, he was [[ordination|ordained]] in the [[United Presbyterian Church of North America]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Manning Metzger, ''Reminiscences of an Octogenarian'' (1997), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; which has since merged and is now known as the [[PCUSA|Presbyterian Church (USA)]]. In 1940, he earned his [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[Princeton University]] and became an instructor in [[New Testament]]. Two years later, he earned his PhD ("Studies in a Greek Gospel Lectionary ([[Lectionary 303|Greg. 303]])"), also from Princeton University.

In 1944, Metzger married Isobel Elizabeth Mackay, daughter of the third president of the Seminary, [[John A. Mackay]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Manning Metzger, ''Reminiscences of an Octogenarian'' (1997), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he was promoted to Assistant Professor. In 1948, he became Associate Professor, and full Professor in 1954. In 1964, Metzger was named the George L. Collord Professor of New Testament Language and Literature. In 1971, he was elected president of both the [[Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas]] and the [[Society of Biblical Literature]]. The following year, he became president of the North American Patristic Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patristics.org/about/|title=About - NAPS – The North American Patristics Society|first=NAPS – The North American Patristics|last=Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzger was visiting fellow at [[Clare Hall, Cambridge]] in 1974 and [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] in 1979. In 1978 he was elected corresponding fellow of the [[British Academy]], the Academy's highest distinction for persons who are not residents in the United Kingdom. At the age of seventy, after teaching at Princeton Theological Seminary for a period of forty-six years, he retired as Professor [[Emeritus]]. In 1994, Bruce Metzger was honoured with the Burkitt Medal for Biblical Studies by the [[British Academy]]. He was awarded [[honorary doctorate]]s from [[Lebanon Valley College]], the [[University of Findlay|Findlay College]], the [[University of St Andrews]], the [[University of Münster]] and [[Potchefstroom Campus|Potchefstroom University]]. "Metzger's unrivaled knowledge of the relevant languages, ancient and modern; his balanced judgment; and his painstaking attention to detail won him respect across the theological and academic spectrum."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Moorhead, ''Princeton Seminary in American Religion and Culture'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2012): 434.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative evangelical scholar [[Daniel B. Wallace]] described Metzger as "a fine, godly, conservative scholar, although his view of biblical authority is not quite the same as many other evangelicals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bible.org/article/inerrancy-and-text-critical-problem-romans-51|title=Inerrancy and the  Text-Critical Problem in Romans 5:1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his 93rd birthday, Metzger died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. He was survived by his wife Isobel and their two sons, John Mackay Metzger and James Bruce Metzger.

==Books and commentaries==
[[File:Kurt Aland - Amrican Bibl Society.jpg|left|thumb|Metzger, Aland, Wikgren, Black&lt;!-- Who is the figure to Metzger's right? There are clearly five people in this photo. --&gt;]]

Metzger edited and provided commentary for many Bible translations and wrote dozens of books. He was an editor of the [[United Bible Societies]]' standard Greek New Testament, the starting point for nearly all recent New Testament translations. In 1952, he became a contributor to the [[Revised Standard Version]] (RSV) of the Bible, and was general editor of the [[Revised Standard Version#Adaptations of the RSV|''Reader's Digest Bible'']] (a condensed version of the RSV) in 1982. From 1977 to 1990, he chaired the Committee on Translators for the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (NRSV) of the Bible and was "largely responsible for ... seeing [the NRSV] through the press."&lt;ref name="SBL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=638|title=SBL Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it a privilege to present the NRSV—which includes the books referred to as [[Apocrypha]] by Protestants, though [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] consider them [[deuterocanonical]]—to [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Patriarch Demetrius I of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="SBL"/&gt;

Central to his scholarly contribution to New Testament studies is his trilogy: ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'' (1964; 2nd ed., 1968; 3d enlarged ed., 1992); ''The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission, and Limitations'' (1977); ''The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;James A. Brooks, "Bruce Metzger as Textual Critic," ''Princeton Seminary Bulletin'', vol. 15, no. 2, new series (1994), 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume of a series that he founded and edited, ''New Testament Tools and Studies,'' appeared in 1960.

Metzger's commentaries often utilize [[historical criticism]] and [[higher criticism]], which attempt to explain the literary and historical origins of the Bible and the [[biblical canon]]. For instance, Metzger argues that the early church which assembled the New Testament did not consider [[biblical inspiration|divine inspiration]] to be a sufficient criterion for a book to be placed in the canon.{{dubious|reason=That this was Metzger's view is not in dispute, but isn't this a generally accepted "given" in historical scholarship on the formation of the canon? That's how it's treated by Dale Martin (https://cosmolearning.org/video-lectures/from-stories-to-canon-6796/), who attributes the idea that "inspiration" is an important criterion to "modern people", apparently implying that this is a modern misconception on the part of Christian popular culture, but was Metzger the progenitor of the idea that inspiration WASN'T the most important criterion? If not, it probably doesn't belong in this article, or should not be written the way it is so as to imply that other scholars disagree or disagreed with this view. The quotation provided in the citation for the following sentence, if that is all there is to it, indicates that associating this idea specifically with Metzger is indeed a weak form of OR. The cited source was published late in Metzger's life, only 12 years before the Martin lecture cited above.|date=September 2016}} Metzger says that the early church saw it as very important that a work describing Jesus' life be written by a follower of or an eyewitness to Jesus, and considered other works such as [[Shepherd of Hermas|''The Shepherd'' of Hermas]] and the ''[[Epistles of Clement (disambiguation)|Epistles of Clement]]'' to be inspired but not canonical.&lt;ref&gt;"The Fathers … did not consider inspiration to be a unique characteristic of canonical writings." Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Canon of the New Testament'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997), 256, and see 211, n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the canon, Metzger identifies three criteria “for acceptance of particular writings as sacred, authoritative, and worthy of being read in services of worship…”, criteria which were “generally adopted during the course of the second century, and were never modified thereafter”, namely, orthodoxy (conformity to the rule of faith), apostolicity, and consensus among the churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The New Testament: Its Background, Growth, and Content'', 3rd ed., rev. and enlarged (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2003), 317–8. And see the detailed discussion in Metzger, ''The Canon of the New Testament'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997), 251–4.&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that, “In the most basic sense neither individuals nor councils created the canon; instead they came to recognize and acknowledge the self-authenticating quality of these writings, which imposed themselves as canonical upon the church.”&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The New Testament: Its Background, Growth, and Content'', 3rd ed., rev. and enlarged (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2003), 318. Also see Metzger, ''The Canon of the New Testament'' (Oxford: Clarendon, 1997), 287–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlos Cossio''' ([[San Miguel de Tucuman]], February 3, 1903 - [[Buenos Aires]], August 24, 1987) was a militant [[University Reform of 1918|university reformer]], [[jurist]], [[lawyer]], [[philosophy of law|legal philosopher]] and [[teacher]] in [[Argentina]]. One of his most important works is the concept of the [[Egological Theory of Law]].

== Biography ==
Cossio had his primary and secondary education in [[Tucumán]], then moved to Buenos Aires to study at the Faculty of Law of the [[University of Buenos Aires]], where he joined the university reform movement, being one of the leaders of the Student Center. He completed his doctoral thesis on the topic of "The University Reform and the Problem of the New Generation," published in 1927.

From 1934 to 1948, he taught at the [[National University of La Plata]] where he began to develop his theories on egological law. In 1948, he took over the Chair of Philosophy of Law at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], where he finished the definition of his original conception of law. He was surrounded by a large group of followers and disciples, including [[Ambrose Lucas Gioja]], [[Julio Cesar Cueto Rua]], [[Genaro Carrió]], [[José Vilanova]], [[Daniel Herrendorf]], [[Enrique Aftalion]], and [[Carlos Spini]], who formed the "Argentina Legal School." During this time, his recognition and prestige reached a level never imagined before. His definition of law as "interference intersubjective behaviors" brought him into a controversy with [[Hans Kelsen]], creator of the [[Pure Theory of Law]], at the same law school in Buenos Aires in 1949.

In 1956, he had to leave his chair forced by the military government because of his alleged sympathy for the [[Peronist]]s, and it was only in 1973 when he could return thanks to the efforts of his friend and disciple, Julio Raffo. The military and its supporters largely destroyed the strength of the "Argentina Law School" and its potential for expansion. The liberal bourgeoisie and the political right never forgave their fidelity to their independent judgment and the fact that they never belonged to a political party, but ardently defended their ideas and proposals. Cossio did respond to an official survey on the then possible constitutional reform that materialized in 1949. While many of his colleagues avoided to comment by pretending to be distracted during the military dictatorships of General Juan Carlos Ongania and Jorge Rafael Videla, the old professor spoke from the podium and repudiated the human rights crimes.

His major work is Ideology and Law, developed from the concept of phenomenology of judgment, the judge's process of interpretation and understanding of the law, and the ideological and class backgrounds of liberal capitalist law. In his early thesis in ''The Law'' magazine, Cossio explained that what judges do affects everyone and what they do remains hidden, both for themselves as for who are "secured" by their decisions. "We are all involved in what judges do, good or bad, and not just for what might be perceived at first glance", Cossio says, "but much more because all of them, day by day and hour by hour, they do something for the right wing or the left wing, and also for democracy or totalitarianism, gravitating over the social life specifically, as agents of the law". Those judges often ignore the scope of their duties because the said contribution being something more vivid than a thought, is on the basis of the situation that those agents of the law defend, a situation inevitably referred to the leading social structures".

Cossio accepted the [[Pure Theory of Law]] of [[Hans Kelsen]], and made it part of his own theory. However, the tension between the two visions was always present. Cossio accepted positive law, but did not accept the mechanistic normativism{{clarify|date=March 2016}} as the object of legal science. Cossio distinguished himself by demonstrating that law should be understood and interpreted by a theory of knowledge regarding human behavior in intersubjective interference. It was not just about ideal legal subjects (normativism mechanistic) but about people, real human beings: "the right as human behavior."

Cossio's work asserted that, "The judge looks at the law and not as conclusive as fact, but as something that is constantly making its living character of human life."

His work, unlike his skeptics', was translated into French, Yugoslav, German, Polish, Portuguese, Finnish, Swedish, and other languages. In 1986 he received the [[Konex Award]] for his development of the Humanities in Argentina. 

The [[egological theory of law]] is one of the most outstanding expressions of the Latin American cultural movement influenced by the university reform. Its main followers are [[Daniel Herrendorf]] (Luxemburg), Albert Brimo (Paris) and Julio Cesar Cueto Rua (Buenos Aires).

== The Egological Theory of Law ==

Its development appeared in his book entitled "The egological theory of law and the legal concept of freedom," whose first edition was published in 1944, and twenty years later, a second edition was published by the printer Abeledo-Perrot, a traditional legal publisher in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
His ideas took shape around 1941 and drew from Edmund Husserl, the last great classical philosopher, and delved into Kant, Martin Heidegger and Hans Kelsen. Husserl used the theory of objects (regional ontologies) acts theory and difference, butt, Kantian root, between formal legal logic and transcendental legal logic. Cossio's contribution was a legal philosophy of science that struck alike the religious mood of Thomistic natural law and legal positivism from the nineteenth century, renovated by the technical-legal. Parthian positive law with Cossian construction shelved the mechanistic normativism as an object of legal science to study the right understanding and interpreting by a theory of knowledge about human behavior in intersubjective interference. Cossio said that the philosophy of law should be studied from the dogmatic science of law and that science was a kind of knowledge crucial for philosophical reflection.
In this work, he drew back the veil on the ideological background capitalistic conceptions of Hans Kelsen's formal logic. Cossio said: 'Kelsen corresponds to a capitalist world and placed on the defensive from the seats of the State in a bourgeois Europe, undifferentiated, and therefore legal scrutiny should not be discussed political power and so their ideas can spread geographically that of Savigny; finally socially conservative groups are those that have been interpreted by those jurists who, as Gény or Kantorowicz, have spoken and continue to speak of 'a resurrection of the eternal natural law.' Later he added: 'criminal liberalism has proclaimed to all the winds that would offend inability associations. As its specific crime is unspeakable enrichment and as are the capitalists who are associated to enrich, obvious their interest to leave unpunished a crime that only they can practically commit '. Cossio concluded saying: "In short: the critical history of the legal conceptions, the errors tematizarlas as a criminal ideology Karl Marx. In this case scientific ideologies lead us to thematize them as an epistemology of error.

== Egológic ==

"Egologic" is a word which the author explains in a previous work "The Theory egological law: Their problem and its problems", also appeared under the printer Abeledo-Perrot in Buenos Aires in 1963. In his own words: "It seems appropriate to an illustrious parallel in order to understand our language:'' Phenomenology'', composed voice of phenomenon and logos, meaning knowledge of phenomena. But [[Hegel]], reversing the priority of voices components, used to signify the logos phenomenalization and this logo on your system the absolute spirit. And we know that [[Husserl]] investment has remained Hegelian significance, except that the logos for him, is the being of entities. Therefore for [[Husserl]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] means phenomenalization of the being of entities. Similarly, egology in egological theory of law, is the meaning of egolization of legal logos, ie egolization of being legal (given the phenomenological equivalence between the logos and be). And there is talk that the transcendental ego is the action, "I act" of any action in instead of "I think" all judgment, "I act" of behavior instead of "I think" the intellect, with egology phenomenalization We could mean as being legal conduct."

== Fundamental thesis ==

The synthesis of thought can be expressed egological in the following propositions: a) the right to conduct interference is intersubjective; b) the law considers all human actions; c) the right is interested in the human act in its unity, d) the right implies the possibility of acts of force; e) freedom is the right content ineliminable f) legal norms conceptualize interference behavior intersubjective g) legal rules and penalties are charged disjunctive judgments, differing from [Hans Kelsen] understanding that the standard was a hypothetical judgment.

== Hans Kelsen Controversy ==

The relevance of the theory in the field egological the right can be seen the significant fact that the Austrian jurist [[Hans Kelsen]] visited in 1949 the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina and engaged in a famous debate with him:

His controversy with Kelsen was reproduced in the book ''Theory egological and pure theory.'' During Kelsen's visit to Argentina, in 1951, Cossio said the physicalist metaphysics he hid static and dynamic traffic Viennese Professor pretemático who performed at that point, between the representative-level conceptual and intuitive plane-real. Probably not worked the work of French Michel Foucault, by the way of intuition in knowledge, but went ahead with these ideas applied to the philosophy of science of law, to the French. This allowed him to dabble in the activity of the judge and make a phenomenological description of the court judgment. Among the elements of the sentence, Cossio recognized three aspects:

a) Legal Structure: the law given a priori;
b) Representations contingent: no insults circumstances
and c) Experience of Judge: Legal assessment.

It was not idealist-metaphysical aspects (normativism mechanistic) but people, real human beings (the right as human behavior). Thus the normative logic was inserted in plenary life without losing its significant role. The first judge's immanence in the law, is 'strictly ontic' as concerns the being of things described. So Cossio says that the judicial creation of the judge's ruling requires meaningful behavior. The judicial creation of the judgment by the judge makes do with evidence that this is not a separate entity and foreign law. 'The judge said Cossio-watching law and not as conclusive as fact, but as something that is constantly making its living character of human life' and added: 'The judicial function is a real analytic a priori within the notion of a logic of what should be '.
In the last years of his life, during the years of the military dictatorship (1976 - 1983), participated with [[Ernesto Giudice]] in the dissemination activities organized by the University Reform Fundación Juan B. Right.
Separation from their chairs Cossio not prevent him from thinking but I felt a great pain for not being able to collaborate in the formation of law students. He received awards, was recognized abroad, served as co-director of the Revue Internationale du Droit of Theorie, managing to form a huge galaxy of legal discípulos.ción.

In [[multi-agent system]] research, '''distributed knowledge''' is all the knowledge that a community of agents possesses and might apply in solving a problem.  Distributed knowledge is approximately what "a wise man knows" or what someone who has complete knowledge of what each member of the community knows knows.  Distributed knowledge might also be called the aggregate knowledge of a community, as it represents all the knowledge that a community might bring to bear to solve a problem.  Other related phrasings include cumulative knowledge, collective knowledge, pooled knowledge, or the wisdom of the crowd.  Distributed knowledge is the union of all the knowledge of individuals in a community.

== Example ==
The logicians Aaleyah and Isko are sitting in their dark office wondering whether or not it is raining outside. Now, none of them actually knows, but Aaleyah knows something about her friend Yu Yan, namely that Yu Yan wears her red coat [[only if]] it is raining. Bob does not know this, but he just saw Yu Yan, and noticed that she was wearing her red coat. Even though none of them knows whether or not it is raining, it is ''distributed knowledge'' amongst them that it is raining. If either one of them tells the other what they know, it will be clear to the other that it is raining.

If we denote by &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; that Yu Yan wears a red coat and with &lt;math&gt;\varphi \Rightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt; that if Yu Yan wears a red coat, it is raining, we have

: &lt;math&gt;(K_b\varphi \land K_a(\varphi \Rightarrow \psi)) \Rightarrow D_{a,b}\psi&lt;/math&gt;

Directly translated: Bob knows that Carol wears a red coat and Aaleyah knows that if Carol wears a red coat it is raining so together they know that it is raining.

Distributed knowledge is related to the concept [[Wisdom of the crowd]]. Distributed knowledge reflects the fact that "no one of us is smarter than all of us."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4786">'''Entity realism''' (also '''selective realism'''),&lt;ref name=Psillos/&gt; sometimes equated with [[Direct reference theory|referential realism]],&lt;ref&gt;Nola, R. (1988) ''Relativism and Realism in Science'', Springer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IfQDs1JxW20C&amp;pg=PA32 p. 32], quotation: {{quotation|Entity realism is strongly supported in Harre (1986) under the name 'referential realism'}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a philosophical position within the debate about [[scientific realism]]. It is a variation of realism (independently proposed by [[Stanford School]] philosophers [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Ian Hacking]] in 1983) that restricts warranted belief to only certain entities.&lt;ref name=Psillos&gt;Psillos, Stathis, ''Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks Truth'', Routledge, 1999, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview&lt;!--'Instrumental realism' and 'Experimental realism' redirect here--&gt;==
Whereas traditional scientific realism argues that our best scientific theories are true, or approximately true, or closer to the truth than their predecessors, entity realism does not commit itself to judgments concerning the truth of scientific theories. Instead, entity realism claims that the theoretical [[entity|entities]] that feature in scientific [[theory|theories]], e.g. '[[electron]]s', should be regarded as real if and only if they refer to phenomena that can be routinely used to create effects in domains that can be investigated independently. 'Manipulative success' thus becomes the criterion by which to judge the reality of (typically unobservable) scientific entities. As [[Ian Hacking]], the main proponent of this formulation of entity realism, puts it (referring to an experiment he observed in a Stanford laboratory, where electrons and positrons were sprayed, one after the other, onto a [[superconductor|superconducting]] metal sphere), "if you can spray them, then they are real."&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I. ''Representing and Intervening'', page 24. Cambridge University Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Entity realism has been an influential position partly because it coincided with a general trend in philosophy of science, and science studies more generally, to downplay the role of theories and put more emphasis on [[experiment]]ation and scientific practice. Thus, entity realism sometimes is also called '''instrumental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Norris (critic)|Norris, Christopher]], ''Hilary Putnam: Realism, Reason and the Uses of Uncertainty'', Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''experimental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Resnik, D. "Hacking's Experimental Realism", ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' Vol. 24 (1994), 395–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
While many philosophers acknowledge the intuitive pull of entity realism, it has also been strongly (some would say: conclusively) criticised, both as being too restrictive (in that it ignores entities that are observable yet do not lend themselves to manipulation)&lt;ref&gt;Shapere, D. "Astronomy and Antirealism", ''Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 60 (1993), 134–150.&lt;/ref&gt; and as being too permissive (to the extent that seemingly successful instances of manipulation may turn out to be spurious).&lt;ref&gt;Gelfert, A. "Manipulative Success and the Unreal", ''International Studies in the Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 17 (2003), 245–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stathis Psillos]] remarks that entity realism is indeed a realist position (since it defends the reality of unobservable entities), but it is a selective realist position, since "it restricts warranted belief to entities only, and suggests to fellow realists that they are wrong in claiming that the theoretical descriptions of these entities are approximately true."&lt;ref name=Psillos/&gt; Psillos also remarks that to a certain extent "this scepticism about theories is motivated by none other than the argument from the [[pessimistic induction]]".&lt;ref name=Psillos/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9844">[[Image:Sangreal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Holy Grail]], illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], 1917. [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] art at this time often represented contemporary interest in the "spirit body", "aura" or "body of light".]]
The '''etheric body''', '''ether-body''', '''æther body''', a name given by [[neo-Theosophy]] to a '''vital body''' or [[subtle body]] propounded in [[esoteric]] philosophies as the first or lowest layer in the "human energy field" or [[aura (paranormal)|aura]].&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Barbara, ''Hands of Light : A Guide to Healing Through the Human Energy Field ([http://www.kheper.net/topics/subtlebody/BAB-etheric.htm Etheric body])'', Bantam Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be in immediate contact with the [[Human anatomy|physical body]], to sustain it and connect it with "higher" bodies.

The English term "etheric" in this context seems to derive from the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] writings of [[Madame Blavatsky]], but its use was formalised by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C.W. Leadbeater]]&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C. W., ''Man, Visible and Invisible'', 1902&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Annie Besant]]&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie, ''Man and His Bodies'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; due to the elimination of Hindu terminology from the system of seven planes and bodies. ([[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar School of Theosophy]]).

The term gained some general popularity after the 1914-18 war, [[Walter John Kilner]] having adopted it for a layer of the "human atmosphere" which, as he claimed in a popular book, could be rendered visible to the naked eye by means of certain exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Kilner, Walter J., ''The Human Atmosphere, or the Aura Made Visible by the aid of Chemical Screens'', 1911, reprinted as "The Human Aura" by Citadel Press, NY, 1965, {{ISBN|0-8065-0545-1}}. The Aura, by Walter J. Kilner. Introd. by Sibyl Ferguson. New York, S. Weiser, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical element [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]] of Platonic and Aristotlean physics continued in Victorian scientific proposals of a [[Luminiferous ether]] as well as the cognate chemical substance ether. According to Theosophists and [[Alice Bailey]] the etheric body inhabits an [[etheric plane]] which corresponds to the four higher subplanes of the [[physical plane]]. The intended reference is therefore to some extremely rarefied matter, analogous in usage to the word "spirit" (originally "breath"). In selecting it as the term for a clearly defined concept in an Indian-derived metaphysical system, the Theosophists aligned it with ideas such as the [[Kosha|prana-maya-kosha]] (sheath made of [[prana]], subtle breath or life-force) of [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] thought.

In popular use it is often confounded with the related concept of the [[astral body]] as for example in the term [[astral projection]] - the early Theosophists had called it the "astral double". Others prefer to speak of the "lower and higher astral".

== Accounts ==
{{planes of existence}}
[[Linga sarira]] is a Sanskrit term for the invisible double of the human body, the etheric body or etheric double (or [[astral body]] in some Theosophical concepts). It is one of the seven principles of the human being, according to Theosophical philosophy.

[[Rudolf Steiner]], the founder of [[Anthroposophy]], often referred to the etheric body (''Ätherleib'' or "Life Body") in association with the etheric formative forces and the [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] of [[Human|man]] and the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Rudolf, ''Occult science&amp;nbsp;– An Outline''. Trans. George and Mary Adams. London: Rudolf Steiner Press, 1909, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, it can be perceived by a person gifted with clairvoyance as being of "peach-blossom color".

Steiner considered the etheric reality or life principle as quite distinct from the physical material reality, being intermediate between the physical world and the astral or soul world.
The etheric body can be characterised as the life force also present in the plant kingdom. It maintains the physical body's form until death. At that time, it separates from the physical body and the physical reverts to natural disintegration.

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings,&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Mysteries (Chapter IV, [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rms/rmseng02.htm#Chapter_IV The Constitution of Man: Vital Body - Desire Body - Mind])'', 1911, {{ISBN|0-911274-86-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the etheric body, composed of four ethers, is called the "Vital Body" since the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] is the way of ingress for vital force from the [[Sun]] and the field of agencies in nature which promote such vital activities as assimilation, growth, and propagation. It is an exact counterpart of our physical body, molecule for molecule, and organ for organ, but it is of the opposite polarity. It is slightly larger, extending about one and one-half inches beyond the periphery of the physical body.

[[Samael Aun Weor]] teaches that the vital body is the tetra-dimensional part of the physical body and the foundation of organic life.&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, ''The Pistis Sophia Unveiled'', Thelema Press, (1983) 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, "[http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/230/99/ Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509180046/http://www.gnosticteachings.org/content/view/230/99/ |date=2007-05-09 }}", ''The Book of the Dead'',  1966&lt;/ref&gt; He states that in the second Initiation of Fire, which is reached through working with [[Sex magic#Samael Aun Weor|sexual magic]] with a spouse, the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] rises in the vital body. Then the initiate learns how to separate the two superior ethers from the others in order for them to serve as a vehicle to travel out of the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, ''The Three Mountains'', Thelema Press, (1972) 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beings that possess only etheric bodies ==
In the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Deva (New Age)|Devas]] are regarded as living either in the [[atmosphere]]s of the [[planet]]s of the [[solar system]] (''Planetary Angels'') or inside the [[Sun]] (''Solar Angels'') (presumably other [[planetary system]]s and [[star]]s have their own angels) and they help to guide the operation of the processes of [[nature]] such as the process of [[evolution]] and the growth of [[plants]]; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human being.  It is believed by Theosophists that devas can be observed when the [[third eye]] is activated.  Some (but not most) devas originally incarnated as [[human being]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson, Geoffrey, ''Kingdom of the Gods'' {{ISBN|0-7661-8134-0}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Has color pictures of what Devas supposedly look like when observed by the [[third eye]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human being.

It is believed by Theosophists that [[nature spirit]]s, [[elementals]] ([[gnome]]s, [[Ondine (mythology)|ondines]], [[sylphs]], and [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamanders]]), and [[Fairy|fairies]] can also be observed when the [[third eye]] is activated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021121131124/http://geocities.com/athens/Olympus/3987/devas4.html Eskild Tjalve’s paintings of devas, nature spirits, elementals and fairies:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings have never been previously incarnated as human beings; they are regarded as on a separate line of spiritual evolution called the “deva evolution”; eventually, as their [[soul]]s advance as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], it is believed they will incarnate as devas.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E.

In the [[United States]], the '''exclusionary rule''' is a legal rule, based on [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]]. The rule prevents [[evidence (law)|evidence]] collected or analyzed in violation of the [[defendant]]'s [[constitutional right]]s from being used in a [[Court|court of law]]. This may be considered an example of a [[prophylactic rule]] formulated by the judiciary in order to protect a constitutional right. The exclusionary rule may also, in some circumstances at least, be considered to follow directly from the constitutional language, such as the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s command that no person "shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself" and that no person "shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law".&lt;ref name=Re&gt;Re, Richard. [http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vol127_re.pdf "The Due Process Exclusionary Rule: A new textual foundation for a rule in crisis"], ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Vol. 127, p. 1885 (2014).  ''See also'' [http://harvardlawreview.org/2014/05/regarding-res-revisionism/ "Regarding Re’s Revisionism: Notes on The Due Process Exclusionary Rule"], ''Harvard Law Review'', Vol. 127, p. 302 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The exclusionary rule is grounded in the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] and it is intended to protect citizens from illegal searches and seizures."&lt;ref&gt;Berg, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusionary rule is also designed to provide a [[Legal remedy|remedy]] and disincentive, which is short of criminal prosecution in response to [[Prosecution|prosecutor]]s and [[police]] who illegally gather evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] compelled to [[self-incrimination]]. The exclusionary rule also protects against violations of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]], which guarantees the [[right to counsel]].

Most states also have their own exclusionary remedies for illegally obtained evidence under their state constitutions and/or statutes, some of which predate the federal constitutional guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures and compelled self-incrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leonetti|first=Carrie|title=Independent and Adequate: Maryland's State Exclusionary Rule for Illegally Obtained Evidence|journal=University of Baltimore Law Review|date=Winter 2009|volume=38|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule is occasionally referred to as a [[legal technicality]] because it allows defendants a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually committed. In this respect, it is similar to the explicit rule in the Fifth Amendment protecting people from [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Double jeopardy|double jeopardy]].
In strict cases, when an illegal action is used by police/prosecution to gain any incriminating result, ''all'' evidence whose recovery stemmed from the illegal action—this evidence is known as "[[fruit of the poisonous tree]]"—can be thrown out from a jury (or be grounds for a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] if too much information has been irrevocably revealed).

The exclusionary rule applies to all persons within the United States regardless of whether they are citizens, immigrants (legal or illegal), or visitors.

==History of the rule==
Up until the [[American Revolution|independence of the United States]], the courts of England excluded self-incriminating evidence that was provided as a result of official compulsion, regardless of its reliability.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Davies, Thomas. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=992830 “Farther and Farther from the Original Fifth Amendment: The Recharacterization of the Right Against Self-Incrimination as a 'Trial Right' in Chavez V. Martinez”], ''Tennessee Law Review'', Volume 70, pages 987–1045 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1769, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Chief Justice Mansfield]] explained as follows:{{cquote|[I]n civil causes, the court will force parties to produce evidence which may prove against themselves; or leave the refusal to do it (after proper notice) as a strong presumption, to the jury....But in a criminal or penal cause, the defendant is never forced to produce any evidence; though he should hold it in his hands in court.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe v. Harvey'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=gtUsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2484 98 Eng. Rep. 302] (K.B. 1769).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Chief Justice Mansfield also explained that "If any evidence or confession has been extorted from her, it will be of no prejudice to her on the trial."&lt;ref&gt;''Rudd's Case'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WYw0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA123&amp;dq=%22If+any+evidence+or+confession+has+been+extorted%22&amp;ei=re9SSYjOFIjcygTjncH2Cw#PRA1-PA115,M1 168 Eng. Rep. 160] (K.B. 1775).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a defendant could sue to suppress and regain possession of at least some types of illegally seized evidence, in a [[common law]] action for [[replevin]].&lt;ref name="Warden"&gt;''Warden v. Hayden'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/387/294.html 387 U.S. 294] (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 1783 case of ''Ceglinski v. Orr'', the English courts declined to suppress evidence obtained by illegal coercion. In the ''Warickshall'' case, evidence was gathered as a result of an involuntary confession, and the court held that the evidence (but not the confession itself) could be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;''King v. Warickshall'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nwg-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA286 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235] (K.B. 1783).&lt;/ref&gt; It is questionable whether the ''Warickshall'' rule became known in the United States before 1789 (when the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]] was written), and whether it applied to confessions obtained by both governmental and private parties.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; In any event, no decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has ever endorsed the ''Warickshall'' rule as a constitutional matter.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;

Generally speaking, [[English law]] before 1789 did not provide as strong an exclusionary rule as the one that later developed under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], regarding unlawful searches and seizures.&lt;ref name="Warden"/&gt; The Fourth Amendment, after all, was partly a reaction against English law including the [[general warrant]] and the [[writs of assistance]].&lt;ref name="Warden" /&gt;

In the 1886 case of ''[[Boyd v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Zoo v. United States'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/116/616.html 116 U.S. 616] (1886).&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court addressed compulsory production of business papers, and the Court excluded those papers based on a combination of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. ''Boyd'' was closely limited to its facts, and several years later the Court stated that the Fourth Amendment does not extend to "excluding testimony" about wrongful searches and seizures.&lt;ref&gt;''Adams v. New York'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/192/585.html 192 U.S. 585] (1904).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in ''Bram v. United States'',&lt;ref&gt;''Bram v. United States'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/168/532.html 168 U.S. 532] (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; that involuntary confessions are inadmissible as evidence. The Court in ''Bram'' did not announce a strong version of the exclusionary rule that would apply uniformly to exclude all evidence gathered in violation of the Bill of Rights, but instead announced a weak version that excluded only self-incriminating testimony that was compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The distinction between testimonial versus other self-incriminating evidence is a matter of continuing debate.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;''United States v. Hubbell'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=530&amp;page=27 530 U.S. 27] (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring): "A substantial body of evidence suggests that the Fifth Amendment privilege protects against the compelled production not just of incriminating testimony, but of any incriminating evidence."&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a strong version of the exclusionary rule was addressed and adopted by the federal courts, it had already been adopted by at least one state court, namely the [[Iowa Supreme Court]], as that court would later describe:{{cquote|The genesis of Iowa’s exclusionary rule was a civil case, ''Reifsnyder v. Lee'', 44 Iowa 101 (1876).... The first application of the exclusionary rule in a criminal context occurred in the ''Height'' case, decided in 1902. ''Height'' involved a physical exam of the defendant against his will. 117 Iowa at 652, 91 N.W. at 935. This court held that the examination of the defendant violated the due process clause of the Iowa Constitution, as well as article 1, section 8’s prohibition of unreasonable searches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=ia&amp;vol=sc%5C20000907%5C99-0412&amp;invol=1 ''Iowa v. Cline''], 617 N.W.2d 277, 285-86
(Iowa 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1914, the U.S. Supreme Court announced a strong version of the exclusionary rule, in the case of ''[[Weeks v. United States]]'', under the Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures.&lt;ref&gt;''Weeks v. United States'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/232/383.html 232 U.S. 383] (1914).&lt;/ref&gt; This decision, however, created the rule only on the federal level. The "''Weeks'' rule," which made an exception for cases at the state level, was adopted by numerous states at a time during [[prohibition]]. In adopting the rule, actions by states often reflected attitudes towards prohibition, which was enacted by adoption of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and was enforced through the [[Volstead Act]]. Concerns about privacy violations also extended to other instances where criminal sanctions were permitted for "victimless" crime, such as illegal gambling or narcotics violations.&lt;ref name="Allen1961"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exclusionary Rule in the American Law of Search and Seizure, The Exclusionary Rule Regarding Illegally Seized Evidence|author=Allen, Francis A.|journal=Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science|volume=52|issue=3|year=1961|pages=246–254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine in the case of ''[[Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Silverthorne Lumber v. United States'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/251/385.html 251 U.S. 385] (1920).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court stated that allowing evidence gathered as an indirect result of an unconstitutional search and seizure "reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of words".

''[[Wolf v. Colorado]]'' {{Ussc|338|25|1949|el=no}}  ruled that states were not required to adopt the exclusionary rule. Despite the ruling, some states adopted the exclusionary rule. In 1955, the [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled in ''People v. Cahan''&lt;ref&gt;(1955) 44 Cal.2d 434&lt;/ref&gt; that the exclusionary rule applied for cases in the state of California. By 1960, 22 states had adopted the rule without substantial qualifications: California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming. Michigan also had an exclusionary rule, but with limitations for some narcotics and firearms evidence. In Alabama, Maryland, and South Dakota, the exclusionary rule applied in some situations.&lt;ref name="Allen1961"/&gt;

It was not until ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|367|643|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961 that the exclusionary rule was also held to be binding on the [[U.S. state|states]] through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which guarantees [[due process]]. Up until ''Mapp'', the exclusionary rule had been rejected by most states.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Paul. [http://www.law.utah.edu/_personfiles/57/HIGHLIGHTS/C1993utahlr751.pdf "The Mysterious Creation of Search and Seizure Exclusionary Rules Under State Constitutions: The Utah Example,"] ''Utah Law Review'', No. 3, page 751, 756 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Utah v. Strieff]] dealt with the exclusionary rule and outstanding warrants and was viewed to be generally favorable towards police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-the-exclusionary-rule-is-weakened-but-it-still-lives/|title=Opinion analysis: The exclusionary rule is weakened but it still lives|date=2016-06-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21701170-supreme-court-weakens-law-against-unreasonable-searches-amended|title=Amended|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of the rule==
The exclusionary rule does not apply in a [[Civil law (common law)|civil case]], in a [[grand jury]] proceeding, or in a [[parole]] revocation hearing.

Even in a criminal case, the exclusionary rule does not simply bar the introduction of all evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendment. In ''[[Hudson v. Michigan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hudson v. Michigan]]'', 547 U.S. 586, 126 S.Ct. 2159 (June 15, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] wrote for the U.S. Supreme Court:

{{Cquote|Suppression of evidence, however, has always been our last resort, not our first impulse. The exclusionary rule generates "substantial social costs," ''[[United States v. Leon]]'', 468 U.S. 897, 907 (1984), which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large. We have therefore been "cautious against expanding" it, ''[[Colorado v. Connelly]]'', 479 U.S. 157, 166 (1986), and "have repeatedly emphasized that the rule's 'costly toll' upon truth-seeking and law enforcement objectives presents a high obstacle for those urging [its] application," ''[[Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott]]'', 524 U.S. 357, 364–365 (1998) (citation omitted). We have rejected "indiscriminate application" of the rule, Leon, supra, at 908, and have held it to be applicable only "where its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciously served," ''[[United States v. Calandra]]'', 414 U.S. 338, 348 (1974){{spaced ndash}}that is, "where its deterrence benefits outweigh its 'substantial social costs,'" Scott, supra, at 363, (quoting Leon, supra, at 907). Whether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case is an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct.}}

Limitations on the exclusionary rule have included the following:
* Evidence unlawfully obtained from the defendant by a private person is admissible. The exclusionary rule is designed to protect privacy rights, with the Fourth Amendment applying specifically to government officials.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Burdeau v. McDowell]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=256&amp;invol=465 256 U.S. 465] (1921)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence can only be suppressed if the illegal search violated the person's own (the person making the court motion) constitutional rights. The exclusionary rule does not apply to privacy rights of a third party.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Jeffers]]'' and ''[[Jones v. United States (1960)|Jones v. United States]]'' clarify the standing requirements.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a narrow exception to this standing requirement, the ''[[jus tertii]]'' standing exception.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Singleton v. Wulff Et Al.'', 96 S. Ct. 2868, 428 U.S. 106 (U.S. 1976); "The Assertion of Constitutional Jus Tertii: A Substantive Approach", Robert Allen Sedler, ''California Law Review'', Vol. 70, No. 6 (Dec., 1982), pp.&amp;nbsp;1308–1344; "Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii", 88 ''Harv.L.Rev''. 423, (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The defendant cannot take advantage of the situation (police breaching rules) to turn the case to his advantage, in face of other evidence against himself.  This falls under the exigent circumstances exception.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Walder v. United States]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Silver Platter doctrine which was ruled unconstitutional in the case of ''[[Elkins v. United States]]'' in 1960. State officials that obtained evidence illegally were allowed to turn over evidence to federal officials, and have that evidence be admitted into trial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wolf v. Colorado]]'' {{Ussc|338|25|1949|el=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Nix v. Williams]]'' held that if the evidence obtained in the unlawful search would almost definitely have been found eventually even without said search ([[inevitable discovery]]), the evidence may be brought forth in court.
* If police officers acting in good faith (''bona fides'') rely upon a defective search warrant, then the evidence acquired may still be used under the [[good-faith exception]].

The exclusionary rule is not applicable to non-U.S. nationals residing outside of U.S. borders. In ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', {{Ussc|504|655|1992|el=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Supreme Court decided that property owned by aliens in a foreign country is admissible in court. Certain persons in the U.S. receive limited protections, such as prisoners, probationers, parolees, and persons crossing U.S. borders. Corporations, by virtue of being, also have limited rights under the Fourth Amendment (see [[corporate personhood]]).

In the case of [[Florida v. Jimeno]] it was found that the evidence found to convict Jimeno, although at first was not admissible, later was found to in fact be admissible since it passed the test of reasonable standards.  The defendant consented to a search of his car, and when the officer searched a package and found drugs, it was not said to be in violation because a reasonable person would expect illegal narcotics to be kept in a package or container.&lt;ref name=Oyez&gt;{{cite web| title =FLORIDA v. JIMENO | work =Oyez| year =1991| url =https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1990/1990_90_622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parallel construction ===
The Special Operations Division of the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] advises DEA agents to follow a process of ''[[parallel construction]]'' when launching criminal investigations of Americans based on SOD tips that may be based on [[NSA warrantless surveillance|warrantless surveillance]].&lt;ref name="Reuters SOD"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Exclusive: U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans |agency=Reuters |first1=John |last1=Shiffman |first2=Kristina |last2=Cooke |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805 |date=August 5, 2013|accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and defense==

The exclusionary rule as it has developed in the United States has been long criticized. Judge [[Benjamin Cardozo]], Chief Judge of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] between 1927 and 1932, stated that under the rule, "The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered." The judge noted that many states had rejected the rule, but suggested that the adoption by the federal courts would affect the practice in the sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;''People of the State of New York v.

By the 1980s, the exclusionary rule remained controversial and was strongly opposed by President [[Ronald Reagan]]. But, some opponents began seeking to have the rule modified, rather than abolished altogether. The case, ''[[Illinois v.

The Supreme Court also considered allowing exceptions for errors made by police in [[good faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nestlerode|first1=Jana|date=Winter-Spring 2010|title=Handcuffing America's Fourth Amendment: ERODING THE INTENT OF THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE|url=http://tiafp.org/restricted/TheForensicDigestVol2Issue1.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|journal=|publisher=Journal of the Academy of Forensic Nursing Science|volume=2|issue=1|pages=22–35|accessdate=January 7, 2013|via=|work=The Forensic Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Reagan administration also asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] to ease the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusionary-Rule Fight Moves to Supreme Court |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1983-01-26 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/us/exclusionary-rule-fight-moves-to-supreme-court.html |last=Taylor |first=Stuart, Jr. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that the exclusionary rule be replaced with [[restitution]] to victims of [[police misconduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=32|publisher=Emory L.

A major criticism of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is that it allegedly defies the original intent of the Constitution.  Yale Law Professor [[Akhil Amar]], for example, has argued that "nothing in the text, history, or structure of the Fourth Amendment" supports the rule.&lt;ref&gt;Akhil Reed Amar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure: First Principles 91 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics like Amar, Oaks and Wilkey point to the fact that the text of the Fourth Amendment does not indicate that illegally seized evidence must be excluded.  Some legal historians argue that the Constitution's Framers intended only that victims of unreasonable searches or seizures could file civil lawsuits.

In 2009, Roger Roots presented evidence that the idea of exclusion can be found in the earliest set of law books published in American history.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Roots, "The Originalist Case for the Fourth Amendment Exclusionary Rule", ''[[Gonzaga Law Review]]'', Vol. 45, pp. 1-66 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Roots elaborated that certain eighteenth-century British law books and pamphlets which discuss the exclusion of illegally seized evidence circulated widely in the American colonies and were owned by numerous prominent Framing-era lawyers and statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Roots, "The Framers' Fourth Amendment Exclusionary Rule: The Mounting Evidence", ''[[Nevada Law Journal]]'', Vol. 15, pp. 42-76 (2014) http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=roger_roots&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2014, Professor Richard Re proposed that the Due Process Clause provides an ample basis for the Exclusionary Rule.&lt;ref name=Re /&gt;

'''Henry Dilworth Gilpin''' (April 14, 1801 – January 29, 1860) was an American lawyer and statesman of [[Quaker]] extraction who served as [[Attorney General of the United States]] under President [[Martin Van Buren]].

He was the son of [[Joshua Gilpin (paper maker)|Joshua Gilpin]] and [[Mary Dilworth]], and was born in [[Lancaster, England|Lancaster]], England, just before his parents returned to America. His father had been on extended tour of Britain and Europe, lasting from 1795 to 1801, during which he obtained information about the new manufacturing methods used in paper-making for his family paper mills on [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] in Delaware. His mother was from the Quaker Dilworths of Lancaster, England.

The family returned to England for another tour in 1812, and returned to the United States in about 1816, during which time Henry attended school near London. After graduating from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he studied law with [[Joseph R. Ingersoll]] and was admitted to the bar in 1822. He served as [[U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] from 1831 to 1837, and then as [[Solicitor of the United States Treasury]] in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The political register and congressional directory: a statistical record of the Federal Officials...1776&amp;ndash;1878|first=Benjamin Perley|last=Poore | authorlink=Benjamin Perley Poore|year=1878 |publisher=Houghton, Osgood and Company |location=Boston |page=230 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=solicitors}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he joined the [[American Philosophical Society]] and from 1833 to 1835 he was on the board of the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]].

President Martin Van Buren named him 14th [[Attorney General of the United States]] in 1840. He served until 1841, during which time he presented the U.S. government's side of the ''[[United States v. The Amistad|Amistad]]'' case to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].

From 7 June 1852 until 13 June 1859 he was president of the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] and a vice president and trustee of the [[Philadelphia Historical Society]], and from 1856 to 1858 he was also a director of [[Girard College]]. He was also a secretary and director of the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]]. Gilpin died in [[Philadelphia]] in 1860.

&lt;!-- USE POSSESSIVE HITCHENS'S IT IS ONE BRITISH VERSION SEE [[MOS:POSS]]#1. --&gt;
'''Hitchens's razor''' is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Razor (philosophy)|razor]] asserting that the [[Philosophical burden of proof|burden of proof]] regarding the truthfulness of a claim lies with the one who makes the claim, and if this burden is not met, the claim is unfounded, and its opponents need not argue further in order to dismiss it.

==Overview==
The concept is named, echoing [[Occam's razor]], for the journalist and writer [[Christopher Hitchens]], who in a 2003 ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article formulated it thus: "'''What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence'''".&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html|title=Mommie Dearest|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|authorlink=christopher hitchens|work=Slate|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cillian|last=McGrattan|title=The Politics of Trauma and Peace-Building: Lessons from Northern Ireland|location=Abingdon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|page=2|isbn=978-1138775183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictum also appears in ''[[God Is Not Great|God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]]'', a book by Hitchens published in 2007.&lt;ref name=God&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens|title=God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|year=2007|page=150|publisher=Twelve Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1843545743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens's razor is actually an English translation of the Latin proverb ''[[:q:en:Latin proverbs#Q|quod grātīs asseritur, grātīs negātur]]'' ("What is freely asserted is freely dismissed"), which was commonly used in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=SkepticInk&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skepticink.com/backgroundprobability/2015/07/25/the-long-history-of-hitchens-razor|title=The Long History of Hitchens' Razor|first=Damion|last=Reinhardt|work=Skeptic Ink|date=25 July 2015|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Jon R. Stone}}, ''The Routledge Dictionary of Latin Quotations'' (2005), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It takes a stronger stance than the [[Sagan standard]] ("Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"), instead applying to even non-extraordinary claims.

Article 25 of the [[Constitution of the United Arab Emirates|Constitution of the UAE]] provides for the equitable treatment of persons with regard to [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], nationality, [[religious beliefs]] or [[social status]]. However, in reality there are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with full UAE locals being given preferential treatment when it comes to employment, even though they generally show minimal interest in working.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/emiratisation-wont-work-if-people-dont-want-to-learn Emiratisation won't work if people don't want to learn | The National].

[[Labour force of the United Arab Emirates|Labour injustices in Dubai]] have attracted the attention of various human rights groups, which have tried to persuade the government to become a signatory to two of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s eight core conventions, which allows for the formation of labour unions. The Dubai government, however, denied any kind of labour injustices and stated that the watchdog's accusations were misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4861540.stm |title=UAE to allow construction unions |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-03-30 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of March 2006, the government announced steps to allow construction unions.

The [[BBC]] has reported that "local newspapers often carry stories of construction workers allegedly not being paid for months on end.

In December 2005, the Indian [[consulate]] in Dubai submitted a report to the [[Government of India]] detailing labor problems faced by [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian expatriates]] in the emirate. The report highlighted delayed payment of wages, substitution of [[employment contract]]s, premature termination of services and excessive working hours as being some of the challenges faced by Indian workers in the city.

Despite protests by Human Rights Watch and several governments, companies allegedly continue to take the passports of workers and refuse to pay promised salaries. These practices have been labeled as "modern slavery" by some organizations.&lt;ref name="slavesofdubai"&gt;[https://www.vice.com/vice-news/the-slaves-of-dubai]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a European national by the name of [[Prosecution of Marte Dalelv|Marte Dalelv]], was arrested and jailed on trumped up charges.

The labour injustices in Dubai - and wider UAE - have attracted the attention of various foreign governments and Human Rights groups, which have tried to persuade the local government to become a signatory to two of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s 7 core conventions, which allows for the formation of  labour unions. The Dubai government has denied any kind of labour injustices and has stated that the watchdog's (Human Rights Watch) accusations were misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4861540.stm | accessdate = 24 April 2006 | work=BBC News | title=UAE to allow construction unions | date=30 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of March 2006, the government announced steps to allow construction unions.

Prior to the mid 2000s, camel owners made use of [[Child camel jockeys|child jockeys]], most of whom were kids kidnapped from other parts of the world.

There are various examples of local folk ill-treating people, just on the basis of nationality or race. In one instance, a local taxi passenger caused a serious injury to a foreign driver. The passenger told the driver that he was an [[Emiratis|Emirati]] and did not listen to the drivers instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/courts/man-jailed-for-beating-driver-who-asked-him-to-use-seat-belt-1.1567599|title=Man jailed for beating driver who asked him to use seat belt|last=Correspondent|first=Bassam Za’za’, Legal and Court|date=2015-08-16|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem of stateless people (known as [[Bidoon]]) has been around for so many years. Many have languished without proper care, even though many of them are natives of the land. These people have not been able to complete their education, secure jobs and have found it hard to marry. A small number of them have been able to acquire UAE nationality or that of Comoros Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/citizenship-hope-for-uaes-stateless|title=Citizenship hope for UAE's stateless|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/sheikh-khalifa-grants-uae-citizenship-to-500-children-of-emirati-mothers|title=Sheikh Khalifa grants UAE citizenship to 500 children of Emirati mothers|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sharia law==
[[LGBT in the United Arab Emirates|Homosexuality is illegal]]. The [[death penalty]] is one of the punishments for homosexuality although in practice this has never been enforced. Kissing in some public places is illegal and can result in [[deportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/public-kissing-can-lead-to-deportation#ixzz3G9lCTpIL |title=Public kissing can lead to deportation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expats in Dubai have been deported for kissing in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/women-get-jail-and-deportation-for-kissing-on-dubai-public-beach-1.106824 |title=Women get jail and deportation for kissing on Dubai public beach |publisher=gulfnews |date=25 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8602449.stm|title=Jailed Dubai kissing pair lose appeal over conviction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10507147|title=London man tells of 'shock' jailing in Dubai over kiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubai has a modest dress code. The dress code is part of Dubai's criminal law.&lt;ref name="Criminal Law of Dubai"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawyersuae.com/court-cases/criminal-law-of-dubai|title=Criminal Law of Dubai}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleeveless tops and short dresses are not allowed at Dubai's malls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alceis.com/sites/default/files/images/dress%20code%20mall.jpg|title=Dubai Mall dress code}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2012/06/24/uae-online-dress-code-campaign-urges-extra-inches-of-clothing/|title=UAE: Dress Code Campaign Urges Extra Inches of Clothing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothes must be in appropriate lengths.&lt;ref name="Criminal Law of Dubai"/&gt; Expats and tourists are not allowed to consume alcohol outside of licensed venues.

[[Apostasy]] is a crime [[punishable by death]] in the UAE; in practice this has never been applied. UAE incorporates [[hudud]] crimes of Sharia law into its Penal Code - apostasy being one of them.&lt;ref name=shar&gt;Butti Sultan Butti Ali Al-Muhairi (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3381546 The Islamisation of Laws in the UAE: The Case of the Penal Code], Arab Law Quarterly, Vol. 11, No. 4 (1996), pp. 350-371&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 and Article 66 of UAE's Penal Code requires hudud crimes to be punished with the death penalty,&lt;ref name=shar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Muhairi (1997), Conclusion to the Series of Articles on the UAE Penal Law.

== Religious freedom ==
{{Details|Freedom of religion in the United Arab Emirates}}
Islam is the official religion in Dubai.  A policy of religious toleration allows foreigners to practice their faith in a private residence or official place of worship, or they can petition the government for a land grant and permission to build a religious institution to hold religious services, which may be a slow process.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14017.htm|title=United Arab Emirates|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen Christian Churches exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.expatechodubai.com/new-to-dubai/places-of-worship-directory/|title=Places of Worship {{!}} Churches Directory {{!}} Expat Echo Dubai|website=www.expatechodubai.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with facilities for Hindus, Sikhs, and Bahá'ís. Non-Muslim groups are generally allowed to meet and advertise their events, but the law prohibits and punishes proselytizing.&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;

== Freedom of expression ==
{{Details|Emirates Discussion Forum}}
Human rights groups have expressed concerns about freedom of expression in Dubai, which is often limited by enacted laws or Ministerial edicts in the name of protecting traditional Islamic morality or the image and reputation of Dubai and its leaders.

In 2007, the Dubai government shut down two Pakistani television channels, [[Geo News]] and [[ARY Digital Network|ARY One]].  Their entertainment, but not news and political programming, were eventually permitted to broadcast in Dubai.&lt;ref name="anhri.net"&gt;[http://www.anhri.net/en/reports/2007/pr1127.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dubai Ministry of Culture and Media banned the exhibition of a play, "Kholkhal", just hours before it was scheduled to be performed at the 8th annual Gulf Theater Festival.&lt;ref name="anhri.net"/&gt; While journalists can no longer be jailed for doing their job, other legal actions can be taken against them. Several members of the Dubai press remain on a government list as being banned from being published within the Emirate. There is also reportedly a degree of self-censorship that occurs, for fear of governmental sanctions, of certain topics that are critical of government policy, the royal family, or may offend traditional Islamic morality.&lt;ref name="anhri.net"/&gt;

In July 2013, a video was uploaded onto [[YouTube]], which depicted a local driver hitting an expatriate worker, following a road related incident. Using part of his [[Keffiyeh|local head gear]], the local driver whips the expatriate and also pushes him around, before other passers-by intervene. A few days later, Dubai Police announced that both the local driver and the person who filmed the video have been arrested. It was also revealed that the local driver was a senior UAE government official.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/senior-uae-official-arrested-over-driver-attack-509289.html|title=Senior UAE official arrested over driver attack|work=ArabianBusiness.com|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video once again brings into question the way that lower classes of foreign workers are treated. Police in November 2013 also arrested a US citizen and some UAE citizens, in connection with a YouTube parody video which allegedly portrayed Dubai and its youth in a bad light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=data/crime/2013/December/crime_December24.xml&amp;section=crime|title=Three held for parody video on Satwa streets|last=Fisher|first=Amira Agarib And Amanda|website=www.khaleejtimes.com|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was shot in areas of [[Satwa]], [[Dubai]] and featured gangs learning how to fight each other using simple weapons, including shoes, the aghal, etc. Eventually, the US citizen was released; in a later interview with the BBC, the Sheikh of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammad mentioned that his treatment was unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/dubai-ruler-speaks-to-bbc-about-uaes-legal-system-syria-and-egypt|title=Dubai Ruler speaks to BBC about UAE’s legal system, Syria and Egypt|work=The National|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab Organisation of Human Rights has obtained testimonies from many defendants, for its report on "Forced Disappearance and Torture in the UAE", who reported that they had been kidnapped, tortured and abused in detention centres.&lt;ref name="aohr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; The report included 16 different methods of torture including severe beatings, threats with [[electrocution]] and denying access to medical care.&lt;ref name="aohr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;

In 2013, 94 Emirati activists were held in secret detention centres and put on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/06/uae-trial-94-activists|title=The UAE's bizarre, political trial of 94 activists|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=David Hearst|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organizations have spoken out against the secrecy of the trial. An Emirati, whose father is among the defendants, was arrested for tweeting about the trial. In April 2013, he was sentenced to 10 months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man faces 10 months jail for tweets about trial in UAE|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/11/world/meast/uae-twitter-jail/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=11 April 2013|author=Ben Brumfield|author2=Caroline Faraj|author3=Saad Abedine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repressive measures were also used against people in order to justify the UAE government's claim that there is an "international plot" in which UAE citizens and foreigners were working together to destabilize the country.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; Foreign nationals were also subjected to a campaign of deportations.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt; There are many documented cases of Egyptians and other foreign nationals who had spent years working in the UAE and were then given only a few days to leave the country.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{Details|Women in the United Arab Emirates}}
In 2006, less than 20% of Emirati women were part of the national labor force.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.academia.edu/5813970/The_Emirati_Workforce_Tables_figures_and_thoughts The Emirati Workforce] Page 30&lt;/ref&gt; UAE has the second lowest percentage of local women working in the GCC.&lt;ref name="par"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfZR8SNg0bwC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq|title=Kuwait: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix|work=[[International Monetary Fund]] |year=2012|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008-2009, only 21% of Emirati women were part of the labor force.&lt;ref name=par /&gt; UAE has the highest percentage of total female labor participation in the GCC (including [[expatriate]] women).

The UAE's judicial system is derived from the [[civil law system]] and [[Sharia law]]. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], UAE's civil and criminal courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law, in a way which discriminates against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/11012631/Human-Rights-Watch-warns-expat-women-about-the-UAE.html|title=Human Rights Watch warns expat women about the UAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT rights==
{{Details|LGBT rights in the United Arab Emirates}}
In keeping with traditional Islamic morality, both Federal and Emirate law prohibit [[homosexuality]] and [[cross-dressing]] with punishment ranging from long prison sentences, deportation for foreigners, and the death penalty.  No nightclub exists for LGBT explicitly, but spots exist in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, with the details spreading only by word-of-mouth. No political organization is allowed to advocate for LGBT rights.

==Prostitution==
Prostitution, although illegal, exists in Dubai. Research conducted by the American Center for International Policy Studies (AMCIPS) found that Russian and Ethiopian women are the most common prostitutes, as well as women from other African countries, while Indian prostitutes are part of a well-organised trans-Oceanic prostitution network.&lt;ref name="pbsdsex"/&gt; A 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary entitled ''Dubai: Night Secrets'' reported that prostitution in clubs is tolerated by authorities and many foreign women work there by choice.&lt;ref name="pbsdsex"&gt;Mimi Chakarova.

==Zero tolerance drug policy==
Drugs found in urine or blood testing count as "possession" under UAE law. Raymond Bingham, BBC's DJ [[Grooverider]], was sentenced to four years in prison after a pair of jeans in his luggage was found to contain just over 2&amp;nbsp;grams of marijuana.&lt;ref name=grooverider&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7253514.stm | work=BBC News | title=Radio 1 DJ jailed on drug charge | date=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dubai authorities have been known to stop tourists on layovers at the airport and are now using extremely sensitive electronic detection equipment, including urine and blood screening, to search for traces of illegal substances. Keith Brown, a British national, was arrested on September 17, 2007 after authorities claim to have discovered a speck of cannabis on the bottom of one of his shoes. According to an article in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'',&lt;ref name=keithbrown&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=512815&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ito=1490 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Briton jailed for four years in Dubai after customs find cannabis weighing less than a grain of sugar under his shoe | date=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the alleged illegal substance was smaller than a grain of sugar - weighing approximately .003&amp;nbsp;grams. He has also been sentenced to four years in prison. Other tourists and residents have been sentenced to [[Capital punishment|execution]] for selling cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/briton-faces-execution-after-uae-drugs-bust-.html Briton faces execution after UAE drugs bust], Yahoo News&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no reports of anyone being executed in the UAE for solely drug offences, unlike neighboring Saudi Arabia. Another UK citizen, Tracy Wilkinson, was arrested and accused of being a "drugs baroness" in 2005 after authorities found [[codeine]] in her blood.&lt;ref name=tracywilkinson&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/southern_counties/4200952.stm | work=BBC News | first=Tanya | last=Gupta | title=Bad back led to jail torment | date=1 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson has a bad back and received an injection of codeine at a Dubai hospital. She ended up spending two months in a cell where she contracted [[dysentery]], [[Head louse|head lice]] and an infestation of [[flea]]s before she was eventually released on bail. German television producer Cat Le-Huy was arrested in January 2008 for possessing a bottle of the over-the-counter hormone sleep aid [[Melatonin]].&lt;ref name=catlehuy&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/tv-executive-faces-jail-in-dubai-for-barely-visible-cannabis-speck-785595.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Amol | last=Rajan | title=TV executive faces jail in Dubai for barely visible cannabis speck | date=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities claimed that some dirt in Mr. Le-Huy's luggage was [[hashish]]. A Vancouver resident named Bert Tatham was arrested at Dubai International Airport returning home from [[Afghanistan]] (where he was working with farmers to try to convince them not to grow poppies). The anti-narcotics officer was found to have two dead poppy bulbs and a tiny amount of hashish melted into the seams of one of his trouser pockets.&lt;ref name=bertatham&gt;[http://money.aol.ca/article/uae-canadian-pardoned-2nd-writethru-bgt/101850/ AOL Canada: Canadian jailed in drug case in Dubai is pardoned by ruler of the emirate]&lt;/ref&gt; After spending more than 10 months in prison, he was eventually pardoned by U.A.E. President H.H. [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]].

==The 2007 censorship of two Pakistani satellite channels==
On 16 November 2007 [[Dubai Media City|Tecom]] stopped [[broadcast]] of two major [[Pakistan]]i [[satellite]] news channels, uplinked from [[Dubai Media City]], which was initially marketed by Tecom under the tagline "Freedom to Create." The [[Dubai]] [[government]] had ordered Tecom to shut down the popular independent Pakistani news channels [[Geo News]] and [[ARY One World]] on the demand of Pakistan's military regime led by General [[Pervez Musharraf]]. This was implemented by [[Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company|du]] Samacom disabling their [[Serial digital interface|SDI]] &amp; [[Asynchronous serial interface|ASI]] streams. Later, policy makers in Dubai permitted these channels to air their entertainment programs, but news, current affairs and political analysis were forbidden. Although subsequently the conditions were removed, marked differences have since been observed in their coverage. This incident has had a serious impact on all organizations in the media city with Geo TV and ARY OneWorld considering relocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/pak_emergency/more_stories/10169767.html Gulf News - Pakistani TV channels may move out of Dubai Media City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422054301/http://archive.gulfnews.com/indepth/pak_emergency/more_stories/10169767.html |date=2008-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/11/25/10170154.html Gulf News - Geo TV also plans to move out of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401105222/http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/11/25/10170154.html |date=2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070033255&amp;ch=11/18/2007%208:27:00%20PM NDTV.com - Geo TV hints at options outside of Dubai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220150253/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20070033255&amp;ch=11%2F18%2F2007%208%3A27%3A00%20PM |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2017, the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|Sergeant-at-Arms]] briefed top staffers for members of Congress that the [[U.S. Capitol Police]] were conducting an active criminal investigation into the actions of five House IT employees — four men and a woman — who were being investigated allegations of procurement scam and violating the House IT network rules. Subsequently, it was also revealed to the general public that there was an ongoing investigation. These five employees were barred from the computer networks at the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name="PolFeb2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Caygle |first=Heather |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586 |title=House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft |work=[[Politico]] |date=February 2, 2017 |accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Awan, his wife, Hina Alvi, his two brothers and his friend were named as the five IT staffers being investigated. Given the suspected violations, most of the congress members terminated Awan's services; Democratic Congresswoman [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] from Florida, however, continued to employ Awan in an advisory role.&lt;ref name="still employed"&gt;{{cite web |last=Caygle |first=Heather |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staff-criminal-investigation-234714 |title=House staffers under criminal investigation still employed |work=[[Politico]] |date=February 6, 2017 |accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name="kept paying"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Daugherty |first1=Alex |last2=Sherman |first2=Amy |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article163818253.html |title=Wasserman Schultz kept paying tech expert suspected of stealing House computers |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]] |work=[[Miami Herald]] |date=July 26, 2017 |accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2017, the [[FBI]] and Capitol Police stopped Awan's wife, Hina Alvi, at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]]. They allowed her and her three children to get on the flight to [[Lahore]].&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo staffer charged"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hsu |first=Spencer S. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/congressional-it-staffer-charged-with-home-equity-loan-fraud/2017/07/26/f5f402e8-71a7-11e7-9eac-d56bd5568db8_story.html |title=Congressional IT staffer charged with home equity loan fraud |publisher=[[Nash Holdings]] |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=July 26, 2017 |accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A government investigation led by [[U.S. Attorney]] [[Jessie K. Liu]] included forensic analysis of computer equipment and data, as well as interviews with about 40 witnesses. The investigation addressed various right-wing conspiracy theories about Awan, concluding that it had "found no evidence that [Awan] illegally removed House data from the House network or from House Members' offices, stole the House Democratic Caucus Server, stole or destroyed House information technology equipment, or improperly accessed or transferred government information, including classified or sensitive information."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The investigation found no evidence of ties between Awan and a foreign intelligence agency targeting Congress, or between Awan and an alleged criminal ring that stole equipment from Democratic lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/03/imran-awan-pleads-guilty-692394 |title=Ex-Dem IT staffer slammed by Trump pleads guilty to bank fraud |work=POLITICO |date=July 3, 2018 |access-date=July 3, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigators stated, "the government has uncovered no evidence that [Imran Awan] violated federal law with respect to the House computer system".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Leary |first=Alex |url=http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/07/03/federal-prosecutors-debunk-conspiracy-theory-involving-ex-wasserman-schultz-aide/ |title=Federal prosecutors debunk conspiracy theory involving ex-Wasserman Schultz aide |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=July 3, 2018 |access-date=July 3, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2017, the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police arrested Awan at Dulles Airport.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Eli |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/politics/imran-awan-house-democrats/index.html |title=Democratic staffer arrested on bank fraud charge |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] |work=[[CNN]] |date=July 27, 2017 |accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously purchased a ticket to Lahore, Pakistan, with a return flight in January 2018.&lt;ref name="Fox News feds"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pergram |first1=Chad |last2=Gibson |first2=Jake |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/25/feds-arrest-it-staffer-for-wasserman-schultz-trying-to-leave-country.html |title=Feds arrest IT staffer for Wasserman Schultz trying to leave country |date=July 25, 2017 |publisher=[[Fox News]] |accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Caygle |first1=Heather |last2=Bresnahan |first2=John |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/25/debbie-wasserman-schultz-aide-arrest-240960 |title=Wasserman Schultz aide arrested trying to leave the country |work=Politico |date=July 25, 2017 |accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awan was arraigned the following day and pleaded not guilty to one count of bank fraud.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; He was ordered to surrender his passports,&lt;ref name="CBS Reid"/&gt; abide by a curfew, and wear a [[Global positioning system|GPS]] device.

On August 17, 2017, a [[federal grand jury]], convened in [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia]], [[indictment|indicted]] Awan and his wife on four counts, including conspiracy, making false statements, bank fraud, and unlawful monetary transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibson |first=Jake |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/17/wasserman-schultz-ex-it-aide-indicted-on-4-counts.html |title=Wasserman Schultz' ex-IT aide indicted on 4 counts |date=August 17, 2017 |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bresnahan |first=John |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/17/new-charges-house-it-aide-241756 |title=Charges revised against ex-Wasserman Schultz aide |work=Politico |date=August 17, 2017 |accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with conspiring to obtain home equity loans for $165,000 and $120,000 from the Wright Patman Congressional Federal Credit Union in [[Oakton, Virginia]] and transferring the money to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="indictment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web |last=Man |first=Anthony |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/nationworld/fl-reg-imran-awan-indicted-20170817-story.html |title=Federal grand jury indicts former Wasserman Schultz aide Imran Awan |work=Sun Sentinel |date=August 17, 2017 |accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017 the couple had wired $283,000 from Alvi's credit union checking account to two individuals in [[Faisalabad]].&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"/&gt; The indictment made no mention of an investigation related to procurement theft.&lt;ref name="indictment" /&gt;

On September 1, 2017, Awan pleaded not guilty to all of these charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/01/ex-it-aide-for-wasserman-schultz-pleads-not-guilty.html |title=Ex-IT aide for Wasserman Schultz pleads not guilty |date=September 1, 2017 |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation concluded in early July 2018 with Awan pleading guilty to making a false statement on a bank loan application.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Awan had filed a loan application in the name of his wife, Hina Alvi, with a property as equity, but falsely claimed that the property in question was Alvi's primary residence when it was in fact being rented out by Alvi.&lt;ref name="Zraick NYTimes" /&gt; Awan's attorney said that Awan made the false statement in order to obtain the loan quickly so that he could quickly transfer money to relatives in Pakistan to help his father, who was gravely ill and living in Virginia.&lt;ref name="Zraick NYTimes" /&gt; On August 21, 2018, the U.S. District Judge [[Tanya S.

=== Subject of conservative conspiracy theories ===
Throughout the government investigation, some conservative media outlets, most notably investigative reporter Luke Rosiak of the website ''[[The Daily Caller]]'', spread allegations and conspiracy theories about Awan. These outlets alleged that Awan had had unauthorized access to classified government data, and that he had provided to the Pakistani government and/or leaked some of that information.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://gizmodo.com/feds-debunk-it-staffer-conspiracy-theory-pushed-by-the-1827322016 |title=Feds Debunk IT Staffer Conspiracy Theory Pushed by The Daily Caller and Trump |last=Cameron |first=Dell |work=Gizmodo |date=July 3, 2018 |access-date=July 3, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included, but was not limited to, the [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks|hacking of the Democratic National Committee server]] in 2015 and 2016, which the U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia was responsible for.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rosiak stated in April 2018 that the affair was "straight out of James Bond."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The coverage often included reports on Awan's personal finances, his business dealings, and family disputes.&lt;ref name="WaPo_Boburg"/&gt;

President [[Donald Trump]] called for Awan to be investigated for espionage in several posts on [[Twitter]], including one in April 2018 when he referred to Awan as the "Pakistani mystery man", and another in June 2018 when he wrote, "Our Justice Department must not let Awan &amp; Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Days after Awan was cleared of espionage accusations, Trump mentioned the conspiracy theory during a press conference with Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki, asking "what happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC?" Trump had been asked if he believed Putin or American intelligence regarding 2016 election interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Timm |first=Jane C. |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-promoted-conspiracy-theories-here-s-truth-n891756 |title=Fact check: Trump promoted conspiracy theories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">The '''instantiation principle''' or '''principle of instantiation''' or '''principle of exemplification''' is the [[concept]] in [[metaphysics]] and [[logic]] (first put forward by [[David Malet Armstrong]]) that there can be no uninstantiated or unexemplified [[property (philosophy)|properties]] (or [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]). In other words, it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object.

Consider a chair. Presumably chairs did not exist 150,000 years ago. Thus, according to the principle of instantiation, the property of being a chair did not exist 150,000 years ago either. Similarly, if all red objects were to suddenly go out of existence, then the property of being red would likewise go out of existence.

To make the principle more plausible in the light of these examples, the existence of properties or universals is not tied to their actual existence now, but to their existence in space-time considered as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The property of being red would exist even if all red things were to be destroyed, because it has been instantiated. This broadens the range of properties which exist if the principle is true. 

Those who endorse the principle of instantiation are known as ''in re'' (in thing or in reality) realists or '[[immanent realist]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Prof '''James Balfour''' [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (1705–1795) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] advocate and [[philosopher]].

==Life==
[[File:Pilrig House, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|300px|Pilrig House]]
[[File:The grave of James Balfour, South Leith Churchyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|300px|The grave of James Balfour, South Leith Churchyard, Edinburgh]]
He was born on 20 August 1705&lt;ref name="wikitree"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Balfour-166|title=Prof james Balfour (1705-1795) &amp;#124; WikiTree FREE Family Tree|website=wikitree.com|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Pilrig]] House, midway between [[Leith]] and [[Edinburgh]]. He was one of a staggering 16 children&lt;ref name="wikitree2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Balfour-175|title=Robert Balfour (b. 1706) &amp;#124; WikiTree FREE Family Tree|website=wikitree.com|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of James Balfour (1681–1737) and his wife, Louisa Hamilton. His father had acquired the estate of Pilrig from the Gilbert family, who lost a fortune in the [[Darien Expedition]]. His father built the current Pilrig House around 1705.

After studying Law at [[Edinburgh University]] and at the [[University of Leyden]], he was called to the Scottish bar as an advocate.

He held the offices of treasurer to the faculty of Advocates and sheriff-substitute of the county of Edinburgh. In 1754 he was appointed to the chair of Professor of Moral Philosophy in the [[University of Edinburgh]], and in 1764 transferred to that of Professor of Public Law.&lt;ref name="ed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourhistory.is.ed.ac.uk/index.php/James_Balfour_(1705-1795)|title=James Balfour (1705-1795)|website=Our History|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775 he is still listed as living in Pilrig House, having inherited the property on the death of his father.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamsonsdirec17751776will#page/106/mode/2up|website=archive.org|title=Williamson's directory for the city of Edinburgh, Canongate, Leith, and suburbs, from June 1775, to June 1776 ...|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Secretary to the Edinburgh Company of Golfers, and belonged to both the Edinburgh and Leith Golf Courses. In this role he would have been involved in the establishment of the original rules of golf in 1777.&lt;ref name="nationalgalleries"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/23488/james-balfour-1705-1795-secretary-edinburgh-company-golfers-published-1796|title=James Balfour, 1705 - 1795. Secretary, Edinburgh Company of Golfers &amp;#124; National Galleries of Scotland|website=nationalgalleries.org|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 6 March 1795. He is buried in the graveyard of [[South Leith Parish Church]].

==Works==
He was the author of three philosophical books:&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Balfour, James (1705–1795)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A Delineation of the Nature and Obligation of Morality, with Reflexions upon Mr. Hume's book entitled'' An Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals. This book was published anonymously, the first edition in 1753, the second in 1763.
* ''Philosophical Essays'', published anonymously in 1768.
* ''Philosophical Dissertations'', published in 1782 under the author's name.

[[James McCosh]], in his work on the ''Scottish Philosophy'', says of him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He sets out (in his "Delineation") with the principle that private happiness must be the chief end and object of every man's pursuit; shows how the good of others affords the greatest happiness; and then, to sanction natural conscience, he calls in the authority of [[God]], who must approve of what promotes the greatest happiness. This theory does not give morality 'a sufficiently deep foundation in the constitution of man on the character of God, and could not have stood against the assaults of [[David Hume|Hume]]. ... In his "Philosophical Essays" he wrote against Hume and Lord Kaimes, and in defence of active power and liberty. Like all active opponents of the new [[scepticism]] he felt it necessary to oppose the favourite theory of [[John Locke|Locke]], that all our ideas are derived from sensation and reflexion.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Family==
In 1737 he married Cecilia Helen Elphinstone (1705–1780), daughter of Sir [[Elphinstone baronets|John Elphinstone]].&lt;ref name="wikitree3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Elphinstone-22|title=Cecilia Helen Elphinstone (1705-1780) &amp;#124; WikiTree FREE Family Tree|website=wikitree.com|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had three sons, James, John, and Lewis, and one daughter, Mary Cecelia. Mary married William Gibson and was mother to James Gibson-Craig who was created a baronet in 1831.

His brother Robert Balfour (born 1706) was a local entrepreneur, running a soapworks in [[Leith]] and operating a stagecoach from [[Edinburgh]] to Leith.

Balfour's mother was a Miss Hamilton, of Airdrie, great-grandaunt of the late [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet]], professor of logic and metaphysics in the University of Edinburgh 1836–1856. His eldest sister married Gavin Hamilton, bookseller and publisher in Edinburgh (also, it is believed, a member of the Airdrie family), whose eldest son was [[Robert Hamilton (economist)|Robert Hamilton]], professor of mathematics in Marischal College and University, Aberdeen, author of a treatise on the national debt.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; The brothers [[George William Balfour]] and [[James Balfour (engineer)|James Balfour]] were great-grandsons, the former a heart specialist in Scotland, and the latter a marine engineer in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Balfour, George William|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Aspden | first1=R J | url=http://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/bio-detail.cfm?id=2 | title=Balfour, James Melville | publisher=[[Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand]] | accessdate=6 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was grandfather to Rev [[Lewis Balfour]] and the great great grandfather of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. It is noteworthy that Stevenson's christened name was Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson, in deference to his ancestral family.

His grandson Elphinstone Balfour was a bookseller on the [[Royal Mile]].&lt;ref name="archive2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/directoryforedin17941795aitc#page/34/mode/2up|website=archive.org|title=A directory for Edinburgh Leith Mussleburgh and Dalkeith containing the names and places of abode of public &amp; private gentlemen, advocates, Writers to the Signet, merchants, manufacturers and principal trader's &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;.|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reaction==
Mark Peacock wrote that in ''The Market: Ethics, Knowledge and Politics'' "O'Neill defends an Aristotelian perfectionism which allows for a plurality of goods pursued for their own sake....The argument is sound, but does not answer the liberal objection to Aristotle that individuals must be allowed to pursue ''what they believe to be'' the good."&lt;ref name="etmp-peacock00" /&gt;

'''Julian Leopold  Ochorowicz''' ({{IPAc-pl|'j|u|l|j|a|n|-|l|e|'|o|p|o|l|d|-|o|ch|o|'|r|o|w|i|cz}}; outside Poland also known as '''Julien Ochorowitz'''; [[Radzymin]], 23 February 1850 – 1 May 1917, [[Warsaw]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]], [[inventor]] (precursor of [[radio]] and [[television]]&lt;ref&gt;"Ochorowicz, Julian Leopold," ''[[Polski słownik biograficzny]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[poet]], [[publicist]], and leading exponent of [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]].

==Life==
Julian Ochorowicz was the son of Julian and Jadwiga, ''[[née]]'' Sumińska.

Ochorowicz studied [[natural sciences]] at [[Warsaw University]], graduating in 1871.  He subsequently studied at [[Leipzig University]] under [[Wilhelm Wundt]]; in 1874 he received his [[doctorate]] there with a thesis ''On Conditions of Consciousness''.

Returning to Warsaw, in 1874-75 he was [[editor-in-chief]] of the popular Polish-language periodical, ''[[Niwa (magazine)|Niwa]]'' (The Field).  From 1881 he was [[assistant professor]] (''docent'') of [[psychology]] and [[natural philosophy]] at [[Lwów University]].

In 1882 he was sent to [[Paris]], [[France]], where he spent several years. Later, from 1907, he would be co-director of the Institut General Psychologique.

Returning to Warsaw, from 1900 Ochorowicz was president of Kasa Literacka (the Literary Fund). He published his [[pedagogical]] papers in ''Encyklopedia Wychowawcza'' (the Encyclopedia of Education).

Ochorowicz was a pioneer of [[empirical research]] in [[psychology]] and conducted studies into [[occultism]], [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], [[hypnosis]] and [[telepathy]]. His most popular works included ''Wstęp i pogląd ogólny na filozofię pozytywną'' (An Introduction to and Overview of Positive Philosophy, 1872) and ''Jak należy badać duszę?'' (How Should One Study the Soul?, 1869).

Ochorowicz the [[poet]] published in ''Przegląd Tygodniowy'' (the Weekly Review) under the [[pen-name]] Julian Mohort. He wrote the poem, "''Naprzód''" ("Forward," 1873), regarded as the Polish Positivists' [[manifesto]].
[[File:Prus 002.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Bolesław Prus]]]]
Ochorowicz, a trained philosopher with a doctorate from the [[University of Leipzig]], became the leader of the [[Positivism in Poland|Positivist movement in Poland]]. In 1872 he wrote: "We shall call a Positivist, anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877 he elaborated the theory for a monochromatic [[television]], to be constructed as a screen comprising bulbs that would convert transmitted images into groups of light points.

In 1885, on several occasions, he demonstrated his own improved [[telephone]]. In [[Paris]], he connected the building of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraph with the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]], 4 kilometers away. At the [[Antwerp]] [[World's Fair]], he set up a connection with [[Brussels]], 45&amp;nbsp;km distant. He linked [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]], with [[Bologoye, Tver Oblast|Bologoye]], 320&amp;nbsp;km away.

He experimented with microphones and with apparatus for sending sound and light over distances, and so is regarded as a precursor of radio and television.

Ochorowicz conducted experiments at a psychological laboratory that he established at [[Wisła]].

[[File:Julian Ochorowicz Wiśle 00634.jpg|thumb|150px|Monument to Ochorowicz at [[Wisła]], which he built into a health resort and tourist destination]]
Julian Ochorowicz was a former [[Lublin]] secondary-school and [[Warsaw University]] schoolmate of [[Bolesław Prus]], who portrayed him in his 1889 novel, ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', as the scientist "Julian Ochocki."  Ochorowicz, after returning to Warsaw from Paris, in 1893 delivered several public lectures on [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[knowledge]].  These evidently helped inspire Prus to write (1894–95) his sole [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]''. Ochorowicz provided Prus books on [[Egyptology]] that he had brought back from [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Wantuła, "''Prus i Ochorowicz w Wiśle''" ("Prus and Ochorowicz in [[Wisła]]"), in Stanisław Fita, ed., ''Wspomnienia o Bolesławie Prusie'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1893, Ochorowicz introduced Prus to the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Spiritualist]], [[Eusapia Palladino]], whom he had brought to [[Warsaw]] from her [[Mediumship|medium]]istic tour in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Krystyna Tokarzówna and Stanisław Fita, ''[[Bolesław Prus]]'', pp. 440, 443, 445-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Prus attended a number of [[séance]]s conducted by Palladino and incorporated several prominent [[spiritualist]]-inspired scenes into his 1895 novel ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'':  Primer on Power", pp. 332-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ochorowicz hosted Palladino in Warsaw from November 1893 to January 1894. Regarding the phenomena demonstrated at Palladino's [[séance]]s, he concluded against the [[spirit]] hypothesis and for a [[hypothesis]] that these phenomena were caused by a "fluidic action" and were performed at the expense of the [[Mediumship|medium]]'s own powers and those of the other participants in the [[séance]]s. Ochorowicz, with [[Frederic William Henry Myers]], [[Charles Richet]] and [[Oliver Lodge]], investigated [[Eusapia Palladino|Palladino]] in the summer of 1894 at Richet's house on the [[Île du Grand Ribaud]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Myers and Richet claimed that furniture moved during the séances and that some of the phenomena were the result of a supernatural agency.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"&gt;Walter Mann. (1919). [https://archive.org/stream/folliesfraudsofs00manniala#page/114/mode/2up ''The Follies and Frauds of Spiritualism'']. Rationalist Association. London: Watts &amp; Co. pp. 115-130&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]] claimed there was inadequate control during the séances and that the precautions described did not rule out trickery. Hodgson wrote that all the phenomena "described could be accounted for on the assumption that Eusapia could get a hand or foot free."  Lodge, Myers and Richet disagreed, but Hodgson was later proven correct in the Cambridge sittings as Palladino was observed to have used tricks exactly the way he had described them.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt;

After Ochorowicz's wife left him, he decided to make some changes in his life:  he bought a piece of land at [[Wisła]] in Poland's mountains, built himself a villa as well as four additional houses for tourists, and proceeded to live on the rentals.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Monika Piątkowska|Monika Piątkowska]], ''Prus:  Śledztwo biograficzne'' (Prus:  A Biographical Investigation), [[Kraków]], [[Wydawnictwo Znak]], 2017, {{ISBN|978-83-240-4543-3}}, pp. 384–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 20 June 1900, Prus and his household arrived to visit.  In July Prus traveled to nearby [[Kraków]], where until the beginning of September he underwent treatments for his multifarious medical complaints by an ophthalmologist, a neurologist, and a physician who treated his thyroid.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pl:Monika Piątkowska|Monika Piątkowska]], ''Prus:  Śledztwo biograficzne'' (Prus:  A Biographical Investigation), [[Kraków]], [[Wydawnictwo Znak]], 2017, {{ISBN|978-83-240-4543-3}}, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1908–9, at Wisła, Ochorowicz studied the [[Mediumship|medium]]ship of [[Stanisława Tomczyk]].  

In the latter half of the 19th century, [[Spiritualism]] was not an unusual subject of study for noted [[psychologist]]s.  A prominent [[United States|American]] psychologist who looked favorably on Spiritualism was [[William James]].

'''Kannon Do Zen Meditation Center''' provides [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] practice in the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and the South Bay.&lt;ref name=KannonDo3&gt;{{cite web|last=SotoZen-Net|title=Organization and temples outside Japan|url=http://global.sotozen-net.or.jp/eng/temples/outside_jp/America/18.html|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KannonDo2&gt;{{cite web|title=The Soto Zen Buddhist Association|url=http://www.szba.org/centers/kannon-do/|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named after [[Kannon]], the [[Buddhist]] personification of compassion, the center provides a supportive environment in which Americans can experience traditional Zen teaching.

== History ==

Zen Master [[Shunryu Suzuki]] arrived in San Francisco from Japan in 1959 to be resident priest of Sokoji, the Japanese-American Soto Zen Mission in [[San Francisco]]. In 1961, he and his new American Zen students founded the San Francisco Zen Center. (The early history of Zen Center and Suzuki's life in the U.S. are well documented in his 1999 biography ''Crooked Cucumber'' by David Chadwick.&lt;ref name=CrookedCucumber&gt;{{cite book|last=David|first=Chadwick|authorlink=David Chadwick (writer)|title=Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki|year=2000|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=978-0-7679-0105-5|pages=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In November, 1964, a "sitting group" was set up in [[Palo Alto]]. The first morning [[zazen]] and lecture was held at 1005 Bryant Street in Palo Alto. An evening group was later established in [[Redwood City]]. In 1965, the morning group moved to [[Marian Derby]]'s home in Los Altos, joined by the evening group a year later. [[Meditation]] was followed by a brief lecture and an informal breakfast, with family-like discussions with Suzuki at the breakfast table. In a tradition that continues at Kannon Do, tea and cookies were served following the weekly lecture.

In 1965, Derby tape-recorded and transcribed Suzuki's morning lectures. From 1968, Trudy Dixon edited the lectures into a book, ''Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind'', published in 1971.&lt;ref name=ZenMindBeginnersMind&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Shunryu|title=Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind|year=June 28, 2011|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-59030-849-3|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the garage was converted to a meditation hall in the style of [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] temples in [[Japan]], to Suzuki's design. Construction, by [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] members, began in June, 1966. ''Haiku Zendo'', named for its seventeen cushions that matched the number of syllables in a [[haiku]] poem, was officially opened on August 4, 1966.&lt;ref name=HaikuZendo&gt;{{cite web|last=Hiestand|first=Barbara|title=Chronicles of Haiku Zendo Including Memories of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi|url=http://www.cuke.com/Cucumber%20Project/suzuki%20stories/haiku1.html|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Kobun Chino-sensei became Haiku Zendo's resident teacher.&lt;ref name=HaikuZendo2&gt;{{cite web|last=Otogawa Roshi|first=Kobun Chino|title=Kobun Chino Otogawa Roshi|url=http://www.jakkoan.net/Kobun/|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HaikunZendo3&gt;{{cite web|title=Kobun Chino Roshi|url=http://www.jikoji.org/kobun.html|accessdate=29 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427200950/http://www.jikoji.org/kobun.html|archivedate=27 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the Sangha bought a small former Pentecostal church on College Avenue in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] for $40,000.  The new zendo was named ''Kannon Do'', "place of compassion". In 1983, Kobun appointed Les Kaye the spiritual leader of Kannon Do.&lt;ref name=HaikunZendoToKannonDo2&gt;{{cite web|title=Gratefully Remembering Kobun Sama|url=http://www.kobun-sama.org/english/biografie.htm|accessdate=29 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011173507/http://www.kobun-sama.org/english/biografie.htm|archivedate=11 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of preparation, the present Kannon Do was dedicated on March 3, 2007, on a one-half acre property acquired for $800,000, at 1972 Rock Street in Mountain View. It serves the surrounding [[Santa Clara Valley]] communities.&lt;ref name=HaikuZendoToKannonDo&gt;{{cite web|title=Being at the old Haiku Zendo| url=http://olympiazencentereidoblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/being-at-old-haiku-zendo.html| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Lagerordnung''''' was the "Disciplinary and Penal Code", first written for [[Dachau concentration camp]], which became the uniform code at all [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in the [[Third Reich]] on January 1, 1934. Also known as the ''Strafkatalog'' (Punishment Catalogue), it detailed the regulations for prisoners. SS guards were instructed to report violations of the code to the commandant's office. The [[Concentration Camps Inspectorate]] was responsible for execution of the resulting punishment, which was carried out without verification of the allegations or any possibility of vindication (see "[[Concentration Camps Inspectorate#Procedures for punishing violations|Procedures for punishing violations]]").

==Evolution of a new penal system==
The early, temporary concentration camps, such as [[Kemna concentration camp]], did not have unified, coordinated regulations, but rather drew their ''Lagerordnung'' from regulations then in use at various police departments and prisons run by the justice system.&lt;ref group=*&gt;Concentration camps [[Neustadt an der Haardt]], [[Moringen]], Kislau, Kuhberg, [[Hainichen concentration camp|Hainichen]], [[Hammerstein]], [[Fuhlsbüttel]] had such regulations. The draft of regulations for Moorland concentration camp and the edict from the ''Landeskriminalamts'' ("State Criminal Office") in [[Dresden]] for [[Sachsenburg (concentration camp)|Sachsenburg concentration camp]] are also examples. Source: Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'', p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were nonetheless minor. Some banned smoking, others allowed prisoners to receive food parcels or visits from family members. The regulations were still based on existing law and the camps were patterned after ordinary detention centers. The early camps had penalties such as denial of privileges, or for more severe cases, solitary confinement, a hard bed, denial of food or solitary confinement in a darkened cell, but there is no [[corporal punishment]].&lt;ref group=*&gt;The only exception to this was the draft, not yet instituted, from Lutze, [[Oberpräsident]] of [[Hannover]]. This draft contained clauses where beating with a stick was allowed, "up to 10 blows on the buttocks". This document is dated January 1934, just after Eicke's ''Lagerordnung''. Source: Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'', pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; The early camps were primarily controlled by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] or the ''[[Gestapo]]''.

Dachau, in contrast, was under the control of the SS. Sometime in May 1933, SS camp commandant [[Hilmar Wäckerle]] wrote the first ''Lagerordnung'' for a concentration camp. It gave full jurisdiction to the office of camp commandant, making him the sole legal authority. To impose capital punishment at Dachau, with the ''Lagerordnung'' it would be sufficient to have a judgment from two SS men — appointed by the commandant. A defense of the accused would no longer be recorded. The executive, judicial and legislative were unified; the separation of powers and system of opposing checks and balances abolished. Through the ever-present threat of the [[death penalty]], Dachau would create a constant state of emergency for the inmate.

In none of the other, earlier concentration camps were there as many political murders as in Dachau's first few months. The first legalized murders took place at Dachau.&lt;ref&gt;Stanislav Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'', [[International concentration camp committees|Comité International de Dachau]] Luxemburg (2002) pp.&amp;nbsp;35-43 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first murders, committed under Wäckerle, led to an investigation when Sophie Handschuh, the mother of one of the dead prisoners, filed a formal complaint to find out what had really happened to her son. The resulting prosecution forced Himmler to replace Wäckerle.&lt;ref name="Klee"&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich'', Frankfurt am Main (2007) p. 648 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter of June 2, 1933, Munich District Court Prosecutor II to the State Ministry of Justice: Subject: "Death of [[protective custody]] prisoners at Dachau concentration camp." {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his stead, Himmler installed [[Theodor Eicke]], a fanatical ''[[SS-Oberführer]]'' whose extreme violence had, only shortly before, in March 1933, caused him to be committed for evaluation at a psychiatric clinic at the [[University of Würzburg]]. Himmler arranged for Eicke to be released, asking his doctor, [[Werner Heyde]] to talk to Eicke and get him to promise to control himself.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Himmler to Heyde, June 2, 1933, cited by Johannes Tuchel, "Konzentrationslager.

Harald Boldt Verlag, Boppard am Rhein (1991) {{ISBN|3-7646-1902-3}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanded to all camps==
Six months later, on October 1, 1933, Commandant Eicke wrote a second edition of the ''Lagerordnung'', adding the [[Postenpflicht]] and introducing [[corporal punishment]] ([[Flagellation|flogging]]). The ''Lagerordnung'' established a "state within a state". The second edition established an orderly system, whereby "[[Reichstag Fire Decree|legally]]" arrested political opponents could be subjected to torture and execution by the SS.

[[File:KZ Dachau-Reichspogromnacht.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Postcard from a prisoner at Dachau, with detailed rules for correspondence]]

In the early years of the Nazi government, the SS barely had any concentration camps. The first SS camp was Dachau, near [[Munich]], which [[Adolf Hitler]] called "the capital of the [Nazi] movement". The improvised operations of the earlier, smaller concentration camps were under the control of the SA, Gestapo or state authorities. The SS didn't become a separate organization until after the [[Night of the Long Knives|Röhm Putsch]], when the SA was disempowered in summer 1934. Once competition from the SA was removed, the SS, under the direction of ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], was able to begin the systematic establishment of newly built, large concentration camps.

All SS concentration camps were to follow the esteemed Dachau model and become a "state within a state", shielded centers of terror with their own laws and judges, without legal defense, and with their own executable violence.

After January 1, 1934, all subsequent versions of the ''Lagerordnung'' were effective for all SS-run concentration camps.

==The Disciplinary and Penal Code==
[Translator's note: The sometimes odd phrasing, inconsistencies of capitalization, and style itself are from the source, not the translator.]&lt;ref group=*&gt;The [[:de:Lagerordnung|original article]] on the German Wikipedia also has a [[Comment (computer programming)|comment]] (in the editable view) about the spelling mistakes, style and phrasing.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dachau Concentration Camp'''&lt;br&gt;
Office of the Commandant, October 1, 1933

'''Disciplinary and Penal Code for the Detention Camp'''

'''Introduction'''

The following penalties are issued within the scope of existing camp regulations, to maintain order and discipline on the grounds of Dachau concentration camp, 
These regulations apply to all prisoners of the DCC from the time of admission on, till the hour of discharge.&lt;br&gt;
The consummate authority of punishment is in the hands of the camp commandant, who is personally responsible to the political police commander for the implementation of the rules as issued.&lt;br&gt;
Tolerance means weakness. Realizing this, there will be a ruthless grip there, where, in the interests of the fatherland, it appears necessary. The decent, incited [sic] ''Volksgenosse''&lt;ref group=*&gt;''Volksgenosse'' is a Nazi word meaning "fellow German" or "fellow comrade".&lt;/ref&gt; will not come into contact with these penalties. But to the politicizing rabble-rouser and intellectual agitator&amp;nbsp;— regardless of which direction&amp;nbsp;— let it be said, beware, that you're not nabbed, otherwise you'll be grabbed by the neck and after your own recipe, [sic] made to hold your peace.

[[File:Scoldengravingalpha.jpg|thumb|350px|A woman wearing a [[Scold's bridle]], a [[Middle Ages]] social punishment for nagging.]]

'''Nagging''', in [[interpersonal communication]], is repetitious behaviour in the form of pestering, hectoring, or otherwise continuously urging an individual to complete previously discussed requests or act on advice.

Reporter [[Elizabeth Bernstein]] defined, in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article, nagging as "the interaction in which one person repeatedly makes a request, the other person repeatedly ignores it and both become increasingly annoyed".&lt;ref name=wallstreet&gt;{{cite news |last=Bernstein|first=Elizabeth|title=Meet the Marriage Killer|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203806504577180811554468728|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, nagging is a form of persistent [[persuasion]] that is more repetitive than aggressive and it is an interaction to which each party contributes. Nagging is a very common form of persuasion used in all aspects of life including domestic and professional. It is also a common practice in order to avoid more aggressive persuasive moves like threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozloff|first=Martin A.|title=Productive interactions with students, children and clients.|date=1988|location=Springfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the Scandinavian ''nagga'', which means "to gnaw".&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;

== Dynamics ==
[[Kari P. Soule]] describes nagging as an "interpersonal ritual" but states that the term "seldom appears in interpersonal communication or conflict textbooks. It appears that 'nagging' is commonly used in everyday conversation but it rarely makes it to academic print".&lt;ref name=soulework&gt;{{Citation | last=Soule | first=Kari P. | chapter=The What, When, Who and Why of Nagging in Interpersonal Relationships | date=2011 | editor-last=Galvin | editor-first=Kathleen | title=Making Connections | publication-date=2011 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | page=193}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Nagging as a form of interpersonal communication is considered to be a repetitious form of persuasion that can be employed as an alternative to resorting to more aggressive tactics in order to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]].&lt;ref name=soulework /&gt;{{rp|195–196}} Martin Kozloff, Ph.D., Professor of Education at the [[University of North Carolina at Wilmington]], identifies four main steps of nagging :
# The nagger gives the signal to perform or stop performing a task or behaviour.
# The person being nagged does not comply to the request from the nagger.
# In response, the nagger repeats his request or signal in a further effort to gain compliance.
# The person being nagged again responds with non-compliance.

Kozloff argues that this interaction cycle continues until either the one who is being nagged complies to the nagger’s request or the nagger gives up the attempt to persuade. Kozloff identifies other important aspects of nagging; for instance, non-compliance is necessary for the persuader to be persistent. In addition, the persuader will often change the initial requests words and paralinguistic cues as a strategic tactic to entice the target into complying with the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kozloff|first=Martin A.|title=Productive interactions with students, children and clients.|date=1988|location=Springfield, IL | publisher = Charles C. Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding compliance, behavioural noncompliance describes the situation that occurs when the person being nagged remains silent or agrees to complete the request, but later does not follow through. This strategy is employed to end the confrontation or interaction quickly without conflict, which is why it is common among spouses or partners. As the nagging interaction that starts out in a calm and polite manner continues and the persuader becomes more repetitive, the interaction is more likely to become aggressive in nature. Verbal noncompliance, on the other hand, describes the situation that occurs when the target tells the persuader through words that he will not comply, and is a more direct tactic than behavioural noncompliance. An example of verbal noncompliance could be a simple no, or I am too busy right now, or an even more elaborate response. This tactic does end the nagging interaction more rapidly; however, it can cause a more aggressive response from the persuader, who may escalate persistent persuasion into a threat or another aggressive form of persuasion.&lt;ref name=soulework /&gt;{{rp|196}}

Psychotherapists such as Edward S. Dean, M.D. have reported that individuals who nag are often "weak, insecure, and fearful&amp;nbsp;... their nagging disguises a basic feeling of weakness and provides an illusion of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and superiority".&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{citation |last=Dean |first=Edward S. |title=A Psychotherapeutic Investigation of Nagging|journal=Psychoanalytic Review |url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=PSAR.051D.0015A |year=1964–1965 |issue=51D |pages=15–21}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nagging is sometimes used by spouses of alcoholics as one of several "drinking control efforts",&lt;ref name=Yoshioka&gt;{{citation |last= Yoshioka |first=Marianne R. |last2=Thomas |first2=Edwin J. |last3=Ager |first3=Richard D. |title=Nagging and other drinking control efforts of spouses of uncooperative alcohol abusers: Assessment and modification |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse |year=1992 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=309–318 |doi=10.1016/0899-3289(92)90038-Y |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6W5J-4C7WH95-10&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=12/31/1992&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1585027571&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=241935cd4ca405bbfad87c424d66fd90&amp;searchtype=a}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is often unproductive.&lt;ref name=MeyersWolfe&gt;{{citation |last=Meyers |first=Robert J. |last2=Wolfe |first2=Brenda L |title=Get your loved one sober: alternatives to nagging, pleading, and threatening |year=2003 |publisher=Hazelden Publishing |isbn=978-1-59285-081-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologically, nagging can act to [[reinforce]] behavior.&lt;ref name=MeyersWolfe/&gt; A  study by the [[University of Florida]]  found the main factors that lead a person to nag are differences in "gender, social distance, and social status and power".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Boxer |first=Diana |year=2002 |title=Nagging: The familial conflict arena|journal=[[Journal of Pragmatics]] |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VCW-45YCP7X-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=01/31/2002&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1c3872495fa4a16f8f395269538695a1&amp;searchtype=a |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=49–61 |doi=10.1016/S0378-2166(01)00022-4 |accessdate=December 20, 2010}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
Kari P. Soule found  that nagging is viewed to be more of a feminine form of interpersonal communication than masculine. An equal number of men and women nag; however, studies have shown that women are more likely to nag both men and women, while men are more likely to nag only men. Meaning women nag all people, which can be attributed to the reason why women are stereotyped as nagging people all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Soule, K. P. (2001). Persistence in compliance-gaining interactions: The Role of Nagging Behavior (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). Northwestern University, Evanston, IL&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marital===
Nagging by spouses is a common marital complaint. Nagging can be found between both male and female spouses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} An 1897 article in ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' magazine stated that at that time, topics differed by gender; husbands' nagging usually involved finding "fault with their dinner, with the household bills [and] with the children", along with "carry[ing] home the worries of business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1897 |title=The Nagging Man |journal=[[Good Housekeeping]] |volume=26 |pages=164 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jcGz-UVJgUAC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=%22nagging%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nagging%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental and child===
A study done at [[Washington State University]] and published in 1959 described parental nagging of children as being a "symptom of the rejection of the child" in circumstances when children's requirements regarding "time and energy" are perceived to interfere with the mother's "individual needs and aspirations."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ellis |first=David |last2=Ivan Nyet |first2=F. Ivan |year=1959 |title=The Nagging Parent |journal=The Family Life Coordinator |page=8 |jstor=581432 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James U. McNeal, there are seven classifications of juvenile nagging, wherein children nag their parents to obtain something they desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schlosser |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Schlosser |title=Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, Volume 1000 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yNFN1OpnkBkC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Kids+as+Customers+McNeal+nagging#v=onepage&amp;q=Kids%20as%20Customers%20McNeal%20nagging&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 5, 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=[[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] |isbn= 978-0395977897|page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During the Middle Ages, a [[scold's bridle]], also called a brank, was an instrument of punishment used primarily on women.&lt;ref name=FreeDictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of branks|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/branks|publisher=Free Dictionary|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was an iron muzzle in an iron framework that enclosed the head. A [[bridle]]-bit (or curb-plate), about 2 inches long and 1 inch broad, projected into the mouth and pressed down on top of the tongue.&lt;ref name=NEN-UK&gt;{{cite web|title=Scolds Bridle|url=http://gallery.nen.gov.uk/image72332-.html|publisher=National Education Network, U.K|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curb-plate was frequently studded with spikes, so that if the offender moved her tongue, it inflicted pain and made speaking impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History talk sheds light on Scold's Bridle|url=http://www.walsall.gov.uk/museum_history_talk_sheds_light_on_the_scold_s_bridle.htm|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives who were seen as [[witch]]es, [[Shrew (archetype)|shrews]] and [[scold]]s, were forced to wear the branks, locked onto their head.&lt;ref name=NEN-UK /&gt;

Friess|authorlink2=Horace L.

Nontheism has generally been used to describe apathy or silence towards the subject of God and differs from an antithetical, explicit atheism. Nontheism does not necessarily describe atheism or disbelief in God; it has been used as an [[umbrella term]] for summarizing various distinct and even mutually exclusive positions, such as [[agnosticism]], [[ignosticism]], [[ietsism]], [[skepticism]], [[pantheism]], [[atheism]], [[negative and positive atheism|strong or positive atheism]], [[implicit and explicit atheism|implicit atheism]], and [[apatheism]]. It is in use in the fields of [[Christian apologetics]] and general [[liberal theology]].

Within the scope of nontheistic agnosticism, Philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] distinguishes between agnostics who find the claim "God exists" uncertain and [[Theological noncognitivism|theological noncognitivists]] who consider all discussion of God to be meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |year=2006 |title=Worshipping an Unknown God |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9329.2006.00339.x |journal=Ratio |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=442 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.2006.00339.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some agnostics, however, are not nontheists but rather [[agnostic theism|agnostic theists]].&lt;ref name=Smith1979&gt;
{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=0Xt_T5mMH8KUiQLrlq3HAw&amp;id=FI7ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=atheism+the+case+against+god&amp;q=agnostic+theist#search_anchor |title=Atheism: The Case Against God |first=George H |last=Smith |authorlink=George H. Smith |pages=10–11 |quote=Properly considered, agnosticism is not a third alternative to theism and atheism because it is concerned with a different aspect of religious belief. Theism and atheism refer to the presence or absence of belief in a god; agnosticism refers to the impossibility of knowledge with regard to a god or supernatural being. The term "agnostic" does not, in itself, indicate whether or not one believes in a god. Agnosticism can be either theistic or atheistic. |year=1979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other related philosophical opinions about the existence of deities are ignosticism and skepticism. Because of the various definitions of the term ''[[God]]'', a person could be an atheist in terms of certain [[conceptions of god]]s, while remaining agnostic in terms of others.

==Origin and definition==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2007) does not have an entry for ''nontheism'' or ''non-theism'', but it does have an entry for ''non-theist'', defined as "A person who is not a theist", and an entry for the adjectival ''non-theistic''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

An early usage of the hyphenated ''non-theism'' is by [[George Holyoake]] in 1852,&lt;ref&gt;"The Reasoner", New Series, No. VIII. 115&lt;/ref&gt; who introduces it because:
{{quote|Mr. [Charles] Southwell has taken an objection to the term Atheism. We are glad he has. We have disused it a long time [...]. We disuse it, because Atheist is a worn-out word. Both the ancients and the moderns have understood by it ''one without God, and also without morality''. Thus the term connotes more than any well-informed and earnest person accepting it ever included in it; that is, the word carries with it associations of immorality, which have been repudiated by the Atheist as seriously as by the Christian. Non-theism is a term less open to the same misunderstanding, as it implies the simple non-acceptance of the Theist's explanation of the origin and government of the world.}}

This passage is cited by [[James Buchanan (minister)|James Buchanan]] in his 1857 ''Modern Atheism under its forms of Pantheism, Materialism, Secularism, Development, and Natural Laws'', who however goes on to state:
{{quote|"Non-theism" was afterwards exchanged [by Holyoake] for "Secularism", as a term less liable to misconstruction, and more correctly descriptive of the real import of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=James|authorlink=James Buchanan (minister)|title=Modern Atheism under its forms of Pantheism, Materialism, Secularism, Development, and Natural Laws|year=1857}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Spelling without hyphen sees scattered use in the later 20th century, following [[Harvey Cox]]'s 1966 ''Secular City'': "Thus the hidden God or [[deus absconditus]] of biblical theology may be mistaken for the no-god-at-all of nontheism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Harvey|authorlink=Harvey Cox|title=Secular City|year=1966|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage increased in the 1990s in contexts where association with the terms ''atheism'' or ''[[antitheism]]'' was unwanted. The 1998 ''Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics'' states, "In the strict sense, all forms of nontheisms are naturalistic, including atheism, [[pantheism]], [[deism]], and agnosticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics|year=1998|volume=Naturalism|pages=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pema Chödrön]] uses the term in the context of [[Buddhism]]:
{{quote|The difference between theism and nontheism is not whether one does or does not believe in God.[...] Theism is a deep-seated conviction that there's some hand to hold [...] Non-theism is relaxing with the ambiguity and uncertainty of the present moment without reaching for anything to protect ourselves [...] Nontheism is finally realizing there is no babysitter you can count on.&lt;ref name= wtfa&gt;{{cite book

'''Phubbing''' is a term coined as part of a campaign by ''Macquarie Dictionary'' to describe the habit of snubbing someone in favour of a [[mobile phone]]. In May 2012, the advertising agency behind the campaign, McCann, had invited a number of lexicographers, authors, and poets to coin a [[neologism]] to describe the behaviour. The word "phubbing" was first described by McCann Group Account Director Adrian Mills, who was working with [[David Astle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4FLTM82VcI |title= The first use of the word phubbing |publisher= YouTube |date= 2017-01-03 |accessdate= 2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has appeared in media around the world and was popularized by the Stop Phubbing campaign created by McCann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stopphubbing.com/ |title=Stop Phubbing |publisher= Stop Phubbing |date= |accessdate= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stop Phubbing campaign==
The Stop Phubbing campaign site, and related [[Facebook]] page, was part of an elaborate public relations effort designed to promote the ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' of [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pathak |first= Shareen |url= http://adage.com/article/news/mccann-melbourne-made-a-word-sell-a-dictionary/244595/ |title= McCann Melbourne Made Up a Word to Sell a Dictionary &amp;#124; News - Advertising Age |publisher= Adage.com |date= 2013-10-07 |accessdate= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the media, the website was originally credited by an Australian college student named Alex Haigh, who had been interning at McCann and was subsequently hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tom Chatfield |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/the-rise-of-phubbing--aka-phone-snubbing-8747229.html |title= The rise of phubbing - aka phone snubbing - Features - Gadgets &amp; Tech |publisher= The Independent |date= 2013-08-05 |accessdate= 2013-10-12 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film, titled ''A Word is Born'', describes the entire process and serves as an advertisement for the dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSOfuUYCV_0 |title= Phubbing: A Word is Born |publisher= YouTube |date= 2013-10-08 |accessdate= 2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phubbing in the media==
The campaign was picked up by numerous media outlets, notably those in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Mexico]], and [[Germany]]. The press reported on surveys showing statistics of the number of the people "phubbing", and published [[etiquette]] guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/10304653/The-15-most-annoying-things-about-iPhones.html |title=The 15 most annoying things about iPhones |publisher=Telegraph |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2013-10-12 |location=London |first=Michael |last=Hogan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinmetz |first=Katy |url=http://techland.time.com/2013/08/06/why-the-stop-phubbing-campaign-is-going-viral/#ixzz2d3mMXCFM |title=Why the ‘Stop Phubbing’ Campaign Is Going Viral &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=Techland.time.com |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts, professor of marketing at [[Baylor University]] Hankamer School of Business, that was published in the journal "Computers In Human Behavior". The study consisted of two separate surveys of more than 450 U.S. adults to learn the relational effects of "phubbing" or partner phubbing. The survey found that 46.3 percent of respondents said their partners phubbed them, and 22.6 percent said it caused issues in their relationship.&lt;ref name="Today"/&gt; In an interview with [[Yahoo!]] Health, Roberts said, "We found that the ones that reported higher partner phubbing fought more with their partner and were less satisfied with their relationship than those who reported less phubbing."&lt;ref name="Digital"/&gt;

[[File:Pietro vettori, edizione xvii secolo.gif|thumb|220px|Pietro Vettori in a 16th-century drawing.]]
'''Piero Vettori''' ([[Latin]]: '''Petrus Victorius''') (1499 – 8 December 1585) was an Italian writer, [[philologist]] and [[Humanism|humanist]].

==Life==
Vettori was born in [[Florence]] and in his life dealt with numerous matters, from agriculture to sciences, from [[rhetorics]] to [[moral philosophy]], and also catalogued codexes in Florence and [[Italy]]. However his main interest was the study of ancient classics, especially Greek texts.

In 1522 he traveled to Spain with his cousin  Paolo Vettori, naval commander of the [[Papal States]], and there he collected numerous ancient inscriptions which, once back to Florence, he tried to interpret. An adversary of the [[House of Medici]], after the death of the Republic and the establishment of the [[Duchy of Florence]] in 1530, Vettori retired to [[San Casciano Val di Pesa]], where he wrote the ''Trattato delle lodi et della coltivazione de gli ulivi'' ("Treatise on the praise and the cultivation of olive trees").

In 1538 Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] called him to Florence, offering him a position as professor of Greek and Latin in the [[Studio Fiorentino]], where he taught until 1583. 

He died in Florence in 1585.

==Works==

His other works include the '' Castigationes'' (commentaries) of [[Cicero]]'s family letter, and editions of works by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Sallust]], [[Aristotle]], [[Euripides]]'s ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'' and others. 

His edition of Aeschylus (1557) was the first printed edition to include the whole of the ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'', as the earlier editors of Aeschylus [[Francesco Robortello]] and [[Adrianus Turnebus]] had only had lines 1-310 and 1067-1159 available to them. Vettori made very few textual conjectures in this edition, but [[Henricus Stephanus]], who printed it, added an appendix with some further corrections.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Aeschylus: Agamemnon'', volume 1, pp. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also edited the works of his friend [[Giovanni della Casa]] after the latter's death. 

In 1553 he published the first 25 books of the ''Variarum lectionum'', followed by another thirteen in 1569 and republished integrally in 1582.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3314">'''''Punct''''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] for "Point") was a [[Romania]]n art and literary magazine, published from 1924 to 1925. 

==History and profile==
Founded and directed by [[Scarlat Callimachi]], it was edited by painter [[Victor Brauner]] and writer [[Stephan Roll]]. [[Scarlat Callimachi]] was the [[editor-in-chief]] of the magazine, which was published on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name="peter"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Brooker|author2=Sascha Bru|author3=Andrew Thacker|author4=Christian Weikop|title=The Oxford Critical and Cultural History of Modernist Magazines: Europe 1880 - 1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bvsfioiQ8k8C&amp;pg=PA1173|accessdate=3 August 2015|date=19 May 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-965958-6|page=1173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the magazine was in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Romanian Avant-Garde (03/1999)|url=http://www.icr.ro/bucharest/the-romanian-avant-garde-03-1999/1922-1928.html|work=Institutul Cultural Roman|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subtitle of ''Punct'' was changed three times during its existence: A Review of Constructivist Literature and Arts, A Review of International Arts and finally, A Review of Constructivist Art.&lt;ref name=peter/&gt; Although the periodical was subtitled "A Review of [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Art]]", it was dedicated not only to constructivism, but also covered other forms of [[abstract art]] and had strong links to [[Dadaism]], publishing pieces by [[Tristan Tzara]]. ''Punct'' was the among the leading avant-garde magazines published in Romania, a group which also comprises ''[[Contimporanul]]'' and the single issue of ''75 HP''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Adriana Copaciu|title=How to be Transnational?

The issues of ''Punct'' were illustrated with [[linocut]]s by Romanian artists, among them Brauner, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Miliţa Petraşcu]], [[János Mattis-Teutsch]], [[M. H. Maxy]], as well as by foreign abstractionists such as [[Victor Servranckx]] or [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Inspired by [[Viking Eggeling]]'s film design, Janco also composed a formal alphabet for ''Punct''. The magazine published literary work by Romanian writers (Roll, [[Ion Vinea]], [[Ilarie Voronca]] and others), poems by [[French-language]] poets ([[Philippe Soupault]], [[Louis Emié]], [[Georges Linze]]) and articles on art by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Germany|German]] painters ([[Theo van Doesburg]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Herwarth Walden]]).

''Punct'' ceased publication in 1925 when it was merged with ''Contimporanul''.&lt;ref name=peter/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44178">'''Richard Shusterman''' is an [[Americans|American]] [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[philosophy|philosopher]]. Known for his contributions to philosophical [[aesthetics]] and the emerging field of somaesthetics, currently he is the Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities and Professor of Philosophy at [[Florida Atlantic University]].

==Biography and career==

Richard Shusterman was born on December 3, 1949, to a Jewish family living in [[Philadelphia]], USA. At the age 16 he left his home and went to [[Israel]], where he continued his education, studying English and philosophy at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. There he received a B.A. degree in English and Philosophy, and later an M.A. degree in philosophy (both degrees awarded magna cum laude). 
After teaching at different Israeli academic institutions, and receiving tenure at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev with an episode as a visiting fellow at [[St John's College, Oxford|St. John's College]], [[Oxford University]] during academic year 1984/85, Shusterman became an Associate Professor of Philosophy at [[Temple University]], [[Philadelphia]], USA in 1986. He was granted tenure in 1988 and promoted to full professor in 1991. He then served as chair of the philosophy department between the years of 1998–2004.
In 2004 Richard Shusterman left Temple University to become the [http://www.fau.edu/humanitieschair/ Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities] at [[Florida Atlantic University]], [[Boca Raton]], where he also holds the rank of Professor in the departments of Philosophy and English.
Richard Shusterman has been married twice. From his first marriage in Israel, he has two sons and a daughter. He has one daughter from his second marriage, which ended in 2013.

During his years at the University of Jerusalem, Shusterman focused on [[analytic philosophy]]. The interest carried over with his doctoral dissertation at Oxford University; ''The Object of Literary Criticism'' which he wrote at St. John's College under the supervision of [[J. O. Urmson]] and defended in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richard|first=Shusterman|date=|year=1979|title=The object of literary criticism|url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:35aaee34-ecdb-45fd-8922-745efdf3403f|journal=|language=en|publisher=Oxford Research Archive|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published under the original title in 1984.
1988 saw the publication of Shusterman's second book, [[T. S. Eliot]] and the Philosophy of Criticism, and with it came a turn in his philosophical focus as well. Influenced by the work that produced the book and personal experiences, Shusterman's attention moved from analytic philosophy to [[pragmatism]]. He also began work to develop his own theory of pragmatist aesthetics; based on [[John Dewey]]’s [[aesthetics]] but augmented by the argumentative methods and tools of analytic philosophy.
His third book published, Pragmatist Aesthetics in 1992, brought a big breakthrough in Shusterman’s academic career. The book’s original approach to the problems of definition of art, organic wholes, interpretation, popular art, and the ethics of taste brought him international fame as the book was translated into 14 languages and several editions were published. Shusterman’s position was further strengthened by three subsequent publications: Practicing Philosophy in 1997, Performing Live in 2000, and Surface and Depth in 2002; in which he continued the pragmatist tradition, raising significant interest, provoking numerous critiques and stimulating debates not only among professional philosophers, but in the areas of literary and cultural studies as well.
In Practicing Philosophy, Shusterman introduces his concept of ‘somaesthetics’, which he elaborates in greater detail in Performing Live. Somaesthetics is the focus of Shusterman's two subsequent books, Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics (2008) and Thinking through the Body: Essays in Somaesthetics (2012). The first of these books, translated into seven languages, helped establish somaesthetics as an international, interdisciplinary project involving scholars from fields beyond philosophy, while the second book consolidated this movement toward the interdisciplinary approach by applying somaesthetics to various arts, and cultural practices.

In 2007, as a part of his project of developing somaesthetics, Shusterman established the [http://www.fau.edu/bodymindculture/ Center for Body, Mind, and Culture] at FAU.  He is a member of many editorial boards and has been allocated important grants and fellowships for his research; from the National Endowment of the Humanities, the [[Fulbright Commission]], and the [[Humboldt Foundation]].

One of the important factors influencing Shusterman's philosophy has been his international career. For instance, his work in France with [[Pierre Bourdieu]], the [[Sorbonne]], and the [[College International de Philosophie]] has allowed his pragmatism to engage and deploy the contemporary French philosophical tradition. His Fulbright Professorship in [[Berlin]] enabled his pragmatism to intersect more closely with contemporary German philosophy. Similarly, his years as a visiting research professor in [[Hiroshima]], Japan and in [[Beijing]] and [[Shandong]] in China facilitated his study of [[Asian philosophy]] and [[Zen]] practice.

Shusterman philosophy stretches beyond the confines of professional academic life. In 1995, he was a delegate member of the [[UNESCO]] project Philosophy and Democracy in the World, and for several years he directed the UNESCO project MUSIC: Music, Urbanism, Social Integration and Culture. In 2012 he prepared a project commissioned by UNESCO that aims to use the internet to stimulate international youth to immerse in dialogue about peace and violence, through the medium of art.  Recalling the classical Greek concept of education, the project is named PAIDEIA, an acronym that stands for Peace through Art and Internet Dialog for Education and Intercultural Association.  On a more local level, during the years 1998-2004, he organized and hosted a public discussion forum, titled “Dialogues on the Square”, at Philadelphia's main [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] bookstore, at Rittenhouse Square.  In 2002, he received his professional certification as a [[Feldenkrais]] practitioner, and he has worked since as a somatic educator and therapist.

==Philosophical work==

===Shusterman's place in the contemporary pragmatism===
Contemporary pragmatism can be divided into two sub-fields; the neo-classical and the [[Neopragmatism|neo-analytical]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., T. Rockmore, “On Classical and Neo-Analytic Forms of Pragmatism”, ''Metaphilosophy'' vol. 36, no. 3, April, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has been well described by Richard Rorty, as an amalgam of the elements of classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, which is sometimes supplemented, especially in Rorty's case, by the ideas of continental thinkers like Martin Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., R. Rorty, “Truth without Correspondence to Reality”, in  ''Philosophy and Social Hope'' (London: Penguin 1999), p. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The former, represented, among others, by Susan Haack, is more conservative in its development of the classical tradition and adopts a critical stance toward Rorty's interpretation thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. S. Haack, “Pragmatism, Old and New”, ''Contemporary Pragmatism'', vol. 1, no. 1, June, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming this description is correct, Shusterman's pragmatism lies somewhere in the middle between the above-mentioned positions. Although his analytic background and acceptance of some of Rorty's ideas (he even subsumes his and Rorty's thought under a common category of “reconstructivist genealogical-poetic pragmatism”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism and Culture: Margolis and Rorty”, in ''Surface and Depth. Dialectics of Criticism and Culture'', (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;) seemingly make him a neo-analytic pragmatist, the stress he puts on the importance of the notion of experience, which Rorty would like to substitute with the notion of language, chimes perfectly with the neo-classical stance.

Besides classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, Shusterman's interests touch varied traditions and disciplines: continental sociology ([[Pierre Bourdieu]]&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., R. Shusterman, “Cultural Analysis and the Limits of Philosophy: The Case of Bourdieu” in ''Surface and Depth''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and philosophy ([[Michel Foucault]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and Care of the Self: The Case of Foucault”, ''Monist'', 83, 2000; R. Shusterman “Entertainment: A Question for Aesthetics”, ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', 43, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;), Western body therapy ([[Moshe Feldenkrais]], [[F. Matthias Alexander]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “The Somatic Turn” in ''Performing Live'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as East-Asian thought ([[Confucius]]).&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism and East-Asian Thought”, ''Metaphilosophy'', 35, 2004; R. Shusterman, “Pragmatist Aesthetics and East-Asian Philosophy”, ''Naked Punch'' (online edition), May, 2006; http://www.nakedpunch.com/shustermanchina.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

This diversity of interests and inspirations finds its reflection in the scope of Shusterman's philosophical work which embraces not only aesthetics, but also metaphysics, ethics, philosophy of language, political theory as well as metaphilosophy; in which he advocates the idea of philosophy as the art of living.

===Experience===

Experience serves as a basic category in Shusterman's pragmatism, both in terms of methodology (the pragmatist should always work from experience &lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, ''Performing Live'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;) as well as ontology or epistemology (experience “is a transactional nexus of interacting energies connecting the embodied self and its environing world”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Intellectualism and the Field of Aesthetics”, ''Revue Internationale de Philosophie'',  220, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;) but contrary to John Dewey, Shusterman does not engage in constructing a general metaphysical conception. He has, however, made significant comments on Dewey's insights &lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism Between Aesthetic Experience and Aesthetic Education”, ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', 22, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and defends Dewey's idea of immediate, nondiscursive experience against the criticism put forward by Richard Rorty.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, "Somatic Experience. Foundation or Reconstruction?", in ''Practicing Philosophy: Pragmatism and the Philosophical Life'' (New York: Routledge,1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Rorty shares Dewey's commitment to debunk epistemological [[foundationalism]], he (Rorty) believes that the notion of language is better suited to achieve this goal, than the notion of immediate, non-discursive experience preferred by Dewey. Rorty further says that Dewey's theory itself collapses into a version of foundationalism, where immediate, non-discursive experience serves as evidence for particular knowledge claims.

To this, Shusterman replies that:
(a) The anti-foundationalist thrust of the notion of language is not as clear as Rorty sees it (in fact language has been frequently used as a foundationalist category)
(b) Dewey never really intended his theory of experience to be a kind of epistemological foundationalism, but rather wanted to celebrate the richness and value of immediate experience, including “the immediate dimension of somatic experience” and to emphasize the positive role such experience can play in improving the quality of human life. (The inspiration of body theorist-therapist F. M. Alexander is important here). Although he argues that Dewey's theory was ultimately spoiled by a kind of foundationalism (not the one Rorty accuses Dewey of but rather one asserting that the specific quality of immediate experience is the glue that makes coherent thought possible),
Shusterman believes that the philosophical value of experience can and should be reaffirmed in an anti-foundationalist form.

In Shusterman's and, also, Dewey's opinion, the eastern meditation practices repair perception for understanding our dependence on the society's moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, [[Wilfrid Sellars]]’s critique of the myth of the given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to think otherwise would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. And the fact that we can hardly imagine any form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation has been one of the reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics.

===Definitions of art===

Shusterman also addresses the philosophical problems of defining art; by presenting both, meta-theoretical insights as well as definitions of his own.

On the meta-theoretical level he criticizes [[essentialist]], classificatory definitions of art (preferred by the traditional analytic philosophy), which he calls “wrapper definitions” since they aim “at the perfect coverage” of the [[Extension (semantics)|logical extension]] of the notion of art.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, Surface and Depth, p. 179-181&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman finds these definitions problematic, given art's contested value and nature as well as its unpredictable development in the future. He further argues that there is a goal for art definitions, which is more important than the conceptual coverage that is directional/transformational in “illuminating the special point and value of art or [...] improving art’s appreciation”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism Between Aesthetic Experience and Aesthetic Education”, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

He says that these ideas may converge, but since they may as well not, it is unacceptable to exclude any definitions only on the basis that they do not satisfy the standards of taxonomical validity, like e.g. evaluative definitions which nevertheless can be useful in their own way. Besides discussing the issue of wrapper definitions in general, Shusterman has also criticized particular definitions of that kind invented by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] and [[Arthur Danto]].&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 38-44. Cf. R. Shusterman, “Art in a Box: Danto” (chapter 10 of ''Surface and Depth'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Shusterman advocates a definition of art; as experience that is influenced by Dewey's definition with significant changes. While he accepts the majority of the elements central to the Dewey's conception of this experience (e.g., that it cannot be reduced to the private mental world of the subject being rather an interaction between the subject and the object), there are some he finds questionable (e.g. Dewey's insistence on the unity and coherence of aesthetic experience which Shusterman would like to supplement with aesthetics of rupture and fragmentation).
He says that Dewey was wrong to treat his definition of art as experience as a traditionalist wrapper definition, thus making it vulnerable to the valid charges, that it is both too narrow and too wide (there are some artworks which do not engender aesthetic experiences and, conversely, in some cases aesthetic experience accompanies phenomena which simply cannot be redefined as art, like natural beauty, e.g.). He further says that what Dewey should have done instead was to assign to it the directional and transformational role mentioned above. Conceived this way, Shusterman argues, the definition of art as experience has an undeniable value because even though it cannot embrace the whole extension of the concept of art it “underlines a crucial background condition, direction, and valued goal of art” (i.e. aesthetic experience) and also helps to widen “the realm of art by challenging the rigid division between art and action that is supported by definitions that define art as mimesis, poiesis, or the narrow practice defined by the institutional art world".&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Pragmatism and Criticism: A Response to three critics of ''Pragmatist Aesthetics''”, ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', 16, 2002, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shusterman also advocates a definition of art as dramatization, which supplements the definition he has inherited from Dewey not only by illuminating art's nature from a slightly different angle, but also by serving a different, yet equally important purpose – the reconciliation of two prominent and, at the same time, conflicted aesthetic accounts of art: [[historicism]] and [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]]. Since the notion of dramatization involves, and harmonizes two important moments: of putting something into a formalized frame (e.g. “the frame of a theatrical performance”&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Art as Dramatization,” in ''Surface and Depth''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and of intense experiential content that is framed, it presents itself as a potential synthesizing formula for historicism and naturalism which, Shusterman argues, can be reduced to emphasizing the formal institutional frame of art (historicism) or experiential intensity that characterizes art as such (naturalism).

Both of Shusterman's definitions have become the subject of many commentaries and criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Thomas Leddy and Paul C. Taylor defend Dewey’s original theory of art as experience against Shusterman’s criticism, while Ranjan Ghosh points out that the definition of art as dramatization is significantly consonant with the Indian concept of Rasa (see the secondary literature listed above). Cf J. J. Stuhr, "Practice, Semiotics, and the Limits of Philosophy", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', vol. 19, no. 1, 2005, p. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

Of the many debates that galvanize contemporary humanities, one of the most important one is devoted to the problem of interpretation. Shusterman has participated in it by co-editing a fundamental anthology “The Interpretive Turn”, as well as making his opinions known.
Shusterman's account of interpretation is constructed in opposition to both analytic aesthetics and [[deconstruction]], which are often said to constitute the two opposite poles of contemporary interpretive theory. As he claims, both of them share “a picture of understanding as the recapturing or reproducing of a particular [...] [“separate and autonomous”] meaning-object”, yet they differ as to whether such act is possible. Deconstructionists, assuming their protean vision of language as “systematic play of differences”, claim it is not, and hence deem every reading a “misreading”, while analytic aestheticians think otherwise, usually construing the objective work-meaning as “metaphysically fixed in the artwork” and identifying it with the intention of the artist or “semantic features of the work itself”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Surface and Depth'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid both these extremes Shusterman proposes a conception of textual meaning inspired by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]](and his notion of [[language-game|language games]]) in which meaning is thought of as a correlate of understanding, the latter term being conceived as “an ability to handle or respond to [something] in certain accepted ways”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; which, although shared and legitimized by the community, can be quite different and constitute many diverse “interpretation games”.
Interpretation, thus, is not an act (be it successful or inherently condemned to failure) of discovering the meaning of text, but rather of constructing it, or, as Shusterman would like to put it, of “making sense’” of text. One of the corollaries of this account is that correctness of interpretation is always relative to the “rules” (typically implicit) of a given interpretation game. Since there are many different incommensurable games existing at the same time and since some of them have undergone some significant changes over history (and some may even have disappeared from use), we can speak of a plurality of correct interpretations of the same text both in synchronic and diachronic dimensions. Another consequence of this theory is Shusterman's logical pluralism which claims not only that there can be different (even contradictory), yet equally true interpretations (that would be only a cognitive pluralism), but also that there are legitimate forms of approaching texts which do not even aim at interpretational truth or plausibility, but rather aim at other useful goals (e.g., providing pleasure or making an old text more relevant to contemporary readers).&lt;ref&gt;See R. Shusterman, “Logics of Interpretation: The Persistence of Pluralism”, in ''Surface and Depth'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Shusterman's contributions to the theory of interpretation is his critique of a widely held view he calls ‘hermeneutic universalism’, and attributes to [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Alexander Nehamas]] and [[Stanley Fish]], among others. Agreeing with basic anti-foundationalist thrust of the hermeneutic universalists’ position, Shusterman simultaneously rejects their thesis that “to perceive, read, understand, or behave at all intelligently [...] must always be to interpret” and seeks to refute it with many original arguments. He also insists that the notion of interpretation needs a contrasting category to guarantee its own meaningfulness. If everything is interpretation then the concept loses its point. Shusterman argues that immediate, non-interpretive understanding can serve that role of contrast. Inspired by Wittgenstein and Heidegger's theory of [[hermeneutics|hermeneutic circle]], Shusterman proposes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“the immediacy of uninterrupted understandings of language (as when I immediately understand simple and pertinent utterances of a language I know well) and the mediacy of interpretations (as when I encounter an utterance or text that I do not understand in terms of word-meaning or contextual relevance and then have to figure out what is meant)”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, "Pragmatism and Criticism", p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Among Shusterman's achievements in the theory of interpretation, there are also the accounts of literary criticism he created in his earlier, analytic period, as well as his pragmatist arguments against interpretational intentionalism and his genealogical critique of deconstructionist ([[Harold Bloom]]’s, [[Jonathan Culler]]’s), analytic ([[Joseph Margolis]]’) and neo-pragmatist (Richard Rorty's, Stanley Fish's, [[Walter Benn Michaels]] and [[Steven Knapp]]’s) literary theories which, as he claims, are all governed at their core by an ideology of professionalism.

===Popular art===

According to Shusterman, one of the most pressing sociocultural problems of today is the aesthetic legitimization of popular art. He feels that though popular art may now seem to be socially justified, its artistic value is still questioned which leads to the following problems:
*popular art is “deprived of artistic care and control” which could protect it against the negative influence of the market, and, as a result, it often becomes “brutally crude in sensibility”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;
*satisfactions provided by this kind of art cannot be complete since they are diminished by a sense of humiliation which is induced in its audience by official art institutions’ explicit disapproval of popular art forms.
*this situation in turn “intensifies painful divisions in society and even in ourselves”.&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Popular Art and Education”, ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', 13, 1995, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
A sincere advocate of popular aesthetics, Shusterman is careful to distinguish his stance from one-sided apologia and would rather characterize it as ‘melorism’ which “recognizes popular art’s flaws and abuses but also its merits [while also holding] that popular art should be improved because it can and often does achieve real aesthetic merits and serve worthy social ends”.&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Popular Art and Education”, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;
Putting his meliorism into practice, Shusterman seeks to win aesthetic legitimation for popular art in two ways:
*On a general theoretical level:
**he promotes the definition of art as experience, assuming that it could “effect the artistic legitimation” of popular art (e.g., “[[rock music]]”) “which affords such frequent and intensely gratifying aesthetic experience to so many people from so many nations, cultures, and classes”;&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
**provides counter arguments to the most influential criticisms of popular art (e.g., [[Theodor W. Adorno]]’s and [[Allan Bloom]]’s&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 7 of ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;)
**analyzes (both on conceptual-etymological as well as genealogical level) the phenomenon of entertainment to highlight the crucial positive role it plays in human existence.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, "Entertainment: A Question for Aesthetics", ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', 43, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shusterman also engages in the aesthetic criticism of particular genres of popular arts and of its concrete works, arguing for artistic value of [[country music]] and [[hip hop music|rap]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Affect and Authenticity In Country Musicals” in ''Performing Live'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2000); “The Fine Art of Rap” in ''Pragmatist Aesthetics'' (2000); “Art in Action, Art Infraction. Goodman, Rap, Pragmatism (New Reality Mix)” in ''Practicing Philosophy: Pragmatism and the Philosophical Life''; "Pragmatism, Art, and Violence: The Case of Rap”, in T. Yamamoto (ed.), ''Philosophical Designs for a Socio-Cultural Transformation'' (Tokyo and Boulder: E.H.E.S.C. and Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; What is worth stressing is that Shusterman was probably the first art philosopher ever to write about rap,&lt;ref&gt;His „Fine Art of Rap” was first published in 1991: ''New Literary History'', 22, 1991, p. 613-632.&lt;/ref&gt; and despite the fact that the accuracy of his treatment of this music genre is sometimes questioned,&lt;ref&gt;See T. Brennan, “Off the Gangsta Tip: A Rap Appreciation, or Forgetting about Los Angeles”, ''Critical Inquiry'', 20, 1994; G. C. Maher, “Brechtian Hip-Hop. Didactics and Self-Production in Post-Gangsta Political Mixtapes”, ''Journal of Black Studies'', vol. 36, no. 1, September, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; his groundbreaking role in this area cannot be denied and has been appreciated worldwide.

===Somaesthetics===
{{main article|Somaesthetics}}

'Somaesthetics’ is a term coined by Shusterman to denote a new philosophical discipline he has invented as a remedy for the following problems:

*According to Shusterman our culture's growing preoccupation with the body has not yet found an appropriate response in the realm of philosophy, which simply neglects the somatic, textualizes it, or reduces it to gender or racial difference, and thus is unwilling or unable to counteract the negative aspects of the current body boom (such as the tendency that “contemporary aesthetic ideals of body remain enslaved by shallow and oppressive stereotypes that serve more to increase profits for the cosmetics industries than to enrich our experience of the varieties of bodily charms”&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Revival of Aesthetics”, ''[[Filozofski Vestnik]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;).
*Despite the relative abundance of humanist disciplines devoted to the body they lack
**a conceptual framework that could integrate their efforts (and also allow for their better cooperation with natural sciences and various somatic methods);
**“a clear pragmatic orientation, something that the individual can directly translate into a discipline of improved somatic practice”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Body/Media Issue” in ''Performing Live'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philosophical aesthetics has paid very little attention to the body as a result of “the willful neglect of the body in [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten’s]] founding text of modern aesthetics, an omission reinforced by subsequent intellectualist and idealist theories (from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] through [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and on to contemporary theories that emphasize disinterested contemplation)”.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Revival of Aesthetics”&lt;/ref&gt;

The above-mentioned conditions have determined the nature of somaesthetics as a grounded-in-philosophical-aesthetics yet interdisciplinary project of theory and practice which can be defined as:

{{Quotation|“the critical, meliorative study of the experience and the use of one’s body as a locus sensory-aesthetic appreciation (aisthesis) and creative self-fashioning [...], devoted [also] to the knowledge, discourses and disciplines that structure such somatic care or can improve it.”.&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and Care of the Self: The Case of Foucault”, ''Monist'', 83, 2000, p. 532-533.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To clarify the terminological issues, one needs to mention that Shusterman has intentionally put the term ‘soma’ (instead of the more familiar ‘body’) in the name of his disciplinary proposal to emphasize one important feature of his conception of corporeality. For Shusterman, who is a true disciple of Dewey in this regard, bodily and mental (as well as cultural and biological) dimensions of  human beings are essentially inseparable, and to signify this unity (this “sentient perceiving «body-mind»”) he prefers to use the term ‘soma’ which, unlike ‘body’, does not automatically connote passive flesh contrasted to dynamic soul or mind.

Although Shusterman's project may at first glance seem utterly innovatory and even iconoclastic, its various elements, as Shusterman himself admits, can be traced to many respected traditions: ancient Greek philosophy and the later Western philosophies (Michel de Montaigne, John Dewey, Michel Foucault), but also East-Asian wisdom such as Confucianism.
Somaesthetics divides into three fundamental branches:

*''analytical somaesthetics'' which is a “descriptive and theoretical enterprise devoted to explaining the nature of our bodily perceptions and practices and their function in our knowledge and construction of the world. Besides the traditional topics in philosophy of mind, ontology, and epistemology that relate to the mind-body issue and the role of somatic factors in consciousness and action, analytic somaesthetics also includes the sort of genealogical, sociological, and cultural analyses advanced by Beauvoir, Foucault [and] Pierre Bourdieu”;&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and The Second Sex: A Pragmatist Reading of a Feminist Classic”, ''Hypatia'' 18, 2003, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''pragmatic somaesthetics'' which (in “contrast to analytic somaesthetics, whose logic is essentially descriptive”) “has a distinctly normative, often prescriptive, character because it involves proposing specific methods of somatic improvement or engaging in their comparison, explanation, and critique”;&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''practical somaesthetics'' which “involves actually engaging in programs of disciplined, reflective, corporeal practice aimed at somatic self-improvement”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shusterman himself works in all three somaesthetic subdisciplines:

*within the analytic field he theorizes the body's status as the basic medium of human existence and the fundamental role it plays in the realm of cognition, ethics, politics and aesthetics;&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and the Body/Media Issue”&lt;/ref&gt;
*in pragmatic somaesthetics
**he analyzes different somatic disciplines (e.g., Feldenkrais method, [[Alexander Technique]], [[Bioenergetics]]);&lt;ref&gt;R. Shusterman, “The Somatic Turn: Care of the Body in Contemporary Culture”, chapter 8 of ''Performing Live''.&lt;/ref&gt;
**criticizes different thinkers, such as [[Edmund Burke]], [[William James]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and Michel Foucault, for either neglecting or misconceiving the value of various forms of somatic care;&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., R. Shusterman, “Somaesthetics and Burke’s Sublime”, ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', 45, 2005;“William James, Somatic Introspection, and Care of the Self”, ''Philosophical Forum'', 36, 2005; "The Silent, Limping Body of Philosophy”, in T. Carman and M. Hansen (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Merleau-Ponty'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
**scrutinizes the issue of Asian erotic arts;&lt;ref&gt;“Asian Ars Erotica and the Question of Sexual Aesthetics”,''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', vol. 65, no. 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
**discusses the value of somaesthetics for education in the humanities;&lt;ref&gt;R.Shusterman,“Somaesthetics and Education: Exploring the Terrain”, in Liora Bressler (ed.), ''Knowing Bodies, Moving Minds: Towards Embodied Teaching and Learning'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2004); “Thinking Through the Body: Educating for the Humanities”, ''Journal of Aesthetic Education'', vol. 40, no. 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*As a certified practitioner of the Feldenkrais Method and a somatic therapist, he gives workshops on somaesthetics that include practical exercises and demonstrations, and he also has experience in treating different cases of somatic disabilities.

While undeniably a new phenomenon, somaesthetics, which by now forms the center of Shusterman's philosophical inquiries, has already influenced many scholars working in fields as diverse as philosophy, [[art education]], [[dance theory]], health and fitness studies.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the secondary literature listed above&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof '''Robert Craigie Cross''' [[FRSE]] CBE (1911-2000) was Regius Professor of Logic at [[Aberdeen University]]. He served as Vice Principal of the university 1974-78.

==Life==

He was born in [[Glasgow]] on 24 April 1911, the son of Matthew Cross, a schoolmaster, and Margaret Dickson.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dictionary of 20th Century British Philosophers: Robert Cross&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Dunbartonshire]]. He attended [[Glasgow University]] and graduated in 1932, winning the David Logan Medal for the most distinguished arts graduate. He was awarded the Foulis Scholarship and used this to attend [[Queen’s College, Oxford]] where he studied "Mods and Greats" under [[Oliver Franks, Baron Franks|Sir Oliver Franks]], focusing on philosophy and ancient history. In 1938 he became a Fellow at the College and began to tutor in Philosophy.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/cross_robert.pdf |first1=Robin |last1=Cameron |first2=Graham |last2=Bird |first3=Max |last3=Gasiin |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |title=Robert Craigie Cross |accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He as a recipient of the David Logan Medal for the most distinguished arts graduate and the Foulis Scholarship to Queen's College, Oxford.&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

Working in tandem with [[Wladek Bednarowski]], he helped redirect the courses in logic and philosophy.  There was a renewed emphasis on common sense and painstaking analysis, which tyified Oxford philosophy.

''[[Plato's Republic]]'' was his premier philosophical work.  It rendered its study "accessible and illuminating."  it became a standard text for students.&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

He served with distinction as Secretary of the Shipbuilding Trades Joint Council and the Admiralty Industrial Council, revealing administrative and diplomatic talents.&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

While teaching Aberdeen undergraduates, he helped to make more popular philosophy classes. "At the end of the 1950s Aberdeen differed from other Scottish universities, all of which had some philosophy compulsion, in the greater popularity, with considerably larger classes, of logic and metaphysics over moral philosophy. Cross's presence made a substantial contribution to that popularity."&lt;ref name="Cameron"/&gt;

After the war he returned to Oxford University until 1953 when he transferred to a chair, as Regius Professor of Logic, at [[Aberdeen University]], where he then rose to be Vice Principal. From 1965 to 1975 he served on the University Grants Committee.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1972.
He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1977. His proposers were [[Edward Maitland Wright]], [[Reginald Victor Jones]], [[Edwin Mervyn Patterson]], George M Burnett, and [[Malcolm Knox|Sir Thomas Malcolm Knox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Ediinburgh 1783-2002 |page=219 |accessdate=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired in 1978 and moved to the [[Scottish Borders]].  He died in [[Edinburgh]] on 13 September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095649774 |work=The Continuum Encyclopedia of British Philosophy |title=Robert Craigie Cross (1911—2000) |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=12 December 2015}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Roger Vernon Scruton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA|FRSL}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|r|uː|t|ən}}; born 27 February 1944) is an English [[philosopher]] and writer who specialises in [[aesthetics]] and [[political philosophy]], particularly in the furtherance of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist conservative]] views.&lt;ref name=Cowlingpxxix&gt;Cowling, Maurice. ''Mill and Liberalism'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990, xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, Mark; Hickson, Kevin. ''Conservative thinkers: The key contributors to the political thought of the modern Conservative Party'', Oxford University Press, 2013, 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor from 1982 to 2001 of ''[[The Salisbury Review]]'', a conservative political journal, Scruton has written over 50 books on philosophy, art, music, politics, literature, culture, sexuality, and religion; he has also written novels and two operas. His most notable publications include ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980), ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997), and ''[[How to Be a Conservative]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Roger Scruton bibliography]].&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a regular contributor to the popular media, including ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'', and the ''[[New Statesman]]''.

Scruton embraced conservatism after witnessing the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 student protests]] in France. From 1971 to 1992 he was a lecturer and professor of aesthetics at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], London, after which he held several part-time academic positions at the [[University of St Andrews|University of Oxford,]] the [[University of St Andrews]], as well as the position of Senior Fellow at the [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; He became known in the 1980s for helping to establish [[Jan Hus Educational Foundation|underground academic networks]] in Soviet-controlled [[Eastern Europe]], for which he was awarded the [[Czech Republic]]'s [[Medal of Merit (Czech Republic)|Medal of Merit]] (First Class) by President [[Václav Havel]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Barbara. ''The Velvet Philosophers'', London: The Claridge Press, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jJNYvDr8YBgC&amp;pg=PA281 281–282].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2016 Birthday Honours]] for "services to philosophy, teaching and public education".&lt;ref name=LondonGazette/&gt;

==Early life==
===Family background===
Scruton was born in [[Buslingthorpe, Lincolnshire|Buslingthorpe]], [[Lincolnshire]]&lt;ref name=born&gt;Cumming, Naomi. [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.50522 "Scruton, Roger"], ''Grove Music Online'', January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; to John "Jack" Scruton, a teacher from Manchester, and his wife, Beryl Claris Scruton (née Haynes), and was raised with his two sisters in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire|Marlow]] and [[High Wycombe]].&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt; The Scruton surname had been acquired relatively recently. Jack's father's birth certificate showed him as Matthew Lowe, after Matthew's mother, Margaret Lowe (Scruton's great grandmother); the document made no mention of a father. However, Margaret had decided, for reasons unknown, to raise her son as Matthew Scruton instead. Scruton wondered whether she had been employed at the former Scruton Hall in [[Scruton]], Yorkshire, and whether that was where her child had been conceived.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''England: An Elegy'', A&amp;C Black, 2001, 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack was raised in a [[Back-to-back house|back-to-back]] on Upper Cyrus Street, [[Ancoats]], an inner-city area of Manchester, and won a scholarship to Manchester High School,&lt;!--no indication as to which school this is--&gt; a [[grammar school]].&lt;ref&gt;''England: An Elegy'', 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton told ''The Guardian'' that Jack hated the upper classes and loved the countryside, while Beryl was fond of romantic fiction and entertaining "blue-rinsed friends".&lt;ref name=Wroe&gt;Wroe, Nicholas. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/28/politics "Thinking for England"], ''The Guardian'', 28 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He described his mother as "cherishing an ideal of gentlemanly conduct and social distinction that&amp;nbsp;... [his] father set out with considerable relish to destroy".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''Gentle Regrets: Thoughts From a Life''. Continuum, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wgtnHZE_6lwC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA11 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton lived with his parents, two sisters, and Sam the dog, in a [[pebbledashed]] semi-detached house in Hammersley Lane, [[High Wycombe]].&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gentlep89&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his parents had been brought up as Christians, they regarded themselves as humanists, so home was a "religion-free zone".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110225210343/http://spectator.org/archives/2009/03/10/the-new-humanism "The New Humanism"], ''American Spectator'', March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton's, indeed the whole family's, relationship with his father was difficult. He wrote in ''Gentle Regrets'': "Friends come and go, hobbies and holidays dabble the soulscape like fleeting sunlight in a summer wind, and the hunger for affection is cut off at every point by the fear of judgement."&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After passing his [[Eleven-plus|11-plus]], he attended the [[Royal Grammar School High Wycombe]] from 1954 to 1962.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''England: An Elegy'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt; He left school with three [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A-levels]], in pure and applied mathematics, physics and chemistry, which he passed with distinction. The results won him an open scholarship in natural sciences to [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], as well as a state scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgs.saund.co.uk/pdfs/1962-09-wycombiensian.pdf "Examination successes, 1961–62"], ''Wycombiensian'', 13(6), September 1962, 328–330.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton writes that he was expelled from the school shortly afterwards, when the headmaster found the school stage on fire, and a half-naked girl putting out the flames, during one of Scruton's plays.&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gentlep34&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt; When he told his family he had won a place at Cambridge, his father stopped speaking to him.&lt;ref name=Edemariam/&gt;

Having intended to study [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|natural sciences at Cambridge]]—where he felt "although socially estranged (like virtually every grammar-school boy), spiritually at home"—Scruton switched on the first day to moral sciences (philosophy).&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the quote, ''Gentle Regrets'', 34.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1965,&lt;ref name=about/&gt; then spent time overseas, some of it teaching at the [[University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour]] in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, where he met his first wife, Danielle Laffitte.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger; Dooley, Mark. ''Conversations with Roger Scruton''. London &amp; New York: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, 18, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 he began studying for his PhD at Jesus, then became a research fellow at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] (1969–1971), where he lived with Laffitte when she was not in France.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 18, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; It was while visiting her during the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 student protests]] in France that Scruton first embraced [[conservatism]]. He was in the [[Latin Quarter in Paris]], watching students overturn cars, smash windows and tear up cobblestones, and for the first time in his life "felt a surge of political anger":&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; I suddenly realised I was on the other side. What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous [[Marxist]] [[gobbledegook]]. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilization against these things. That's when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1970s–1980s==
===Birkbeck, first marriage===
[[File:Birkbeck College phototram.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Scruton taught at Birkbeck for 21 years.]]
Scruton was awarded his PhD in January 1973 for a thesis entitled "Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind", supervised by Michael Tanner and [[Elizabeth Anscombe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/244964 "Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind"], Apollo, University of Cambridge repository.&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis was the basis of his first book, ''Art and Imagination'' (1974), which was followed by ''The Aesthetics of Architecture'' (1979). From 1971 he taught philosophy at [[Birkbeck College]], London, a college that specializes in adult education and holds its classes in the evening.&lt;ref name=Gentlep39/&gt; Laffitte taught French at [[Putney High School]], and they lived together in a [[Harley Street]] apartment previously occupied by [[Delia Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1972 but divorced in 1979.&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;

Working at Birkbeck left Scruton's days free, so he used the time to study law at the [[Inns of Court School of Law]] (1974–1976) and was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in 1978; he never practised because he was unable to take a year off work to complete a [[pupillage]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100831023120/http://www.roger-scruton.com/rs-cv.html "About"], roger-scruton.com, archived 31 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 57; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birkbeck was known for its embrace of [[left-wing politics]]. Scruton has said he was the only conservative there, except for the woman who served meals in the [[Senior Common Room]].&lt;ref name=Gentlep39&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, along with [[Hugh Fraser (British politician)|Hugh Fraser]], [[Jonathan Aitken]] and [[John Casey (academic)|John Casey]], he became a founding member of the [[Conservative Philosophy Group]] dining club, which aimed to develop an intellectual basis for conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 45; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Hugh Thomas]] and the philosopher [[Anthony Quinton]] attended meetings, as did [[Margaret Thatcher]] before she became prime minister. She reportedly said during one meeting in 1975: "The other side have got an ideology they can test their policies against. We must have one as well."&lt;ref&gt;Young, Hugo. ''One of Us'', London: Pan Macmillan, 2013, 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton's academic career at Birkbeck was blighted by his conservatism, particularly by his third book, ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''The Meaning of Conservatism'', London: The Macmillan Press, and Totowa, NJ: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goss2006&gt;Goss, Maxwell. [http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles6/ScrutonConservative.php "The Joy of Conservatism: An Interview with Roger Scruton"], ''New Pantagruel'' (courtesy of orthodoxytoday.org), January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and later by his editorship of the conservative ''Salisbury Review''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 51; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''The Guardian'' that his colleagues at Birkbeck vilified him over the book.&lt;ref name=Edemariam/&gt; The Marxist philosopher [[Gerald Cohen]] of [[University College London]] reportedly refused to teach a seminar with Scruton, although they later became friends.&lt;ref name=SDp46&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued teaching at Birkbeck until 1992, first as a lecturer, by 1980 as [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]], and then as professor of aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Salisbury Review''===
[[File:Roger Scruton (2015), Prague.jpg|thumb|Scruton in Prague, 2015]]
In 1982 Scruton became founding editor of ''[[The Salisbury Review]]'', a journal championing traditional conservatism in opposition to [[Thatcherism]], which he edited until 2001.&lt;ref name=ScrutonSept212002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''Conservative Thoughts: Essays from the Salisbury Review'', London: The Claridge Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Review'' was set up by a group of Tories known as the Salisbury Group—founded in 1978 by Diana Spearman and [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury|Robert Gascoyne-Cecil]]&lt;ref&gt;Cowling 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_RjyJSr_z0C&amp;pg=PR29 xxix].&lt;/ref&gt;—with the involvement of the [[Peterhouse school of history|Peterhouse Right]]. The latter were conservatives associated with the Cambridge college, including [[Maurice Cowling]], [[David Watkin (historian)|David Watkin]] and the mathematician Adrian Mathias.&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Peterhouse Right (he calls it the Peterhouse Group) and ''The Salisbury Review'', see Haseler, Stephen. ''The battle for Britain: Thatcher and the New Liberals'', London: I.B. Tauris, 1989, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_vPwkkJUA6IC&amp;pg=PA138 138]; ''Gentle Regrets'', 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton wrote that editing ''The Salisbury Review'' effectively ended his academic career in the United Kingdom. The magazine sought to provide an intellectual basis for conservatism, and was highly critical of key issues of the period, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, egalitarianism, feminism, foreign aid, multiculturalism and modernism. To begin with, Scruton had to write most of the articles himself, using pseudonyms: "I had to make it look as though there was something there in order that  ''there should be something there!''"&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that the ''Review'' "helped a new generation of conservative intellectuals to emerge. At last it was possible to be a conservative and also to the ''left'' of something, to say 'Of course, the ''Salisbury Review'' is beyond the pale; but&amp;nbsp;...'"&lt;ref name=Gentlep59&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 the ''Review'' published a controversial article by [[Ray Honeyford]], a headmaster in Bradford, questioning the benefits of multicultural education.&lt;ref&gt;Honeyford, Ray. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3654888/Education-and-Race-an-Alternative-View.html "Education and Race—an Alternative View"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 27 August 2006 (reprint of Honeyford's 1984 article).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger.

&lt;blockquote&gt; It cost me many thousand hours of unpaid labour, a hideous character assassination in ''[[Private Eye]]'', three lawsuits, two interrogations, one expulsion, the loss of a university career in Britain, unendingly contemptuous reviews, Tory suspicion, and the hatred of decent liberals everywhere.

===Writing===
The 1980s established Scruton as a prolific writer. Thirteen of his non-fiction works appeared between 1980 and 1989, as did first novel, ''Fortnight's Anger'' (1981). The most contentious publication was ''[[Thinkers of the New Left]]'' (1985), a collection of his essays from ''The Salisbury Review'', which criticized 14 prominent intellectuals, including [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].{{efn|The subjects of ''[[Thinkers of the New Left]]'' are [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[R. D. Laing]], [[Raymond Williams]], [[Rudolf Bahro]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Perry Anderson]], [[György Lukács]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].}} According to ''The Guardian'', the book was [[Remaindered book|remaindered]] after being greeted with "derision and outrage". Scruton said he became very depressed by the criticism.&lt;ref name=Adams2015&gt;Adams, Tim. [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/04/roger-scruton-my-father-looked-like-jeremy-corbyn-fools-frauds-firebrands-interview "Roger Scruton: 'Funnily enough, my father looked very like Jeremy Corbyn'"], ''The Guardian'', 4 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 he founded his own publisher, The Claridge Press, which he sold to the [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"The Claridge Press and Continuum", ''The Salisbury Review'', 21–22, 2002, 56: "The Continuum International Publishing Group is delighted to announce the acquisition of the small, independent publishing house Claridge Press from its proprietor, the philosopher, Professor Roger Scruton."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090709070236/http://www.aei.org/scholar/100052 "Roger Scruton"], American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 9 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983 to 1986 he wrote a weekly column for ''The Times''. Topics included music, wine and motorbike repair, but others were contentious. The features editor, [[Peter Stothard]], said that no one he had ever commissioned had "provoked more rage". Scruton made fun of anti-racism and the peace movement, and his support for [[Margaret Thatcher]] while she was prime minister was regarded, he wrote, as an "act of betrayal for a university teacher". His first column, "The Virtue of Irrelevance", argued that universities were destroying education "by making it relevant": "Replace pure by applied mathematics, logic by computer programming, architecture by engineering, history by sociology: the result will be a new generation of well-informed philistines, whose charmlessness will undo every advantage which their learning might otherwise have conferred."&lt;ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p50&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stothard, Peter.

===Activism in Central Europe===
[[File:Roger Scruton, Budapest, September 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Scruton on "Europe and the Conservative Cause", Budapest, September 2016]]
From 1979 to 1989, Scruton was an active supporter of [[dissident]]s in [[Czechoslovakia]] under [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] rule, forging links between the country's dissident academics and their counterparts in Western universities. As part of the [[Jan Hus Educational Foundation]], he and other academics visited [[Prague]] and [[Brno]], now in the [[Czech Republic]], in support of an underground education network started by the Czech dissident [[Julius Tomin]], smuggling in books, organizing lectures, and eventually arranging for students to study for a Cambridge external degree in theology (the only faculty that responded to the request for help). There were structured courses, ''[[samizdat]]'' translations, books were printed, and people sat exams in a cellar with papers smuggled out through the diplomatic bag.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, David.

Scruton was detained in 1985 in Brno before being expelled from the country. The Czech dissident [[:cs:Bronislava Müllerová|Bronislava Müllerová]] watched him walk across the border with Austria: "There was this broad empty space between the two border posts, absolutely empty, not a single human being in sight except for one soldier, and across that broad empty space trudged an English philosopher, Roger Scruton, with his little bag into Austria."&lt;ref&gt;Day 1999, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June that year, he was placed on the Index of Undesirable Persons. He writes that he was also followed during visits to Poland and Hungary.&lt;ref name=Day1999p281/&gt;

For his work in supporting dissidents, Scruton was awarded the First of June Prize in 1993 by the Czech city of [[Plzeň]], and in 1998 he was awarded the Czech Republic's [[Medal of Merit (Czech Republic)|Medal of Merit]] (First Class) by President [[Václav Havel]].&lt;ref name=Day1999p281&gt;Day 1999, 281–282; ''Gentle Regrets'', 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton has been strongly critical of figures in the West—in particular [[Eric Hobsbawm]]—who "chose to exonerate" former communist regimes' crimes and atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-05/local/me-2147_1_communist-party |title=The Day of Reckoning for the Apologists: Western collaborators with Soviet communism must be held accountable |work=Los Angeles Times|date=18 February 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; His experience of dissident intellectual life in 1980s Communist Prague is recorded in fictional form in his novel ''[[Notes from Underground (Scruton novel)|Notes from Underground]]'' (2014).{{fact|date=November 2017}}

==1990s–2000s==
===Farm purchase, second marriage===
[[File:Albany Courtyard.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Scruton rented an apartment in the [[Albany (London)|Albany]]; the rooms had previously been [[Alan Clark]]'s [[servants' quarters]].]]
Scruton took a year's [[sabbatical]] from Birkbeck in 1990 and spent it working in Brno in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=SDp109&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 109–112.&lt;/ref&gt; That year he registered Central European Consulting, established to offer business advice in post-communist [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name=companyinterests&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100902062543/http://www.roger-scruton.com/rs-business.html "Company interests"], roger-scruton.com, accessed 2 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He had been living in an apartment in [[Notting Hill Gate]], which he sold, and when he returned to England rented a cottage in [[Stanton Fitzwarren]], Swindon, from [[the Moonies]] and an apartment in the [[Albany (London)|Albany]] building on [[Piccadilly]], London, from [[Alan Clark]] (it had been Clark's [[servants' quarters]]).&lt;ref name=Wroe/&gt;&lt;ref name=SDp109/&gt;

From 1992 to 1995 he lived in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], teaching an elementary philosophy course and a graduate course on the [[philosophy of music]] for one semester a year, as professor of philosophy at [[Boston University]]. Two of his books grew out of these courses: ''Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey'' (1994) and ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997). In 1993 he bought Sunday Hill Farm in [[Brinkworth, Wiltshire|Brinkworth]], [[Wiltshire]]—35 acres, later increased to 100, and a 250-year-old farmhouse—where he lived after returning from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016.&lt;!--add page number--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ross1998&gt;Ross, Deborah.

While in Boston, Scruton had flown back to England every weekend to indulge his passion for [[fox hunting]],&lt;ref&gt;''On Hunting'', 1998; Scruton and Dooley 2016, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was during a meet of the [[Duke of Beaufort's Hunt|Beaufort Hunt]] that he met Sophie Jeffreys, an architectural historian.

===Tobacco company funding===
Scruton was criticized in 2002 for having written articles about [[smoking]] without disclosing that he was receiving a regular fee from [[Japan Tobacco International]] (JTI) (formerly [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]]).&lt;ref name=Gilmore2004/&gt; In 1999 he and his wife—as part of their consultancy work for Horshells Farm Enterprises&lt;ref name=companyinterests/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scruton28Jan2002/&gt;—began producing a quarterly briefing paper, ''The Risk of Freedom Briefing'' (1999–2007), about the state's control of risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120114207/http://www.riskoffreedom.com/archive.php ''The Risk of Freedom Briefing''], 2000–2006, accessed 11 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed to journalists, the paper included discussions about drugs, alcohol and tobacco, and was sponsored by JTI.&lt;ref name=Scruton28Jan2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p141&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 140–143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Scruton |first=Roger |date= 16 February 2002|title=Smoke Without Fire |url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/16th-february-2002/24/smoke-without-fire |magazine=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton wrote several articles in defence of smoking around this time, including one for ''The Times'',&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger.

The tobacco controversy damaged Scruton's consultancy business in England. In part because of that, and because the [[Hunting Act 2004]] had banned fox hunting in England and Wales, the Scrutons considered moving to the United States permanently, and in 2004 they purchased [[Montpelier (Sperryville, Virginia)|Montpelier]], an 18th-century [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation house]] near [[Sperryville, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 181, 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton set up a company, Montpelier Strategy LLC, to promote the house as a venue for weddings and similar.&lt;ref name=companyinterests/&gt; The couple lived there while retaining Sunday Hill Farm, but decided in 2009 against a permanent move to the United States and sold the house.&lt;ref name=ScrutonDooley2016p192&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 192–193; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110207060237/http://web.mac.com/rogerandsophie/iWeb/Site/Welcome.html "Welcome to Montpelier in Rappahannock County, Virginia"], web.mac.com/rogerandsophie.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton held several part-time academic positions during this period. From 2005 to 2009 he was research professor at the [[Institute for the Psychological Sciences]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], a graduate school of [[Divine Mercy University]], and in 2009 he worked at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in Washington, D.C., where he wrote his book ''Green Philosophy'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Scruton and Dooley 2016, 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wine, opera===
From 2001 to 2009 Scruton wrote a wine column for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', and made contributions to ''[[The World of Fine Wine]]'' and ''Questions of Taste: The Philosophy of Wine'' (2007), with his essay "The Philosophy of Wine". His book ''I Drink Therefore I am: A Philosopher's Guide to Wine'' (2009) in part comprises material from his ''New Statesman'' column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Anthony Quinn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/20/drink-therefore-am-roger-scruton |title=I Drink Therefore I Am by Roger Scruton |work=The Guardian |date=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/roger_scruton |title=Roger Scruton |work=New Statesman |date= |accessdate=9 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920083059/http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/roger_scruton |archivedate=20 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scrutons returned from the United States to make their home again at Sunday Hill Farm in Wiltshire.

== Philosophical and political views ==
===Aesthetics===
Scruton has specialised in [[aesthetics]] throughout his career. From 1971 to 1992 he taught aesthetics at Birkbeck College. His PhD thesis formed the basis of his first book, ''Art and Imagination'' (1974), in which he argued that "what demarcates aesthetic interest from other sorts is that it involves the appreciation of something for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pjaesthetics.org/index.php/pjaesthetics/article/view/12/11 |title=Imagination, Attitude and Experience in Aesthetic Judgement|first=Cain|last=Samuel Todd|work=Postgraduate Journal of Aesthetics|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then Scruton has published ''The Aesthetics of Architecture'' (1979), ''The Aesthetic Understanding'' (1983 and 1997), ''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997), and ''Beauty'' (2010). In 2008 a two-day conference was held at [[Durham University]] to assess his impact in the field, and in 2012 a collection of essays, ''Scruton's Aesthetics'', was published by Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/philosophy/events/conferences/scrutonaesthetics/ "Scruton's Aesthetics"], Department of Philosophy, Durham University, 6 November 2012; Hamilton, Andy; Zangwill, Nick. ''Scruton's Aesthetics'', London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[Intelligence Squared]] debate in March 2009, Scruton (seconding historian [[David Starkey]]) proposed the motion: "Britain has become indifferent to beauty" by holding an image of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' next to one of the supermodel [[Kate Moss]].&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, Stephen. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/mar/22/national-trust-intelligence-squad "Has Britain become indifferent to beauty?], ''The Guardian'', 22 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year Scruton wrote and presented a [[BBC Two]] documentary, ''[[Why Beauty Matters]]'', in which he argued that beauty should be restored to its traditional position in art, architecture and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p6tsd |title=Why Beauty Matters |publisher=BBC |date=28 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that he had received "more than 500 e-mails from viewers, all but one saying, 'Thank Heavens someone is saying what needs to be said'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scruton |first=Roger |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2010/05/17/on-defending-beauty |title=On Defending Beauty |work=The American Spectator |date=May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519110549/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/05/17/on-defending-beauty |archivedate=19 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton has argued that a belief in God makes for more beautiful architecture.  He wrote "Who can doubt, on visiting Venice, that this abundant flower of aesthetic endeavour was rooted in faith and watered by penitential tears? Surely, if we want to build settlements today we should heed the lesson of Venice. We should begin with an act of consecration, since we thereby put down the real roots of a community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2018/11/17/only-religion-could-have-inspired-the-beauties-of-venice/|title=Only religion could have inspired the beauties of Venice {{!}} Catholic Herald|date=2018-11-17|work=Catholic Herald|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for conservatism===
{{Conservatism sidebar}}
Scruton is best known for his writing in support of conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Samuel. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/04/21/enemies-of-roger-scruton/ "The Enemies of Roger Scruton"], ''New York Review of Books'', 21 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; His second book, ''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980)—which he called "a somewhat [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] defence of Tory values in the face of their betrayal by the free marketeers"&lt;ref name=Scruton2005p51&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 51.&lt;/ref&gt;—was responsible, he said, for blighting his academic career.&lt;ref name=Edemariam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Jesse. [http://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/09/how-to-be-a-conservative-by-roger-scruton-book-review/ "Passion, authority and the odd mini-rant: Scruton’s conservative vision"], ''The Spectator'', 27 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in ''Gentle Regrets'' (2005) that he found several of [[Edmund Burke]]'s arguments in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) persuasive. Although Burke was writing about revolution, not socialism, Scruton was persuaded that, as he put it, the utopian promises of socialism are accompanied by an abstract vision of the mind that bears little relation to the way most people think. Burke also convinced him that there is no direction to history, no moral or spiritual progress; that people think collectively toward a common goal only during crises such as war, and that trying to organize society this way requires a real or imagined enemy; hence, Scruton wrote, the strident tone of socialist literature.&lt;ref name=Regretsp40/&gt;

Scruton further argued, following Burke, that society is held together by authority and the [[rule of law]], in the sense of the right to obedience, not by the imagined rights of citizens. Obedience, he wrote, is "the prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them, and without which societies crumble into 'the dust and powder of individuality'". Real freedom, Scruton wrote, does not stand in conflict with obedience, but is its other side.&lt;ref name=Regretsp40&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also persuaded by Burke's arguments about the [[social contract]], including that most parties to the contract are either dead or not yet born. To forget this, he wrote—to throw away customs and institutions—is to "place the present members of society in a dictatorial dominance over those who went before, and those who came after them".&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton argued that beliefs that appear to be examples of prejudice may be useful and important: "our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable, from our own perspective, and the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss." A prejudice in favour of [[modesty]] in women and [[chivalry]] in men, for example, may aid the stability of sexual relationships and the raising of children, although these are not offered as reasons in support of the prejudice. It may therefore be easy to show the prejudice as irrational, but there will be a loss nonetheless if it is discarded.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentle Regrets'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton has been critical of the contemporary [[Feminism|feminist]] movement, while reserving praise for suffragists such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].&lt;ref name=Edemariam/&gt;

[[File:Nexus Masterclass Roger Scruton, November 2015.webm|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Scruton discussing the [[European Union]] and the [[nation state]], November 2015]]
In ''Arguments for Conservatism'' (2006), he marked out the areas in which philosophical thinking is required if conservatism is to be intellectually persuasive. He argued that human beings are creatures of limited and local affections. Territorial loyalty is at the root of all forms of government where law and liberty reign supreme; every expansion of jurisdiction beyond the frontiers of the nation state leads to a decline in accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''A Political Philosophy: Arguments for Conservatism'', London: Bloomsbury, 2006, 3, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He opposed elevating the "nation" above its people, which would threaten rather than facilitate citizenship and peace. "Conservatism and conservation" are two aspects of a single policy, that of husbanding resources, including the [[social capital]] embodied in laws, customs and institutions, and the material capital contained in the environment. He argued further that the law should not be used as a weapon to advance special interests. People impatient for reform—for example in the areas of [[euthanasia]] or [[abortion]]—are reluctant to accept what may be "glaringly obvious to others—that the law exists precisely to impede their ambitions".&lt;ref&gt;''Arguments for Conservatism'', 15, 34, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

He defined [[post-modernism]] as the claim that there are no grounds for truth, objectivity, and meaning, and therefore conflicts between views are nothing more than contests of power, and argued that, while the West is required to judge other cultures in their own terms, Western culture is adversely judged as ethnocentric and racist. He wrote: "The very reasoning which sets out to destroy the ideas of objective truth and absolute value imposes political correctness as absolutely binding, and cultural relativism as objectively true."&lt;ref&gt;''Arguments for Conservatism'', 106, 115, 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and totalitarianism===
Scruton contends, following [[Immanuel Kant]], that human beings have a transcendental dimension, a sacred core exhibited in their capacity for [[self-reflection]].&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, Mark. ''Roger Scruton: The Philosopher on Dover Beach''. Continuum, 2009, 12, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that we are in an era of secularization without precedent in the history of the world; writers and artists such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]] "devoted much energy to recuperating the experience of the sacred—but as a private rather than a public form of consciousness." Because these thinkers directed their art at the few, he writes, it has never appealed to the many.&lt;ref name=Arguments142&gt;''Arguments for Conservatism'', 142–143, 146–147, 150–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

He defines totalitarianism as the absence of any constraint on central authority, with every aspect of life the concern of government. Advocates of totalitarianism feed on resentment, Scruton argues, and having seized power they proceed to abolish institutions—such as the law, property, and religion—that create authorities. Scruton writes, "To the resentful it is these institutions that are the cause of inequality, and therefore the cause of their humiliations and failures." He argues that revolutions are not conducted from below by the people, but from above, in the name of the people, by an aspiring elite.&lt;ref name=Arguments142/&gt;

Scruton suggests that the importance of [[Newspeak]] in totalitarian societies is that the power of language to describe reality is replaced by language whose purpose is to avoid encounters with realities. He agrees with [[Alain Besançon]] that the totalitarian society envisaged by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) can be only understood in theological terms, as a society founded on a transcendental negation. In accordance with T. S. Eliot, Scruton believes that true originality is only possible within a tradition, and that it is precisely in modern conditions—conditions of fragmentation, heresy, and unbelief—that the conservative project acquires its sense.&lt;ref&gt;''Arguments for Conservatism'', 162–163, 182, 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton considers that religion plays a basic function in "endarkening" human minds. "Endarkenment" is Scruton's way of describing the process of socialization through which certain behaviours and choices are closed off and forbidden to the subject, which he considers necessary to curb socially damaging impulses and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, P. "Endarkening the mind: Roger Scruton and the power of law", ''Social &amp; Legal Studies'', 6(1), 1997, 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stafford1991/&gt; Scruton himself is an [[Anglican]], who authored ''Our Church: A Personal History of the Church of England'', defending the relevance of the [[Church of England]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

On the matter of evidence of God's existence, Scruton has said, "Rational argument can get us just so far...It can help us to understand the real difference between a faith that commands us to forgive our enemies, and one that commands us to slaughter them. But the leap of faith itself — this placing of your life at God's service — is a leap over reason's edge. This does not make it irrational, any more than falling in love is irrational."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/science/sc0078.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite claiming that belief alone is sufficiently rational, he has advocated a form of the [[argument from beauty]]: he has said that when we take the beauty in the natural world around us as a gift, we are able to openly understand God. The beauty speaks to us, he claims, and from it we can understand God's presence around us.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/17/roger-scruton-kindly-atheists&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
Scruton's ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986) has been described as "the most interesting and insightful philosophical account of sexual desire" produced within [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamilton|first1=Christopher |last2=Soble|first2=Alan, Editor |last3=Power|first3=Nicholas P., Editor |title=The Philosophy of Sex: Contemporary Readings, Fifth Edition |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location=Lanham, Maryland |year=2008 |page=101 |isbn=0742547981 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a challenge to the conventional boundaries of that discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Janaway|first1=Christopher |last2=Honderich|first2=Ted, Editor |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=816 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has influenced subsequent discussions of sexual ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnhill|first1=Anne |last2=Crasnow|first2=Sharon L., Editor |last3=Superson|first3=Anita M., Editor |title=Out from the Shadows: Analytical Feminist Contributions to Traditional Philosophy |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |year=2012 |pages=115–116 |isbn=978-0199855476 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Plaxton|first1=Michael |title=Implied Consent and Sexual Assault: Intimate Relationships, Autonomy, and Voice |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]] |location=Montreal |year=2015 |pages=221, 223 |isbn=978-0773546202 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] credited Scruton with providing "the most interesting philosophical attempt as yet to work through the moral issues involved in our treatment of persons as sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nussbaum|first1=Martha |last2=Soble|first2=Alan, Editor |title=The Philosophy of Sex, Contemporary Readings, Third Edition |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location=Oxford |year=1997 |page=293 |isbn=0-8476-8481-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social theorist [[Jonathan Dollimore]] writes that Scruton bases a conservative sexual ethic on the Hegelian proposition that "the final end of every rational being is the building of the self", which involves recognizing the other as an end in itself.&lt;ref name=Dollimore260&gt;[[Dollimore, Jonathan]]. ''Sexual Dissidence: Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault''. Oxford University Press, 1991, 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay, "Sexual morality and the liberal consensus" (1989), Scruton argues that [[homosexuality]] is a perversion because the body of the homosexual's lover belongs to the same category as his own.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. ''The Philosopher on Dover Beach''. Carcanet Press Limited, 1990, 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton argued further that gays have no children and consequently no interest in creating a socially stable future. He therefore considered it justified to "instil in our children feelings of revulsion" towards homosexuality,&lt;ref name=Stafford1991&gt;Stafford, J. Martin. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00372432 "The two minds of Roger Scruton"], ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', 11(2), 1991, 187–193. {{doi|10.1007/BF00372432}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 he challenged the idea that gays should have the right to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3636798/This-right-for-gays-is-an-injustice-to-children.html "This 'right' for gays is an injustice to children"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 28 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Scruton told ''The Guardian'' in 2010 that he would no longer defend the view that revulsion against homosexuality can be justified.&lt;ref name=Edemariam&gt;Edemariam, Aida. [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jun/05/roger-scruton-interview "Roger Scruton: A pessimist's guide to life"], ''The Guardian'', 5 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal rights===
[[File:Roger Scruton, September 2002.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Roger Scruton]]: rights imply obligations.]]

Scruton argues that rights imply obligations. Every legal privilege, he writes, imposes a burden on the one who does not possess that privilege: that is, "your right may be my duty." Scruton therefore regards the emergence of the animal rights movement as "the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview", because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species.&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt;

He accuses animal rights advocates of "pre-scientific" [[anthropomorphism]], attributing traits to animals that are, he says, [[Beatrix Potter]]-like, where "only man is vile." It is within this fiction that the appeal of animal rights lies, he argues. The world of animals is non-judgmental, filled with dogs who return our affection almost no matter what we do to them, and cats who pretend to be affectionate when, in fact, they care only about themselves. It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape.&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html "Animal Rights"], ''City Journal'', summer 2000.
*Scruton (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton singled out [[Peter Singer]], a prominent Australian philosopher and animal-rights activist, for criticism. He wrote that Singer's works, including ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), "contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals."&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html "Animal Rights"], ''City Journal'', summer 2000.
*Scruton (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===English independence===
Scruton supports [[English independence]] because he believes that it would uphold friendship between [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]]; [[Northern Ireland]] and because the English would have a say in all matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26173128|title= A Point of View: Should the English have a say on Scottish independence?|date= 23 February 2014|publisher= BBC News|quote= I would vote for English independence, as a step towards strengthening the friendship between our countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shlomit C. Schuster''' ({{lang-he|שוסטר שלומית {{lrm}}}}; born 19 July 1951 in [[Suriname]] and died 15 Feb 2016 in [[Israel]]) was an Israeli Philosophical Counselor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://npcassoc.org/in-memoriam-dr-shlomit-c-schuster/|title=In Memoriam: Dr. Shlomit C. Schuster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered a pioneer in the [[Philosophical counseling]] field.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.facebook.com/groups/177645392279868?view=permalink&amp;id=1135964659781265&lt;/ref&gt; Her first book is considered a source of learning and teaching [[Philosophical counseling]] .&lt;ref name="Philosophy Practice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=D5280C|title=Philosophy Practice|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuster was born in [[Suriname]] on 19 July 1951. She immigrated to Israel in 1976 and started philosophy academic studies in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

Schuster got to the [[philosophical practice]] field following  a newspaper article. She trained under the Dutch philosophical counselor Ad Hoogendijk, a colleague of [[Gerd B. Achenbach]]. In 1989 she opened the [[philosophical practice]] center in Israel, "Center Sophon" in Jerusalem. In 1990 she opened the philosophical First-Aid Line, "Philosophone", for persons with existential problems and ethical challenges. In 2000 she received her Ph.D. degree. Her thesis, conducted by [[Marcel-Jacques Dubois]] and Maurice S. Friedman, described the life of central philosophers in order to find ways to help people by their autobiography.&lt;ref name="abc-clio.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=D5252C|title=The Philosopher's Autobiography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was an Editorial board member of the Journal of Radical Psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radicalpsychology.org/Info.html|title=Radical Psychology Editors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the International Journal for Philosophical Practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://npcassoc.org/journal/editors/|title=Editorial Board - NPCA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Journal of Humanities Therapy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ht21c.org/page/page.php/22|title=Humanities Therapy Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in Jerusalem on 15 February 2016, after a serious illness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33940">'''Syntactic bootstrapping''' is a theory in developmental psycholinguistics and language acquistion which proposes that children learn word meanings by recognizing syntactic categories (such as nouns, adjectives, etc.) and the structure of their language. It is proposed that children have innate knowledge of the links between syntactic and [[Semantics|semantic]] categories and can use these observations to make inferences about word meaning. Learning words in one's native language can be challenging because the extralinguistic context of use does not give specific enough information about word meanings.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23–64|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in addition to extralinguistic cues, conclusions about syntactic categories are made &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|year=1990|title=The Structural Sources of Verb Meaning.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED335884|journal=Language Acquisition|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–55|via=|doi=10.1207/s15327817la0101_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then lead to inferences about a word's meaning. This theory aims to explain the acquisition of lexical categories such as verbs, nouns, etc. and functional categories such as case markers, determiners, etc.

==History==

One of the earliest demonstrations of the existence of syntactic bootstrapping is an experiment done by [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Roger W.|title=Linguistic determinism and the part of speech.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/h0041199|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1037/h0041199|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his research, Brown demonstrated that preschool-aged children could use their knowledge of different parts of speech to distinguish the meaning of nonsense words in English. The results of Brown’s experiment provided the first evidence showing that children could use syntax to infer meaning for newly encountered words and that they acquired grammar and semantics simultaneously. Brown's experiment was the beginning of the framework needed in order for the theory to thrive.

This led developmental psycholinguists like [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]], who coined the term syntactic bootstrapping in 1990,&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; to argue that syntax was pivotal for language learning, as it also gives a learner clues about [[semantics]]. According to Gleitman's hypothesis, verbs are learned with a delay compared to other parts of speech because the linguistic information that supports their acquisition is not available during the early stages of language acquisition.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The acquisition of verb meaning in children is pivotal to their language development. Syntactic bootstrapping seeks to explain how children acquire these words.

== Logic and evidence ==
The syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis is based on the idea that there are universal/innate links between syntactic categories and semantic categories. Learners can therefore use their observations about the syntactic categories of novel words to make inferences about their meanings. This hypothesis is intended to solve the problem that the extralinguistic context is uninformative by itself to make conclusions about a novel word's meaning.

For example, a child hears the sentence, “The cat meeped the bird.” If the child is familiar with the way arguments of verbs interact with the verb, he will infer that "the cat" is the agent and that "the bird" is the patient. Then, he can use these syntactic observations to infer that "meep" is a behaviour that the cat is doing to the bird.

Children's ability to identify syntactic categories may be supported by [[Prosodic bootstrapping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gervain|first=J.|last2=Nespor|first2=M.|last3=Mazuka|first3=R.|last4=Horie|first4=R.|last5=Mehler|first5=J.|year=2008|title=Bootstrapping word order in prelexical infants: A Japanese-Italian cross-linguistic study.|url=https://www.sissa.it/cns/Articles/Gervainetal08.pdf|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=57|pages=56–74|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosodic bootstrapping is the hypothesis that children use prosodic cues, such as intonation and stress, to identify word boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707263897|title=Introduction to psycholinguistics : understanding language science|last=J.|first=Traxler, Matthew|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=|isbn=9781405198622|edition=1st ed|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=335|oclc=707263897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensitivity to syntactic categories ===

Landau and Gleitman (1985) found when studying the acquisition of the verbs ''look'' and ''see'' by blind children that contextual clues appeared to be insufficient to explain their ability to differentiate these verbs &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language and Experience: Evidence from the Blind Child|last=Landau|first=Barbara|last2=Gleitman|first2=Lila|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-674-51025-9|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=120–156|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''  They considered the possibility that perceptual verbs might be used more by the blind child's mother when talking about nearby objects, since the child had to touch objects to perceive them. An analysis of the mother's utterances however, found this not to be the case.

The solution investigated by Gleitman et al. was that syntactic categories (referred to as 'Sentence Frames' by Gleitman), narrow down the contexts in which verbs are present, allowing children to learn their specific meanings in isolation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Acquisition of Syntactic Structure|last=Becker|first=Misha|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-00784-0|location=New York|pages=186-187}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This narrowing provided evidence for their original hypothesis. When utterances that selected for ''perception verbs only'' were analyzed, the mother's use of the verbs ''look'' and ''see'' for nearby objects increased significantly. Gleitman concluded that a narrowing of contexts, ''then'' contextual support were required for the blind children to learn verbs (in which they had no direct experience). By proxy, since there are many verbs that sighted children do not have direct experience with, they must use the same mechanism as well.

Waxman and Booth (2001) found that children who heard nouns focused on the object categories and children who focused on adjectives focused on an object's properties and categories. This shows that children are sensitive to different syntactic categories and can use their observations of syntax to infer word meaning.

=== Sensitivity to syntactic framing ===
In Roger Brown’s 1957 experiment, children between the ages of three and five were shown various pictures depicting nonsense words that represented either singular nouns, [[mass nounc|mass nouns]], [[count noun]]s or verbs. When the novel words were positioned in a question format, the children were able to use the placement of the novel word in the sentence to draw conclusions focus on different aspects of the image shown and adjusted their answer. For example, when Brown wanted the child to identify a mass noun, he would ask the children "do you see any sib", and the child would point at the pictured mass noun or noun indicating quantity. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Mass noun environment|| ''Do you see any '''sib'''?''
|-
| Verb environment|| ''What is '''sib'''bing?''
|-
| Singular noun environment || ''Do you see a '''sib'''?''
|}
When children made guesses, they were correct more than half of the time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Roger W.|title=Linguistic determinism and the part of speech.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0041199|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1037/h0041199|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that children are sensitive to the syntactic position of words, and can correctly associate a novel word with its syntactic category.

Harrigan, Hacquard, and Lidz (2016) &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrigan|first=Kaitlyn|last2=Hacquard|first2=V.|last3=Lidz|first3=J.|year=2016|title=Syntactic Bootstrapping in the Acquisition of Attitude Verbs: think, want and hope|journal=In Proceedings of WCCFL|volume=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Found that children's interpretation of a new attitude verb depended on the [[Subcategorization|syntactic frame]] in which it was introduced. In the experiment, children who heard the word 'hope' presented in the same syntactic frame as 'want' (i.e. followed by an infinitival verb) connected the new verb 'hope' with a meaning of desire. On the other hand, those that heard 'hope' presented in the same frame as 'think' (i.e. followed by a finite verb) made no such association between desire and the new verb, instead of associating the novel verb with belief. This provides evidence that children use syntax to some extent in learning the meaning behind these sorts of abstract verbs.

Papafragou, Cassidy, Gleitman (2007) &lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papafragou|first=Anna|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Gleitman|first3=Lila R.|date=2007|year=|title=When we think about thinking: The acquisition of belief verbs|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=105|pages=125–165|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.09.008|pmc=2768311}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Participants were asked to identify verbs within the context of a video. Papafragou et al. had children watch 12 videotaped stories. 4 stories about the subject's desires and 8 stories that varied in the subject's beliefs and the framing of a novel verb. At the end of the tape, they would hear a sentence describing the scene but the sentence's verb was replaced with a novel word. Children were asked to respond with what they thought the word meant. Their responses were categorized 4 ways: Action, Belief, Desire, and Other. They found that action words were easily interpreted by children. However, false belief scenes with the complementizer phrase caused for children to respond with belief words more often. Results showed that participants in the experiment identified the verb most accurately when they could use both the video and sentence contexts. When it comes to attitude verbs, children are sensitive to the syntactic framing of the verb in question.

Wellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wellwood|first=Alexis|last2=Gagliardi|first2=Annie|last3=Lidz|first3=Jeffrey|date=2016-07-02|title=Syntactic and Lexical Inference in the Acquisition of Novel Superlatives|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15475441.2015.1052878|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=12|issue=3|pages=262–279|doi=10.1080/15475441.2015.1052878|issn=1547-5441}}&lt;/ref&gt;— showed that four-year-olds can understand the difference between a quantitative or qualitative word, based on its syntactic position within a sentence. In “Gleebest of the cows are by the barn,” the novel word “gleebest” is in a determiner position, and is inferred to mean “most” or “many.” In “the gleebest cows are by the barn,” “gleebest” is in an adjective position, and children infer it to mean “spotty” or another quality. These results are significant because they show children using syntax to understand word meanings.

(1999) study&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillette|first=J.|last2=Gleitman|first2=H.|last3=Gleitman|first3=L.|last4=Lederer|first4=A.|date=1999-12-07|title=Human simulations of vocabulary learning|journal=Cognition|volume=73|issue=2|pages=135–176|issn=0010-0277|pmid=10580161|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(99)00036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;—, the researchers tested adults to see what difficulties they would face when asked to identify a word from a muted, videotaped scene. They found that adults had trouble identifying the word, especially verbs, when they could only refer to the scene.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Their performance increased once they were given the syntactic context for the mystery word. These results indicate that word learning is aided by the presence of syntactic context.

==Acquiring lexical categories==

=== Acquiring verbs ===
Gillette et al. (1999) performed experiments which found that participants who were provided both environmental and syntactic contexts were better able to infer what muted word was uttered at a particular point in a video than when only the environmental context was provided.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; In the experiment, participants were shown muted videos of a mother and infant playing. At a particular point in the video, a beep would sound and participants had to guess what word the beep stood for. It was always a verb or noun. Experimental results showed that participants were correct on identifying nouns more often than verbs. This shows that certain contexts are conducive to learning certain categories of words, like nouns, while the same context is not conducive to learning other categories, like verbs. However, when the scene was paired with a sentence containing all novel words, but the same syntactic structure as the original sentence, adults were better able to guess the verb. This shows that syntactic context is useful in the acquisition of verbs.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

An early demonstration by Naigles (1990) of syntactic bootstrapping involved showing 2-year-olds a video of a duck using its left hand to push a rabbit down into a [[squatting position]] while both the animals wave their right arms in circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naigles|first1=L.|title=Children Use Syntax to Learn Verb Meaning|journal=Journal of Child Language|date=1990|volume=17|pages=357–374|doi=10.1017/S0305000900013817}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

 '''Initial video''': Duck uses left hand to push rabbit into squatting position while both animals wave their right arms in circles

During the video, children are presented with one of the following two descriptions:

 (6) '''Utterance A''': ''The duck is '''kradding''' the rabbit.''
     (describes a situation where the duck does something to the rabbit)
 (7) '''Utterance B''': ''The rabbit and duck are '''kradding'''.''
     (describes a situation where the duck and the rabbit perform the same action)

Children were then presented two distinct follow-up videos.

 '''Follow-up video 1''': the duck pushing the rabbit
 '''Follow-up video 2''': the duck and the rabbit are both waving their arms in the air.

When instructed to "find kradding", children looked to the video that illustrated the utterance they heard during the initial video. Children who heard utterance A interpreted ''kradding'' to mean the act of the duck pushing on the rabbit, while children who heard utterance B assumed ''kradding'' was the action of arm waving. This indicates that children arrive at interpretations of a novel verb based on the utterance context and the syntactic structure in which it was embedded.

In 1990, Lila Gleitman took this idea further by examining the acquisition of verbs in more detail.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Gleitman, Lila. "The Structural Source of Verb Meanings", 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In her study, she found that children could differentiate between verbs that take one or more arguments and that this knowledge was used to help them narrow down the potential meanings for the verb in question. This discovery explains how children can learn the meaning of verbs that cannot be observed, like ‘think’.

In later studies, this was exemplified by Fisher as she proposed that children can use the number of noun phrases in a sentence as evidence about a verb's meaning.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Cynthia|year=1996|title=Structural Limits on Verb Mapping: The Role of Analogy in Children’s Interpretations of Sentences|url=|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=31|issue=12|pages=41–81|via=|doi=10.1006/cogp.1996.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that children expect the noun phrases in a sentence to map one-to-one with participant roles in the event described by that sentence. For example, if a toddler hears a sentence that contains two noun phrases, she can infer that that sentence describes an event with two participants. This constrains the meaning that the verb in that sentence can have. Fisher presented 3 and 5 year old children a video in which one participant caused a second participant to move. Children who heard that scene described by a transitive clause containing a novel verb, associated the subject of the verb with the agent. Children who heard the scene described by an intransitive clause associated the subject with either the agent or the patient.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This shows that children make different inferences about meaning depending on the transitivity of the sentence.

==== Acquiring attitude verbs ====
Acquiring the meaning of attitude verbs, which refer to an individual’s mental state, provides a challenge for word learners since these verbs do not correlate with any physical aspects of the environment. Words such as 'think' and 'want' do not have physically observable qualities. Thus, there must be something deeper going on that enables children to learn these verbs referring to abstract mental concepts, such as syntactic frames as described in a study above by Harrigan, Hacquard, and Lidz.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; Because children have no initial idea about the meaning or usage of the words, syntactic bootstrapping aids them in figuring out when verbs refer to mental concepts. If a child hears the statement, "Matt thinks his grandmother is under the covers," three- to four-year-old children will understand that the sentence is about Matt's belief.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papafragou|first=Anna|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Gleitman|first3=Lila R.|date=2007|year=|title=When we think about thinking: The acquisition of belief verbs|url=|journal=Cognition|volume=105|pages=|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2006.09.008|pmc=2768311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children will understand from the syntactic frame in which it was uttered that the verb for mental state, ''thinks'', refers to Matt's beliefs and not to his grandmother's. In addition, Gillette et al. (1999)&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; show that mental state verbs cannot easily be identified when only visual context is available and that these verbs showed the greatest improvement when syntactic context was provided.

=== Acquiring nouns ===
The acquisition of nouns is related to the acquisition of the [[#The acquisition of the count/mass contrast|mass/count contrast]]. In 1969, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. "Ontological Relativity and Other Essays", 1969&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that children cannot learn new nouns unless they have already acquired this semantic distinction. Otherwise, the word “apples” might refer to the individual objects in a pile or the pile itself, and the child would have no way to know without already understanding the difference between a mass and a count noun. Nancy N. Soja&lt;ref&gt;Soja, N "Inferences about the meanings of nouns: the relationship between perception and syntax", 1992&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Quine is mistaken, and that children can learn new nouns without fully understanding the mass/count distinction. She found in her study that 2-year old children were able to learn new nouns (some mass, some count nouns) from inferring meaning from the syntactic structure of the sentence the words were introduced in.

=== Acquiring adjectives ===
In a 2010 study, Syrett and Lidz&lt;ref&gt;Syrett, Kristen &amp; Jeffrey Lidz."30-Month-Olds Use the Distribution and Meaning of Adverbs to Interpret Novel Adjectives", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; show that children learn the meaning of novel gradable adjectives on the basis of the adverbs that modify them. Gradable adjectives have a scale associated with them: for example, the adjective “large” places the noun that it modifies on a size scale, while the adjective “expensive” places the noun that is modifiers on a price scale. In addition, gradable adjectives (GA's) subdivide into two classes: relative and maximal GA’s.

Relative GA’s are words like “big” in (5), and require a reference point: a big mouse is not the same size as a big elephant. As shown in (6) and (7), while relative GAs can be modified by the adverb ''very'' they cannot be modified by the adverb ''completely''.

 relative gradable adjectives
 (5) a.  ''a '''big''' mouse''
     b.  ''a '''big''' elephant''
 (6) a.  ''a very '''big''' mouse''
     b.  ''a very '''big''' elephant''
 (7) a. *''a completely '''big''' mouse''
     b. *''a completely '''big''' elephant''

Maximal GA’s are words like, “full” in (8); they operate on a close-ended scale. As shown in (9) and (10), while relative GAs cannot be modified by the adverb ''very'' they can be modified by the adverb ''completely''.

 maximal gradable adjectives
 (8)  a.    ''a '''full''' pool''
      b.    ''a '''full''' tank''
 (9)  a. ?? ''a very '''full''' pool''
      b. ?? ''a very '''full''' tank''
 (10) a.    ''a completely '''full''' pool''
      b.    ''a completely '''full''' tank''

In the 2010 study, Syrett and Lidz showed children pictures of objects that could be described in terms of both relative and maximal GA’s. For example, a picture of a container that could be described as both ''tall'' (a relative GA) and ''clear'' (a maximal GA).

When showing these objects to the children, the novel adjective used to describe them was prefaced with either adverb ''very'' (which usually modifies relative GA’s) or the adverb ''completely'' (which modifies maximal GA’s). As a control, in some contexts, no adverb was present. When the novel adjective was presented with the adverb ''very'', the children assigned a relative GA meaning to it, and when it was presented with adverb ''completely'', a maximal GA. When no adverb was present, the children were unable to assign a meaning to the adjective. This shows that, in order for children to learn the meaning of a new adjective, they depend on grammatical information provide by adverbs about the semantic class of the novel adjective.

An experiment by Wellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) showed that four-year-olds associate unknown words with a quality meaning when they are presented with adjective syntax, and with a quantitative meaning when they are presented with determiner syntax. For example, in "Gleebest of the cows are by the barn," "gleebest" would be interpreted as "many" or "four," a quantity. Yet children associate the same unknown word with a quality interpretation when the word is presented in an adjective position. In the sentence "The gleebest cows are by the barn," "gleebest" would be interpreted as "striped" or "purple," a quality.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; This shows that children use syntax to identify whether a word is an adjective or a determiner, and use that category information to infer aspects of the word's meaning.

== Acquiring functional categories ==
There is a basic contrast between lexical categories (which include open-class items such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives), and [[functional item|functional categories]] (which include closed-class items such [[auxiliary verb]]s, case markers, [[complementizer]]s, [[coordination (linguistics)|conjunctions]] and [[determiner]]s. The acquisition functional categories has been studied significantly less than the lexical class, so much remains unknown. A 1998 study led by Rushen Shi&lt;ref&gt;Shi, Rushen, James L. Morgan, Paul Allopena. (1998). Phonological and acoustic bases for earliest grammatical category assignment; a cross-linguistic perspective&lt;/ref&gt; shows that, at a very young age, Mandarin and Turkish learners use [[phonology|phonological]], acoustic and distributional cues to distinguish between words that are lexical categories from words that are functional categories. 11 to 20-month old children were observed speaking with their mothers to evaluate whether speech directed at the children contained clues that they could then use to categorize words as "lexical" or "function". Compared to as lexical category words, functional category words were found to have the following properties:

* simpler syllable structures
* simpler vowels ([[monophthong|monopthongs]] as opposed to [[diphthong]]s)
* shorter duration
* lower amplitude
* occur much more frequently in speech

== Challenges to the theory ==
[[Steven Pinker]] presents his theory of [[semantic bootstrapping]], which hypothesizes that children use the meaning of words to start to learn the syntax of their language.  Gleitman (1990) counters Pinker’s ideas by asserting that context is insufficient to supply word meaning, as a single context can allow for multiple interpretations of an uttered sentence. She explains that simply observing objects and events in the world does not provide sufficient information to infer the meanings of words and sentences.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Pinker, however, argues that semantic bootstrapping and syntactic bootstrapping aren't conflicting ideas, and that semantic bootstrapping makes no claims about learning word meanings. He argues that since semantic bootstrapping is a hypothesis about how children acquire syntax, while syntactic bootstrapping is a hypothesis about how children acquire word meanings, the opposition between the two theories does not necessarily exist.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinker|first=Steven|year=1994|title=How could a child use verb syntax to learn verb semantics?|url=|journal=Lingua|volume=94|pages=337–410|via=|doi=10.1016/0024-3841(94)90347-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker agrees that syntactic categories are in fact used by children to learn semantics and accepts syntactic bootstrapping, but argues that Gleitman applies the hypothesis too broadly, and that is insufficient evidence to account for all of Gleitman's claims. Pinker argues that while children can use syntax to learn certain semantic properties within a single frame, like the number of arguments a verb takes or the types of arguments such as agent and patient, there are serious problems with the argument that children pick up on these semantic properties from the syntax when a verb is found in a wide range of syntactic frames. Pinker uses the verb "sew" as an example:
{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="4" |Frames of "sew" (Pinker 1994)
|-
| rowspan="4" |(You) sew
| colspan="2" |
|Activity
|-
| rowspan="3" |the shirt
|
|Activity done to an object.
|-
|for me
|Creating an object for a beneficiary.
|-
|out of rags
|Creating one object out of another.
|}
Pinker argues that the syntax provides information about possible verb frames, but does not help a learner "zoom in" on a verb's meaning after hearing it in multiple frames. According to Pinker, the frames presented above for "sew" can do nothing for learners other than clue them into the fact that "sewing" is some sort of activity. Furthermore, Pinker disagrees with Gleitman's claim that the ambiguities in the situations where a word is used could only be solved by using information about how the word behaves syntactically.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Applications cross-linguistically ==
With all of the studies above supporting or challenging syntactic bootstrapping, how does the theory hold up cross linguistically?

Two studies focusing on French and German were determining the use of syntactic contexts to classify novel words as nouns or verbs. The German study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höhle, B., Weissenborn, J., Kiefer, D., Schulz, A., &amp; Schmitz, M.|title=Functional elements in infants' speech processing: The role of determiners in the syntactic categorization of lexical elements.|journal=Infancy|date=2004|volume=5 | issue = 3 |pages=341–353|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0503_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children between 14 and 16 months could use [[determiner]]s to classify a novel word as a noun, however, they could not show the same ability mapping pronoun environments to verbs. Overall, this exemplifies their ability to determine the categories of function words and shows a sensitivity to syntactic framing. Following this conclusion, Christophe et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christophe, A., Millotte, S., Bernal, S., &amp; Lidz, J.|title=Bootstrapping lexical and syntactic acquisition|journal=Language and Speech|date=2008|volume=51(1-2)|pages=61–75|doi=10.1177/00238309080510010501}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that children can use this ability along with [[Prosodic bootstrapping]] to infer the syntactic category of the neighboring content words; as at 23 months they can classify novel nouns as well as verbs based on their surrounding syntactic envionrment. These studies follow the Syntactic Bootstrapping model of language acquisition, however, the determiner/noun and pronoun/verb environments are also found in English, som, how well does this theory apply to a Language structurally different from English?

Lee and Naigles (2005) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joanne N.|last2=Naigles|first2=Letitia R.|year=2005|title=The Input to Verb Learning in Mandarin Chinese: A Role for syntactic bootstrapping|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=529–540|via=|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.3.529}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked into how Mandarin children use the transitive versus intransitive environments to infer meaning in a language that allows the [[noun phrase]] (subject or object) argument to go unpronounced. Following Fisher’s studies where children use the number of NP’s to make conclusions about the causation in the sentence; 1 NP is an intransitive sentence and involves only the agent while 2 NP’s is a transitive environment and involves an action being taken upon something or someone. 
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! colspan = "2"|Intransitive environment !!colspan="3" | Transitive environment
|-
| &lt;Agent&gt; || &lt;Non-causative verb&gt; || &lt;Agent&gt; || &lt;Causative verb&gt; || &lt;Theme&gt;
|-
| ''The dog'' || ''comes'' || ''The dog'' || ''brings'' || ''the lion''
|}
The environment above was presented in the study and then altered to test the change of interpretation the Mandarin children might have. Due to the pervasive [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] in Mandarin, the number of NP’s in a phrase is a weaker clue in mapping causation or non-causation of a verb. Presented with an elided transitive environment ''The dog brings,'' the children determined the sentence to be intransitive, meaning they changed their interpretation of the verb based on the number of noun phrases presented. This was shown as the children used toys to act out the scenario they heard; if their interpretation were to be independent of the number of NP's they would have shown the dog bringing the lion, however, they showed the dog going on its own, showing their interpretation of the verb to be non-causative. This follows the syntactic bootstrapping theory as their mapping of verb meaning relied on the syntactic frame and content in the sentence. However, it poses another question about how Mandarin children can go on to map transitive or intransitive environments properly during their development.

A few studies have begun to look at how children learning languages with different word orders represent syntactic structures which are required for children to map word meanings or categories using syntactic bootstrapping. For example, the research on the acquisition of verbs presents English children as using information about the subject and objects to determine if the verb is causative or non-causative, however, will this ability change in a language which has the object occurring before the verb. One could assume this to be a difficult task if both an English child and child leaning an [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] language have the same mental representation of syntactic structure. To address this, a Gervain, et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervain, J., Nespor, M., Mazuka, R., Horie, R., &amp; Mehler, J.|title=Bootstrapping word order in prelexical infants: A Japanese–Italian cross-linguistic study|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=2008|volume=57 | issue = 1 |pages=56–74|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at an infant’s mental representation of Japanese, which is a [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] – [[Head (linguistics)|head]] language with an object-verb (OV) word order, and Italian, which like English, is head-complement and therefore has a verb-object (VO) word order. They found that 8-month-olds have a general knowledge of word order specific to their language preceding their acquisition of lexical items or syntactic categories. Their attuning of structural relations of syntactic categories (verbs, nouns, etc.) within their language allows them to then apply this knowledge later in their development, possibly allowing for language-specific syntactic bootstrapping.

'''Tajalli''' ({{lang-fa|تجلی}}, divine self-manifestation) is the appearance and disclosure of [[God]] as truth in [[Sufism|Islamic theoretical mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FBXvfLySQwC|title=Ibn 'Arabi in the Later Islamic Tradition: The Making of a Polemical Image in Medieval Islam|last=Knysh|first=Alexander D.|date=1999-01-01|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791439678|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajalli is a process by which God reveals Himself in concrete forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPT9uAypnOEC|title=Sufism and Taoism: A Comparative Study of Key Philosophical Concepts|last=Izutsu|first=Toshihiko|date=1984-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520052642|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
Tajalli literally means "manifestation, disclosure and appearance". Mystics use the term to mean "appearance of truth into human heart and universe." The concept is used five times in the [[Quran]], notably in the following verse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] arrived at our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: "O Lord, reveal Yourself to me that I may behold You." "You cannot behold Me," He said. "But look at the mountain: If it remains firm in its place you may then behold Me." But when his Lord appeared on the mountain, making it crumble to a heap of dust, and Musa fell unconscious. When he recovered, he said: "All glory to You. I turn to You in repentance, and I am the first to believe." ([[Al-A'raf|7. Al-Araf]]: 143)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tajalli in theological commentaries==
Theologians interpreting the Quran understand tajalli as appearance. They emphasize the concept of seeing [[vision of God|God]], or ''Ro'ya''. The traditional [[Ash'ari]]s use the Quranic concept to argue for the possibility of seeing God. To the contrary, [[Shia]]s and [[Mu`tazila|Muta'zilas]] interpret this verse to prove the impossibility of seeing God.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Asghar Dadbeh|vol. 14|p. 587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tajalli in mysticism==
Divine self-manifestation has an important role in [[epistemology]] and [[ontology]] for mystics. Two concepts are important to Tajalli; one is ''shams'', the sun of truth, and the other is the mirror of the heart. According to the symbolical language of mysticism, the sun is a password of Truth and the mirror is the key to the universe and the heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Asghar Dadbeh|vol.14|p.588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemological meaning===
According to epistemological semantics, truth manifests itself in the heart of the human being on a mystical journey. Consequently, by means of divine manifestation within one's self, the mystic could attain to a realization of the truth to such a degree that those attributes he personally embodies shine forth as reflections of The Divine Attributes within his very being. The spiritual wayfarer discovers this through the ascetic or Sufi conduct during his spiritual journey inward to attain to God Consciousness, which he unleashes within himself into the world as a kind of divine charisma. Some mystics of the Sufi path recognize this charisma as a divine presence and regard it as sufficient reason to conclude that the Divine is manifest in the heart of the charismatic. Alternatively, Tajalli is also use to denote a removal of the conceptual veils which occult the truth of The Divine Manifestation - namely every thing that veils Creation's True End, which is to act as a Revelation of God's Divine Attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Asghar Dadbeh|vol.14|p.p.588-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hierarchy of manifestation====
Mystics have many levels to achieve intuitive knowledge of God:
# The level of muhazarah or the place of self-eefacement or "Mahv". This level is also called a place of manifestation of conducts of God.
# The level of revealing or the place of "Tams". the level is the manifestation of God's attributes.
# The level of revealing the essence of God unto ascetic's heart. This stage is also called '''Mahq'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Asghar Dadbeh|vol.14|p.589-90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontological meaning===
According to ontological sense, the absolute truth manifests itself in the universe like the appearing of the sun of truth in the mirror of universe in the heart of the Mystic. The absolute manifests itself in multitude forms in different beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Asghar Dadbeh|vol.14|p.590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tea room may be a room set aside in a hotel especially for serving [[afternoon tea]], or may be an establishment which only serves [[cream tea]]s.  Although the function of a tearoom may vary according to the circumstance or country, teahouses often serve as centers of [[social interaction]], like [[coffeehouse]]s.

Some cultures have a variety of distinct tea-centered establishments of different types, depending on the national [[tea culture]]. For example, the British or American tearoom serves [[Tea (meal)#Afternoon tea|afternoon tea]] with a variety of small cakes.

In [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Nepal]], a teahouse (茶館 ''cháguăn'' or 茶屋 ''cháwū''; [[Nepali language|Standard Nepali]]:''चिया घर'') is traditionally a place which offers tea to its customers. People gather at teahouses to chat, socialize, and enjoy tea, and young people often meet at teahouses for dates. The Guangdong (Cantonese) style teahouse is particularly famous outside of China especially in Nepal's Himalayas. These teahouses, called ''chálou'' (茶樓) serve [[dim sum]] (點心), and these small plates of food are enjoyed alongside tea.

Before tea was used as a social drink, Buddhist Monks drank tea as an aid to their meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Laudan, Rachel. Cuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History. University of California Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Chinese adaptation of Buddhism between 200 C.E. and 850 C.E., tea was introduced as a medicinal herb. It was then evolved to assist Buddhist monks in their meditation by providing the energy needed to stay awake (likely via the effects of caffeine as a stimulant on the brain). Soon thereafter, tea popularized as a commonplace beverage (replacing the previously consumed milk- and water-based beverages) as Chinese teahouses provided a new kind of social life for the Chinese during the 8th-9th centuries C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuisine and Empire|last=Laudan|first=Rachel|publisher=University of California Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-520-28631-3|location=Berkley and Los Angeles, California|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]]ese tradition a teahouse ordinarily refers to a private structure designed for holding [[Japanese tea ceremony|Japanese tea ceremonies]]. This structure and specifically the room in it where the tea ceremony takes place is called {{Nihongo||茶室|chashitsu|literally "tea room"}}. The architectural space called ''chashitsu'' was created for aesthetic and intellectual fulfillment.

In Japan during the Edo period, the term "teahouse" could also refer to a place of entertainment with [[geisha]] or as a place where couples seeking privacy could go. In this case the establishment was referred to as an {{Nihongo||お茶屋|[[ochaya]]}}, which literally meant "tea house". However, these establishments only served tea incidentally, and were instead dedicated to geisha entertainment or to providing discreet rooms for visitors. This usage is now archaic. Contemporary Japanese go to modern tearooms called [[kissaten]] on main streets to drink black or green tea as well as coffee.

[[File:Myanmar Tea House Food.jpg|thumb|Burmese tea house accompaniments.]]
In Myanmar (Burma), teahouses, known as ''laphetyay saing'' ({{my|လက်ဖက်ရည်ဆိုင်}}) and formerly known as ''kaka saing'' ({{my|ကာကာဆိုင်}}), are a staple of urban centers throughout the country. These teahouses, which first emerged during the British colonial era, serve [[milk tea]] and a variety of delicacies ranging from native dishes like [[mohinga]] to Indian fritters (e.g., [[paratha]], [[poori]], etc.) or Chinese pastries (e.g., [[baozi]], [[youtiao]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/news/tea-shops-yangon.html|title=Tea shops IN YANGON|work=The Myanmar Times|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea shops have traditionally served as venues akin to conversational [[salon (gathering)|salon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freemuse.org/news/myanmarburma-music-under-siege/|title=Myanmar/Burma: Music under siege - Freemuse|website=freemuse.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Asia the term teahouse could refer to Shayhana in Kazakh, Chaykhana in Kyrgyz and Choyxona in Uzbek, which literally means a tea room.  In [[Tajikistan]], the largest teahouses are the Orient Teahouse, Chinese Teahouse, and Orom Teahouse in the city of [[Isfara]]. On the 15th anniversary of the independence of Tajikistan, the people of Isfara presented the Isfara Teahouse to the city of [[Kulyab]] for its 2700th anniversary on September 2006.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  Teahouses are present in other parts of Central Asia, notably in [[Iran]] and also [[Turkey]]. Such teahouses may be referred to, in [[Persian Language|Persian]], as ''Chay-Khaneh'', or in Turkish, ''çayhane''—literally, the "house of tea".  These teahouses usually serve several beverages in addition to tea.

In [[Arab countries]] such as [[Egypt]], establishments that serve tea, coffee and [[herbal tea]]s like [[karkade]] are referred to as ''ahwa'' or ''maqha'' ({{lang-ar|مقهى}}) and are more commonly translated into English as [[coffeehouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hummusisyummus.wordpress.com/2007/10/31/my-life-in-the-ahwa/ |title=Ahwa's in Egypt |publisher=Hummusisyummus.wordpress.com |date=2007-10-31 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pakistan]], the proniment [[Pak Tea House]] is an intellectual [[Tea in Pakistan|tea]]–[[café]] located in [[Lahore]] known as the hub of [[Progressive Writers' Movement]].

==Europe==

===Britain===
{{Main|Tea in the United Kingdom}}

Tea drinking is a pastime closely associated with the English.&lt;ref name="miaminewtimes2002"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pamela Robin Brandt |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2002-10-17/restaurants/tea-for-view-view-for-tea/ |title=Miaminewtimes.com |publisher=Miaminewtimes.com |date=2002-10-17 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female manager of London's [[Aerated Bread Company]] is credited with creating the bakery's first public tearoom, which became a thriving chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chrystal|first1=Paul|title=Tea: A Very British Beverage|date=2014|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited,|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea rooms were part of the growing opportunities for [[women in the Victorian era]].

In the UK today, a tea room is a small room or restaurant where beverages and light meals are served, often having a sedate or subdued atmosphere. [[Tea (meal)|The food served]] can range from a [[cream tea]] (also known as Devonshire tea), i.e. a [[scone (bread)|scone]] with [[jam]] and [[clotted cream]]; to an elaborate [[tea (meal)#afternoon tea|afternoon tea]] featuring [[tea sandwich]]es and small cakes; to a [[high tea]], a savoury meal. In [[Scotland]] teas are usually served with a variety of scones, [[pancake]]s, [[crumpet]]s and other cakes. There is a long tradition of tea rooms within London hotels, for example, at [[Brown's Hotel]] at 33 [[Albemarle Street]], which has been serving tea in its tea room for over 170 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.roccofortehotels.com/hotels-and-resorts/browns-hotel/restaurants-and-bars/english-tea-room/ |title=Brown's Hotel|publisher=Brown's Hotel |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the charm of the occasion is an attractive [[tea set]], often decorated china.

In a related usage, a tea room may be a room set aside in a workplace for relaxation and eating during [[break (work)|tea breaks]]. Traditionally this was served by a [[tea lady]], not to be confused with a [[dinner lady]].

====Commonwealth====
Tea rooms are popular in Commonwealth countries, particularly Canada, with its harsh winters, when afternoon tea is popular. The menu will generally have similar foods to in the UK, but with the addition sometimes of [[butter tarts]] or other small desserts like [[nanaimo bars]] or [[pets de sœurs]]. Tea is commonly consumed in other Commonwealth countries alone or in the British fashion.

===Elsewhere===
[[File:Berlin belvedere schlossgarten charlottenburg 01 20080423.JPG|thumb|End view of the teahouse "belvedere" of the [[Charlottenburg Palace]]]]

In France, a tea room is called [[:fr:Salon de thé|Salon de thé]], and pastries and cakes are also served.  It seems that having a separate teahouse was a tradition in many countries in Europe.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  In Germany, one ''[[Berghof (residence)#Mooslahnerkopf teahouse|Teehaus]]'' was particularly famous during the Third Reich era where the German Dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] used to have his daily walk and tea on Mooslahnerkopf hill near his residence [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], in the Bavarian Alps. Hitler's teahouse was a cylindrical structure built in the woods.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In the Czech Republic, the tea room culture has been spreading since the Velvet Revolution 1989 and today, there are nearly 400 tea rooms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cajik.cz/#start|title=ajk - seznam ajoven a obchod ajem|work=cajik.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; (čajovny) in the country (more than 50 just in Prague), which is according to some sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.ihned.cz/cestovani/c1-48492650-cesko-je-zemi-s-nejvetsi-koncentraci-cajoven-na-svete-kam-na-dobry-caj-zajit|title=esko je zem snejvt koncentrac ajoven na svt. Kam na dobr aj zajt?|work=Hospodsk noviny}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest concentration of tea rooms per capita in Europe.

In Eastern Europe, countries like Latvia are located at the crossroads of trade routes between Western and Eastern Europe, and tea came both from the East and West. One example of mixed tea is a new type of tea room—Club tea culture. For example, a tea club Goija.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Relationship to 19th century temperance movement==

The popularity of the tea room rose as an alternative to the pub in the UK and US during the [[temperance movement]] in the 1830s.  The form developed in the late 19th century, as [[Catherine Cranston]] opened the first of what became a chain of ''Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms'' in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, and similar establishments became popular throughout Scotland. In the 1880s, fine hotels in both the United States and England began to offer tea service in tea rooms and tea courts, and by 1910 they had begun to host afternoon tea dances as dance crazes swept both the U.S. and the UK. Tea rooms of all kinds were widespread in Britain by the 1950s, but in the following decades cafés became more fashionable, and tea rooms became less common.

==Other meanings and related words==
[[Image:Twinings London April 2006 088.jpg|thumb|[[Twinings]] tea shop, established 1706]]

The term "tea shop" may also refer to a retail shop selling dry tea to take home. Dry tea (first, as loose leaves, and then in [[teabag]]s) used to be sold at [[Grocery store#Early history|grocers' shops]], and now mainly at supermarkets. One of the oldest shops that still specialises in selling tea for consumption at home is [[Twinings]], which has been operating from the same premises in [[central London]] since it opened in 1706.

In the workplace, the term ''tea room'' ("break room" in North America) is a room set aside for employees to relax; specifically, to take refreshment during [[break (work)|work breaks]]. Traditionally, a staff member serving hot drinks and snacks at a factory or office was called a [[tea lady]], although this position is now almost defunct.

Tea is a prominent feature of [[British culture]] and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A very British beverage: Why us Brits just love a cuppa|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/food/529175/Why-Brits-love-a-cup-of-tea|agency=Express|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries, Britain has been one of the world's greatest tea consumers, and now consumes an average ''per capita'' of 1.9 kg (4.18 lbs) per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Balance Sheets|url=http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html#DOWNLOAD|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4694">The concept of the '''victim soul''' derives from the Roman Catholic teaching on redemptive suffering. Such a person is said to be one chosen by God to suffer more than most people during life, and who generously accepts the suffering, based on the example of [[Passion (Christianity)|Christ's own Passion]]. The Catholic Church does not officially designate anyone as a victim soul.

==Background==
In the apostolic letter "Salvifici Doloris" (1984), which deals with human suffering and redemption, Pope John Paul II noted that: "The Redeemer suffered in place of man and for man. Every man has his own share in the Redemption. Each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished. ..."&lt;ref name=korson&gt;[https://www.osv.com/TodaysIssues/Article/TabId/599/ArtMID/13753/ArticleID/10338/What-is-a-Victim-Soul.aspx Korson, Gerson. "What is a Victim Soul?", ''The Catholic Answer'', Our Sunday Visitor, February 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

An exposition of the tradition of victim soul appears in the autobiography of saint [[Thérèse of Lisieux]], ''[[The Story of a Soul]]''. In her view, the victim soul is a chosen one whose suffering is mysteriously joined with the redemptive suffering of Christ and is used for the redemption of others.&lt;ref name=BWell&gt;''The Blackwell Companion to Catholicism'' by James Buckley, Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt and Trent Pomplun (Dec 21, 2010) {{ISBN|1444337327}} pages 396-397&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church does not officially designate anyone as a victim soul. The term comes from the testimony of those who have observed Christians who seem to undergo a kind of redemptive suffering. Victim soul status, even when genuine, is a matter of private revelation; therefore individuals are not bound to accept, as part of the Catholic faith, the legitimacy of any particular person for whom such a claim is made, nor the genuineness of any miraculous claims that have been made in connection with such a person.&lt;ref name=korson/&gt;

==Notable cases==
Examples of alleged victim souls are:
* [[Lidwina|Saint Lidwina of Schiedam]] (1380 - 1433)
* [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart]] (1863 – 1899): the noble countess Droste zu Vischering and Mother Superior of the Convent of Good Shepherd Sisters in Porto, Portugal, wrote in her autobiography ''"I offered myself to God as a victim for the sanctification of priests"'' and added ''"I know that the Lord has accepted my suffering"''.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chasle; ''Sister Mary of the Divine Heart'', Burns &amp; Oates, London (1906).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gemma Galgani|Saint Gemma Galgani]] (1878 – April 11, 1903): wrote in her autobiography how Jesus told her ''"I need souls who, by their sufferings, trials and sacrifices, make amends for sinners and for their ingratitude."''&lt;ref&gt;''Visionaries: The Spanish Republic and the Reign of Christ'' by William A. Christian (May 30, 1996) University of California Press {{ISBN|0520200403}} page 96&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Maria Valtorta]] (1897 – 1961): whose spiritual life was influenced by reading the autobiography of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, as well as the life of Saint John Mary Vianney at the age of 28, before becoming bedridden, she offered herself to God as a victim soul.&lt;ref name=Peter1&gt;''Shepherd of Souls: The Virtuous Life of Saint Anthony Pucci'' by [[Fr. Peter Mary Rookey, O.S.M.|Peter M. Rookey O.S. M.]] (Jun 2003) {{ISBN|1891280449}} CMJ Marian Press pages 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alexandrina Maria da Costa|Blessed Alexandrina of Balazar]] (1904 – 1955): whose Vatican biography states that she saw her vocation in life to invite others to conversion, and to ''"offer a living witness of Christ's passion, contributing to the redemption of humanity."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20040425_da-costa_en.html Vatican biography of Alexandrina Maria da Costa]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Faustina Kowalska|Saint Faustina Kowalska]] (1905 – 1938): who wrote in her diary that Christ had chosen her to be a ''"victim offering"'', a role that she voluntarily accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Faustina Kowalska, ''Divine Mercy in My Soul: the Diary of Saint Maria Faustina Kowalska'' (Marian Press, 2005), pp. 74-76, paras. 135-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the notion of a [[scapegoat]] has been present within Judeo-Christian teachings for long, the Catholic concept of a victim soul is distinct and different from it, in that in this case the victim soul willingly offers the suffering to God, unlike the unwitting scapegoat scenario.&lt;ref&gt;Freeze, Michael. ''They Bore the Wounds of Christ'' (Nov 1989) {{ISBN|0879734221}} pages 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
He was born in Palermo from Giuseppe Emanuele Fazio, originary from [[Alcamo]] (ex garibaldian and working at the [[National Museum]] of Palermo) and from Felicina Allmayer, of [[Germans|German]] origins, but resident in Italy.&lt;ref name=trecca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vito-fazio-allmayer_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|publisher=treccani.it|title=FAZIO-ALLMAYER, Vito in &amp;quot;Dizionario Biografico&amp;quot;|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Since a boy he was interested  in the history of art;  when he was 23 he graduated in [[Jurisprudence]], but as he was fond of  philosophy, he soon started the philosophical studies and attended the philosophical [[library]] of Palermo, where he met [[Giovanni Gentile]].

In 1910 Allmayer graduated in philosophy and started his career as teacher: in 1914 he moved to the  [[liceo]] "Umberto I" in  Palermo, where he started his rich essaystic production that made him famous in [[Italy]].

His  career continued in [[Rome]]; soon after the fall of [[Fascism]], in November 1943, Vito  Fazio Allmayer was suspended  from teaching and reintegrated after the end of war.

After a difficult period of his life, in the 1950s he resumed his multifarious activity of  essayst and [[critic]], besides teaching.

In 1915 he had married  Concettina Carta, whom he had three children with. After being widowed in 1953 he remarried  [[Bruna Boldrini]], who has been among Fazio's  greatest critics and promoted a complete edition of his works (I-XXII, Firenze 1969–1991).&lt;ref name=trecca/&gt;

Allmayer, who had had a [[heart stroke]] three years before, died in Pisa in 1958.

==Philosophical thought==
The end of  [[Positivism]], and the friendship with Gentile, took him to an ideological engagement in favour of Actual idealism that  seemed it would take a cultural and civil renovation;&lt;ref name=trecca/&gt; according to Actual idealism  it was the [[Actus purus|act]] of [[Thought|thinking]] as [[perception]], and not creative thought as [[imagination]], which defines [[reality]].

Together with Giovanni Gentile and [[Guido De Ruggiero]], he was one of the supporters of that Actual idealism which "had all the romantic seduction and all the optimistic confidence of attracting…the best dissatisfied young people, those not moving towards [[D'Annunzio]] or [[Marinetti]]",&lt;ref&gt;E. Garin, Cronache di filosofia italiana..., I-II, Bari 1966, ad Indicem;&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1914–15 he openly sustained, even with [[lectures]], Italy's intervention in the world war, but he was  declared unfit at the military visit.

Bruna Boldrini, the philosopher's wife, who tried to outline the substantial autonomy of Fazio from Gentile's  [[metaphysics]], affirmed that ''Fazio-Allmayer arrives to justify the historical experience as concrete life, in which the manifold and different forms flow into an [[intersubjective]] relationship, [[ethical]]-[[aesthetic]] synthesis, into the specicifity of each one'' (p.&amp;nbsp;35).

On the other hand, since 1922 even  [[Benedetto Croce]], in a review of the [[essay]]  ''Contributo alla teoria della storia dell'arte'' (later in Opere, IV, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–113), put in doubt that we could still speak of actual idealism in Fazio.

In the second [[post-war]], in a denigratory moment of idealism, and mostly of Actual idealism, accused of [[connivance]] with Fascism, Fazio's position was one of open defence of Actual idealism and a faithful development of his own thought.&lt;ref name=trecca/&gt;

=== Teaching is not dying ===
Teaching is not dying, but entering a life process preceding us and following us over time: on this certainty of Vito and Bruna Fazio-Allmayer, it is based a pedagogic drive of Socratic kind, therefore the master feels a man among men, being more expert, while they are younger, but tending towards the new.&lt;ref name="fazio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fazio-allmayer.it/index//|publisher=fazio-allmayer.it|title=Fondazione &amp;quot;Vito Fazio-Allmayer&amp;quot;|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[educator]], in his becoming a person, turns into the [[historian]] of himself, in the relationship with his pupils he must acknowledge  them in their [[individuality]], rather than level them off.
Opening to others  is the contribution to living: as this sense of  [[solidarity]] fails with everything, we will have the bother  of [[anguish]] inside us.

So the meaning of life is that of hope and love: the other individuals are not antithetical to their [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]], but a necessary development of their ego. Each one of us becomes  ''compossible''  with others for what he gives and what he take back from others, so the particular results in the universality and  this one in the particular.&lt;ref name="fazio"/&gt;

Owing to Vito Fazio-Allmayer, hope is in the certainty that future is in the present: therefore  old teachers are those that, taken from the past, find contemptible everything is produced in the present, and  young people are stupid, and all new thoughts are wrong. Old school cannot see the new world and its renovating; the teacher who withdraws  in the memories of past, shows  the mortal disease called  old age.

=== Foundation ===
The  ''Fondazione Nazionale "Vito Fazio-Allmayer''  was created in Palermo in 1975, by  [[Fanny Giambalvo]] and Bruna Fazio-Allmayer, who came to [[Sicily]] from [[Tuscany]]  to teach [[ethics]]  and history of  Pedagogy;  this institution was founded to honour his husband's  memory and arise interest in philosophy by the new generations.&lt;ref name="fazio"/&gt;

'''Vladimir Alexandrovich Bazarov''' (Russian: Влади́мир Алекса́ндрович База́ров; 1874–1939) was a Russian [[Marxist]] revolutionary, [[journalist]], [[philosopher]], and [[economist]], born Vladimir Alexandrovich Rudnev. Bazarov is best remembered as a pioneer in the development of [[economic planning]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. He was one of the [[Russian Machism|Russian Machists]].

==Biography==

===Early years===

Vladimir Alexandrovich Rudnev was born August 8, 1874 (N.S.) in [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], [[Russian Empire]].

The son of a doctor, A. M. Rudnev, he enrolled in the Tula classical gimnaziia (high school) in 1884, and graduated in the spring of 1892.

In the autumn of 1892, Rudnev  enrolled in the faculty of natural sciences of Moscow University.&lt;ref name=Jasny124&gt;Naum Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties: Names to Be Remembered.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1972; pg. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; He became involved in revolutionary politics in 1896, activity which would lead to his expulsion from Moscow the following year.&lt;ref name=Jasny124 /&gt; He also adopted the surname "Bazarov" as an underground revolutionary [[pseudonym]] taking it from the [[Auguste Comte|Comtean]] [[positivist]] character in [[Turgenev]]'s ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]''.&lt;ref name=Polianski&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Weir|editor-first=Todd H.|author1=Polianski, Igor|chapter=Between Hegel and Haeckel: Monistic worldview, Marxist Philosophy, and Biomedecine in Russia and the Soviet Union|title=Monism: science, philosophy, religion, and the history of a worldview|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=9780230113732|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Bazarov returned home to Tula where, together with [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and [[Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov]], Bazarov organized a secret school for Tula workers.&lt;ref name=Jasny124 /&gt; Bogdanov  resided at the house of Bazarov's father, and met his wife who worked for Alexander Rudenev. A guiding principle of this group was that the workers' movement should be led by workers themselves, assisted by educated members of the radical [[intelligentsia]].&lt;ref name=Williams35&gt;Robert C. Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks: Lenin and His Critics, 1904-1914.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1986; pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In exile==
Bazarov was expelled from Tula in 1899 and emigrated to Germany, settling in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=Jasny124 /&gt; In the fall of 1900, Bazarov was instrumental in establishing a political organization called the "Neutral Group of Social-Democrats in Berlin." This organization dedicated itself to helping heal the split between the [[Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad]], publishers of ''Rabochee Delo'' (The Workers' Cause), and the [[Emancipation of Labour|Emancipation of Labor Group]], publishers of ''[[Iskra]]'' (The Spark). According to Bazarov, the Berlin group sent representatives to [[Geneva]] in an attempt to broker a reconciliation between these two groups of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary groups.&lt;ref name=LCW&gt;Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the CPSU, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/apr/25.htm "The Neutral Group of Social Democrats in Berlin,"] in Lenin, ''Collected Works: Volume 36: 1900-1923.'' Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1966; pg. 624, fn. 82. Direct translation of the same note in Lenin, ''Polnoe sobranie sochinenii: Tom 46: Pisma 1893—1904.'' Moscow: Izdatel'stvo Politicheskoi Literatury, 1964; pg. 489, fn. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Bazarov's Berlin group issued three or four political proclamations before disbanding in the summer of 1901.&lt;ref name=LCW /&gt;

==Return to Russia==
[[File:Materialism-and-Empirio-Criticism.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Cover of the first edition of Lenin's ''Materialism and Empirio-Criticism: Critical Notes about One Reactionary Philosophy,'' published in 1909 against Alexander Bogdanov, Nikolai Valentinov, Vladimir Bazarov, and their co-thinkers.]]
In the fall of 1901, Bazarov returned to Russia to serve as a member of the Moscow Social Democratic Committee.&lt;ref name=Jasny124 /&gt; He was soon again arrested for his political activity, however, this time to be exiled for three years to [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name=Jasny124 /&gt;
In 1904, Bazarov joined the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]] (RSDLP), an organization headed by [[Vladimir Lenin|V.I. Lenin]].&lt;ref name=Jasny124 /&gt; Over the next several years, Bazarov wrote extensively for the Bolshevik party press, serving on the editorial board of the grouping's primary newspaper, ''Rabochii put''' (The Workers' Path), and sitting as a member of the party's underground leadership in the country, the so-called "Bolshevik Center."&lt;ref name=Jasny124 /&gt;

Also in this period Bazarov joined with his old Tula comrades Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov and Alexander Bogdanov in retranslating and publishing a new Russian-language edition of the three volumes of ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'' by [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref name=Jasny125&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition of the book gained recognition as the basic Russian translation and was reissued for decades in the [[Soviet Union]], although for political reasons any mention of the participation of Bazarov and Bogdanov in the translation was later avoided.&lt;ref name=Jasny125 /&gt;

Bazarov also became interested in philosophy during the first decade of the 20th Century, coming to reject Marx's formulaic [[dialectical materialism]] in favor of the use of the [[scientific method]] to observe and theorize about human behavior, as espoused by the Austrian [[Ernst Mach]] and the German-Swiss philosopher [[Richard Avenarius]].&lt;ref name=Jasny125 /&gt; The Bolshevik supporters of the "empirical-criticism" of Mach and Avenarius, including Bazarov, Bogdanov, and [[Nikolai Valentinov]], were soon the target of a bitter [[polemic]] by Lenin published in 1909, ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism]].''  Bazarov subsequently moved away from membership and participation in the Bolshevik organization, while remaining politically radical.&lt;ref name=Jasny124 /&gt;

In 1911, Bazarov was arrested once again and was deported once more, this time a three-year sentence to [[Astrakhan]].&lt;ref name=Jasny124 /&gt; In November 1912, Bazarov joined with Bogdanov, [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Maxim Gorky]], and Lenin, writing for a new paper in St. Petersburg called ''[[Pravda]].''&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
During the years of [[World War I]], Bazarov wrote for various radical publications, including Gorky's radical daily, ''Novaia zhizn''' (New Life).&lt;ref&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the 1917 revolution===

Following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Bazarov moved to [[Kharkov]] in the [[Ukraine]], where he wrote for various [[Menshevik]] publications.&lt;ref name=Jasny125 /&gt; In 1919 he published ''Na puti k sotsializmu'' (Khar'kov, 1919), for which he was attacked by [[Bukharin]], who viewed him and Bogdanov as being part of a combined opposition espousing a theory of  a  "bureaucratic degeneration (the technico-intellectual bureaucracy, the 'organizing' caste)".

In 1922, Bazarov joined the staff of the [[Gosplan|State Planning Commission]], where he met [[Vladimir Groman]], with whom he would work intimately for the next half decade.&lt;ref name=Jasny125 /&gt; Bazarov and Groman worked together developing the basics of Soviet industrial planning, setting the foundation stones for the next half century of the Soviet economy. On November 21, 1923, Groman presented the Presidium of Gosplan with a paper entitled "Problems of Planning the National Economy as a Whole," in which Bazarov argued that the adoption of the [[mixed economy]] of the [[New Economic Policy]] actually accentuated rather than lessened the need for [[central economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Groman, Bazarov was influential in developing the idea that a diminishing rate of growth was an earmark of economies such as that of the Soviet Union which were in the process of recovery.&lt;ref name=Jasny127&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in retrospect the observation seems obvious, the "theory of the leveling-off curve" espoused by Groman and Bazarov postulated that an economy with substantial reserves of idle capacity would initially show an inordinately rapid pace of growth as productive capital returned to use, with this rate tapering off as available plant approached full capacity.&lt;ref name=Erlich60&gt;Alexander Erlich, ''The Soviet Industrialization Debate, 1924-1928.'' [1960] Second Edition. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1967; pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 Bazarov published a pamphlet entitled ''Towards a Methodology for Strategic Planning'' in which he further expanded his ideas on the development of central planning procedures as the Soviet economy moved from recovery to expansion.&lt;ref name=Jasny126&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Bazarov remained convinced that central direction of economic investment would provide the impetus for accelerated economic growth, speaking in 1926 of the "hope to overtake and surpass in our development the advanced countries of the capitalist world."&lt;ref name=Jasny128&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bazarov was a staunch advocate of using material incentives to motivate the [[peasantry]] to expand agricultural output, declaring early in 1927 that "only by amply supplying the village with good industrial products at very low prices can we create a real impulse toward the development of our backward agriculture..."&lt;ref name=Jasny130&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of weak agricultural marketing by the peasantry in 1927 and 1928, Soviet political leaders moved another direction, however, returning to the coercive requisitioning methods first used during the earlier period of [[War Communism]] before moving to a radical drive for complete [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] of agriculture at the end of the decade.

Bazarov was a voice in the Soviet planning apparatus for a rational rate of growth. In response to a draft [[first five-year plan|Five-Year Plan]] prepared by the [[Supreme Council of National Economy]] (VSNKh) which posited industrial growth of 135% over the five economic years 1927/28 to 1932/33, Bazarov deemed the long-term possibilities "fascinating" and "enchanting."&lt;ref name=Jasny133&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a pace was soon dismissed as inadequate by those holding more extreme views, however, and Bazarov was sharply criticized for pessimism in underestimating "the advantages inherent in the Soviet system."&lt;ref&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pp. 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, a growth of 179% over the five-year period was approved by Soviet planning authorities, and Bazarov, Groman, and others holding similar views favoring a less drastic rate of capital accumulation were shunted aside.&lt;ref name=Jasny134&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1931 Menshevik Trial===

Bazarov was arrested by the Soviet secret police during the summer of 1930. At his interrogation of August 15, 1930, he signed a deposition acknowledging his participation in a group with other economists who had been arrested and interrogated by the GPU, including his friend and co-worker Groman and former [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]] member [[Nikolai Kondratiev]].&lt;ref&gt;"Protokol dopros Bazarova Vladimira Aleksandrovicha ot 15-go avgusta 1930 goda" (Transcript of the Deposition of Vladimir Alexandrovich Bazarov of August 15, 1920) in A.L. Litvin (ed.), ''Men'sheviistskiii protsess 1931 goda: Sbornik dokumentov v 2-kh knigakh.'' Moscow: ROSSPEN, 1999; vol. 1, pp. 46-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 the [[Menshevik Trial]] was held charging "Mensheviks" in the state planning apparatus with the "[[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]]" of Soviet industry through the setting of artificially low planning targets. Although Bazarov was not in the dock among the public defendants in this [[1931 Menshevik Trial]], his associate Groman was. Groman gave public testimony that he and Bazarov headed a counterrevolutionary group in Gosplan, purportedly organized in 1923, which attempted at "influencing the economic policy of the Soviet authorities so as to hold the position of 1923-25."&lt;ref&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 136, citing the transcript of Groman's trial testimony published in ''Protsess kontrrevoliutsionnoi organizatsii Men'shevikov (1 marta—9 marta 1931): Stenogragramma sudebnogo protsessa.'' Moscow: Sovetskoe Zakonodatel'stvo, 1931; pg. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Naum Jasny]] has speculated that Bazarov's failure to appear as a defendant at this major public trial was likely a reflection of the fact that "the [[GPU]] did not succeed in breaking him completely enough to make him a desirable member of the trial."&lt;ref name=Jasny137&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groman, the star figure among the accused, damned himself and his colleagues with testimony that at Gosplan they had spent their time

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Putting into the control figures and into the surveys of current business planning ideas and deliberately distorted appraisals antagonistic to the [[General line of the party|general Party line]] (lowering the rates of expansion of socialist construction, distorting the class approach, exaggerating the difficulties), stressing the signs of an impending catastrophe (Groman) or, what is close to this, assigning a negligible chance of success to the Party line directed toward the socialist attack (Bazarov, Gukhman)..."&lt;ref&gt;Naum Jasny, ''Soviet Industrialization, 1928-1952.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961; pg. 69, quoting ''Protsess kontrrevoliutsionnoi organizatsii Men'shevikov,'' pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although excluded from the public trial which besmirched him, Bazarov was tried in secret and sentenced to a term of prison for his alleged wrecking activities.&lt;ref&gt;Jasny,  ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pg. 137, citing an article in ''Pravda'' of December 24, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; A December 1931 letter from the USSR published in the Menshevik journal ''Sotsialisticheskii vestnik'' (Socialist Herald) reported that Bazarov was being held at that time in a political "isolator" at [[Yaroslavl]].&lt;ref&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Economists of the Twenties,'' pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===

Bazarov died September 16, 1939 in Moscow. He was 65 years old at the time of his death.

In 1999 a two volume collection of documents relating to the [[1931 Menshevik Trial]] was published in Russia. Included were the text of several handwritten depositions collected from Bazarov during the process of his interrogation during the summer of 1930.&lt;ref&gt;See: Litvin (ed.), ''Men'sheviistskiii protsess 1931 goda,'' vol. 1, pp. 46-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">The '''von Neumann–Wigner interpretation''', also described as "'''consciousness causes collapse''' [of the wave function]", is an [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] in which [[consciousness]] is postulated to be necessary for the completion of the process of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]].

== Background: observation in quantum mechanics ==
In the orthodox [[Copenhagen interpretation]], quantum mechanics predicts only the probabilities for different outcomes of pre-specified observations. What constitutes an "observer" or an "observation" is not directly specified by the theory, and the behavior of a system upon observation is completely different than its usual behavior: the wavefunction that describes a system spreads out into an ever-larger superposition of different possible situations. However, during observation, the wavefunction describing the system collapses to one of several options. If there is no observation, this collapse does not occur, and none of the options ever becomes less likely.

It can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. The observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. Still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. This apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see [[Measurement problem]]).

== The interpretation ==

In his 1932 book ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]] to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the "subjective perception" of the human observer.  In 1939, [[Fritz London]] and Edmond Bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;F. London and E. Bauer, "La théorie de l’observation en mécanique quantique" (1939), English translation in ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', edited by J. A. Wheeler and W. H. Zurek, Princeton University, Princeton, 1983, pp. 217–259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, [[Eugene Wigner]]&lt;ref name="Wigner"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1119/1.1973829| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1169–1170| last = Wigner| first = Eugene| author2 = Henry Margenau| title = Remarks on the Mind Body Question, in Symmetries and Reflections, Scientific Essays| journal = American Journal of Physics| accessdate = 2009-07-30| date = 1967| url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| bibcode = 1967AmJPh..35.1169W| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130112081842/http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| archive-date = 2013-01-12| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; reformulated the "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" [[thought experiment]] as "[[Wigner's friend]]" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line that precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation.  See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and measurement|Consciousness and measurement]]. The non-physical mind is postulated to be the only true measurement apparatus.&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9501014v5 Schreiber, Z. ''The Nine Lives of Schrödingers's Cat''].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudolf Peierls]] was also a proponent of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. W. Davies and J. R. Brown (editors), ''The Ghost in the Atom'', Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation has been summarized thus:&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The rules of quantum mechanics are correct but there is only one system which may be treated with quantum mechanics, namely the entire material world. There exist external observers which cannot be treated within quantum mechanics, namely human (and perhaps animal) ''minds'', which perform [[quantum measurement|measurement]]s on the brain causing wave function collapse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Henry Stapp]] has argued for the concept as follows:&lt;ref name="Stapp2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. Stapp |title=Quantum Theory and the Role of Mind in Nature |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=1465–1499 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1012682413597|arxiv=quant-ph/0103043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the point of view of the mathematics of quantum theory it makes no sense to treat a measuring device as intrinsically different from the collection of atomic constituents that make it up. A device is just another part of the physical universe...  Moreover, the conscious thoughts of a human observer ought to be causally connected ''most directly and immediately'' to what is happening in his brain, not to what is happening out at some measuring device...  Our bodies and brains thus become ... parts of the quantum mechanically described physical universe. Treating the entire physical universe in this unified way provides a conceptually simple and logically coherent theoretical foundation...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Objections to the interpretation ==

There are other possible solutions to the "Wigner's friend" thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes.  Moreover, Wigner actually shifted to those interpretations (and away from "consciousness causes collapse") in his later years. This was partly because he was embarrassed that "consciousness causes collapse" can lead to a kind of [[solipsism]], but also because he decided that he had been wrong to try to apply quantum physics at the scale of everyday life (specifically, he rejected his initial idea of treating macroscopic objects as isolated systems).&lt;ref name=Esfeld&gt;Michael Esfeld, (1999), [http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/philo/shared/DocsPerso/EsfeldMichael/1999/SHPMP99.pdf Essay Review: Wigner’s View of Physical Reality], published in Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 30B, pp. 145–154, Elsevier Science Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and Superposition|Consciousness and Superposition]].

To many scientists this interpretation fails to compete with other [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] because "consciousness causes collapse" relies upon an [[Interactionism (philosophy of mind)|interactionist]] form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] that is inconsistent with the [[materialism]] presupposed by many physicists.&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; The [[measurement problem]] notwithstanding, they point to a [[Causal closure|causal closure of physics]], suggesting a problem with how consciousness and matter might interact, reminiscent of objections to Descartes' [[substance dualism]].

{{quote|The only form of [[interactionist dualism]] that has seemed even remotely tenable in the contemporary picture is one that exploits certain properties of quantum mechanics. There are two ways this might go. First, some [e.g., [[How the Self Controls Its Brain|Eccles 1986&amp;#x5D;]] have appealed to the existence of [[quantum indeterminacy]], and have suggested that a nonphysical consciousness might be responsible for filling the resultant causal gaps, [[determinism|determining]] which values some physical magnitudes might take within an apparently "[[probabilistic]]" distribution… This is an audacious and interesting suggestion, but it has a number of problems… A second way in which quantum mechanics bears on the issue of [[causal closure]] lies with the fact that in some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations of the quantum formalism]], consciousness itself plays a vital causal role, being required to bring about the so-called "[[wave function collapse|collapse of the wave-function]]." This collapse is supposed to occur upon any act of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]]; and in one interpretation, the only way to distinguish a measurement from a nonmeasurement is via the presence of consciousness. This theory is certainly not universally accepted (for a start, it ''presupposes'' that consciousness is not itself [[physicalism|physical]], surely contrary to the views of most physicists), and I do not accept it myself, but in any case it seems that the kind of causal work consciousness performs here is quite different from the kind required for consciousness to play a role in [[free will|directing behavior]]… In any case, all versions of interactionist dualism have a conceptual problem that suggests that they are less successful in avoiding [[epiphenomenalism]] than they might seem; or at least they are no better off than &amp;#x5B;[[naturalistic dualism]]&amp;#x5D;. Even on these views, there is a sense in which the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] is irrelevant. We can always subtract the phenomenal component from any explanatory account, yielding a purely [[causality|causal]] component.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chalmers |year=1996 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |series=Philosophy of Mind Series |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-983935-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgiH-feUyIC&amp;pg=PA156 |pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[David Chalmers]]|"The Irreducibility of Consciousness" in ''The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory''}}

The interpretation has also been criticized for not explaining which things have sufficient consciousness to collapse the wave function. Also, it posits an important role for the conscious mind, and it has been questioned how this could be the case for the earlier universe, before consciousness had evolved or emerged.  It has been argued that "[consciousness causes collapse] does not allow sensible discussion of [[Big Bang]] cosmology or biological [[evolution]]".&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; For example, [[Roger Penrose]] remarked: "[T]he evolution of conscious life on this planet is due to appropriate mutations having taken place at various times.  These, presumably, are quantum events, so they would exist only in linearly superposed form until they finally led to the evolution of a conscious being—whose very existence depends on all the right mutations having 'actually' taken place!"&lt;ref&gt;R. Penrose, ''The Emperor's New Mind'', Penguin Books, 1989, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others further suppose a universal mind (see also [[panpsychism]] and [[panexperientialism]]). To most physicists{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, this merely pushes the problem back, which some see as a fatal [[Occam's razor|unparsimonious]] move in a competition with [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|other theories]].

Recently, it has been argued that the results of [[delayed-choice quantum eraser]] experiments preclude this interpretation.&lt;ref name=Yu_and_Nikolic&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yu S., Nikolić D. | year = 2011 | title = Quantum mechanics needs no consciousness | url = http://www.danko-nikolic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Yu-and-Nikolic-Qm-and-consciousness-Annalen-Physik.pdf | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 523 | issue = 11| pages = 931–938 | doi = 10.1002/andp.201100078|bibcode = 2011AnP...523..931Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the experiment has also been used to argue for support of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4834&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers have expressed similar objections to the introduction of any subjective element in the collapse of the wavefunction.&lt;ref name=Mandel&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mandel L. | year = 1999 | title = Quantum effects in one-photon and two-photon interference | journal = Rev.

== Reception ==

A poll was conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 using 33 participants (including physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers). Researchers found that 6% of participants (2 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a distinguished physical role (e.g., wave-function collapse by consciousness)". This poll also states that 55% (18 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role". They also mention that "Popular accounts have sometimes suggested that the Copenhagen interpretation attributes such a role to consciousness. In our view, this is to misunderstand the Copenhagen interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Schlosshauer |author2=J. Koer |author3=A.

=== Views of the pioneers of quantum mechanics ===

Many of the originators of quantum mechanical theory held that humans can effectively interrogate nature through interacting with it, and that in this regard quantum mechanics is not different from [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wiley| last = Bohr| first = Niels| title = Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge| year = 1958}}, pp. 73, 81: "The freedom of experimentation, presupposed in classical physics, is of course retained and corresponds to the free choice of experimental arrangement for which the mathematical structure of the quantum mechanical formalism offers the appropriate latitude.  ...  In the great drama of existence we ourselves are both actors and spectators.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 32: "[T]he measuring device has been constructed by the observer, and we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Dialectica |author=Wolfgang Pauli| title= Naturwissenschaftliche und erkenntnistheoretische Aspekte der Ideen vom Unbewussten| volume=8| pages=283–301| year= 1954| doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1954.tb01265.x}} as translated in Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas, ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 13(3), 5-50 (2006):  "Pauli’s ideas on mind and matter in the context of contemporary science": “Once the physical observer has chosen his experimental arrangement, he has no further influence on the result which is objectively registered and generally accessible. Subjective properties of the observer or his psychological state are as irrelevant in the quantum mechanical laws of nature as in classical physics.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Werner Heisenberg maintained that [[wave function collapse]], "The discontinuous change in the probability function", takes place when the result of a measurement is registered in the mind of an observer. However, this is because he understood the probability function as an artifact of human knowledge: he also argued that the reality of the material transition from "possible" to "actual" was mind-independent. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 28. ("The transition from the 'possible' to the 'actual' takes place  as soon as the interaction of the object with the measuring device, and thereby the rest of the world, has come into play; it is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the observer.   The discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with the act of registration, because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant of registration that has its image in the discontinuous change of the probability function.")&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Albert Einstein]], who believed in [[philosophical realism|realism]], and did not accept the theoretical completeness of quantum mechanics, similarly appealed for the merely epistemic conception of the wave function:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“[I advocate] that one conceives of the psi-function [i.e., wavefunction] only as an incomplete description of a real state of affairs, where the incompleteness of the description is forced by the fact that observation of the state is only able to grasp part of the real factual situation. Then one can at least escape the singular conception that observation (conceived as an act of consciousness) influences the real physical state of things; the change in the psi-function through observation then does not correspond essentially to the change in a real matter of fact but rather to the alteration in ''our knowledge'' of this matter of fact.”&lt;ref&gt;A. Einstein to W. Heitler, 1948, translated in A. Fine, ''Einstein’s Interpretations of Quantum Theory'' p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heisenberg and Bohr described quantum mechanics in [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science |author=John Honner |title= Niels Bohr and the Mysticism of Nature |volume=17-3 |pages=243–253 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences - which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy or convenience.&lt;ref name="Bohr1928"&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Nature |author=Niels Bohr| title= The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory| volume=121 |pages=580–590| year= 1928 |url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v121/n3050/abs/121580a0.html | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B }} ": "[T]he quantum postulate implies that any observation of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction with the agency of observation not to be neglected. Accordingly, an independent reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation.  After all, the concept of observation is in so far arbitrary as it depends upon which objects are included in the system to be observed.  Ultimately, every observation can, of course, be reduced to our sense perceptions.  The circumstance, however, that in interpreting observations use has always to be made of theoretical notions entails that for every particular case it is a question of convenience at which point the concept of observation involving the quantum postulate with its inherent "irrationality" is brought in."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in [[Nazi Germany]]''' were subject to doctrines of [[Nazism]] by the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), promoting exclusion of women from political life of Germany along with its executive body as well as its executive committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histoire-en-questions.fr/deuxieme%20guerre%20mondiale/allemagne%20femmes.html |title=La femme sous le regime Nazi |publisher=Histoire-en-questions.fr |date= |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franz-Willing 1962"&gt;{{cite book|last=Franz-Willing|first=Georg|authorlink=Georg Franz-Willing|title=Die Hitlerbewegung.|year=1962|publisher=R. v. Deckers Verlag G. Schenck, Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Nazi party decreed that "women could be admitted to neither the Party executive nor to the Administrative Committee",&lt;ref name="Franz-Willing 1962"/&gt; this did not prevent numerous women from becoming party members. The Nazi doctrine elevated the role of German men, emphasizing their combat skills and the brotherhood among male compatriots.&lt;ref name="le-iiie-reich-et-les-femmes"&gt;{{cite web|title=le-iiie-reich-et-les-femmes|url=http://deuxiemeguerremondia.forumactif.com/t7692-le-iiie-reich-et-les-femmes|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women lived within a regime characterized by a policy of confining them to the roles of mother and spouse and excluding them from all positions of responsibility, notably in the political and academic spheres. The policies of Nazism contrasted starkly with the evolution of emancipation under the [[Weimar Republic]], and is equally distinguishable from the patriarchal and conservative attitude under the [[German Empire]]. The regimentation of women at the heart of satellite organizations of the Nazi Party, as the {{Lang|de|[[Bund Deutscher Mädel]]}} or the {{Lang|de|[[NS-Frauenschaft]]}}, had the ultimate goal of encouraging the cohesion of the "people's community" {{Lang|de|Volksgemeinschaft}}.

First and foremost in the implied Nazi doctrine concerning women was the notion of motherhood and procreation for those of child-bearing ages.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson (2001). ''Women in Nazi Germany'', p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi model woman did not have a career, but was responsible for the education of her children and for housekeeping. Women only had a limited right to training revolving around domestic tasks, and were, over time, restricted from teaching in universities, from medical professions and from serving in political positions within the NSDAP.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson (2001). ''Women in Nazi Germany'', pp.&amp;nbsp;17-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Many restrictions were lifted once wartime necessity dictated changes to policy later in the regime's existence. With the exception of ''Reichsführerin'' [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]], no women were allowed to carry out official functions, however some exceptions stood out in the regime, either through their proximity to [[Adolf Hitler]], such as [[Magda Goebbels]], or by excelling in particular fields, such as filmmaker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] or aviator [[Hanna Reitsch]].

Henceforth, while many women played an influential role at the heart of the Nazi system or filled official posts at the heart of the [[Nazi concentration camps]],&lt;ref&gt;Lower (2013). ''Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields'', pp.&amp;nbsp;97-144.&lt;/ref&gt; a few were engaged in the [[German resistance]] and paid with their lives, such as [[Libertas Schulze-Boysen]] or [[Sophie Scholl]].

==Background==
Under the [[Weimar Republic]], the status of women was one of the most progressive in Europe. The [[Weimar Constitution]] of January 19, 1919 proclaimed their right to vote (articles 17 and 22), equality of the sexes in civic matters (art. 109), non-discrimination against female bureaucrats (art. 128), maternity rights (art. 19) and spousal equality within marriage (art. 119).&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Bénédicte Vincent,'' Histoire de la société allemande au XXe siècle. Tome I. Le premier XXe siècle. 1900–1949'', Paris, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clara Zetkin]], a prominent leader of the German feminist movement, was a Member of Parliament in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] from 1920 to 1933 and even presided over the assembly in the role of Dean. But Weimar did not represent a huge leap forward for women's liberation. Women remained under-represented in the parliament; motherhood continued to be promoted as women's most important social function; abortion was still prosecutable (§ 218 of the Criminal Code); and female workers did not achieve substantial economic progress such as equal salaries.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Bénédicte Vincent,'' Histoire de la société allemande au XXe siècle. Tome I. Le premier XXe siècle. 1900–1949'', Paris, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of [[consumerism]], businesses and government had an increasing need for labour; although work became a route to emancipation for women, they were often restricted to clerical work as secretaries or sales staff, where they were generally paid 10 to 20% less than male employees,{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=32}}  under various pretexts, such as the claim that their understanding of domestic tasks freed them from certain household expenses.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H02370, Sekretärin an Schreibmaschine.jpg|thumb|German woman secretary, in 1938.]]

While most of the other parties under the Weimar Republic ran female candidates during elections (and some were elected), the Nazi party did not. In 1933, [[Joseph Goebbels]] justified this position by explaining that "it is necessary to leave to men that which belongs to men ".{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=27}} Germany went from having 37 female Members of Parliament out of 577, to none, after the [[German election, November 1933|election of November 1933]].{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=27}}

===Beginning of the Nazi regime===
[[Adolf Hitler]]'s attaining power as Chancellor marked the end of numerous women's rights, even though Hitler had succeeded in his social rise in part thanks to the protection of influential women.&lt;ref&gt;Fabrice d'Almeida, ''La Vie mondaine sous le nazisme'', 2008, chapter "Naissance de la haute société nazie".&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of voting patterns however, a higher proportion of male voters supported the Nazi party compared to female voters.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;Richard F. Hamilton, ''Who voted for Hitler?'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's socializing within affluent circles, and with socialites such as Princess [[Elsa Bruckmann]], wife of the editor [[Hugo Bruckmann]], and [[Helene Bechstein]], wife of industrialist {{Interlanguage link multi|Edwin Bechstein|de}},&lt;ref&gt;Fabrice d'Almeida, ''La Vie mondaine sous le nazisme'', 2008, pages 35 et 41.&lt;/ref&gt; early on brought the [[Nazi party]] significant new sources of financing. For example, Gertrud von Seidlitz, a widow of a noble family, donated 30,000 marks to the party in 1923;&lt;ref&gt;Fabrice d'Almeida, ''La Vie mondaine sous le nazisme'', 2008, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and Helene Bechstein, who had an estate on the Obersalzberg, facilitated Hitler's acquisition of the property Wachenfeld.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund (2000). ''Women of the Third Reich'', p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, during a speech to the National-Socialist Women's Congress, Hitler declared, with regard to women's rights: {{Blockquote|in reality, the granting of so-called equal rights to women, as demanded by [[Marxism]], does not confer equal rights at all, but constitutes the deprivation of rights, since they draw women into a zone where they can only be inferior. It places women in situations where they cannot strengthen their position with regard to men and with society – but it only weakens them.&lt;ref name="le-iiie-reich-et-les-femmes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'', September 15, 1935, available at the Wiener Library&lt;/ref&gt; }} The fact that Hitler was unmarried and that he represented a masculine ideal for many Germans led to his erotisation in the public imagination. In April 1923, an article appeared in the [[Münchener Post]] stating "women adore Hitler ";&lt;ref name="Franz-Willing 1962"/&gt; he was described as adapting his speeches to "the tastes of women who, since the beginning, count among his most fervent admirers".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Zoller, ''Hitler privat'', Düsseldorf, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also sometimes instrumental in bringing their husbands into the Nazi political fold, thus contributing to the recruitment of new NSDAP members.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund (2000). ''Women of the Third Reich'', pp.&amp;nbsp;8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a society that was beginning to consider women as men's equals, Nazi policies constituted a setback, forcing women from political life. The Nazis' policies pertaining to women were one aspect of their efforts to stem what they viewed as the decadence of the Weimar Republic. In their eyes, the Weimar regime, which they perceived as having a Jewish character, in effect appeared as feminized, as well as tolerant of homosexuality&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the veritable antithesis of German virility.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[Heinrich Himmler]] declared as much{{clarify|date=May 2016}} to the SS-Gruppenführer, on February 18, 1937: {{Blockquote|On the whole, in my view, we have too much masculinized our life, to the point that we are militarizing impossible things [...] For me, it is a catastrophe that women's organizations, women's communities and women's societies intervene in a domain that destroys all feminine charm, all the feminine majesty and grace. For me, it is a catastrophe that we other poor male fools - I speak generally, because this does not mean you directly, we want to make women an instrument of logical thought, to educate them in everything possible, that we want to masculinize with time the difference between the sexes, the polarity will disappear. The path to homosexuality is not far. [...] We must be very clear. The movement, the ideology cannot be sustained if it is worn by women, because man conceives of everything through the mind, whereas women grasp everything through sentiment. [...] The priests burned 5,000 to 6,000 women [for witchcraft], because they preserve emotionally the ancient wisdom and ancient teachings, and because, emotionally, they do not let go, whereas men, they are logically and rationally disposed.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Longerich, ''Himmler'', Paris, 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;230-231&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Officially, the status of women changed from "equal rights" ({{Lang|de|Gleichberechtigung}}) to an "equivalence" between men and women ({{Lang|de|Gleichstellung}}).{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=33}} Historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Ayçoberry|fr}} points out that "this offensive offered the double advantage of pleasing their male colleagues worried by this competition, and returned to private life more than 100,000 people proud of their success, the majority of whom were voters who supported the political left". This policy created worry among the militants in the NSDAP, who were concerned that it would harm the number of female graduates, a reservoir needed for future party ranks.&lt;ref name="Ayçoberry 2008 193"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayçoberry|first=Pierre|title=La société allemande sous le IIIe Reich, 1933-1945|year=2008|publisher=éditions du Seuil|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Withdrawal from higher education===
In 1933, school programmes for girls were changed, notably with the goal of discouraging them from pursuing university studies. The five years of Latin classes and three years of science were replaced by courses in German language and domestic skills training.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=33}} This did not bear productive results; on the one hand, a significant number of girls enrolled in boys' schools, while on the other hand, the " enrollment restrictions " of 10% at the university level were generally ignored. Thus, the measures only decreased the enrollment in medical schools from 20% to 17%.&lt;ref name="Ayçoberry 2008 193"/&gt;

Some women's associations, notably communist and socialist groups were banned, and in some rare cases members were arrested or assassinated.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=31}} All associations were requested to turn in Jewish members, such as the Union of Protestant Women, the Association of Household and Countryside, the Women's German Colonial Society Union and the Union of Queen Louise.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=31}} But rapidly, the majority of the associations disbanded or chose among themselves to disappear, such as the BDF ([[Bund Deutscher Frauenverein]]), established in 1894 and which disbanded in 1933 to avoid being controlled.&lt;ref name="Incent 2011 42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Incent|first=Marie-Bénédicte|title=Histoire de la société allemande au XXe siècle. Tome I. Le premier XXe siècle. 1900-1949|year=2011|location=Paris|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only one women's association persisted under the regime (the association of  [[Gertrud Bäumer]], Die Frau, or Woman), until 1944, but placed under the guardianship of the Reich Minister of People's Education and of Propaganda, [[Joseph Goebbels]].{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=32}} [[Rudolf Hess]] established the [[Deutsches Frauenwerk]] which, with the women's branch of the Nazi party, the [[NS-Frauenschaft]], had the purpose of becoming a mass organization for the regime.&lt;ref name="Incent 2011 42"/&gt;

[[File:Frauen Warte - 1.Juni 1939 (front).JPG|thumb|The Nazi [[NS-Frauen-Warte]] magazine for women, 1st edition, 1939]]

In 1936, a law was passed banning certain high-level positions in the judicial system to women (notably judge and prosecutor, through Hitler's personal intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayçoberry|first=Pierre|title=La société allemande sous le IIIe Reich, 1933-1945|year=2008|publisher=éditions du Seuil|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the medical field. Female doctors were no longer allowed to practice, until their loss had a harmful effect on health needs and some were recalled to work; also dissolved was the Association of Medical Women, which was absorbed into its male counterpart.&lt;ref name="Ayçoberry 2008 193"/&gt; Under the Weimar Republic, only 1% of university posts were filled by women. On June 8, 1937, a decree stipulated that only men could be named to these posts, if it was not in a social field. Nonetheless, on February 21, 1938 " in an individual and exceptional capacity " following lobbying by [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]],&lt;ref&gt;Anna Maria Sigmund, ''Les femmes du IIIe Reich, 2004, page 180.&lt;/ref&gt; one female scientist [[Margarete Gussow]] obtained a post in astronomy. Mathematician [[Ruth Moufang]] was able to receive her doctorate, but could not obtain the right to teach and was forced to work for national industry.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Josiane Olff-Nathan, ''La science sous le Troisième Reich'', éditions du Seuil, 1993, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emmy Noether]], another mathematician, was terminated from her post by virtue of the "German law for the Restoration of the Public Service" of April 7, 1933, for having been active in the 1920s in the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]. Physics researcher [[Lise Meitner]], who directed the Department of Physics at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]], was able to remain in her post until 1938, but this was only due to her Austrian nationality, which ended with the [[Anschluss]]); she then left for the Netherlands, and then Sweden. In the scientific field, there were almost no nominations of women; in 1942, a woman was not permitted to direct a scientific institute, despite the fact that no male candidate had applied.&lt;ref name="Les femmes ont-elles été nazies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Les femmes ont-elles été nazies ?|url=http://www.delpla.org/article.php3?id_article=200|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exile of women from political life was total:  they could not sit in either the Reichstag, the regional parliaments or municipal councils.

There was no substantial resistance to this control. The bourgeois women's associations reasoned, as did many others, that the Nazi government was a vulgar phenomenon that would soon fade, and that through their participation they could still exert some influence.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=32}} They thus deluded themselves into believing that they were obtaining an "acceptable arrangement", as they were accustomed to do under a patriarchal system. With respect to the widespread tendency to underestimate the threat that the regime presented, the historian Claudia Koonz highlights the popular proverb of the era: "The soup is never eaten as hot as it is cooked".{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=32}} Women who were the most resolute in their opposition either set their sights on emigration, or, if they took an active stance, risked being arrested and interned, and possibly executed, the same as male opponents of the regime.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=32}}

===Partial recovery of 1937===
Noticing the need for women in certain professions and their usefulness in the country's economy, the anti-emancipation policy in terms of the workforce was rapidly blunted. Women were otherwise invited to adhere to Nazism and reassured with the idea that they could be a mother and be employed, [[Joseph Goebbels]] even attacking anti-lipstick propaganda campaigns in [[Völkischer Beobachter]] and attacking the most zealous ideologues.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=33}}

==Nazi feminine ideal==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1973-010-31, Mutter mit Kindern.jpg|thumb|[[Nazi]] propaganda photo: A mother, her daughters and her son in the uniform of the [[Hitler Youth]] pose for the magazine ''[[SS-Leitheft]]'' February 1943.]]

===New Woman===
The Nazi woman had to conform to the German society desired by Adolf Hitler ([[Volksgemeinschaft]]), racially pure and physically robust. She did not work, living in the naturalization of motherhood and following the slogan of the former emperor [[William II of Germany]]: [[Kinder, Küche, Kirche]], meaning "Children, kitchen, church". In a document published in 1934, ''The Nine Commandments of the Workers' Struggle'', [[Hermann Göring|Hermann Goering]] bluntly summarizes the future role of German women: "Take a pot, a dustpan and a broom and marry a man".&lt;ref name="Women in the Third Reich"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the Third Reich|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005205|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le IIIe Reich et les Femmes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le IIIe Reich et les Femmes|url=http://deuxiemeguerremondia.forumactif.com/t7692-le-iiie-reich-et-les-femmes|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was anti-feminism in the sense that the Nazis considered political rights granted to women (access to high-level positions for example) as incompatible with the nature of reproduction, the only role within which they could blossom and best serve the interests of the nation. Thus, [[Magda Goebbels]] declared in 1933: "German women were excluded from three professions: the army, as elsewhere in the world; the government; and the judiciary. If a German girl must choose between marriage or a career, she will always be encouraged to marry, because that is what is best for a woman".&lt;ref name="Le IIIe Reich et les Femmes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Vossische Zeitung'', July 6, 1933, available in the Wiener Library Clipping Collection&lt;/ref&gt; It is not possible to make a mental leap to the conservative and patriarchal societies that prevailed for example during the Second Empire; in effect, the totalitarian character of the regime moved away from the concept that had been made of women being put on a shelf by society. On the contrary, they were expected to participate at the ground level in the roles of mother and spouse. The fact that the regimentation of women ([[Bund Deutscher Mädel]] then [[Frauenschaft]]) being so organized, did not permit relegating women to what they could do in the 19th century. Without a doubt, a conservative electorate and a fringe part of the population very critical of the image of the emancipated woman from the 1920s found a certain satisfaction in the new regime. But the goals were different, asking each woman to take part in the building of the "Reich of 1000 years". Female liberation found itself therefore necessarily limited, and Heide Schlüpmann stated conclusively in ''Frauen und Film'', that the films of [[Leni Riefenstahl]] (the official film director of the regime) "value quite a negation of female sexuality and only offer women a deceptive autonomy".

===Prohibitions and obligations===
The wearing of makeup was generally prohibited, and a certain modesty was demanded of women, contrasting with the Weimar Republic period, which experienced more freedom on a moral level. In 1933, meetings of the NSBO (National Sozialistischer Betriebs Obman, the women's section of the [[Deutsche Arbeitsfront|German Workers' Front]]) proclaimed that women "painted and powdered were forbidden at all meetings of the NSBO. Women who smoked in public – in hotels, cafés, in the street and so on – will be excluded from NSBO".&lt;ref&gt;''Frankfurter Zeitung'', August 11, 1933, available in the Wiener Library Clipping Collection&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le IIe Reich et les Femmes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le IIe Reich et les Femmes|url=http://deuxiemeguerremondia.forumactif.com/t7692-le-iiie-reich-et-les-femmes|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities considered more or less traditional were limited to recommended places: music, manual labour, gymnastics. Sexuality was banned, unless for a reproductive goal; liberated young women were considered "depraved" and "antisocial". Mothers were encouraged to have children: thus was created the "Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter" (in English: [[Cross of Honour of the German Mother]]) for mothers having brought into the world more than four children. A "German Mothers' Day" was also created; during that of 1939, three million mothers were decorated.&lt;ref name="Le IIe Reich et les Femmes"/&gt; Concerning abortion, access to services was quickly prohibited, until in 1935, the medical profession became obliged to report stillbirths to the Regional Office for State Health, who would further investigate the natural loss of a child; in 1943 the ministers of the Interior and Justice enacted the law "Protection of Marriage, Family and Motherhood", which made provisions for the death penalty for mothers convicted of infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ces ombres du Troisieme Reich|url=http://www.lepanoptique.com/sections/histoire/ces-ombres-du-troisieme-reich-les-femmes-allemandes-victimes-ou-complices/|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical standards===
In line with [[Nazism and race|Nazi racial theory]], the Nazi government promoted the "[[Aryan]]" ([[Nordic race|Nordic]]) archetype as the ideal physical appearance: women were to be blonde, beautiful, tall, thin and robust all at once. This image was spread as much through advertising as through official art, then through ancient art, and more specifically through Greco-Roman statues. Academic Monique Moser-Verrey notes: "a revival, during the course of the Thirties, of mythological themes such as the [[Judgement of Paris]]."{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=26}} Moser-Verrey notes however:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet it is striking that the image of women projected by women's literature of the 1930s is clearly contrary to traditional views of sweet housewife spread by [[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] and [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]]. The heroines of women's novels during this period are often a strong and tenacious type of woman, while the sons and husbands are quickly delivered to death. Everything happens as if one perceives through these fictions a true antagonism between the sexes generated by the constant mobilisation of these two groups independent of one another.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=38}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fashion===
Fashion for women in Nazi Germany was problematic for Nazi officials. The Nazi government wanted to propagandize the "Aryan" woman. In various posters and other forms of media, this ideal Nazi woman was strong, fertile, and wore historically traditional [[Dirndl|German clothing]].&lt;ref name="Guenther 2004 113"&gt;{{cite book|last=Guenther|first=Irene|title=Fashion Women in the Third Reich|date=2004|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Nazi officials also did not want to hinder the German clothing or fashion industries from creating profit, as the government also sought to create a consumerist society based for the most part on German domestic products.&lt;ref name="Wiesen 2011 50–80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiesen|first=Jonathan|title=Creating the Nazi Marketplace: Commerce and Consumption in the Third Reich|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge|pages=50–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These differences in goals often led to disparities in what was considered fashionable, nationalistic, and politically correct for women in Nazi Germany.

However, although there was disagreement over how to ideally fashion German "Aryan" women, anti-Semitic, anti-American, and anti-French Nazi rhetoric played a key part in molding German women's fashion ideology.&lt;ref name="Guenther 2004 113"/&gt; The Nazis severely criticized the [[1920s in Western fashion|Western fashions of the 1920s]], claiming the Jazz [[Flapper]] fashion to be "French-Dominated" and "severely Jewish."  Additionally, the Nazi Party was strictly against the Flapper style because they felt it masculinized women and created an immoral ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makela|first=Maria|title=The Rise and Fall of the Flapper Dress: Nationalism and AntiSemitism in Early-Twentieth-Century Discourses on German Fashion|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=2004|volume=XXXIV|series=3|pages=183–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Nazi propaganda was reliant on shunning women to the private sphere as housewives and mother figures, the want to abolish 1920's fashion in Nazi Germany was logical.&lt;ref name="Guenther 2004 113"/&gt;

Yet, while the Nazi government sought to create a maternal ideal for the Aryan woman, they also sought financial gain from the textile industry.&lt;ref name="Wiesen 2011 50–80"/&gt;  While Hitler urged women to consume, he concluded that women must only consume German products.&lt;ref name="Guenther 2004 113"/&gt;  The creation of a German Fashion Institute that sought to create a Western high fashion niche market created varying opinions on how fashion and Nazi politics should interact.

==Regimentation of women==
The compulsory education for girls was not neglected and boys and girls were placed on the same footing at schools. Girls were encouraged to pursue secondary education but university courses were closed to them. Beginning in 1935 they were required to fulfill a work period of six months for the benefit of the service of women's work, the ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]''  ''Deutscher Frauenarbeitsdienst''. Adolf Hitler declared, on April 12, 1942, that the schools of the Reich must gather "boys and girls from all classes" to meet "all the youth of the Reich".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les femmes: ont-elles etes nazis?|url=http://www.delpla.org/article.php3?id_article=200|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The education manual ''Das kommende Deutschland'' notes that: {{Blockquote|The Jungmädel (young girl) must know a) the date and place of the birth of the Führer, and be able to recount his life. b) She is capable of recounting the history of the movement and the struggle of the SA and  the Hitler Youth. c) She knows the living collaborators of the Führer."&lt;ref name="Les femmes ont-elles été nazies"/&gt; }} It was also required that they know the geography of Germany, its hymns as well as the clauses of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Les femmes ont-elles été nazies"/&gt;
The BDM was particularly regarded as instructing females to avoid ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement), which was treated with particular importance for young females in order to preserve the [[Aryan race]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/fink.htm The Jewish Question in Education]"&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, repeated efforts were made to propagate Volkstum ("racial consciousness"), to prevent sexual relations between Germans and any foreign workers. Nazi propaganda published pamphlets that enjoined all German women to avoid sexual relations with all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their blood.&lt;ref&gt;Leila J. Rupp, ''Mobilising Women for War'', p 124–5, {{ISBN|0-691-04649-2}}, {{OCLC|3379930}}&lt;/ref&gt; German women accused of racial defilement were paraded through the streets with a shaved head and placard around her neck detailing her crime.&lt;ref name="Evans2006"&gt;{{cite book| author= Richard J.

[[Robert Gellately]] in ''The Gestapo and German Society. Enforcing Racial Policy 1933–1945'' writes about such cases of German women being found guilty of sexual relations with prisoners of war and foreigner workers. One case in March 1941 was of a married woman who had an affair with a French prisoner of war had her head shaved and was marched through the town of Bramberg in Lower Franconia carrying a sign which said, "''I have sullied the honour of the German woman.''"&lt;ref name="Gellately1990"&gt;{{cite book| author= Robert Gellately| title=The Gestapo and German Society: Enforcing Racial Policy, 1933-1945| year=1990| publisher= Clarendon Press| ISBN= 978-0-19-820297-4| pages= 238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another case was Dora von Calbitz who in September 1940 was found guilty of having sexual relations with a Pole. She had her head shaved and was placed in the pillory of her town of Oschatz near Leipzig, with a sign that proclaimed, "''I have been a dishonourable German woman in that I sought and had relations with Poles. By doing that I excluded myself from the [[Volksgemeinschaft|community of the people]].''"&lt;ref name="Gellately19901"&gt;{{cite book| author= Robert Gellately| title=The Gestapo and German Society: Enforcing Racial Policy, 1933-1945| year=1990| publisher= Clarendon Press| ISBN= 978-0-19-820297-4| pages= 236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The education of girls also meant political education;  there already existed elite schools of political studies, the [[Napola]] (Nationalpolitische Anstalten), one for girls opened in 1939 in [[Vienna]] and another in 1942 in [[Luxembourg]]. These institutions did not have a purpose of enabling women to re-enter political life but of endowing the best with the cultural baggage required to occupy posts related to the management of women's affairs. This concerned a very small minority. However, on June 5, 1942, the MInister of Finance [[Lutz Schwerin von Krosigk]], a conservative politician, threatened to cut grants to the second school, if it did not become a simple internship for adolescents, rejecting all political education for girls. Adolf Hitler decided otherwise on June 24, 1943, promising the construction of three new Napola.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-049191, Wusih, Ostereiersuchen.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the BDM at a vacation camp at [[Wuxi]], in the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)]], in 1934.]]
When the [[Hitler Youth]] was devoted to organizing the extra-curricular life of male adolescents, the [[Bund Deutscher Mädel]] (BDM), occupied  female adolescents from 14 to 18 years. Founded in 1934, the movement was needed after the law of December 1, 1936. It was led from 1934 to 1937 by [[Trude Mohr]], then from 1937 to 1945 by the psychologist [[Jutta Rüdiger]]. Young girls were trained for certain employment (social work, cleaning) or farming (Ernteeinsatz, helping with harvest) and practised sports ; but shockingly, as the education manual ''Das kommende Deutschland'' shows, the physical performance demanded was sometimes the same as those of the boys (for example, to run 60 meters in less than 12 seconds).&lt;ref name="Les femmes ont-elles été nazies"/&gt;  Every Wednesday evening, for girls from 15 to 20 years old, the " home parties " took place, for discussing art and culture.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=33}} Vacation camps, held for one week during Summer,{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=33}} in Germany or abroad, were organized. There also existed a required six-month work service, the Reichsarbeitsdienst der weiblichen Jugend (National Young Women's Work Service), completed in 1941 with six extra months in the Kriegshilfsdienst (for the war effort). For young women aged 18 to 25 years old wishing to find work, in 1938 the Pflichtjahr was instituted, one year of obligatory service in farming or domestic work.&lt;ref name="Le IIe Reich et les Femmes"/&gt;

===National Socialist Women's League===
[[File:Frauen Arbeitsdienst.svg|thumb|Service flag for women's work (''Deutscher Frauenarbeitsdienst'').]]

Women could be members of the [[Nazi Party]], but newcomers to the party were only admitted if they were "useful" (nurses or cooks for example).{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=33}} They numbered 5% of women in 1933 and 17% in 1937.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=33}} But since October 1931 the [[NS-Frauenschaft]] (NSF) existed, the political organization for Nazi women, that sought above all to promote the ideal of the model woman of Nazi Germany; at its foundation, it was responsible for training in housekeeping.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=33}} Young women joined when they were 15 years old. On 31 December 1932, the NSF counted 109,320 members. In 1938, it had 2&amp;nbsp;million, corresponding to 40% of the total number of party members. The NSF was directed by [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]], who had the title of Reichsführerin; she called the members "my daughters" and acquired a strong influence over them and a certain credibility. Her views on women were obviously in agreement with those of Adolf Hitler, but she still defended access to some positions of responsibility. She did not participate in major meetings of the party but was invited to the party congress.

School textbooks were edited beginning in 1934, often under the supervision of the doctor {{Interlanguage link multi|Johanna Haarer|de}}, an author notably for ''The German Mother and Her First Baby'', which was widely published, and promoting the driving role of the German mother in building the regime, or ''Mother, tell me about Adolf Hitler'' (''Mutter, erzähl von Adolf Hitler''), to lead women to indoctrinate their children in Nazi values:&lt;ref name="webmail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pelenop.fr/?p=162 |title=Mother, tell me about Adolf Hitler |publisher=Pelenop.fr |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |quote=[http://webmail.ovh.net Webmail.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housekeeping training was promoted through Frauenwerk (German Women's Work), which opened thematic courses for "ethnically pure" women. It is notable, however, that although there were numerous courses for domestic training, gymnastics and music, they deserted those oriented towards antireligious teaching.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=33}}

The [[NS-Frauenschaft]] "played no political role and did not oppose the loss of hard-won women's rights. It defended the role of the mother of the family at home, conscious of their duties at the heart of the community. Provided, containing women within the private sphere does not hide their responsibilities under the Third Reich ; we know today that the Frauenbewegung (women's movement) thought the place of a woman in society was at the heart of a community that excluded Jews and performed a civilizing mission in occupied Eastern Europe to preserve the race".&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Bénédicte Incent,'' Histoire de la société allemande au XXe siècle. Tome I. Le premier XXe siècle. 1900–1949'', Paris, 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
During the Second World War, temporarily contradicting their past claims, the National Socialists changed policy and allowed women to join the German army. Adolf Hitler had already affirmed in a speech to activists of the [[National Socialist Women's League]] on September 13, 1936: "We possess a generation of healthy men - and we, National Socialists, are going to watch - Germany will not form any section of women grenade throwers or any corps of women elite snipers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sigmund|first=Anna Maria|title=Les femmes du IIIe Reich|year=2004|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women were not assigned to combat units during the war, but were regarded as auxiliary military personnel, responsible for logistical and administrative duties in the areas understaffed due to the number of men sent into combat. Other women also worked in factories or in military education. Military members of the ''[[Reichsbahn]]'' (National Company of Railways) or the ''Feuerwehr'' (firefighters) wore uniforms appropriate to the era, especially with a skirt. [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]], NSDAP member and leader of the National Socialist Women's League stated: {{Blockquote| We often hear, even from the women, the most diverse objections against work in arms factories. The question of knowing whether we can require such work of this or that particular woman is now well past.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Maria Sigmund, ''Les femmes du IIIe Reich'', 2004, page 187.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E10868, BDM in der Landwirtschaft.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The caption in the propaganda magazine ''Das Deutsche Mädel'' (May 1942 issue) states: "bringing all the enthusiasm and life force of their youth, our young daughters of the Work Service make their contribution in the [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|German territories 'regained' in the East]].]]

Beginning in 1943, the [[Economy of Nazi Germany|Reich Minister of the Economy]] introduced the job training program called ''Berufsausbildungsprogramm Ost'' for farming duty in the East (not to be confused with the ethnic cleansing of [[Generalplan Ost]]). He extended the existing laws of the Reich, concerning the protection of minors and of employment standards for the ''[[League of German Girls]]'' (''Bund Deutscher Mädel'') ''Osteinsatz'',&lt;ref name="bdmhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdmhistory.com/research/easternaction.html |title=Bund Deutscher Maedel - historical research site |publisher=BDM history.com |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for whom such work was compulsory. Adolescent girls were employed in the Brandebourg Market for the agricultural work program.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 219 {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were active [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|in the resettlement areas]] of [[occupied Poland]] as their assignment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/images/maedel/dm5-42.jpg ''Das Deutsche Mädel'']&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, referring to the decree of January 1943, calling for the mobilization of German women aged 17 to 45, Gertrud Scholtz-Klink from NSDAP said in September of that year at a conference in Bad Schlachen: {{Blockquote|The educated women in the women's league and made available to the Wehrmacht not only have to type and work, but also be soldiers of the Führer.&lt;ref name="z3"&gt;Anna Maria Sigmund, ''Les femmes du IIIeReich'', 2004, page 188.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels in his ''Sportspalast'' speech delivered on February 18, 1943 at the Berlin Sports Hall, called on German women to work, and to be sober in their commitment:
# "What use are beauty salons that encourage a cult of beauty and that takes up an enormous amount of our time and energy? They are wonderful during times of peace, but are a waste of time in a time of war. Our wives and our daughters will be able to welcome our victorious soldiers without their beautiful peacetime adornments."
# "It is why we hire men that do not work in the war economy and women do not work at all. They cannot and will not ignore our request. The duties of women are huge. This is not to say that only those included in the law can work. All are welcome. The more who join the war effort, the more we free up soldiers for the front."
# "For years, millions of German women have worked with brio in war production and they patiently wait to be joined and assisted by other women."
# "Especially for you women, do you want the government to do everything in its power to encourage German women to put all their strength into supporting the war effort, and to let me leave for the front when possible, helping the men at the front?"
# "The great upheavals and crises of national life show us who the real men and women are. We no longer have the right to speak of the weaker sex, since both sexes show the same determination and the same spiritual force."

The mobilisation of women in the war economy always remained limited: the number of women practising a professional activity in 1944 was virtually unchanged from 1939, being about 15&amp;nbsp;million women, in contrast to Great Britain, so that the use of women did not progress and only 1,200,000 of them worked in the arms industry in 1943, in working conditions that were difficult and often poorly treated by their bosses, who deplored their lack of qualification.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Bénédicte Vncent,'' Histoire de la société allemande au XXe siècle. Tome I. Le premier XXe siècle. 1900–1949'', Paris, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;96&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the army (Wehrmacht)===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-768-0147-15, Paris, Wehrmachtshelferinnen.jpg|thumb|Women auxiliaries of the [[Wehrmacht]] in Paris during the occupation (1940).]]

In 1945, there numbered 500,000 women auxiliaries in the Wehrmacht (Wehrmachtshelferinnen),&lt;ref name="Women in the Third Reich"/&gt; who were at the heart of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]], the [[Luftwaffe]] and the [[Kriegsmarine]]. About half of them were volunteers, the others performing obligatory service connected to the war effort (Kriegshilfsdienst). They took part, under the same authority as prisoners of war ([[Hiwi (volunteer)|Hiwi]]s), as auxiliary personnel of the army  (Behelfspersonal) and they were assigned to duties not only within the heart of the Reich, but to a lesser extent, to the occupied territories, for example in the [[General government]] of occupied [[Poland]], in [[France]], and later in [[Yugoslavia]], in [[Greece]] and in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathrin Kompisch: ''Täterinnen. Frauen im Nationalsozialismus'', p.&amp;nbsp;219&lt;/ref&gt;

They essentially participated :
* as telephone, telegraph and transmission operators,
* as administrative clerks [[Copy typist|typists]] and messengers,
* in anti-aircraft defense, as operators of listening equipment, operating projectors for anti-aircraft defense, employees within [[meteorology]] services, and auxiliary civil defense personnel
* in military health service, as volunteer nurses with the German [[Red Cross]] or other voluntary organizations

===In the SS===
[[File:SS women camp guards Bergen-Belsen April 19 1945.jpg|thumb|SS women camp guards in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], 19 April 1945]]

The {{Interlanguage link multi|SS-Gefolge|de}} was the women's wing of the men's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], but in contrast it was only confined to voluntary work in Emergency Service (Notdienstverpflichtung). SS Women belonged either to the ''[[:de:SS-Helferinnenkorps|SS-Helferinnen (de)]]'' or the ''SS-Kriegshelferinnen''. They were in charge of auxiliary transmissions (telephone, radio operators, stenographers) in the SS and sometimes in camps (these were the [[Aufseherin]], see next section). There was an internal hierarchy in the women's wing of the SS, which had no influence on the male troops, although the titles designated to the women sometimes had an influence upon the owners.

The SS-Helferinnen were trained at the Reichsschule-SS at Oberehnheim in Elsass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5U5kXjVq6p0C&amp;pg=PA224 |title=Hitler's Children: The Hitler Youth and the Ss - Gerhard Rempel - Google Books |work=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1183 |title=Das SS-Helferinnenkorps: Ausbildung, Einsatz und Entnazifizierung der weiblichen Angehörigen der Waffen-SS 1942-1949 &amp;#124; Reviews in History |publisher=History.ac.uk |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reichsschule-SS (in full, the Reichsschule für SS Helferinnen Oberenheim) was the training centre for the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], reserved for women, and opened in [[Obernai]] in May 1942 upon the order of [[Heinrich Himmler]].

They had to meet certain physical criteria determined by the regime: they must be aged 17 to 30 years and measure more than {{convert|1.65|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, while over the long term, the enrollment criteria were relaxed (the age limit was raised to 40 years and minimum height dropped to 1.58 metres); they even accepted 15 Muslim students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les filles SS Obernai|url=http://www.witzgilles.com/ecole_de_femmes_ss_obernai.htm|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having been in a privileged status, war widows were favoured before the admissions were opened up to other social classes.

===In the camps===
[[File:Ilse Koch.png|thumb|Debriefing of the Aufseherin of the [[Buchenwald]] concentration camp, [[Ilse Koch]], after her arrest.]]
{{Main article|Female guards in Nazi concentration camps}}

Women were within the ranks of the [[Nazi]]s at the [[Nazi concentration camps]] : these were the [[Aufseherin]] and generally belonged to the  [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. They were guards, secretaries or nurses. They arrived before the start of the war, some of them being trained from 1938 in Lichtenburg. This took place due to the need for personnel following the growing number of political prisoners after the [[Kristallnacht]] on 8 and 9 November 1938. After 1939, they were trained at Camp [[Ravensbrück]] near [[Berlin]]. Coming mostly from lower- or middle-class social origins, they previously worked in traditional professions (hairdresser, teacher, for example) but were, in contrast to men who were required to fulfill military serve, the women were driven by a sincere desire to reach the female wing of the SS, the [[SS-Gefolge]]. Of the 55,000 total number of guards at all the Nazi camps, there were 3,600 women (approximately 10% of the workforce), however, no woman was allowed to give orders to a man.

They worked at the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] camps beginning in 1942. The following year, the Nazis began the conscription of women because of the shortage of guards. Later, during the war, women were also assigned on a smaller scale in the camps [[Neuengamme]] Auschwitz (I, II and III), [[Plaszow]] [[Flossenbürg]], [[Gross-Rosen]] [[Vught]] and [[Stutthof concentration camp|Stutthof]], but never served in the [[extermination camp|death camps]] of [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibór]] [[Treblinka]] or [[Chełmno]]. Seven Aufseherinnen served at [[Vught]], 24 were at [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], 34 at [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], 19 at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], 20 at [[Mauthausen]], three at [[Mittelbau-Dora]], seven at [[Struthof|Natzweiler-Struthof]], twenty at Majdanek, 200 at Auschwitz and its sub-camps, 140 at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], 158 at [[Neuengamme]], 47 at Stutthof, compared with 958 who served at [[Ravensbrück]], 561 at [[Flossenbürg]] and 541 at [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]]. Many supervisors worked in the sub-camps in [[Germany]], some in [[France]], [[Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]].

There was a hierarchy within the ''Aufseherin'' position, including the following higher ranks: the ''Rapportaufseherin'' (head Aufseherin), the ''Erstaufseherin'' (first guard), the ''Lagerführerin'' (head of the camp), and finally, the ''Oberaufseherin'' (senior inspector), a post only occupied by [[Anna Klein (camp warden)|Anna Klein]] and [[Luise Brunner]].

==Female members of discriminated minorities==

Under the same threats as men who were [[Jew]]s or [[Romani people|Romani]], women belonging to these communities were equally discriminated against, then deported and for some exterminated. In many concentration camps there were sections for female detainees (notably at [[Auschwitz]] and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]) but the camp at [[Ravensbrück]], opened in May 1939, distinguished itself as a camp solely for women, by 1945 numbering about 100,000 prisoners. The first women's concentration camp had been opened in 1933 in [[Moringen]], before being transferred to Lichtenburg in 1938.

In concentration camps, women were considered weaker than men, and they were generally sent to the gas chambers more quickly, whereas the strength of men was used to work the men to exhaustion. Some women were subjected to medical experiments.

Some took the path of the Resistance, such as the Polish member [[Haika Grossman]], who participated in the organization for aid for the ghetto of [[Białystok]], during the night of August 15 to 16, 1943. On October 7, 1944, members of the Sonderkommando, 250 prisoners responsible for the bodies of persons after gassing, rose up ; they had procured explosives stolen by a Kommando of young Jewish women ([[Ala Gertner]], [[Regina Safir]], [[Estera Wajsblum]] and [[Roza Robota]]) who worked in the armament factories of the ''Union Werke''. They succeeded in partially destroying Crematorium IV.

==Female resistance to Nazism==
In addition to the resistors forced into their commitment because of their risk of being deported and exterminated because of their race, some were also committed against the German Nazi regime. Women represented approximately 15% of the Resistance. Monique Moser-Verrey notes however: {{Blockquote|If we can say that, among the persecuted minorities, women are more often spared than men, it is their low status in a society dominated by men that did not make them sizeable enemies of the regime, however, it is they who understood the need to hide or flee before their misled spouses, whose social inclusion was more complete.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=36}}}}

The student Communist [[Liselotte Herrmann]] protested in 1933 against the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor and managed to get information to foreign governments about the rearmament of Germany. In 1935 she was arrested, sentenced to death two years later and executed in 1938. She was the first German mother to suffer the death penalty since the beginning of the regime. Twenty women from Düsseldorf, who saw their fathers, brothers and son deported to the camp [[Börgermoor]], managed to smuggle out the famous ''[[The Song of the deportees]]'' and make it known. [[Freya von Moltke]], [[Mildred Harnack|Mildred Harnack-Fish]] and [[Libertas Schulze-Boysen]] participated in the [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]] group [[Kreisau Circle]] and [[Red Orchestra (espionage)|Red Orchestra]]; the last two were arrested and executed. The 20-year-old student [[Sophie Scholl]], a member of [[The White Rose]] was executed February 22, 1943 with her brother [[Hans Scholl]] and [[Christoph Probst]], for posting leaflets. The resistor [[Maria Terwiel]] helped to spread knowledge of the famous sermons condemning the Nazi movement given by [[Clemens von Galen]], Bishop of Munster, as well as helping Jews escape to abroad. She was executed on 5 August 1943. The successful protests of women can also be noted, called the [[Rosenstrasse protest|Rosenstraße]], racially "[[Aryan]]" women married to Jews who, in February 1943, obtained the release of their husbands.

Women also fought for the [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]] from abroad, like [[Dora Schaul]], a Communist who had left Germany in 1934 and involved from July 1942 with clandestine networks, Deutsch Arbeit (German Labour) and Deutsche-Feldpost (My German countryside), from the School of Military Health in [[Lyon]]. [[Hilde Meisel]] attempted in 1933 to galvanize British public opinion against the Nazi regime. She returned to Germany during the war but was executed at the bend of a road.

A little over half of the [[Righteous Among the Nations]] recognized by [[Yad Vashem]] are women. While many of them acted in cooperation with other family members, some of these courageous women were the initiators of the rescue and acted independently to save Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/righteous-women/index.asp?WT.mc_id=wiki|title=Stories of Women Who Rescued Jews During the Holocaust - Righteous Among the Nations - Yad Vashem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High society and circles of power==
Although women did not have political power in Nazi Germany, a circle of influence did exist around Adolf Hitler. Within this circle, Hitler became acquainted with the British [[Unity Mitford]] and [[Magda Goebbels]], wife of the Minister of Propaganda [[Joseph Goebbels]]. Magda Goebbels became known by the nickname "First Lady of the Third Reich": she represented the regime during State visits and official events. Her marriage to Goebbels on December 19, 1931 was considered a society event, where [[Leni Riefenstahl]] was a notable guest.&lt;ref&gt;Fabrice d'Almeyda, ''La vie mondaine sous le nazisme'', 2008, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; She posed as the model German mother for [[Mothers Day]]. [[Eleonore Baur]], a friend of Hitler since 1920 (she had participated in the [[Beer Hall putsch]]) was the only woman to receive the [[Blood Order]]; she also participated in official receptions and was close to [[Heinrich Himmler]], who even named her a colonel of the SS and permitted her free access to the concentration camps, which she went to regularly, particularly [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]].&lt;ref name="Les femmes ont-elles été nazies"/&gt; Hitler did not forget that he owed part of his political ascension to women integrated in the society world (aristocrats or industrialists), such as [[Elsa Bruckmann]].

Women were also able to distinguish themselves in certain domains, but they were the exceptions that proved the rule. Thus [[Leni Riefenstahl]] was the official film director of the regime and was given enormous funding for her cinematic productions (''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', and ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]''). [[Winifred Wagner]] directed the highly publicized [[Bayreuth Festival]], and soprano [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]] was promoted as the "Nazi diva", as noted by an American newspaper. [[Hanna Reitsch]], an aviator, distinguished herself with her handling of test aircraft and military projects of the regime, notably the [[V1 flying bomb]].

==Women during the collapse of Nazi Germany==
After the collapse of Nazi Germany, many German women nicknamed ''[[Trümmerfrauen]]'' ("Rubble Women") participated in the rebuilding of Germany by clearing up the ruins resulting from the war. In the Soviet occupation zone, more than two million women were victims of rape.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Bénédicte Vincent,'' Histoire de la société allemande au XXe siècle. Tome I. Le premier XXe siècle. 1900–1949'', Paris, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;106&lt;/ref&gt; One of them would publish a memoir recalling this experience: ''Eine Frau in Berlin'' (A Woman In Berlin). As the Soviets entered German territory, German women typically had no choice, save suicide, to comply. Age did not matter with victimization crossing the generational strata entirely.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonogh (2007). ''After the Reich: The Brutal History of the Allied Occupation'', p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt; Famed Russian author [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]], outraged by finding the body of a small girl murdered following a gang rape, wrote a scathing poem to mark the moment for posterity ''(right)''.
{{Quote box |quote=
&lt;poem&gt;
;''Prussian Nights''
:The little daughter's on the mattress,
:Dead. How many have been on her
:A platoon, a company perhaps?
:A girl's been turned into a woman,
:A woman turned into a corpse.
:It's all come down to simple phrases:
:Do not forget! Do not forgive!
:Blood for blood! A tooth for a tooth! 
&lt;/poem&gt;
|author = [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] &lt;ref&gt;Alexander Solzhenitsyn, ''Prussian Nights'', as found in Norman M. Naimark, ''The Russians in Germany: A History of Soviet Occupation, 1945-1949'' (Cambridge, MA.: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1997), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

What Solzhenitsyn's poem also reveals is the penchant for revenge the Red Army exacted upon Germany, a recompense promulgated by Soviet leaders. Soviet troops were given a certain degree of license in the early victories in repulsing the Germans, as even Josef Stalin expressed outright indifference towards rape. An example is discernible in what Stalin once asked Yugoslav's communist leader Milovan Djilas, "Can’t he understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometers through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle?"&lt;ref&gt;MacDonogh (2007). ''After the Reich: The Brutal History of the Allied Occupation'', p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many German women died in the midst of such trifles, their husbands and families suffering immeasurable grief along with them, and some of them chose to take their own lives in lieu of being raped. Even when not raped, women hid in apartments, cellars, and closets for fear of being violated, experiencing hunger, fear, and loneliness which left psychological scars for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;Bessel (2006). ''Nazism and War'', p.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt; For more background see: [[Rape during the occupation of Germany]].

===Accountability for committed war crimes===
[[File:Herta Oberheuser sentencing.jpg|thumb|[[Herta Oberheuser]] at the trial for doctors, August 20, 1947.]]
[[File:Inge Viermetz.jpg|thumb|[[Inge Viermetz]] at the trial for RuSHA, January 28, 1948.]]

The question of the culpability of the German people in their support of Nazism has long overshadowed the women, who had little political power under the regime. Thus, as explained by the German historian [[Gisela Bock]], who was involved with the first historians to highlight this issue, by asking women during the Nazi era.{{sfn | Moser-Verrey | 1991 | p=39}} In 1984, in "When Biology Became Destiny, Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany", she wrote that women who are enslaved economically and morally, cannot exercise their freedom by being confined in the home and placed under the rule of their husbands.&lt;ref name="Chagnon"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chagnon|first=Marie-Eve|title=Ces ombres du Troisième Reich|url=http://www.lepanoptique.com/sections/histoire/ces-ombres-du-troisieme-reich-les-femmes-allemandes-victimes-ou-complices/|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we associate studies on the subject during the 1980s mainly with perceptions that women were victims of "machismo" and a "misogynist" [[fascism]]. In terms of voting patterns, a higher proportion of male voters supported the Nazi party compared to female voters.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

However, the simplicity of this analysis tends to disappear with recent studies. In 1987, historian Claudia Koonz, in "Mothers in Fatherland, Women, the Family and Nazi Politics" questioned this statement and acknowledged some guilt. She states as follows: "Far from being impressionable or innocent, women made possible State murder in the name of interests that they defined as maternal."&lt;ref name="Chagnon"/&gt; For her, the containing of housewives just allowed them to assert themselves and grasp an identity, especially through women's associations led by Nazi [[Gertrud Scholtz-Klink]]. They therefore helped to stabilize the system. The women took pleasure in politics and eugenics of the state, which promised financial assistance if the birth rate was high, so they would help to stabilize the system "by preserving the illusion of love in an environment of hate."&lt;ref name="Chagnon"/&gt; In addition, if Gisela Bock denounced the work of her colleague as "anti-feminist", others as {{Interlanguage link multi|Adelheid von Saldern|de}} refuse to stop at a strict choice between complicity and oppression and are more interested in how Nazism included women in their project for Germany.&lt;ref name="Chagnon"/&gt; Recent work from historian [[Wendy Lower]] (consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum), demonstrates that a substantial number of women were accomplices to Nazi atrocities, and sometimes direct participants.&lt;ref&gt;See: Lower, Wendy. ''Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Such realities make it abundantly clear that by the time the war ended, German women had traversed the full-circle of being once sheltered incubators for the Aryan future to effectual contributors in the Nazi concentration camp system.

===Neo-Nazism===
There are many militant neo-Nazis or defenders of former Nazis, such as the Germans {{Interlanguage link multi|Helene Elisabeth von Isenburg|de}} or [[Gudrun Burwitz|Gudrun Himmler]] (daughter of [[Heinrich Himmler]]), who are active through the organization [[Stille Hilfe]], and the French citizens [[Françoise Dior]] and [[Savitri Devi]].

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''Xuanyuandao''' (軒轅道 "Way of Xuanyuan"){{efn|軒轅道 ''Xuānyuándào'', [[traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]]: 軒轅道. Xuanyuan is said to have been the [[Yellow Emperor]]'s personal name.}}, also known as '''Xuanyuanism''' (軒轅教{{efn|軒轅教 ''Xuānyuánjiào''}}) or '''Huangdiism''' (黄帝教{{efn|黄帝教 ''Huángdìjiào'', [[traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]]: 黃帝教; "faith in the [[Yellow Emperor|Yellow Deity]]"}}), is a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Chinese folk religion|folk religion]] of [[China]] which was founded in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; The founder was Wang Hansheng (王寒生) (1899–1989), a [[legislator]].&lt;ref&gt;Jochim 2003. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Xuanyuan aims to restore the "national religion" of archaic (pre-[[Han dynasty]]) China,&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Palmer. 2011. p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] as the universal God.

==Theology and practices==
The Church of Xuanyuan subsumes all the ways of worship to local deities under one national god, [[Yellow Emperor|Xuanyuan Huangdi]] (軒轅黄帝 "Xuanyuan the Yellow Deity"{{efn|The color [[yellow]] [huáng 黄] represents [[earth (Wu Xing)|earth]], the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], and the [[Absolute (philosophy)|centre of the universe]] [''[[Shangdi]]''] in [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese cosmologies]], and is used as a [[naming taboo|revelative character]] for the [[homophone]] ''huáng'' 皇 "august, generative".}}). According to the ''[[Shiji]]'', Xuanyuan was the name of Huangdi,&lt;ref&gt;Clart, Jones. 2003. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; and he is traditionally considered the thearch ([[progenitor]] god) of the [[Han Chinese]] race.&lt;ref&gt;Clart, Jones. 2003. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Xuanyuanism is based on Confucian rationalism, and therefore rejects practices it considers superstitious that are found in other sects of Chinese folk religion, such as scripture writing through god mediumship.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Chinese Religions'', 1997, n. 25. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diffusion==
As of 2013 the Xuanyuandao has 200,000 adherents in Taiwan and is active in China, where it runs temples, schools, and members take part in the sacrifices celebrated at the [[Xuanyuan Temple]], the largest temple dedicated to Huangdi in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Baidu Baike Encyclopedia: [http://www.baike.com/wiki/%E8%BD%A9%E8%BE%95%E6%95%99 轩辕教].&lt;/ref&gt; Huangdi is also worshipped in [[Chinese folk religion]] by millions of people who do not necessarily belong to the Church of Xuanyuan.
