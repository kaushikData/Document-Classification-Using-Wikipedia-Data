The '''album era''' was a period in English-language popular music from the mid 1960s to the mid 2000s in which the [[album]] was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.  It was primarily driven by three successive music recording formats, the 33{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm [[LP record]], the [[Compact Cassette|audiocassette]] and the music [[Compact disc]].

==Origins==
Technological developments in the early twentieth century led to the development of the vinyl [[LP album|long-playing (LP) album]] as an important medium for recorded music. In 1948, [[Columbia Records]] began to bring out 33{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm twelve-inch extended-play LPs that could play for as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side. [[Musical film]] soundtracks, jazz works, and thematic albums by singers such as [[Frank Sinatra]] quickly utilized the new longer format. However, in the 1950s and into the 1960s, 45&amp;nbsp;rpm [[seven-inch single]] sales were considered the primary market for the recorded music industry, while albums were a secondary market.  The careers of notable rock and roll performers such as [[Elvis Presley]] were driven primarily by single sales.

==1960s–1990s==
The dominance of the single as the primary medium of creative expression in music changed with the release of several albums in the 1960s, such as ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector]]'' (1963), [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965),&lt;ref name="MartinProg p 41" /&gt; [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), [[the Mothers of Invention]]'s ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), and the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Julien|first=Oliver|title=Sgt. Pepper and the Beatles: It Was Forty Years Ago Today|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013|isbn=9781409493822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the Beatles' ''Rubber Soul'', ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''Sgt. Pepper'' and the Beach Boys' ''Pet Sounds'', writer [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] noted: "In the wake of these albums, many rock musicians took up the 'complete album approach.'"&lt;ref name="MartinProg p 41"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bill|title=Listening to the Future: The Time of Progressive Rock, 1968-1978|date=1998|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago, Ill. [u.a.]|isbn=0-8126-9368-X|pages=41|edition=1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' assistant editor Andy Greene felt that ''Sgt. Pepper's'' "was the beginning of the album era.  It was the big bang of albums."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kokenes. [http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/29/lennon.lyrics.auction/ "'A Day in the Life' Lyrics to be Auctioned."] [[CNN.com]]. 30 April 2010. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Howard, writing in his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', "pop's stakes had been raised into the stratosphere" by the Beatles' ''Rubber Soul'', resulting in a shift in focus from singles to creating albums without the usual [[filler (media)|filler]] tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Howard |first=David N. |year=2004 |title=Sonic Alchemy: Visionary Music Producers and Their Maverick Recordings |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4Sk0FNXkjcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=rubber+soul+album+without+filler#v=onepage&amp;q=rubber%20soul%20album%20without%20filler&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-634-05560-7 |p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1966, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine cited the initial US sales of ''Rubber Soul'' (1.2 million copies over nine days) as evidence of teenage record-buyers increasingly moving towards the LP format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q="Rubber+Soul"+%22nine+days%22 |author=Staff writer|title=Teen Market Is Album Market|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=18 March 2016|p=36|date=15 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, no singles were released from the album, which writer [[David Leaf]] says created the "perception that their new work should be viewed as a whole.&amp;nbsp;... it introduced the possibility to the recording industry that the 45&amp;nbsp;RPM disc&amp;nbsp;... preeminent for a decade&amp;nbsp;... might soon give way to a new king&amp;nbsp;... the album as a work of art."&lt;ref name="LeafPerspective"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |first=David |last=Leaf |authorlink=David Leaf |chapter=''Pet Sounds'' – Perspective |title=The Pet Sounds Sessions |others=[[The Beach Boys]] |year=1997 |publisher=[[Capitol Records]] |type=Booklet|chapter-url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Pet_Sounds_-_Perspective.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During ''Pet Sounds''' composition and production, Beach Boys bandleader [[Brian Wilson]] found the American version of ''Rubber Soul'' to be "a collection of songs that…somehow went together like no album ever made before", which inspired Wilson to briefly shift his focus from singles to albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Stevens | first =Robert  | url =http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/oct2007/wils-o24.shtml  | title = An Evening with Brian Wilson: The Palace Theatre in Manchester, England—September&amp;nbsp;23, 2007 | publisher =wsws.org | date=October 24, 2007 | accessdate = March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mid 1960s to the late 1970s was the era of the LP and the "golden era" of the album. According to BBC Four's ''The Golden Age'', "These were the years when the music industry exploded to become bigger than Hollywood."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qhn70 Synopsis of "When Albums Ruled the World."] from [[BBC Four]]'s ''The Golden Age Of The Album'' series. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This period, especially the 1970s, is also called the Album Rock Era. Music critic [[Dave Marsh]] has called [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s 1967 "[[Purple Haze]]" the "debut single of the Album Rock Era"&lt;ref&gt;Dave Marsh. Review of "Purple Haze" in ''The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made.'' Dave Marsh. Da Capo Press, 1999. p. 178. {{ISBN|9780306809019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called [[Lou Gramm]]'s 1987 "[[Midnight Blue (Lou Gramm song)|Midnight Blue]]" the "last great single of the album-rock era".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Thomas Erlewine. Review of ''Jukebox Heroes: The Foreigner Anthology'' in ''All Music Guide Required Listening: Classic Rock.'' Chris Woodstra, John Bush and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, eds. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2007. p. 72. {{ISBN|9780879309176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[LP record]], the [[8-track tape]] was another format popular in the United States in this period. After the fall of LP record sales at the end of the 1970s and rise of first the cassette and then the CD as the dominant format for recorded music saw the end of the LP-driven "golden age" of the album, the album consolidated its domination of the recorded music market.  Seven-inch vinyl single sales were dropping and were almost totally displaced by [[cassette single]]s by the end of the 1980s.  Yet these were never as popular as seven-inch singles and they and the subsequent CD singles never amounted to a significant threat to the dominance of the album.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The primary threat to the album's primacy in the 1980s and early 1990s came from [[MTV]].  It was quickly recognized that, "after the album-rock era of the 1970s, MTV helped return the hit single to prominence as a pop marketing tool".&lt;ref name=Pareles&gt;Jon Pareles.

"Death of the album" is a phrase used to describe the perceived decline of album sales in the 21st century, sometimes attributed to internet sharing and downloading,&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation|last=Baneriee|first=Scott|title=New Ideas, New Outlets|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 November 2004|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRMEAAAAMBAJ|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kiss|first=Jemima|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/aug/29/thedeathofthealbum|work=[[Guardian.co.uk]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=29 August 2008|title=The death of the album|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the changing expectations of music listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Paxson|first=Peyton|date=2010|title=Mass Communications and Media Studies: An Introduction|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9781441108951|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RusUVdLjxrsC|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Album Sales Are Down|url=http://www.speeli.com/articles/view/Why-album-sales-are-down|website=Speeli|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to releasing an album, some bands have begun releasing a series of singles&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hopkins|first=Daniel|title=Advice to Every New Band: Stop Putting Out Albums|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|date=12 September 2012|publisher=Kevin Thornburg|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2012/09/ask_a_failed_musician.php|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Extended play|EP]]s as a way to combat the "average person's short attention span."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hearsay|title=Death of the Album?|work=[[Fort Worth Weekly]]|date=3 October 2012|url=http://www.fwweekly.com/2012/10/03/death-album/|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 1990s, single song delivery of music to the consumer was almost dead, at least in the United States.&lt;ref name=Leeds/&gt;  In 1998, ''Billboard'' magazine [[Billboard Hot 100#Album cuts|ended the requirement of a physical single]] for charting on its [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart after several of the year's major hits were not released as singles. But, despite the dominance of the CD, technological changes quickly turned the tables. In 1999, the internet [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] service [[Napster]] allowed internet users to easily download single songs in [[MP3]] format.  By early 2001, Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Jupiter Media Metrix (July 20, 2001). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080413104420/http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?id=249 Global Napster Usage Plummets, But New File-Sharing Alternatives Gaining Ground]. Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Napster was shut down in 2001 for copyright violations, other [[music download]] services took its place.  In 2001, [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iTunes]] service was introduced and the [[iPod]], a consumer-friendly MP3 player, was released later that year.  This and other legal alternatives as well as illicit file sharing continued to depress sales of recorded music on physical formats.  By 2006, downloaded digital single sales outnumbered CD sales for the first time and buyers of digital music purchased singles over albums by a margin of 19:1.&lt;ref name=Leeds&gt;Jeff Leeds. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/26/business/media/26music.html "The Album, a Commodity in Disfavor."] ''[[The New York Times]]''. 26 March 2007. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even music industry executives were forced to admit that the album was on its way out.  "For some genres and some artists, having an album-centric plan will be a thing of the past," [[Capitol-EMI]]'s COO Jeff Kempler said.  Other warnings were more dire.  Media researcher Aram Sinnreich bluntly predicted that "the album is going to die.  Consumers are listening to play lists" on their MP3 players.&lt;ref name=Leeds/&gt;

With consumers abandoning albums, performers "started concentrating on dishing out singles as opposed to churning out albums".&lt;ref name=Morey&gt;Tejas Morey. [http://www.mensxp.com/technology/internet/8798-how-itunes-changed-the-music-industry-forever.html "How iTunes Changed The Music Industry Forever."] ''MensXP ([[Times of India]])''. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of the trend argued that single songs "never truly showed an artist’s true prowess and every singer or songwriter proved to be a one-hit wonder".&lt;ref name=Morey/&gt;

In [[psychology of art]], the relationship between '''art and emotion''' has newly been the subject of extensive study thanks to the intervention of esteemed art historian [[Alexander Nemerov]]. [[Emotion]]al or aesthetic responses to [[art]] have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Emotional Responses to Art: From Collation and Arousal to Cognition and Emotion.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=342–357|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.4.342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression.&lt;ref name=Fellous-review&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fellous|first=Jean-Marc|title=A mechanistic view of the expression and experience of emotion in the arts. Deeper that reason: Emotion and its role in literature, music and art by Jenefer Robinson|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=2006|volume=119|issue=4|pages=668–674|doi=10.2307/20445371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition.&lt;ref name=Cupchick-neuro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cupchik|first=Gerald C.|author2=Vartanian, Oshin|author3= Crawley, Adrian|author4= Mikulis, David J.|title=Viewing artworks: Contributions of cognitive control and perceptual facilitation to aesthetic experience|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=1 June 2009|volume=70|issue=1|pages=84–91|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, [[brain]] regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.&lt;ref name=Cupchick-neuro /&gt;

== Basis for Emotional Responses to Art ==
Evolutionary ancestry has hard-wired humans to have affective responses for certain patterns and traits. These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.&lt;ref name="barry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barry | first1 = A | year = 2006 | title = Perceptual Aesthetics: Transcendent Emotion, Neurological Image | url = | journal = Visual Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 134–151 | doi = 10.1207/s15551407vcq1303_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. [[Symmetry]] is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were [[Symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]], as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt;

Another example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of [[anxiety]] and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = N | year = 2003 | title = ART AND MOOD: PRELIMINARY NOTES AND CONJECTURES | url = | journal = Monist | volume = 86 | issue = 4| pages = 521–555 | doi=10.5840/monist200386426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meta-Emotions ===
The optimal visual artwork creates what Noy &amp; Noy-Sharav call "meta-emotions." These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce "meta-emotions."&lt;ref name="noy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noy | first1 = P. | last2 = Noy-Sharav | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Art and Emotions | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 100–107 | doi = 10.1002/aps.1352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of [[Christ]] on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's [[crucifixion]] are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.

Noy &amp; Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and [[dance]] to [[music]] for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message ./..&lt;ref name="noy" /&gt;

tions works of art can elicit; whether these are defined emotions such as anger, confusion or happiness, or a general feeling of aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Looking past pleasure: Anger, confusion, disgust, pride, surprise, and other unusual aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48–51|doi=10.1037/a0014632}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic experience seems to be determined by liking or disliking a work of art, placed along a continuum of pleasure–displeasure.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; However, other diverse emotions can still be felt in response to art, which can be sorted into three categories: Knowledge Emotions, Hostile Emotions, and Self-Conscious Emotions.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

===Liking and comprehensibility ===
Pleasure elicited by works of art can also have multiple sources. A number of theories suggest that enjoyment of a work of art is dependent on its comprehensibility or ability to be understood easily.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: The influence of titles on aesthetic experiences.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320–329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when more information about a work of art is provided, such as a title, description, or artist's statement, researchers predict that viewers will understand the piece better, and demonstrate greater liking for it.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt; Experimental evidence shows that the presence of a title for a work increases perceived understanding, regardless of whether that title is elaborative or descriptive.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt;  Elaborative titles did affect aesthetic responses to the work, suggesting viewers were not creating alternative explanations for the works if an explaining title is given.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt; Descriptive or random titles do not show any of these effects.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt;

Furthering the thought that pleasure in art derives from its comprehensibility and processing fluency, some authors have described this experience as an emotion.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|author2=Detweiler-Bedell, Brian|title=Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2008|volume=12|issue=4|pages=305–329|doi=10.1037/a0012558}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional feeling of beauty, or an aesthetic experience, does not have a valence emotional undercurrent, rather is general cognitive arousal due to the fluent processing of a novel stimuli.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /&gt; Some authors believe that aesthetic emotions is enough of a unique and verifiable experience that it should be included in general theories of emotion.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /&gt;

===Knowledge emotions===
Knowledge emotions deal with reactions to thinking and feeling, such as interest, confusion, and surprise.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; They often stem from self-analysis of what the viewer knows, expects, and perceives.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; This set of emotions also spur actions that motivate further learning and thinking.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Interest====
Interest in a work of art arises from perceiving the work as new, complex, and unfamiliar, as well as understandable.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; This dimension is studied most often by aesthetics researchers, and can be equated with aesthetic pleasure or an aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; This stage of art experience usually occurs as the viewer understands the artwork they are viewing, and the art fits into their knowledge and expectations while providing a new experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt;

====Confusion====
Confusion can be viewed as an opposite to interest, and serves as a signal to the self to inform the viewer that they cannot comprehend what they are looking at, and confusion often necessitates a shift in action to remedy the lack of understanding.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Confusion and interest: The role of knowledge emotions in aesthetic experience.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=75–80|doi=10.1037/a0017081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion is thought to stem from uncertainty, and a lack of one's expectations and knowledge being met by a work of art.&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; 
Confusion is most often experienced by art novices, and therefore must often be dealt with by those in arts education.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Surprise====
Surprise functions as a disruption of current action to alert a viewer to a significant event.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; The emotion is centered around the experience of something new and unexpected, and can be ellicied by sensory incongruity.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; Art can ellicit surprise when expectations about the work are not met, but the work changes those expectations in an understandable way.

===Hostile emotions===
Hostile emotions toward art are often very visible in the form of anger or frustration, and can result in censorship, but are less easily described by a continuum of aesthetic pleasure-displeasure.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; These reactions center around the hostility triad: anger, disgust, and contempt.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;  These emotions often motivate aggression, self-assertion, and violence, and arise from perception of the artist's deliberate trespass onto the expectations of the viewer.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

===Self-conscious emotions===
Self-conscious emotions are responses that reflect upon the self and one's actions, such as pride, guilt, shame, regret and embarrassment.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; These are much more complex emotions, and involve assessing events as agreeing with one's self-perception or not, and adjusting one's behavior accordingly.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; There are numerous instances of artists expressing self-conscious emotions in response to their art, and self-conscious emotions can also be felt collectively.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Sublime feelings====
Researchers have investigated the experience of the sublime, viewed as similar to aesthetic appreciation, which causes general psychological arousal.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eskine|first=Kendall J.|author2=Kacinik, Natalie A.|author3= Prinz, Jesse J.|title=Stirring images: Fear, not happiness or arousal, makes art more sublime.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1071–1074|doi=10.1037/a0027200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sublime feeling has been connected to a feeling of happiness in response to art, but may be more related to an experience of fear.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime /&gt; Researchers have shown that feelings of fear induced before looking at artwork results in more sublime feelings in response to those works.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime /&gt;

====Aesthetic chills====
{{Main|Aesthetic chills}}
Another common emotional response is that of chills when viewing a work of art. The feeling is predicted to be related to similar aesthetic experiences such as awe, feeling touched, or absorption.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|author2=Nusbaum, Emily C.|title=On personality and piloerection: Individual differences in aesthetic chills and other unusual aesthetic experiences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=208–214|doi=10.1037/a0021914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality traits along the Big 5 Inventory have been shown to be predictors of a person's experience of aesthetic chills, especially a high rating on Openness to Experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt; This counters the effect of fluid intelligence, where those with higher amounts of fluid intelligence are less likely to experience chills.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt; Experience with the arts also predicts someone's experience of aesthetic chills, but this may be due to them experiencing art more frequently.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt;

===Effects of expertise===
The fact that art is analyzed and experienced differently by those with artistic training and expertise than those who are artistically naive has been shown numerous times. Researchers have tried to understand how experts interact with art so differently from the art naive, as experts tend to like more abstract compositions, and show a greater liking for both modern and classical types of art.&lt;ref name=Leder-appreciated&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Gerger, Gernot|author3= Dressler, Stefan G.|author4= Schabmann, Alfred|title=How art is appreciated.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–10|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts also exhibit more arousal when looking at modern and abstract works, while non-experts show more arousal to classical works.&lt;ref name=Leder-appreciated /&gt;

Other researchers predicted that experts find more complex art interesting because they have changed their appraisals of art to create more interest, or are possibly making completely different types of appraisals than novices.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Artistic training and interest in visual art: Applying the appraisal model of aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2006|volume=24|issue=2|pages=139–161|doi=10.2190/dx8k-6wea-6wpa-fm84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts described works rated high in complexity as easier to understand and more interesting than did novices, possibly as experts tend to use more idiosyncratic criteria when judging artworks.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise /&gt; However, experts seem to use the same appraisals of emotions that novices do, but these appraisals are at a higher level, because a wider range of art is comprehensible to experts.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise /&gt;

====Expertise and museum visits====
Due to most art being in museums and galleries, most people have to make deliberate choices to interact with art. Researchers are interested in what types of experiences and emotions people are looking for when going to experience art in a museum.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano|author2=Bartoli, G.|author3=Bove, G.|title=Learning through ancient art and experincing emotions with contemporary art: Comparing visits in two different museums|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–191|doi=10.2190/r784-4504-37m3-2370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people respond that they visit museums to experience 'the pleasure of art' or 'the desire for cultural learning', but when broken down, visitors of museums of classical art are more motivated to see famous works and learn more about them.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt; Visitors in contemporary art museums were more motivated by a more emotional connection to the art, and went more for the pleasure than a learning experience.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt; Predictors of who would prefer to go to which type of museum lay in education level, art fluency, an socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt;

==Theories and models of elicited emotions==
Researchers have offered a number of theories to describe emotional responses to art, often aligning with the various theories of the basis of emotions. Authors have argued that the emotional experience is created explicitly by the artist and mimicked in the viewer, or that the emotional experience of art is a by-product of the analysis of that work.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fellous-review /&gt;

===Appraisal theory===
The [[appraisal theory]] of emotions centers on the assumption that it is the evaluation of events, and not the events themselves, that cause emotional experiences.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Emotions are then created by different groups of appraisal structures that events are analyzed through.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; When applied to art, appraisal theories argue that various artistic structures, such as complexity, prototypically, and understanding are used as appraisal structures, and works that show more typical art principles will create a stronger aesthetic experience .&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Appraisal theories suggest that art is experienced as interesting after being analyzed through a novelty check and coping-potential check, which analyze the art's newness of experience for the viewer, and the viewer's ability to understand the new experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Experimental evidence suggests that art is preferred when the viewer finds it easier to understand, and that interest in a work is predictable with knowledge of the viewer's ability to process complex visual works, which supports the appraisal theory.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; People with higher levels of artistic expertise and knowledge often prefer more complex works of art. Under appraisal theory, experts have a different emotional experience to art due to a preference for more complex works that they can understand better than a naive viewer.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt;

====Appraisal and negative emotions====
A newer take on this theory focuses on the consequences of the emotions elicited from art, both positive and negative. The original theory argues that positive emotions are the result of a biobehavioral reward system, where a person feels a positive emotion when they have completed a personal goal.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jessica M.|author2=Paul J. Silvia|title=Opposing art: Rejection as an action tendency of hostile aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=109–126|doi=10.2190/em.27.1.f}}&lt;/ref&gt; These emotional rewards create actions by motivating approach or withdrawal from a stimuli, depending if the object is positive or negative to the person.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; However, these theories have not often focused on negative emotions, especially negative emotional experiences from art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; These emotions are central to experimental aesthetics research in order to understand why people have negative, rejecting, condemning, or censoring reactions to works of art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; By showing research participants controversial photographs, rating their feelings of anger, and measuring their subsequent actions, researchers found that the participants that felt hostile toward the photographs displayed more rejection of the works.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; This suggests that negative emotions towards a work of art can create a negative action toward it, and suggests the need for further research on negative reactions towards art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt;

===Minimal model===
Other psychologists believe that emotions are of minimal functionality, and are used to move a person towards incentives and away from threats.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xenakis|first=Ioannis|author2=Arnellos, Argyris|author3= Darzentas, John|title=The functional role of emotions in aesthetic judgment|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=30|issue=2|pages=212–226|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, positive emotions are felt upon the attainment of a goal, and negative emotions when a goal has failed to be achieved.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /&gt;   The basic states of pleasure or pain can be adapted to aesthetic experiences by a disinterested buffer, where the experience is not explicitly related to the goal-reaching of the person, but a similar experience can be analyzed from a disinterested distance.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /&gt; These emotions are disinterested because the work of art or artist's goals are not affecting the person's well being, but the viewer can feel whether or not those goals were achieved from a third-party distance.

===Five-step aesthetic experience===
Other theorists have focused their models on the disrupting and unique experience that comes from the interacting with a powerful work of art. An early model focused on a two-part experience: facile recognition and meta-cognitive perception, or the experience of the work of art and the mind's analysis of that experience.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelowski|first=Matthew|author2=Akiba, Fuminori|title=A model of art perception, evaluation and emotion in transformative aesthetic experience|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2011|volume=29|issue=2|pages=80–97|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2010.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further cognitive model strengthens this idea into a five-part emotional experience of a work of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; As this five-part model is new, it remains only a theory, as not much empirical evidence for the model had been researched yet.

====Part one: Pre-expectations and self-image====
The first stage of this model focuses on the viewer's expectations of the work before seeing it, based on their previous experiences, their observational strategies, and the relation of the work to themselves.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; Viewers who tend to appreciate art, or know more about it will have different expectations at this stage than those who are not engaged by art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part two: Cognitive mastery and introduction of discrepancy ====
After viewing the work of art, people will make an initial judgment and classification of the work,  often based on their preconceptions of the work.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; After initial classification, viewers attempt to understand the motive and meaning of the work, which can then inform their perception of the work, creating a cycle of changing perception and the attempt to understand it.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; It is at this point any discrepancies between expectations and the work, or the work and understanding arise.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part three: Secondary control and escape====
When an individual finds a discrepancy in their understanding that cannot be resolved or ignored, they move to the third stage of their interaction with a work of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; At this point, interaction with the work has switched from lower-order and unconscious processes to higher-order cognitive involvement, and tension and frustration starts to be felt.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; In order to maintain their self-assumptions and to resolve the work, an individual will try to change their environment in order for the issue to be resolved or ignored.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;  This can be done by re-classifying the work and its motives, blaming the discrepancy on an external source, or attempting to escape the situation or mentally withdraw from the work.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part four: Meta-cognitive reassessment====
If viewers cannot escape or reassess the work, they are forced to reassess the self and their interactions with works of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;  This experience of self-awareness through a work of art is often externally caused, rather than internally motivated, and starts a transformative process to understand the meaning of the discrepant work, and edit their own self-image.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part five: Aesthetic outcome and new mastery====
After the self-transformation and change in expectations, the viewer resets their interaction with the work, and begins the process anew with deeper self-understanding and cognitive mastery of the artwork.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

==Pupillary response tests==
In order to research emotional responses to art, researchers often rely on behavioral data.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuchinke|first=Lars|author2=Trapp, Sabrina|author3= Jacobs, Arthur M.|author4= Leder, Helmut|title=Pupillary responses in art appreciation: Effects of aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=156–163|doi=10.1037/a0014464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But new psychophysilogical methods of measuring emotional response are beginning to be used, such as the measurement of pupillary response.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Pupil responses have been predicted to indicate image pleasantness and emotional arousal, but can be confounded by luminance, and confusion between an emotion's positive or negative valence, requiring an accompanying verbal explanation of emotional state.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=W. Ryan|author2=Schirillo, James A.|title=Hemispheric laterality measured in Rembrandt's portraits using pupil diameter and aesthetic verbal judgements|journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion|date=1 August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=868–885|doi=10.1080/02699931.2010.515709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pupil dilatations have been found to predict emotional responses and the amount of information the brain is processing, measures important in testing emotional response ellicted by artwork.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Further, the existence of pupillary responses to artwork can be used as an argument that art does ellicit emotional responses with physiological reactions.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; 
[[File:Juan Gris 004.jpg|thumb|An example Cubist work by Juan Gris]]

===Pupil responses to art===
After viewing Cubist paintings of varying complexity, abstraction, and familiarity, participants' pupil responses were greatest when viewing aesthetically pleasing artwork, and highly accessible art, or art low in abstraction.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Pupil responses also correlated with personal preferences of the cubist art.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; High pupil responses were also correlated with faster cognitive processing, supporting theories that aesthetic emotions and preferences are related to the brain's ease of processing the stimuli.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt;

====Left-cheek biases====
[[File:Rembrandt - Minerva - WGA19246.jpg|thumb|''Minerva'' Rembrandt. Female portrait showing left-cheek orientation]]
These effects are also seen when investigating the Western preference for left-facing portraits. This skew towards left-cheek is found in the majority of Western portraits, and is rated as more pleasing than other portrait orientations.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Kelsey|author2=Schirillo, James|title=Emotive hemispheric differences measured in real-life portraits using pupil diameter and subjective aesthetic preferences|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=19 April 2012|volume=219|issue=4|pages=447–455|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3091-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories for this preference suggest that the left side of the face as more emotionally descriptive and expressive, which lets viewers connect to this emotional content better.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt; Pupil response tests were used to test emotional response to different types of portraits, left or right cheek, and pupil dilation was linearly related to the pleasantness of the portrait, with increased dilations for pleasant images, and constrictions for unpleasant images.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt; Left-facing portraits were rated as more pleasant, even when mirrored to appear right-facing, suggesting that people are more attracted to more emotional facial depictions.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt;

This research was continued, using portraits by [[Rembrandt]] featuring females with a left-cheek focus and males with a right-cheek focus.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt;  Researchers predicted Rembrandt chose to portray his subjects this way to elicit different emotional responses in his viewers related to which portrait cheek was favored.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt; In comparison to previous studies, increased pupil size was only found for male portraits with a right-cheek preference. This may be because the portraits were viewed as domineering, and the subsequent pupil response was due to unpleasantness.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt; As pupil dilation is more indicative of strength of emotional response than the valence, a verbal description of emotional responses should accompany further pupillary response tests.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt;

==Art as emotional regulation==
Art is also used as an emotional regulator, most often in [[Art Therapy]] sessions. Studies have shown that creating art can serve as a method of short-term [[mood (psychology)|mood]] regulation.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Jennifer E.|author2=Winner, Ellen|title=Confronting sadness through art-making: Distraction is more beneficial than venting.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=3|pages=255–261|doi=10.1037/a0026909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalebroux|first=Anne|author2=Goldstein, Thalia R.|author3= Winner, Ellen|title=Short-term mood repair through art-making: Positive emotion is more effective than venting|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=288–295|doi=10.1007/s11031-008-9105-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of regulation falls into two categories: venting and distraction.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Artists in all fields of the arts have reported emotional venting and distraction through the creation of their art.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

===Venting===
Venting through art is the process of using art to attend to and discharge negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; However, research has shown venting to be a less effective method of emotional regulation. Research participants asked to draw either an image related to a sad movie they just watched, or a neutral house, demonstrated less negative mood after the neutral drawing.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Venting drawings did improve negative mood more than no drawing activity.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Other research suggests that this is because analyzing negative emotions can have a helpful effect, but immersing in negative emotions can have a deleterious effect.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

===Distraction===
Distraction is the process of creating art to oppose, or in spite of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; This can also take the form of fantasizing, or creating an opposing positive to counteract a negative affect.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt; Research has demonstrated that distractive art making activities improve mood greater than venting activities.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Distractive drawings were shown to decrease negative emotions more than venting drawings or no drawing task even after participants were asked to recall their saddest personal memories.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; These participants also experienced an increase in positive affect after a distractive drawing task.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; The change in mood valence after a distractive drawing task is even greater when participants are asked to create happy drawings to counter their negative mood.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

== Plot ==
''Ask for Jane'' is based on the historic true story of the underground abortion network in [[Chicago]] between 1969 and 1973. The [[Jane Collective]] helped over 11,000 women obtain illegal abortions before [[Roe v. Wade]] was passed to allow legal abortions in the [[United States]] and many members of the collective were arrested. ''Ask for Jane'' is the first ever narrative feature film about the [[Jane Collective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jezebel.com/everyones-trying-to-make-a-movie-about-jane-the-illega-1797279836|title=Everyone's Trying to Make a Movie About Jane, the Illegal Abortion Collective From the '70s|last=Cills|first=Hazel|work=Jezebel|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-jane-collective-chicago-movies-20170728-story.html|title=2 films to focus on Jane Collective, Chicago’s underground network for abortion access|last=Swartz|first=Tracy|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bitstream Inc.''' was a [[type foundry]] that produced digital [[typeface]]s. Founded in 1981 by [[Matthew Carter]] and [[Mike Parker (typographer)|Mike Parker]] among others, it claims to be the oldest such company. It was located in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]]. The font business, including [[MyFonts]], was acquired by [[Monotype Corporation|Monotype Imaging]] in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/monotype-closes-purchase-of-bitstreams-font-business-for-50-mln-lifts-fy-view-20120319-01557 |title=Monotype Closes Purchase Of Bitstream's Font Business For $50 Mln; Lifts FY View |accessdate=2012-03-26 |date=2012-03-19 |work=Market Headlines web site |publisher=[[NASDAQ]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.monotypeimaging.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=658188 |title=Monotype Imaging Completes Acquisition of Bitstream's Font Business |accessdate=2012-03-26 |date=2012-03-19 |work=press release |publisher=Monotype Imaging |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408120109/http://ir.monotypeimaging.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=658188 |archivedate=2012-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the business, responsible for Pageflex and [[Bolt (web browser)|Bolt Browser]], was spun off to a new entity named Marlborough Software Development Holdings Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printweek.com/Business/article/1103796/monotype-acquires-bitstreams-font-business-50m-cash-deal/|title=Monotype acquires Bitstream's font business in $50m all cash deal|accessdate=2012-03-26|date=2011-11-14|work=PrintWeek|publisher=Haymarket Business Media|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502114457/http://www.printweek.com/Business/article/1103796/monotype-acquires-bitstreams-font-business-50m-cash-deal/|archivedate=2012-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marlborough-software-development-holdings-inc-214100019.html|title=Marlborough Software Development Holdings Inc. to Commence Trading on Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board on March 19, 2012 Under the Symbol "MBGH."|accessdate=2012-03-26|date=2012-03-16|work=press release|publisher=Bitstream, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later renamed Pageflex, Inc following a successful [[management buyout]] in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marlborough Software Development Holdings Inc.

==Products==

Bitstream created a library of "classic" fonts (usually under different names for [[trademark]] reasons) in digital form (for example, Times Ten as 'Dutch 801'). The Bitstream font collection is most widely used through its inclusion with the [[CorelDRAW]] software.  The company received extensive criticism for its strategy of cheaply offering digitisations of pre-existing typefaces that it had not designed. While technically not illegal, font designer John Hudson would describe its selling of large numbers of typefaces on CD as "one of the worst instances of piracy in the history of type".&lt;ref name="Bitstream Devroye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|author-link=Luc Devroye|title=Bitstream|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27538.html|website=Type Design Information Page|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitstream developed a number of fonts on its own, such as [[Bitstream Charter|Charter]], by Matthew Carter, [[Iowan Old Style]] by [[John Downer (signpainter)|John Downer]] and the [[freeware]] [[Bitstream Vera]] family of fonts.

One of their best known fonts is Swiss 721 BT, which is a [[Helvetica]] clone with condensed versions and a rounded version. It was among the first digitally available Swiss family typefaces, being designed for that purpose in 1982.

Another Bitstream product is [[Font Fusion]], a font [[rasterizing]] engine developed jointly with Type Solutions, Inc., which was later owned entirely by Bitstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Bitstream/ |title=Bitstream |accessdate=2010-03-02 |date=2010-03-02 |work=Myfonts.com Web site |publisher=Bitstream, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-byte character set was named [[Bitstream International Character Set]] ([[BICS (character set)|BICS]]).

==History==
The company had a high level of involvement in [[BeOS]], with older BeOS releases using a Bitstream renderer, and the latest development releases from 2001 using Font Fusion. The OS, including its freeware releases, included a large number of Bitstream fonts, including their clones of [[Times New Roman]], [[Helvetica]] and [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]].

On December 2, 1998, Bitstream Inc. announced acquisition of all outstanding stock of Type Solutions, Inc. In addition, [[Sampo Kaasila]], its founder and president and the creator of [[TrueType]], agreed to join Bitstream's team as Director of Research and Development.

In March 2000, Bitstream launched [[MyFonts]], an open marketplace offering fonts from various foundries.

In January 2009, Bitstream introduced the [[BOLT Browser]], a [[Java ME]]-based [[Web browser]] for mobile phones. It was distributed free of charge to consumers and was built using the company's [[ThunderHawk (web browser)|ThunderHawk]] mobile Web browsing technology for [[mobile network operator]]s and handset manufacturers. The product was discontinued by the end of 2011.

[[File:Dr. Seuss WikiWorld.png|thumb|300px|Example of a modern cartoon. The text was excerpted by cartoonist Greg Williams from the Wikipedia article on [[Dr. Seuss]]|alt=A cartoon shows a bearded man with a red bow tie holding numerous items. He holds the hat from Dr. Seuss's "The Cat in the Hat" and balances a fishbowl on his left index finger.]]
A '''cartoon''' is a type of [[illustration]], possibly animated, typically in a non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for [[satire]], [[caricature]], or [[humor]]; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a ''[[cartoonist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the second sense they are usually called an ''[[animator]]''.

The concept originated in the [[Middle Ages]], and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, [[fresco]], [[tapestry]], or [[stained glass]] window. In the 19th century, beginning in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in 1843, cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers. In the early 20th century, it began to refer to [[Animated cartoon|animated]] films which resembled print cartoons.&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fine art==
{{Main article|Modello}}
A cartoon (from {{Lang-it|cartone}} and {{Lang-nl|karton}}—words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy [[paper]] as a study or ''[[modello]]'' for a [[painting]], [[stained glass]], or [[tapestry]]. Cartoons were typically used in the production of [[fresco]]es, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp [[plaster]] over a series of days (''giornate'').{{sfn|Constable|1954|page=115}}

Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or "pounced" over a cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster ("pouncing"). Cartoons by [[Painting|painter]]s, such as the [[Raphael Cartoons]] in London, and examples by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], are highly prized in their own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually colored, were followed with the eye by the [[weaving|weavers]] on the [[loom]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;{{sfn|Adelson|1994|page=330}}

==Print media==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Stoke-on-Trent]] --&gt;
[[File:SubstanceandShadow.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], ''Cartoon no.1: Substance and Shadow'', 1843, satirized preparatory cartoons for frescoes in the Palace of Westminster, creating the modern meaning of "cartoon"|alt=A detailed black-and-white illustration is vignetted in the center showing people of various sizes looking at pictures framed on the left and back walls.]]

In print media, a cartoon is an illustration or series of illustrations, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from 1843, when ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Punch.co.uk|title=History of the Cartoon|url=http://punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|access-date=2007-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111013522/http://www.punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|archive-date=2007-11-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly sketches by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]].{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|p=30}} The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new [[Palace of Westminster]]. The original title for these drawings was ''Mr Punch's face is the letter Q'' and the new title "cartoon" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.

Cartoons can be divided into gag cartoons, which include editorial cartoons, and comic strips.

Modern single-panel [[gag cartoon|''gag cartoons'']], found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath, or—less often—a [[speech balloon]].{{sfn|Bishop|2009|p=92}} Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by [[Mel Calman]], [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], [[Gary Larson]], [[George Lichty]], [[Fred Neher]] and others. Many consider ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoonist [[Peter Arno]] the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maslin |first1=Michael |title=The Peter Arno Cartoons That Help Rescue The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-peter-arno-cartoons-that-helped-rescue-the-new-yorker |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=2018-09-16 |date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes [[Charles Addams]], [[Charles Barsotti]], and [[Chon Day]].

[[Bill Hoest]], [[Jerry Marcus]], and [[Virgil Partch]] began as magazine gag cartoonists and moved to syndicated [[comic strips]]. [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson]] is noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration; he illustrated numerous feature articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' before creating his ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' comic strip. The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester "Chet" Brown's ''[[All in Sport]]''.

''[[Editorial cartoons]]'' are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using [[irony]] or [[satire]]. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and sometimes use multiple panels. [[Editorial cartoonist]]s of note include [[Herblock]], [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], [[Jeff MacNelly]], [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]], and [[Gerald Scarfe]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

''Comic strips'', also known as ''cartoon strips'' in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the United States, they are not commonly called "cartoons" themselves, but rather "comics" or "[[Sunday comics|funnies]]". Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as well as [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s—are usually referred to as "[[cartoonist]]s". Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Some noteworthy cartoonists of humorous comic strips are [[Scott Adams]], [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]], [[Charles Schulz]], [[E. C. Segar]], [[Mort Walker]] and [[Bill Watterson]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

===Political cartoons===
{{main article|Editorial cartoon}}

Political cartoons are like illustrated editorial that serve visual commentaries on political events. They offer subtle criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does not get embitered.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th century England.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}} [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]] produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Birth+of+England%27s+pocket+cartoon%3B+LOCAL+HISTORY+Smile+awhile+through...-a0153110971| title=Birth of England's pocket cartoon|author=Chris Upton|publisher=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, [[James Gillray]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]], both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and [[caricature]], and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} By calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were directed against [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of [[revolutionary France]] and [[Napoleon]].{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} [[George Cruikshank]] became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray, from 1815 until the 1840s. His career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications.

[[File:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|250px|Nast depicts the [[Tweed Ring]]: "Who stole the people's money?" / "'Twas him."|alt=A cartoon showing a circle of men pointing their fingers at the man to their right with grimaces on their faces.]]

By the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day. [[Thomas Nast]], in New York City, showed how realistic German drawing techniques could redefine American cartooning.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|p=24}} His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the [[William M. Tweed|Tweed machine]] in New York City, and helped bring it down. Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain when police identified him from Nast's cartoons.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|pp=49–50}} Sir [[John Tenniel]] was the toast of London.{{sfn|Morris|Tenniel|2005|p=344}}

Political cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target of the humor may complain, but they can seldom fight back. Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when [[J. H. Thomas]], the leader of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the [[British Communist Party]]. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of "Black Friday", when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain|Miners' Federation]]. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to grievously degrade his character in the popular imagination. Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won the lawsuit and restored his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel S.  Hyde, "'Please, Sir, he called me “Jimmy!' Political Cartooning before the Law: 'Black Friday,' J.H. Thomas, and the Communist Libel Trial of 1921," ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#4 pp 521-550&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific cartoons===
Cartoons such as ''[[xkcd]]'' have also found their place in the world of [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[technology]]. Cartoons related to [[chemistry]] are, for example, the ''Wonderlab'', which looked at daily life in the lab.  In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is [[Sidney Harris (cartoonist)|Sidney Harris]]. Not all, but many of [[Gary Larson]]'s cartoons have a scientific flavor.

===Comic books&lt;!--'Humor comics' and 'Humour comics' redirect here--&gt;===
{{Main|Comic book}}
 
Books with cartoons are usually magazine-format "comic books," or occasionally [[Comics collection|reprints of newspaper cartoons]].

In Britain in the 1930s adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by [[DC Thomson]]; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Sackville Turner]], ''Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton et al.'' (3rd ed. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;  D.C. Thomson issued the first [[The Dandy|''The Dandy Comic'']] in December 1937. It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful.  Thomson capitalized on its success with a similar product ''[[The Beano]]''  in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Keith Booker|title=Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas &amp;#91;4 volumes&amp;#93;: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|year=2014|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with ''[[Think Small]]'', a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by [[Volkswagen]] dealers. [[Bill Hoest]] and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as [[H. Allen Smith]], [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]] and [[Jean Shepherd]]. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.

==Animation==
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|200px|An [[animated cartoon]] horse, drawn by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos|alt=a running horse (animated)]]
{{Main article|Animated cartoon}}
Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, ''cartoon'' came to refer to [[animation]], and the word ''cartoon'' is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons.{{sfn|Walasek|2009|p=116}}  While ''animation'' designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word "cartoon" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and short films aimed at children, possibly featuring [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] animals,{{sfn|Wells|2008|p=41}} [[superhero]]es, the adventures of child protagonists or related themes.

In the 1980s, ''cartoon'' was shortened to ''toon'', referring to characters in animated productions. This term was popularized in 1988 by the combined live-action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', followed in 1990 by the animated TV series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''.

The CTTC works in support of indigenous weavers from the Cusco region to recover traditional Cusqueñan textiles.

== Mission and vision ==
The CTTC's mission is to "promote the empowerment of weavers through the sustainable practice of Peruvian ancestral textile traditions in the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] region. This enables the weavers to maintain their identity and textile traditions while improving their quality of life through workshops, opportunities, and the promotion of their textile art."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Mission and Vision|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTTC's aim is to revive Pre-Columbian textile traditions and provide support to weaving communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Callañaupa Alvarez|first1=Nilda|title=Weaving in the Peruvian highlands : dreaming patterns, weaving memories|date=2007|publisher=Center de Textiles Traditionales del Cusco|location=Cusco, Peru|isbn=9781596680555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to racism, colonialism, poverty, and more, textile traditions in the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] region were in danger of disappearing during the 20th century. In the [[Andes]], textiles are an important part of everyday life and a key component of local culture. This ancient way of life, passed down for thousands of years from generation to generation, has been at risk since the days of the Conquest. Traditional textiles were such a strong symbol of indigenous identity and resistance to colonial rule, that the Spanish outlawed their creation and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Us and Them: Archeology and Ethnicity in the Andes|last=Andrea|first=Heckman|publisher=The Cotsen Institute of Archeology, University of California|year=2005|isbn=|editor-last=Martin Reycraft|editor-first=Richard|location=Los Angeles|pages=113|chapter=Cultural Communication of Ethnicity through Clothing: The Qocha-Lake Symbol in Contemporary Textiles from Ausungate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the people of the [[Andes]] continued practicing their textile traditions until the 20th century. Under pressure from changes brought about by [[globalization]], including the introduction of chemical dyes and fibers, traditional textiles experienced a dramatic decline in the 1900s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9838860-1-3|location=China|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, the CTTC has worked to empower weavers and achieve its vision "To place the weaver of ancestral textiles as a recognized global artist, forging a just recognition by society and assuring the continuity of the ancestral textile practice."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
Since the 1960s, an informal group of women weavers from the community of Chinchero gathered together to revive textile traditions and earn an independent income from male relatives through the sale of their textiles in the tourist market.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When the husband and wife pair of ethnobotnists Christine and Ed Franquemont arrived in Chinchero in the 1970s to conduct research, they encouraged the weavers to continue their community organizing work. With the support of the Franquemonts and other international friends, the group of weavers founded a cultural center in Chinchero. When this cultural center failed, the weavers re-organized under the leadership of [[Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez]] to found the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco (CTTC).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The CTTC was founded in 1996 as a non-profit organization registered with APCI in [[Peru]] by weavers from Chinchero and their international supporters. Key founders of the CTTC include: [[Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez]], Elizabeth and David Van Buskirk, Maria Tocco, Christine and Ed Franquemont, Yolanda Jaime Callañaupa, Yenny Callañaupa, Flora Callañaupa de Hendrickson, Betty Doerr, and Tim Wells, amongst many others.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9838860-1-3|location=China|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTTC originally partner with a handful of communities in the Cusco region to revive textile traditions, including the communities of Accha Alta, Chahuaytire, Chinchero and Pitumarca. [[Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez]] has served as director of CTTC since 1996.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The board of directors includes: [[Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez]], Flora Callañaupa de Hendrickson, Yolanda Jaime Callañaupa, Hilda Roque Perez, Miriam Luna, and Betty Doerr.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Until 2001 the CTTC was run out of the basement of the home of [[Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez]]. After an extensive capital campaign, the CTTC purchased and remodeled a building on Av. Sol 603, [[Cusco]], [[Peru|Perú]] to house its offices, museum, and store.

In 2010 the CTTC held Tinkuy 2010: Gathering of Weavers, an international conference that gathered together indigenous weavers, textile artists, art historians, anthropologists and others to discuss and share textile traditions from around th world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Tinkuy|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, CTTC organized the second Tinkuy titled Tinkuy 2013: Gathering of Weavers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.andeantextilearts.org/tinkuy_2017|title=Tinkuy 2017|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Andean Textile Arts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The weaving associations ==
The CTTC has partnered with ten communities from the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] region:  Accha Alta, Acopia, Chahuaytire, Chinchero, Huacatinco, Mahuaypampa, Patabamba, Pitumarca, Santa Cruz de Sallac, and Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In each community the weavers have formed autonomous weaving associations, each registered with the Peruvian government. Each weaving association is self-governed through elected officials (President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer), who are elected once a year. Each weaving association determines its own rules and regulates member participation.

In each community the CTTC has built a weaving center for the associations where the weavers can gather to meet and work. The weaving centers are composed of a central grassy courtyard for weaving in good weather while the surrounding complex of buildings are used for weaving in poor weather conditions, meetings, and include space for storage and a kitchen. Each association gathers once a week in their weaving center to work and organize.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Accha Alta  ===

Association: "Centro de Tejedores Munay Pallay Awaqkuna de Accha Alta"

Community: Accha Alta

District: Calca

Province: Calca

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Accha Alta is located approximately 2 hours northeast of the city of [[Cusco]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|last2=Franquemont|first2=Christine|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2013|isbn=9780983886044|location=China|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nestled on a steep mountain slope next to the ruins of [[Anqasmarka|Ankasmarka]], an ancient Incan granary, this remote mountain community looks out over the valley below. Most people in Accha Alta only speak [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], the local indigenous language, and rely on their ''chakras'' (fields) to produce much of the food they need for their families. At 12,930 feet above sea level, very few crops grow in the thin mountain air except for potatoes and other tubers. Accha Alta is well known for its many potato varieties and people from as far away as [[Cusco]] come to buy Accha Alta potatoes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The community of Accha Alta began working with the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco in 1998. In the beginning almost all of the association members knew how to weave, but solely used synthetic fibers. Since 1998, the weavers have returned to using natural materials, which includes natural dyes in [[sheep]], [[alpaca]], and [[llama]] wool. Accha Alta weavers are very proud of their traditions, and place great emphasis on the young weavers, ensuring that their traditions are carried on into the future. There are approximately 40 adult members in Accha Alta's weaving association and 35 children.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Accha Alta|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accha Alta textiles are recognized for their thin sections of plain weave and wide designs in the ''ley'' (supplementary warp) technique. Traditional textiles from Accha Alta are white and red. Popular designs include patterns of lakes, which are represented as diamonds, for example, ''wasqa qocha'', or long lakes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Accha Alta textile artists manage a number of techniques, including: backstrap weaving in the ''ley'' technique, backstrap weaving in the ''doble cara'' technique, knitting (including the ''Qhurpus'' knitting technique), sling braiding, rope braiding, the tubular border weaving ''chichilla'', and the crotcheted stitch known as ''kumpay'' used on the edges of textiles.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Acopia ===

Association: "Centro de Tejedores Cuatro Lagunas de Acopia"

Community: Acopia

District: [[Acopia District|Acopia]]

Province: [[Acomayo Province|Acomayo]]

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Acopia is located about two hours south of the city of [[Cusco]] in an area known as the Four Lakes, or land of Valicha after a popular [[huayno]] (folk song). The four high mountain lakes provide sustenance to local people who rely on them for fishing and irrigation for their fields. Acopia is located on the banks of the third and smallest lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|last2=Franquemont|first2=Christine|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2013|isbn=9780983886044|location=China|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weaving tradition in Acopia nearly disappeared completely as the younger generation did not continue in the footsteps of their elders. The CTTC began working with Acopia in 2006, helping the elders pass on their knowledge to younger generations. There are approximately 30 adult members in Acopia’s weaving association and 20 children.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Acopia|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Acopia blankets are woven with many thin designs in the ''doble cara'' (two sided warp-faced) technique. A distinguishing design from the community is ''organo q’enqo,'' a zig-zag pattern'''.'''&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Chahuaytire ===

Association: "Centro de Tejedores Inka Pallay de Chahuaytire"

Community: Chahuaytire

District: [[Pisac District|Pisac]]

Province: Calca

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Chahuaytire is located in the mountains above the valley town of [[Písac|Pisaq]] approximately 25 miles north of the city of Cusco. There is an Incan trail that leads from the lowlands near [[Písac]] to the highlands of Chahuaytire that has been in use since pre-Columbian times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|last2=Franquemont|first2=Christine|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2013|isbn=9780983886044|location=China|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chahuaytire weavers care for flocks of alpaca, llama and sheep higher in the mountains around their community. The CTTC began working with Chahuaytire in 1999.  There are approximately 35 adult members in Chahauytire's weaving association and 40 children.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Chahuaytire|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chahuaytire weavers are well known locally for the high quality of their weavings. Their compact warp-faced weave, careful colour combinations, and detail to border finishes make Chahuaytire textiles some of the finest in the Cusco region. Chahuaytire weavers use both the ''doble cara'' (complementary warp) and ''ley'' (supplementary warp) techniques to create wide designs. Traditional textiles from Chahauytire are dark marooon and white. Designs are woven in dark marroon or purple on white backgrounds, while plain weave ''pampa'' sections are modulations of varying hues in dark purple. maroon and/or black. Chahuaytire weavers are experts in color combination, and in non-traditional textiles deftly modulate color tones to beautiful results. A common design from Chahuaytire is ''tika qocha'', lake with flowers, which often features on blankets and ponchos. Chahauytire blankets are characterized by their unique star, or rose, stich which unites the two sides of the blanket.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Chinchero  ===

Association: "Asociación de Tejedores Awayriqcharicheq de Chinchero"

Community: Chinchero

District: [[Chinchero District|Chinchero]]

Province: [[Urubamba Province|Urubamba]]

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Chinchero is known as the ‘birthplace of the rainbow’ and is located on a high plain 45 minutes outside the city of [[Cusco]]. The town of Chinchero is composed of smaller communities, including: Cuper Bajo, Cuper Alto, Huaypo, Yanacona, and others. Chinchero is located on the road between [[Cusco]] and [[Urubamba, Peru|Urubamba]], which means that thousands of  tourists pass through Chinchero en route from the airport in [[Cusco]] to the famed ruins of [[Machu Picchu]] beyond [[Urubamba, Peru|Urubamba]]. Many tourists stop in Chinchero to visit the ruins of the summer residence of Inca [[Topa Inca Yupanqui|Tupac Yupanqui]] and to witness the town's weaving tradition. Since the CTTC began its work in the textile field, many other small textile centers have emerged in Chinchero and the town has become increasingly commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|last2=Franquemont|first2=Christine|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2013|isbn=9780983886044|location=China|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinchero weaving association was the founding association of CTTC in 1996. There are approximately 40 adult members in the Chinchero weaving association and 40 children. Since the 1960s until today, the Association "Asociación de Tejedores Awayriqcharicheq de Chinchero" (not to be confused with the many other textile centers in Chinchero that sprung up afterward), has succeeded in bringing weaving to the forefront of their community. The town of Chinchero is known internationally as a prominent Andean weaving community where efforts to revive traditions have also revitalized the town itself.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Chinchero|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chinchero is located on a major tourist byway, the weavers of the Chinchero weaving association offer demonstrations to visiting tourists and run a small store in their weaving center.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Huacatinco  ===

Association "Asociación de Tejedores Wiñay Awaqkuna de Huacatinco"

Community: Huacatinco

District: [[Ocongate District|Ocongate]]

Province: [[Quispicanchi Province|Quispicanchis]]

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Huacatinco is the latest community to partner with CTTC; it joined the non-profit in 2011. The community is located in the [[Ocongate District|Ocongate]] district, approximately three hours south of the city of [[Cusco]]. While Huacatinco is rich in local culture and natural beauty as it looks out over the snow-capped peaks of the [[Ausangate|Ausungate]] mountain range, it is one of the most impoverished areas of [[Peru]]. Some parts of the district have been completely abandoned by government services and local families are forced to be self-sufficient. Most rely on their chakra (fields) and flocks of alpaca and llama for survival. Local people mostly speak [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], and continue to wear their traditional clothing on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Huacatinco|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before partnering with CTTC, weavers from the Huacatinco association found it difficult to sell their textiles. After traveling the three hours to the city of [[Cusco]], they would search for buyers, often in vain. When a store or merchant was interested in their products, they offered extremely low prices for the detailed work. Rather than paying the weavers upfront, they would withhold payment for months, if they even paid the weavers at all. Some merchants would agree to buy the textiles, but would never follow through with their promise of future payment.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Today approximately 25 adult weavers and 20 children are members of the Huacatinco weaving association. The weavers are working to finish construction on their weaving center and to investigate their textile traditions with elders. Through the fair-trade sale of their textiles with CTTC, they are assured of a steady income for their families.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In Huacatinco both women and men knit elaborately patterned hats called ''[[chullo]]'' and weave fine textiles with the backstrap loom. Both men's and women's traditional clothing are elaborated with embroidery in white beads.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Mahuaypampa ===

Association:  "Centro de Tejedores Virgen Inmaculada Concepción de Mahuaypampa"

Community: Mahuaypampa

District: Maras

Province: [[Urubamba Province|Urubamba]]

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Mahuaypampa is located approximately 50&amp;nbsp;km to the northwest of the city of [[Cusco]] in the Maras district, just off the highway between [[Cusco]] and [[Urubamba, Peru|Urubamba]].&lt;ref name="Faces of Tradition"&gt;{{cite book|title=Faces of tradition : weaving elders of the Andes|last2=Franquemont|first2=Christine|last3=(photographer) Coca|first3=Joe|date=2013|isbn=9780983886044|last1=Alvarez|first1=Nilda Callañaupa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated on a high [[altiplano]], the community dedicates itself to agriculture as it is well situated on a wide rolling plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|last2=Franquemont|first2=Christine|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2013|isbn=9780983886044|location=China|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The textile tradition in Mahuaypampa almost disappeared as few children were learning from their elders. The Mahuaypampa association partnered with the CTTC in 2000. Since then the community has worked to recover its weaving tradition. Today there are approximately 30 adult weavers and 12 children in the Mahuaypampa weaving association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Mahuaypampa|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional designs in Mahuaypampa are small and narrow. Because of this, weavers will typically place many designs next to each other in order to build up a wider design composition. The design ''mayu qenqo,'' said to represent the [[Milky Way]], is one of the principal designs of Mahuaypampa. Blankets in Mahuaypampa are characterized by the ''enagua'' seam, which represents petticoats and is used to unite the two halves of the textile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secrets of Spinning, Weaving and Knitting in the Peruvian Highlands|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2017|isbn=9780998452357|location=China|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patabamba ===
Association: "Centro de Tejedores Away Paccarichiq Pallay Tika de Patabamba"

Community: Patabamba

District: [[Coya District|Coya]]

Province: Calca

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Patabamba is located high in the mountains above the [[Sacred Valley]] overlooking the town of [[Písac|Pisac]]. There are many [[Inca Empire|Incan]] ruins located around the community. A high mountain lake is located above Patabamba. Here locals pasture their flocks of [[sheep]], [[alpaca]] and [[llama]] while also occasionally fishing for trout. Few traditional festivals are still celebrated in Patabamba. This decline in local culture is attributed to conflicts between the older [[Catholicism|Catholic]] tradition and new [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] tradition that prohibits the expression of older belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|last2=Franquemont|first2=Christine|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2013|isbn=9780983886044|location=China|pages=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As just a handful of elders knew how to weave in Patabamba, the weaving tradition nearly disappeared. The Patabamba association partnered with the CTTC in 2001 and today approximately 40 adult weavers and 15 children are members. They continue to work to revive their weaving tradition.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Patabamba|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional ''[[lliklla]]'' (blankets) from Patabamba are woven with a wide sections of plain weave in red or green. Design sections are woven in the ''doble cara'' (complementary warp) technique. Often, weavers will sew a strip of blue or green fabric, often velvet, around the edge of their blankets. Over this border frame they will embroider figures in white thread, often images of fish, flowers, and birds. While this embellishment is decorative, it also serves to protect blanket edges from fraying with use.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Pitumarca ===

Association: "Asociación de Tejedores Munay Ticlla del Distrito de Pitumarca"

Community: Pitumarca

District: [[Pitumarca District|Pitumarca]]

Province: [[Canchis Province|Canchis]]

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Pitumarca is located approximately two hours south of the city of [[Cusco]], off the main highway passing the town of Checacupe. Pitumarca is now a large town, and weavers from surrounding communities come down from the mountains to participate in the Pitumarca weaving association which partnered with CTTC in 1997. There are approximately 50 adult weavers and 25 children in the Pitumarca weaving association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Pitumarca|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weavers of Pitumarca have maintained for thousands of years, from generation to generation, dozens of complex textile techniques that can be directly traced to specific pre-Columbian cultures. These include: ''ley'' (supplementary warp), ''doble cara'', (complementary warp), ''amapolas'' (a weaving technique that allows for designs on both sides of the textiles in up to five colors), ''ticlla'' (discontinuous warp and weft), sling and rope braiding, knitting, and other techniques. Pitumarca textiles are some of the finest and most complex in the Cusco region, and the town's official slogan is the "Andean capital of textiles." Weavers of the Pitumarca association are incredibly proud of their hard work to investigate and revive techniques like ticlla, and wear their traditional clothing with honor and pride.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2013|isbn=9780983886044|location=China|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitumarca is known internationally for its revival of the ''ticlla'' (discontinuous warp and [[Warp and woof|weft]]) technique. This complex technique allows a weaver to change the color of their warp thread by inserting sticks into their warp. The weaver warps one color between one set of warp sticks, and another color between the following set of warp sticks. The weaver then weaves the two sections together to create a unified whole. The ticlla technique can be traced as far back as the [[Chavín culture|Chavin]] culture, and was especially important to the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] who created stunning textiles solely with ticlla. The technique is unique to the pre-Columbian cultures of Peru, and cannot be found anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

For decades modern scholars believed that ticlla was but another unique Andean technique that had been lost to time. After beginning investigative work with the Pitumarca association, elders revealed that they still knew how to weave ticlla. Since then elders have taught younger generations, and Pitumarca is now the only community in Peru that continues to weave with ticlla.

=== Santa Cruz de Sallac ===

Association: "Centro de Tejedores Watay de Santa Cruz de Sallac"

Community: Santa Cruz de Sallac

District: [[Urcos District|Urcos]]

Province: [[Quispicanchi Province|Quispicanchis]]

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Santa Cruz de Sallac is located approximately two and a half hours to the south of the city of [[Cusco]] high in the mountains above the regional town of [[Urcos]]. Urcos is a market town where highways meet and merchants sell products from the [[Andes]] mountains as well as the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] jungle. Santa Cruz de Sallac is located on the opposite side of the valley from the highway that leds to [[Puerto Maldonado]] and the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] jungle.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|last2=Franquemont|first2=Christine|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2013|isbn=9780983886044|location=China|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a great sense of community in Santa Cruz de Sallac and weavers foccus on community organization and assisting each other. The weaving association is very well-organized. There are approximately 45 adult weavers and 20 children in the Santa Cruz de Sallac weaving association. The association partnered with the CTTC in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Santa Cruz de Sallac|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weavers in the Santa Cruz de Sallac association are unique in the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] region for their use of embroidery to create their designs. While they also weave patterns in the ''ley'' (supplementary warp) technique, they predominately embroider geometric shapes over plain weave backgrounds. Santa Cruz de Sallac is also well known for its revival of the ''watay'' (ikat) technique.&lt;ref name="Faces of Tradition" /&gt; In this dyeing technique, the weaver will prepare a special warp, where he or she tightly wraps up certain sections. The weaver then dyes this warp. The unwrapped sections of warp thread are dyed, but dye cannot enter the tightly wrapped sections which remain undyed. After dyeing, the weaver unwraps the sections of wrapped warp. When the weaver mounts this warp on her or his loom and weaves it as plain weave, the dyed and undyed sections form a design. Besides the Ccatcca district, Santa Cruz de Sallac is one of the only communities in [[Peru]] that still maintains the ''watay'' technique which can be traced to dyeing techniques practiced by the [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] and Huari cultures.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas) ===

Association: "Asociación de Mujeres Artesanas 'Surphuy' de Chumbivilcas"

Community: Santo Tomas

District: Santo Tomas

Province: [[Chumbivilcas Province|Chumbivilcas]]

Region: [[Cusco Region|Cusco]]

Santo Tomas is the capital of the [[Chumbivilcas Province|Chumbivilcas]] province and is located eight hours southwest from the city of [[Cusco]]. The Santo Tomas weaving center is located in the capital, but weavers from the surrounding province travel into the small city to participate. Santo Tomas is located on a high rolling plain and is known for its horseback riding tradition and cattle herds. As communities and homes are spread far apart over the rolling plains and hills, people traditionally rely on their horses for transportation. Many local festivals and traditions are based around horseback riding, and traditional clothing reflects this in the use of leather chaps, spurs, and other riding equipment.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|last2=Franquemont|first2=Christine|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2013|isbn=9780983886044|location=China|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Santo Tomas weaving association partnered with CTTC in 2007. Today approximately 20 adults and 15 children are members of the Santo Tomas weaving association. Before working with the CTTC, members of this association used acrylic yarn and chemical dyes in their textiles. After an arduous process, the weavers now use natural dyes and natural sheep wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Santo Tomas|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The textile tradition of Santo Tomas reflects their unique horseback riding tradition. Wide designs in the ''doble cara'' (complementary warp) technique often reflect horses or horses with riders. Women's traditional clothing is distinguished by bold reverse appliqué designs in black velvet over satin-like fabrics in bright reds, blues, and greens, making traditional dress from Santo Tomas highly distinct from other Cusco communities. Both women and men wear boots for horseback riding, while men wear elaborate leather leggings and spurs.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

== Education department ==
The mission of the CTTC's Education Department is to "provide an interactive space between weavers and the public through programs, investigations, and publications that promote the revaluation of ancestral textiles." The vision of the Education Department is "To achieve a future where Peruvian textile culture is valued as a global patrimony." The Education Department at the CTTC runs educational events for the weavers, the young weavers and the general public, as well as managing the museum Weaving Lives, the permanent collection of textiles, the library on textile sources, the design catalogue, investigations and publications, classes for visitors, visual materials and the volunteer program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The Young Weaver Groups ===

Each of the ten weaving associations works with a youth group called the Young Weaver Group. These are children and adolescents between the ages of six and thirty who are learning the textile traditions of their community. The CTTC places great emphasis on the young weavers as they will be responsible for carrying on traditions in the future. The Young Weaver Groups began in Chinchero in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9838860-1-3|location=China|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, each community has organized a youth group. Elder weavers work with the children to teach them designs and techniques. The Education Department organizes various activities for the young weavers each year, including: gatherings of young weavers, weaving competitions, classes on ancient textiles of Peru, field trips to local museums, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=The Young Weavers|last=|first=|date=2017-03-29|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Museum "Weaving Lives" ===

Located on Av Sol 603, [[Cusco]], [[Peru|Perú]], the museum Weaving Lives details the backstrap weaving process, unique Peruvian textile techniques, traditional uses of textiles in the Andes, as well as traditions and practices associated with textiles. Opened to the public in 2001, the small museum presents five rooms that display textiles, photography, and text in Spanish and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=The Museum Weaving Lives|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The CTTC Permanent Collection of Textiles ===

Since its founding in 1996, the CTTC has developed a unique ethnographic collection of traditional textiles from the Andes that include: examples of the traditional clothing from each of the ten communities, examples of the rudimentary textiles made before the CTTC's investigative work, exemplary textiles created after the CTTC's investigative work, pieces from the annual competition "Weaver Awards," amongst others. Pieces from the CTTC Permanent Collection of Textiles have been displayed in local and international exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=The Permanent Collection of Textiles|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CTTC Library ===

The CTTC maintains a small library of textile sources, used for investigative work with the weavers and visiting scholars. Much of the replication work completed by the weavers of the CTTC is conducted through reference to textual sources.

=== The CTTC Design Catalogue ===

Each community maintains a unique repertoire of designs that represent their history and culture. Since 1996, the CTTC has worked to create a reference catalogue for each community that documents every design as well as each design variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9838860-1-3|location=China|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investigations and Publications ===

Through extensive investigative work with the elders of each community, the CTTC works to recover ancient designs, techniques, and styles that were on the brink of being lost to time. The Center has published a number of articles, books and DVDs based on its efforts, including:
* ''Weaving Lives: Traditional Textiles of Cusco, Preserving the Textile Tradition,'' published in 2005 by the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco
*  ''Weaving in the Peruvian Highlands: Dreaming Patterns, Weaving Memories, published in 2007 by Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez
* ''Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage,'' published in 2012 by Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez
* ''Faces of Tradition: Weaving Elders of the Andes'', published in 2013 by Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez and Christine Franquemont

=== The Weaver Awards ===

Since 2006 CTTC has partnered with Culture Explorers to offer the 'Weaver Awards,' an annual weaving competition, to the ten weaving associations that partner with CTTC. The Weaver Awards inspire the weavers to unite their efforts to create exceptional pieces that are inducted into the CTTC's Permanent Collection of textiles or that are acquired by international collectors and museums. The Weaver Awards help provide additional income to impoverished communities while encouraging excellence in the textile arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9838860-1-3|location=China|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textile Classes ===

The CTTC offers four courses on traditional Andean textiles: spinning, backstrap weaving, knitting, and sling braiding. Each course is one to three days in length, except for the knitting course which is only offered for a full three days. The classes are private and teach the basic skills of spinning with a drop spindle, weaving on a backstrap loom, knitting in the Chinchero style, and braiding ropes and slings from Pitumarca. The CTTC's policy concerning the teaching of traditional techniques is a balance between educating the public and respecting the intellectual property rights of indigenous peoples. The CTTC offers up to three days of instruction in traditional techniques, as this time frame is enough for students to gain greater respect for the complex, millennia old techniques. The CTTC does not offer more than three days of class time, as this would risk compromising the intellectual property rights of the indigenous weavers it works with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Weaving Classe|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The CTTC Volunteer Program ===

The CTTC offers two volunteer positions, Education Department Volunteers and Project Volunteers. In the Education Department volunteers assist with various projects and events run for the weavers and the public. Project Volunteers work on unique projects in support of the CTTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Volunteer|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sales and marketing department ==

The Sales &amp; Marketing Department promotes the sale on a fair-trade basis of the weaver's textile art. The Sales &amp; Marketing Department manages five physical store locations, as well as an online catalogue. The main CTTC store, which sells woven textiles, is located on Av Sol 603, Cusco, Peru. Directly next door to its main store, the CTTC runs a small knitwear store. Besides the main two stores on Av Sol, the Sales and Marketing Department runs a small museum shop in Museo Inka and another museum shop in [[Museo de Arte Precolombino (Peru)|Museo de Arte Precolombino]], both located in the historic center of [[Cusco]]. The fifth CTTC store is located at the weaving complex in the community of Chinchero. The CTTC also exports to stores and companies located in the USA and Canada.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textilescusco.org/|title=Shops|last=|first=|date=28 March 2017|website=Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale on a fair-trade basis of the weaver's work has been the main contributing factor in improving the quality of life of member weavers. With improved income, families are able to send their children to school, access better health care, and make improvements to their homes. Women have been provided with independent incomes from their male relatives, which has improved their standing in community life.

=== Products ===

The CTTC offers traditional textiles as well as modern products created in various techniques including: backstrap weaving, knitting, and rope braiding. Each piece is made with natural alpaca, sheep or llama fiber and dyed with natural plant and animal dyes. Each item is authored and includes a photo of the artist, their birthdate, and their community. Traditional textiles offered by the CTTC include: ''[[lliklla]]'' (blankets), ponchos, ''unkuna'' (a cloth to carry coca leaves), ''chumpi'' (belts), ''jakima'' (small ribbons), slings, and ''[[chullo]]'' (knitted hats), amongst others. Non-traditional products offered by the CTTC include: wall hangings and wall art, home decor, bags and purses, accessories, and modern clothing items, amongst others.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

== Special Projects ==
Besides the Education Department and the Sales &amp; Marketing Department, the CTTC runs a number of special projects that seek to revive textile traditions in the Cusco region.

=== Natural dyes ===

Since 1999, the CTTC has been the leader in the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] region in the revival of natural dyes.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9838860-1-3|location=China|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weavers from the community of Chinchero, led by Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez, held investigations with elders, attended international workshops and conferences, and conducted many experiments before reviving the natural dyeing process in the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] region. The CTTC is recognized internationally as the main force in reviving natural dyeing in the Cusco region where today many weavers once more use ancient dyes once practiced by their ancestors.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Natural dyes revived by the CTTC include:
* Anil ([[indigo]]) - ''[[Indigofera suffruticosa|Indigófera suffruticosa]]'', familia Fabaceae - produces all shades of blue from light to dark&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9838860-1-3|location=China|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chaphi (Palo Palo) - ''[[Galium aparine]]'', familia Rubiaceae - produces a light shade of pink or peach&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Checchi - ''Berberis carinata'', familia Berberidaceae - produces shades of yellow&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Ch'illka - ''Baccharis caespitosa'', familia Asteraceae - produces shades of green&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* [[Cochineal]] - [[Dactylopius coccus|''Dactylopius coccu''s]], familia Dactylopiidae - produces shades of red, pinks, purples and oranges depending on what mordant is used in the dye vat&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Kiku - ''Bidens andicola'', familia Asteraceae - produces shades of yellow&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Q'olle - ''Budleja coriaceae'', familia Loganiaceae - produces shades of yellow and orange when mixed with cochineal&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Kinsa k'uchu - ''Baccharis genistelloides'', familia Asteraceae - produces a light shade of turquoise. Note, it is a black fungus on the leaf Kinsa kuchu that produces the dye, not the leaf itself.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Molle - ''[[Schinus molle|Sichinus molle]]'', familia Anacardiaceae - produces shades of yellow&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Mot'e - ''[[Vaccinium floribundum]]'', familia Ericaceae -produces shades of burgundy&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Nogal (walnut) - ''[[Juglans neotropica]]'', familia juglandaceae - produces shades of brown&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Q'aq'a sunkha - ''Usnea barbata'', familia Usneaceae - produces shades of dark orange to brown&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;
* Tayanka - ''Baccharis buxifolia'', familia Asteraceae - produces shades of yellow to lime green&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== The Indigo Project ===

The strain of indigo found in pre-Columbian textiles is native to South America. After investigations and a long revival process, the CTTC establish a small plantation in the community of Huayro where it farms approximately five acres of native ''[[Indigofera suffruticosa|Indigófera suffruticosa]]'' plants.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Indigo is the only plant in the world that produces blue dye. The process of extracting the dye from the leaves of the plant is long and laborious. After harvesting, leaves must be oxidized in large vats of water that are left to evaporate. The resultant mixture is then heated to remove remaining excess water and produce a hard cake of indigo dye. This dye is later mixed with human urine and left to ferment underground with the yarn for a month to produce the dyed yarn. The CTTC's Indigo Project seeks to maintain the unique strain of indigo native to South America, and serves to educate the public about the importance of natural dyes.

=== Replica Work ===

The CTTC is known internationally for its work in replicas of Pre-Columbian and Colonial textiles. The CTTC's replica projects include, amongst others: 
* The Juanita Mummy - working jointly with Dr Bill Conklin, Jose Antonio Chavez (director of the Museo Santuarios Andinos at the [[Catholic University of Santa María|Catholic University of Santa Maria]] in [[Arequipa]]), and [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], weavers from the CTTC traveled to [[Arequipa]] to analyze the textiles of the Juanita Mummy, discovered by [[Johan Reinhard]] in 1995 on the [[Ampato]] Mountain above [[Arequipa]]. CTTC weavers replicated the ''[[lliklla]]'' (blanket), ''axsu'' (dress), and ''chumpi'' (belt), of the mummy after a laborious investigative process to determine the techniques and designs of the textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9838860-1-3|location=China|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinchero weaver Carolina Concha W. comments that "When we went to the museum we wanted to open the showcase where 'Juanita' was exhibited, to touch, see and examine the designs. It was hard to see, and it was frozen. To replicate the designs was very difficult. We tried again and again until we thought that it might not have been woven in our style of warp-faced weaving. With great effort, the designs started to show, and I felt so excited! We discussed all kinds of commentaries and jokes, like Juanita didn't want us to replicate her designs and her textiles, but we did. I know that  for some of us, it is still impossible to replicate the designs, but we feel very proud of weaving the heritage of our Incan textile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Textile Traditions of Chinchero: A Living Heritage|last=Callañaupa Alvarez|first=Nilda|publisher=Thrums Books|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9838860-1-3|location=China|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The poncho of [[José de San Martín|Jose de San Martin]] - Contacted by an associate of the Museo Histórico Regional de Buenos Aires – Argentina, where the original piece is housed, weavers from the CTTC replicated the poncho of [[José de San Martín|Jose de San Martin]] in complementary warp faced weave.
* The poncho of [[Simón Bolívar|Simon Bolivar]] - Contacted by the director of the [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú]], weavers from the CTTC realized a replica of the poncho of [[Simón Bolívar|Simon Bolivar]].

=== Tinkuy: Gathering of the Textile Arts ===

Tinkuy is an international textile conference organized by CTTC approximately every three years starting in 2010. Tinkuy gathers together indigenous weavers, textile artists, anthropologists, art historians and textile enthusiasts. The conference is composed of lectures, presentations, workshops, demonstrations and other events. The next Tinkuy is scheduled for November 2017. During Tinkuy indigenous textile artists from across the world meet to share and celebrate their textile traditions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Concert production''' is the act of putting on a [[concert]] or a live music performance.  As an individual's role, this refers to the person coordinating all the staff and equipment necessary to make a concert happen; they monitor the schedule, pay the staff, act as a hub for communication between team members, and generally make sure the event runs smoothly.  The role of a '''concert producer''' or '''concert promoter''' is best filled by a person with good organizational skills, a [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] demeanor, and plenty of charisma.  As a company's role, concert production may also include the responsibility of [[Talent agency|booking]] the musicians, [[marketing]] the concert, and the financial loss or gain of the event. Over the last 10 years, the number of independent concert producers in the United States has diminished greatly due to acquisition of smaller firms by large national companies.

'''Contemporary dance''' is a genre of [[Concert dance|dance performance]] that developed during the mid twentieth century and has since grown to become one of the dominant genres for formally trained dancers throughout the world, with particularly strong popularity in the U.S. and Europe. Although originally informed by and borrowing from [[classical dance|classical]], [[modern dance|modern]], and [[Jazz dance|jazz]] styles, it has since come to incorporate elements from many styles of dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concordia University Contemporary Dance Program|url=https://www.concordia.ca/programs-and-courses/undergraduate-programs/a-z-subject-list/bfa_contemporarydance.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its technical similarities, it is often perceived to be closely related to modern dance, ballet, and other classical concert dance styles.

In terms of the focus of its technique, contemporary dance tends to combine the strong but controlled legwork of ballet with modern that stresses on torso. It also employs contract-release, [[floor work]], fall and recovery, and improvisation characteristics of modern dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheff|first=Helene |author2=Marty Sprague |author3=Susan McGreevy-Nichols |title=Exploring dance forms and styles: a guide to concert, world, social, and historical dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phJqR8gMWRUC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22Contemporary+dance%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Contemporary%20dance%22&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=0-7360-8023-6|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction are often used, as well. Additionally, contemporary dance sometimes incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures, such as elements from African dance including bent knees, or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance, [[Butoh]].&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins of Contemporary Dance|url=http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Origins_of_Contemporary_Dance|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Contemporary&gt;{{cite web|title=Contemporary Dance History|url=http://www.contemporary-dance.org/contemporary-dance-history.html|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Modern dance}}
[[File:ATERBalletto.jpg|thumb|222px|Contemporary dance performed by Le Sacre]]
Contemporary dance draws on both classical ballet and modern dance, whereas [[postmodern dance]] was a direct and opposite response to modern dance. [[Merce Cunningham]] is considered to be the first choreographer to "develop an independent attitude towards modern dance" and defy the ideas that were established by it.&lt;ref name="Contemporary"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Modern&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Dance Pioneers|url=http://www.groovygames.com/hinge/writing/articles/Beginner%27s%20Guide%204.htm|accessdate=28 February 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 Cunningham accompanied his dance with music by [[John Cage]], who observed that Cunningham's dance "no longer relies on linear elements (...) nor does it rely on a movement towards and away from climax. As in [[abstract painting]], it is assumed that an element (a movement, a [[sound]], a change of light) is in and of itself expressive; what it communicates is in large part determined by the observer themselves." Cunningham formed the [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]] in 1953 and went on to create more than one hundred and fifty works for the company, many of which have been performed internationally by ballet and modern [[dance companies]].

==Cunningham's key ideas==
Cunningham's key ideas include:
* Contemporary dance does refuse the classical ballet's leg technique in favor of modern dance's stress on the torso
* Contemporary dance is not necessarily [[narrative]] form of art
* Choreography that appears disordered, but nevertheless relies on technique
* Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction 
* Multiple and simultaneous actions
* Suspension of perspective and symmetry in ballet scenic frame perspective such as front, center, and hierarchies
* Creative freedom
* "Independence between dance and music"
* Dance to be danced, not analyzed
* Innovative lighting, sets, and costumes in collaboration with [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and [[Jasper Johns]] &lt;ref name="Contemporary"/&gt;

Other pioneers of contemporary dance (the offspring of modern and postmodern) include [[Ruth St. Denis]], [[Doris Humphrey]], [[Mary Wigman]], [[Francois Delsarte]], [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]], [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], [[Rudolph von Laban]], [[Loie Fuller]], [[Jose Limon]] and [[Marie Rambert]].

==Choreographer's role==
There is usually a choreographer who makes the creative decisions and decides whether the piece is an abstract or a [[narrative]] one. Dancers are selected based on their skill and training. The choreography is determined based on its relation to the music or sounds that is danced to. The role of music in contemporary dance is different from in other genres because it can serve as a backdrop to the piece. The choreographer has control over the costumes and their aesthetic value for the overall composition of the performance and also in regards to how they influence dancers’ movements.&lt;ref name=Choreo&gt;{{cite web|title=Choreo|url=http://www.contemporary-dance.org/choreography.html|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance technique==
[[File:Le_Sacre_du_Tempo.jpg|thumb|Le Sacre du Tempo]]
Dance techniques and movement philosophies employed in contemporary dance may include [[Contemporary ballet]], [[Dance improvisation]], [[Modern dance]] styles from [[United States]] such as [[Graham technique]], [[Humphrey-Weidman]] technique and [[Lester Horton|Horton]] technique, [[Modern dance]] of [[Europe]] [[Bartenieff Fundamentals]] and the dance technique of [[Isadora Duncan]] (also see [[Free dance]]).

Contemporary dancers train using contemporary dance techniques as well as non-dance related practices such as [[Pilates]], [[Yoga]], the acting practice of [[Corporeal mime]] - [[Étienne Decroux]] technique and somatic practices such as [[Alexander technique]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juilliard.edu/college/dance/curriculum_outline.html The Juilliard School - Dance Division - Curriculum Outline]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feldenkrais Method]], Sullivan Technique and [[Eric Franklin|Franklin-Methode]], American contemporary techniques such as [[José Limón]] technique and [[Erick Hawkins|Hawkins]] technique and [[Postmodern dance]] techniques such as [[Contact improvisation]] and [[Merce Cunningham|Cunningham]] technique,  and [[Release technique]].

Some well-known choreographers and creators of contemporary dance created schools and techniques of their own. [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]] developed a dance technique called Taylor technique, which is now taught at modern dance schools like The Ailey School in New York City.

The '''Crescent Theater''' is a single-screen [[movie theater]] located in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. The theater mainly shows [[independent film|independent]] and [[arthouse cinema]], though several mainstream films have been included. It also operates as the home of local cinema and film competitions, and has been used for music and [[improvisational comedy]]. It was first opened in 1885 as the Crescent Theater for [[vaudeville]] entertainment. In the intervening years, the building became a cinema and later was used for restaurants, before being reopened in October 2008 by Max Morey, the theater's owner and operator.
==Background==
The Crescent Theater first opened at 208 Dauphin Street in Mobile in 1885, offering vaudeville and [[burlesque]] shows. In 1912, it was converted to show [[silent film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crescenttheater.com/about/|title=Crescent Theater - Mobile, Alabama, Independent Movie Theater|website=CrescentTheater.com|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, the building was used for several restaurants, and by 2006, it was operating as Derry's Ole Tyme Cafe. It suffered damage that year when a neighboring bar, Monsoon's, caught fire.

The building was later rented to Max Morey, who reopened as the Crescent Theater on October 31, 2008. Morey had first visited the city in 1992 and, according to the ''[[Press-Register]]'', "vowed that he was going to save his money and build a movie theater there." The theater was successful, and has been credited with revitalizing downtown Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/just-coasting/2010/12/downtown_mobile_festivities_sh.html|first=Lawrence|last=Specker|title=Downtown Mobile festivities showcase area's growth|date=December 30, 2010|accessdate=July 27, 2017|work=[[Press-Register]]|publisher=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it nearly shuttered when costs mounted for a switch to digital projection, but a [[Kickstarter]] raised over $84,000 to keep the theater operating. In 2017, it again faced closure when its rent rose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/04/crescent_theater_downtown_mobi.html|first=Michelle|last=Matthews|title=Crescent Theater in downtown Mobile set to close|date=April 6, 2017|accessdate=July 27, 2017|work=[[Press-Register]]|publisher=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but met its $72,000 goal to stay open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/06/crescent_theater_exceeds_fundr.html|first=Michelle|last=Matthews|title=Crescent Theater meets fundraising goal, will stay open for two more years|date=June 24, 2017|accessdate=July 27, 2017|work=[[Press-Register]]|publisher=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater is financially supported by the Crescent Theater Film Society, a [[nonprofit group]].

The theater was ranked the "coolest movie theater" in Alabama by ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/g10356491/best-movie-theater-in-every-state/|title=The Coolest Movie Theater in Every State|first=Kate|last=Beckman|work=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]|date=July 26, 2017|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival'''  is a [[theatrical]] event held annually in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]] during the first two weeks of May.  The 15th festival will be held from 7–20 May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaytheatre.ie&lt;/ref&gt; Over 70% of the festival's content comes from outside Ireland.  The Festival has included productions from countries as diverse as [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Canada]] as well as strong representation from the [[UK]], [[Ireland]] and the [[United States]].  Festival 2016 saw the 3,500th performance of a Festival production since 2004.

==History==
The festival was founded in 2004 in order to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Dublin-born [[Oscar Wilde]] in his native city, and to encourage and develop concepts of gay theatre. The image of Oscar Wilde was first used as the official festival logo in 2006 and remains so today.  This image is combined with that of the green carnation, which is a gay symbol associated with both Oscar Wilde and homosexuality within the world of theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaytheatre.ie/about/about_our_logo/&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival's patrons are Senator [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]], writer [[Emma Donoghue]] and playwright [[Terrence McNally]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaytheatre.ie/about/festival_patrons/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The festival has continued to grow year on year and has been sponsored by various organisations including [[Arts Council (Ireland)|The Arts Council]], [[Dublin City Council]], Visit Dublin and [[The George, Dublin|The George]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaytheatre.ie/about/friends_and_supporters/|title=Friends and Supporters List {{!}} International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival|website=www.gaytheatre.ie|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its official website, the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival provides "theatrical and academic fora for the presentation of new and exciting works by gay authors, or works that have a gay character, theme, relevance or other input by a gay artist to promote visibility and recognition of gay people's contribution to the arts nationally and internationally."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12687">'''Encastellation''' (sometimes '''castellation''', which can also mean [[Battlement|crenellation]]) is the process whereby the [[Feudalism|feudal]] kingdoms of [[Europe]] became dotted with [[castle]]s, from which local lords could dominate the countryside of their fiefs and their neighbours', and from which kings could command even the far-off corners of their realms. The ubiquity of the castle is iconic of the [[Middle Ages]]. 

The process was rather quick once the castle, as a distinct type of fortress, was introduced. However, it took different forms in different lands. The methods and reasons of encastellation differed based on law (who could legally build a castle), necessity (who needed a castle), and geography (where could castles be effectively built). The stone castle originated probably in the north of [[France]] in the tenth century. Older wooden castles, of the [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte-and-bailey]] variety are probably older, though they were far more common until well into the twelfth century.

==France==
In France, encastellation began in the north, in [[Normandy]] and [[Anjou]], under the direction both of local barons as well as the [[Duke of Normandy]] and the [[Counts and dukes of Anjou|Count of Anjou]]. Most of these castles were of the motte-and-bailey type, which could be constructed with ease in a few months. Stone castles, however, were built before the end of the tenth century in Anjou.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, p ?.&lt;/ref&gt; These were originally nothing more than towers, [[Keep|donjons]] (from whence [[dungeon]]) or keeps. The reason for this proliferation was to provide oneself with protection in times of war, primarily as a place of refuge, but also as a strategic headquarters: a place from which to sally forth to raid and plunder before retreating to safety (again, the castle). For example, in Normandy:
{{cquote|Because [Hugh of Abbeville's peers] were not all lords of castles, [he] became more powerful than the rest of his peers. For he could do what he liked without fear, relying on the protection of the castle, while others, if they tried anything, were easily overcome as they had no refuge.&lt;ref&gt;Hariulf.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From Normandy and Anjou, encastellation spread to the [[Loire Valley]]. In [[Poitou]], there were thirty nine castles by the eleventh century, the constructions primarily of local magnates. Fortification had briskly increased in Gaul during the [[Viking Age]] (see [[Edict of Pistres]]) and this merely continued apace while the [[Carolingian dynasty]] declined in importance and regional control devolved to regional lords. 

In [[Languedoc]] and the south of France, there were more serious attempts, the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movements, to curb feudal warfare. But with the spread of heresy came the spread of castles as fortresses to which heretic barons could flee, such as the "five sons of Carcassonne."

==Italy==
In Italy, the process of encastellation is known as ''incastellamento''. It has a specific notion, as the ''incastellamento'' describes less the building of castles than the change towards fortified settlements, in which the castle proper (''rocca'') is a separate part. The term 'incastellamento' for this process was coined by [[Pierre Toubert]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Toubert: Les structures du Latium médiéval. Le Latium méridional et la Sabine du 9e siècle à la fin du 12e siècle, Rom 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; As in France, it was a different process in the north and the south. 

In the north, the castles were originally the seats of the barons. They spread quickly after the disruption of royal authority in Italy in the mid-tenth century. By the eleventh century, the territorial magnates, like the [[List of rulers of Tuscany|margrave of Tuscany]], were supreme and castles dotted the landscape. With the rise of the city-states after the collapse of Tuscan power in the early twelfth century, the powerful merchant families began to construct fortress and towers as residences in the cities. Well-preserved [[San Gimignano]] was the result of the struggle between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]. 

In the centre of the peninsula, the [[Papal States]], the agents of encastellation were not large territorial magnates, but the petty nobles who belonged to various families and factions usually associated with [[Rome]] in some way. The [[Crescentii]] and the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] constructed fortresses throughout [[Latium]] to dominate the roads leading to the Eternal City and the Vatican. During the papal nadir of the tenth and eleventh centuries, their hilltop fortresses gave these minor lords far more power than their territories would otherwise permit. In Rome itself, encastellation often led to the fortifying of the ancient monuments which had fallen into disuses, such as the [[Arch of Constantine]] and the [[Colosseum]]. These fortresses were usually in the hands of one of the powerful lay families, but sometimes of the popes. 

In the [[Southern Italy|Mezzogiorno]], the independent principalities of the [[Lombards]] and the Greek city-states, which distanced themselves from any central authority, formed an opportune place for the proliferation of castles. Indeed, the nominally Byzantine duchies of [[Gaeta]], [[Naples]], and [[Amalfi]] grew around what were originally small coastal fortresses. The decline of ducal authority in these places has been blamed on the tendency to give outlying regions to younger sons (e.g. [[Docibilis II of Gaeta]] granting [[Fondi]] to [[Marinus II of Gaeta|Marinus]]), who then built their own fortresses and thus became independent in fact. Historian G. A. Loud considers ''incastellamento'' as one of the chief reasons for the decline in princely influence in Benevento and Capua (especially the former) during the late tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Loud, p 481.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Barbara Kreutz notes the encastellation of the monastic estates which dominated south Italian politics and contributed to the constant confiscation and invasion of monastic estates as lay barons sought to increase their power against their foes during the war-filled eleventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Kreutz, pp 134-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of the [[Normans]], adept castle-builders, in the early eleventh century only exacerbated the tendency toward fortification of every hilltop. Together with the [[List of Princes of Salerno|Prince of Salerno]], they subdued [[Calabria]] and encastellated its mountainous territory, leading to the inevitable invasion of [[Sicily]].

==Spain==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The encastellation of Spain is inextricably linked to the [[Reconquista]]. That said, encastellation occurred mostly in the centre of the peninsula. This region, originally a county of the [[Kingdom of León]], even adopted the name [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] because of its many castles. The castles first began to spread quickly in the tenth century, in light of the increasing power of the Castilian counts ''vis-à-vis'' the king. During the long reign of Count [[Fernán González of Castile|Fernán González]], Castile became ''de facto'' independent and its castles multiplied.

==Britain==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
True medieval castles were a somewhat later arrival in Britain than in continental Europe. The process of encastellation in Britain is as inextricably linked to [[Normans|Normanisation]] (which is, of course, linked to the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]]) as the encastellation of Spain is to the Reconquista.

===England===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Normanisation began in England before the Conquest primarily through the Norman sojourn of [[Æthelred the Unready|Ethelred II]] and the influence of his Norman queen [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]]. During the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]] (1042&amp;ndash;1066), definite strides were taken in spreading Norman ideas to England. Castles were first built in England in his reign under the direction especially of his Norman [[marcher lord]] [[Ralph the Timid]]. 

Encastellation began in earnest under [[William the Conqueror]] in the years immediately following the [[Battle of Hastings]]. Castles of the motte-and-bailey were erected quickly all over the country to subdue the locals and prevent foreign invasions by rival claimants to the throne. Within a matter of years, England was fully castled. Most of these castles belonged to the king or one of his tenants-in-chief. The construction of numerous castles by minor lords was a feature, as in most places, of the reign of weaker kings. After the iron hand of William's sons had passed, [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen]] took the throne and [[the Anarchy]] (1135&amp;ndash;1152) of civil war which characterised his reign saw the proliferation of [[Adulterine castle|adulterine]] (unauthorised) castles: to the number of 1,115, according to one chronicler.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===Wales===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The [[Welsh Marches]] had been encastellated from an early date, beginning even before the Conquest. However, the proliferation of castles in Wales dates only from [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|its English conquest]], though a few stone castles date from the reign of [[Llywelyn the Great]]. 

Motte-and-bailey castles existed from before the thirteenth century in those parts of Wales which fell under English authority and they spread in south Wales after its conquest, but the most famous encastellation of Wales occurred in the north under [[Edward I of England]] (1272&amp;ndash;1307). His famous Edwardian [[concentric castle]]s, large stoneworks with multiple rings of defences, grew up at strategic locations throughout the north and the local populace was placed securely under English authority. In this case, encastellation was the result, not of weak central authority, but of a strong royal hand and direction.

===Scotland===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
In [[Scotland]], the spread of castles came with the Normans who, in the twelfth century, began constructing castles of the motte-and-bailey type in the south, where they received royal support, especially in [[Galloway]]. At about the same time, the first stone castles appeared in the north, in [[Orkney]], built not by Normans but by the [[Vikings|Norse]].

===Ireland===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
In [[Ireland]], as in the rest of Britain and most of Europe, encastellation was primarily a Norman venture. The first castles were motte-and-baileys built on the expanding frontier of the [[The Pale|English Pale]] and within it to control the local population, according to [[Gerald of Wales]]. Stone castles were slow to develop, appearing in the late thirteenth century.

==Germany==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
As in France, so in Germany: the impetus for encastellation was provided, not by a strong monarch, but by the weakening of royal authority. During the eleventh-century [[Investiture Controversy]] in Germany and the resulting decline of the royal power, castle-building exploded as local warlords staked claims to formerly royal prerogatives in their petty states. 

In [[Prussia]], during the [[Drang nach Osten]] and the [[Northern Crusades]] of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, encastellation was the result of the [[List of rulers of Brandenburg|Margraves of Brandenburg]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]], who, among others, conquered the land from the pagan [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]. The construction of castles to control territories occurred at a late point in the development of the castle and these fortresses were large and complex. They were called ''[[Ordensburg]]en'' and they served as headquarters and training grounds for initiates into the knightly orders.

'''Santa Maria dello Stellario''' (or Church of Stellario)  was a [[catholic]] Church  located in piazza Ciullo, in the town centre of [[Alcamo]], in  the [[province of Trapani]].
==History==  
It was founded in the 17th century by [[Mariano da Alcamo]], a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin| Capuchin]] friar, and consecrated in 1625. As the historian [[Ignazio De Blasi]] affirms in his work, they carried the [[Holy Sacrament]] and the painting of ''Maria Santissima dello Stellario'' in procession to this Church,  to ask her intercession for rain to come. It had not rained for several months: it rained  continuously for three consecutive days.&lt;ref name=Messi&gt;Messina, Salvatore (2015). Alcamo nella storia, nella leggenda e nell'arte. Alcamo: Campo.&lt;/ref&gt;
The founder also created the homonimous [[confraternity]] in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Bembina, G.B. (1956). Alcamo sacra; con note di P. M. Rocca, rivedute ed accresciute da Francesco Maria Mirabella. Alcamo: Accademia di studi Cielo d'Alcamo.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, before being demolished,  the Church was not in bad conditions: in fact, in 1939  Maria De Blasi Casale, a widow,  had financed the restoration of its roof.&lt;ref&gt;"La Chiesa dello Stellario ad Alcamo. Uno scempio impunito"&lt;/ref&gt;
===Description===
The [[façade]] had a fine portal; the Church had a single [[nave]], there were [[Ionic capitals]] and two altars on both sides. On the high altar there was a painting of the titular saint, later missing, realized by  Giuseppe La Ficara in 1651.&lt;ref name=Cata&gt;Cataldo, Carlo (2001). La conchiglia di S.Giacomo. Alcamo: Campo&lt;/ref&gt;The picture, with a low artistic value, represented [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] on a throne of clouds, in the middle of 12 stars and the [[Infant Jesus]] in her arms; there were a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] and a capuchin friar on the sides, while the Eternal father and the Holy Ghost were portrayed in the upper part.&lt;ref name=Messi/&gt;

In 1769 the Church was embellished with [[Stucco|stuccoes]];  inside it there were also some ancient crypts which were destroyed during the demolition, made after the building had been sold by the [[Curia (Catholic Church)|Curia]] of Trapani. With the income they bought a piece of land in viale Europa, in order to provide that area with a [[parish Church]], later called [[Church of the Holy Heart (Alcamo)|chiesa del Sacro Cuore]].

===The confraternity of Santa Maria dello Stellario===
It was founded on 21 June 1602 in the [[Mother church (Alcamo)|Mother church]] and had its oratory inside this Church. From the information that the historian Ignazio De Blasi handed down, we know that its brethren were butchers and farmers.&lt;ref name=Cata/&gt; They wore a sack and a visor made with linen cloth,  a fabric mantle with the image of  Maria Santissima dello Stellario, and a big cordon; they went barefoot, with sandals like capuchin friars,  the order which their founder, Father [[Mariano da Alcamo|Mariano Bonofino]],  belonged to.&lt;ref name=Cata/&gt;
The confraternity dissolved  in the forties.
====Duties of the brethren====  
Here it is the list of their obligations:  
*Being always very diligent, in any occasion 
*Taking part in the [[sung Mass]] and receive Communion on 8th September, festivity of their titular Saint.
*Taking part in the procession of [[Corpus Domini]] and on its [[Octave (liturgy)|Octave]]
*Accompanying dead brethren to their sepulchre and complying with the Easter Precept on [[Maundy Thursday]], in the Church of the Capuchin friars.&lt;ref name=Cata/&gt;

'''Femina Potens''' ([[Latin]]: ''Powerful Woman'') is a non-profit [[art gallery]] and [[performance art]] space located in [[San Francisco, California]], founded in 2001 by artistic director [[Madison Young]], which seeks to bring greater visibility and advancement to female artists, including [[transgender]] ones.

==History==
Femina Potens was originally a theater company dedicated to producing original works by local female playwrights, actors, and directors. It was formed in [[Cincinnati]] by Madison Young, who later moved to [[San Francisco]] in 2001 to perform with Woman's Will, the Bay Area's all-woman Shakespeare company. After founding, Femina Potens featured such artists as [[Angela Regas]], [[Mari Schaal]], [[Michelle Tea]], [[Aphrodites Hymen]], Dumbwaiter, [[The Reputation]], [[Blevin Blechdom]], along with open mic [[poetry]] events and anarchist crochet circles.

In 2003 Femina Potens then moved to its {{convert|800|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} space in the San Francisco Mission district where the gallery started to flourish. In May 2003 Femina Potens found a fiscal sponsor (SF Media Archive) and in November 2004 changed its fiscal sponsorship to Queer Cultural Center and through them received non-profit status. In the past 4 years Femina Potens has produced nearly 300 art and cultural events for the [[LGBTQ]], women, trans, [[queer]] and kink communities in San Francisco. Producing monthly spoken word open mic events, queer film screenings, music and dance events, and month visual art openings. Femina Potens has been recognized for its work in the community by Bitch Magazine, Curve Magazine, MTV's LOGO, Herbivore Magazine, Japan's FOIL Magazine, HERE TV, QTV, San Francisco Guardian, SF Weekly, SF Chronicle, London's [[Skin Two]] Magazine and more.

In 2007 Femina Potens moved into a {{convert|1300|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} store front space in the [[Castro District]] that had been inhabited for 25 years by Image Leather - a landmark in the Castro neighborhood and the [[leather subculture]]. Located at 2199 Market St. San Francisco CA 94114 one block from the Church MUNI Station.  Tenure there was short, and they now reside at 3435 Cesar Chavez St. in San Francisco.

==Notable artists and events==
Femina Potens has worked to bring the best women and transgender artists to the community, coupling world-renowned visual and performing artists with talented new emerging artists. These multi-generational performances and exhibitions encourage to artists to thrive while well-established artists and heroines stand on the same stage or placed on the same wall acting as mentors for fledgling artists.

'''''Flower Drum Song''''' is a 1961 [[film adaptation]] of the 1958 [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'', written by the composer [[Richard Rodgers]] and the lyricist/librettist [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. The film and stage play were based on the 1957 [[The Flower Drum Song|novel of the same name]] by the [[Chinese American]] author [[C. Y. Lee (author)|C. Y. Lee]].

In 2008, ''Flower Drum Song'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

''Flower Drum Song'' became the first major Hollywood feature film to have a majority Asian cast in a contemporary Asian-American story. It would be the last film to do so for a third of a century, until 1993's [[The Joy Luck Club (film)|''The Joy Luck Club'']].&lt;ref name=NYT-2018-08-08&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/movies/crazy-rich-asians-cast.html |title= ‘Crazy Rich Asians’: Why Did It Take So Long to See a Cast Like This? |author= Robert Ito |date= 8 August 2018 |publisher= New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC-2018-08-13&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/six-decades-ago-flower-drum-song-featured-hollywood-s-first-n899576 |title= Six decades ago, 'Flower Drum Song' featured Hollywood's first Asian-American cast |date= 13 August 2018 |author= Melissa Hung |publisher= NBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Nancy Kwan and Jack Soo in Flower Drum Song 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sammy Fong (Jack Soo) and Linda Low (Nancy Kwan) in ''Flower Drum Song''.]]
A young woman named Mei Li emigrates from [[China]] to [[Chinatown, San Francisco]] as an [[illegal immigrant]] with her father. After landing, the Lis seek the address of Madam Fong, the mother of Sammy Fong, to whom Mei Li has been promised in an [[arranged marriage]]. While asking where to find Madam Fong, Mei Li [[street performance|performs]] a [[Flower Drum Song (song)|flower drum song]] to earn money ("A Hundred Million Miracles"). Sammy is the owner of a night club, the Celestial Gardens (inspired by the actual [[Forbidden City (nightclub)|Forbidden City nightclub]]) and is already romantically involved with his leading [[showgirl]], Linda Low. The Lis arrive at the Celestial Gardens during a show ("Fan Tan Fannie").

Sammy does his best to dissuade Mei Li from marrying him, introducing her to Madame Liang, the sister-in-law of Master Wang. Liang and Wang bemoan the gap between immigrants and their offspring ("The Other Generation") as Master Wang's younger son, Wang San gives his own take on the gap to some younger children. However, dissolving the marriage contract is harder than either of them imagine. Master Wang is persuaded by Madame Liang to allow Mei Li to fall in love naturally with Master Wang's eldest son, Wang Ta, and the Lis move in with Master Wang. But Wang Ta is dazzled by the charms of Linda, who flirts with him ([[I Enjoy Being a Girl (song)|"I Enjoy Being a Girl"]]). He asks her to go on a date, and she convinces him to give her his fraternity pin to symbolize they are [[Courtship|"going steady"]] during the date.

When Mei Li sees Wang Ta sneaking back in after the date, she mistakes his friendly greeting as a welcome to the household and starts to warm to America ("I Am Going to Like It Here"). Linda plans to use Wang Ta to force a real commitment from Sammy Fong out of jealousy, but Sammy gets wind of her scheme when Linda attends a party to celebrate both Wang Ta's graduation from university and Madame Liang's graduation from citizenship classes. Madame Liang compares the citizens of America to a mix of different ingredients ("Chop Suey"). At the party, Linda has Frankie Wing, the club emcee, pose as her brother to grant permission for Linda to marry Wang Ta. Mei Li, hearing this, becomes discouraged, while Ta and his father argue over his marriage plans. Ta argues that he is old enough to make his own decisions, but the father says that he will be the one to let Ta know when he is old enough.

[[File:San Francisco, CA Chinatown in 1945 (2729060072).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Grant Avenue]], [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]]'s "western street with eastern manners" (1945)]]
At the New Year's Parade, Linda rides on a float and sings about [[Grant Avenue]], Chinatown's "western street with eastern manners" ("Grant Avenue"). Sammy, in an effort to keep Linda from marrying Wang Ta, invites Wang Ta and his family to Celestial Gardens, where they see Frankie Wing recall girls he has known ("Gliding Through My Memoree") and Linda's nightclub act ("Fan Tan Fanny"). Wang Ta is shocked at her performance. He leaves, distraught, accompanied by his friend since childhood, the seamstress Helen Chao. Chao also grew up in America and deeply loves Wang Ta. Ta becomes drunk in his misery over Linda, and Helen ends up letting him stay for the night in her apartment, where she declares her unrequited love ("Love, Look Away").

In the morning, Mei Li comes to deliver a burned coat for Helen to mend, and becomes distressed when she discovers Wang Ta's clothing in Helen's kitchen. When Wang Ta wakes up (seconds after Mei Li leaves), he still does not notice Helen's affections, even as she pleads for him to stay, and he leaves quickly. He goes to speak with Mei Li, now realizing that she is a better match for him than Linda Low ("You Are Beautiful"), only to have Mei Li reject him, saying that she once loved him, but not anymore.

She and her father leave Master Wang's house and pursue the marriage contract between Mei Li and Sammy Fong. Sammy has already proposed to Linda, who daydreams about wedded life ("Sunday"). Unfortunately, now that Mei Li is pursuing Sammy again, he and Linda will be unable to marry as the contract with Mei Li is binding. Sammy enumerates his many faults ("Don't Marry Me") in a last-ditch attempt to convince Mei Li to break the contract. Before the wedding, Wang Ta goes to see Mei Li, and they both realize that they are deeply in love with one another. They agree to try to come up with a way to get Mei Li out of her marriage contract.

The day of the wedding, right before she is to sip from a goblet (which would seal her marriage to Sammy), Mei Li declares that, because she entered the United States illegally, the contract is null and void. Wang Ta can thus marry Mei Li, and Sammy decides to marry Linda right there as well, resulting in a double wedding.

==Music==
Although the [[Film score|score]] of ''Flower Drum Song'' did not produce many hit tunes, the song "I Enjoy Being a Girl" has been recorded by such performers as [[Doris Day]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Pat Suzuki]], and [[Phranc]], and it has been used in other movies and shows. Parodies of the song including a U.S. [[Gap (clothing)|Gap company]] commercial with [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]. There are over a dozen versions of the song on [[YouTube]], including parodies based on [[Harry Potter]] and ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''.

Compared to the musical on which it is based, the film rearranged the order of the songs.&lt;ref name=Deaville-17 /&gt; According to David Henry Hwang, the song "Like a God" was dropped from the film because studio executives were worried it could "offend audiences in the American South".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Flower-Drum-Song-set-to-different-beats-2635598.php |title='Flower Drum Song' set to different beats |author=Hurwit, Robert |date=9 February 2003 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Newman, the conductor and music supervisor, wrote a letter to producer Ross Hunter protesting the excision of music arrangers from the credits during post-production; Hunter agreed to reinsert a credit for Ken Darby, the associate music supervisor.&lt;ref name=AFI-catalog23063 /&gt;

==Production==
After the novel was released and became a bestseller, options were offered to author [[C. Y. Lee (author)|C.Y. Lee]] to produce a movie or stage adaptation. Lee was torn between the movie offer, which was more lucrative at $50,000, but would force him to give up all rights, or the stage offer from [[Joseph Fields]], which only gave him $3,000 but only relinquished stage rights. After getting drunk the night of the decision, Lee could not remember the offer he chose, but his agent congratulated him on making the right choice the next morning. It turns out Lee had chosen the offer from Fields, who initially wanted to produce a play and eventually a movie, but after Fields mentioned the novel to Rodgers and Hammerstein, they signed on to write the musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nwitimes.com/entertainment/the-flower-drum-song-where-the-chinese-american-novel-began/article_5e2df089-063e-561d-84ee-9d77f9fa8ee0.html |title='The Flower Drum Song': Where the Chinese-American novel began |author=Kuchwara, Michael |agency=AP |date=1 December 2002 |newspaper=The Times of Northwest Indiana |access-date=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1961 film production of ''Flower Drum Song'' was produced by [[Universal Studios]], a break for Rodgers and Hammerstein, who had previously had their films produced by [[Twentieth Century Fox]]. The screenplay was written by Joseph Fields, who had previously collaborated with Hammerstein on the libretto for the musical, but had not previously written a major musical film; likewise, the director Henry Koster and producer Ross Hunter were working on their first musical film.&lt;ref name=Deaville-17 /&gt;

San Francisco watercolorist [[Dong Kingman]] painted the opening title sequence, which traces the journey of Mei Li from Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=LIFE-1961-11-24 /&gt; [[Hermes Pan (choreographer)|Hermes Pan]] provided the choreography.&lt;ref name=LAT-2002-01-25 /&gt;

Principal photography began on March 20, 1961; the film was largely shot at Stage 12 of the [[Universal Studios Lot]], on a {{convert|51300|ft2|abbr=on}} set built to reproduce Chinatown, including the opening scenes at [[Saint Mary's Square (San Francisco)|Saint Mary's Square]] (complete with a replica of the stainless steel statute of [[Sun Yat-Sen]] sculpted by [[Beniamino Bufano]]), at a cost of $310,000.&lt;ref name=AFI-catalog23063 /&gt;

Among various changes for the film, the song "Like a God" was changed from a song into a [[beat generation|beat]] poetry presentation. The film (and earlier stage version) is lighter-hearted than the novel upon which it is based. Most notably, while Helen is simply left alone and broken-hearted in the musical and film versions, Ta's rejection of her prompts her to commit suicide in the novel. In the novel, Mei Li does not arrive in Chinatown illegally, nor does she have an arranged marriage with Sammy Fong (whose character was created for the musical and film).&lt;ref name=Deaville-17&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.3998/mpub.5555199 |title=China and the West: Music, Representation, and Reception |author=Deaville, James |pages=119–136 |chapter=The Many Lives of Flower Drum Song (1957–2002): Negotiating Chinese American Identity in Print, on Stage, and on Screen |editor1=Yang, Hon-Lun |editor2=Saffle, Michael |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |isbn=978-0-472-90075-6 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming locations===
Although set in San Francisco, only a few scenes were actually filmed on location,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTJnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104 |title=Hollywood in San Francisco: Location shooting and the asethetics of urban decline |author=Gleich, Joshua |page=104 |date=2018 |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-1-4773-1757-0 |accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably a scene with Kwan and Shigeta on [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]]. But neither Kwan nor Shigeta actually filmed at this location. Doubles stood in for them for the long shots of the car arriving and leaving Twin Peaks. The close-ups of Kwan and Shigeta in the car were process shots filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood with the view from Twin Peaks projected on a screen behind them.

The film includes scenes from the 1961 [[San Francisco Chinese New Year Festival and Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=OL19610302.2.24 |title=Gung Hay Fat Choy ... happy year of the ox to you |author= |date=2 March 1961 |newspaper=Oak Leaf |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=snb19610629-01.1.3 |title=Show Biz Buzz |author=Taeko |date=29 June 1961 |newspaper=Shin Nichibei |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Flower Drum Song'' premiered in New York City at [[Radio City Music Hall]] on November 9, 1961.&lt;ref name=NYT-611110 /&gt; The initial plan was to have the premiere on November 17 in San Francisco, at the [[Golden Gate Theatre]], to benefit local hospitals, including the [[San Francisco Chinese Hospital]]. The Golden Gate Theatre premiere would be followed by a three-day Flower Drum Festival in Chinatown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=snb19611020-01.1.2 |title=Show Biz Buzz |author=Taeko |date=20 October 1961 |newspaper=Shin Nichibei |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A private screening was held for President [[John F.

Although it has been asserted the film was the only Hollywood adaptation of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to lose money,{{sfn|Lewis, ''Flower Drum Songs''|p=109}} the production rights were reported as costing $1&amp;nbsp;million and the budget was $4&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=AFI-catalog23063&gt;{{cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/23063 |title=Flower Drum Song (1961) |publisher=American Film Institute |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while gross revenues have been reported as $10.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Flower-Drum-Song#tab=box-office |title=Flower Drum Song (1961) |website=The-Numbers |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
The film was first issued on [[VHS]] in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vhscollector.com/movie/flower-drum-song |title=Flower Drum Song |website=VHS Collector |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-08-01/entertainment/8602250499_1_mister-rogers-neighborhood-mca-home-video-stars |title=Children Can Get Video Lessons From Mister Rogers, Mr. Wizard |author=Stevens, Mary |date=1 August 1986 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; then reissued in 1991 followed by a [[LaserDisc]] version in 1992 by [[MCA Home Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/04055/40198/Flower-Drum-Song |title=Flower Drum Song (''1961'') |website=LaserDisc Database |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LaserDisc and VHS versions of the film were cropped to a 1.33:1 ratio using [[pan and scan]] with the exception of the "I Enjoy Being a Girl" sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1992/02/27/new-on-video/954b076d-d915-4930-a273-1e7ec7f8b72a/ |title=New on Video |date=27 February 1992 |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/article/1992/03/27/flower-drum-song-3/ |title=Flower Drum Song |date=27 March 1992 |author=Daly, Steve |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the VHS and LaserDisc versions went out of print, the film was unavailable on home media for many years, while most of the other video versions of Rodgers and Hammerstein movies were released on [[DVD]] by other studios.

At present, [[MGM]] (via its acquisition of [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]]) owns the theatrical and television rights to this movie, as well as other certain Rodgers and Hammerstein productions, while the original distributor Universal owns only the home video rights. (Universal also holds the copyright to this movie.)

[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] (in association with the estates of Rodgers and Hammerstein) finally released a DVD version on November 7, 2006, with extra features on the making and casting of the movie. It includes interviews with David Henry Hwang, Pat Suzuki, and Nancy Kwan, and pictures from the 1958 and 2002 Broadway rehearsals and practice sessions, as well as pictures of Rodgers, Hammerstein, and Fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDreviews26/flower_drum_song.htm |title=DVD Review: Flower Drum Song |date= |website=DVD Beaver |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing for ''The New York Times'' after the premiere, [[Bosley Crowther]] called the film neither "subtle or fragile ... It is gaudy and gaggy and quite melodic."&lt;ref name=NYT-611110&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/11/10/archives/screen-flower-drum-song-opensmovie-drawn-from-a-musical-arrives.html |title=Screen: 'Flower Drum Song' Opens: Movie Drawn From a Musical Arrives; Music Hall Offering New Film in Color |author=Crowther, Bosley |date=10 November 1961 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] called it "gay, tuneful and well worth the admission".&lt;ref name=LIFE-1961-11-24&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA27 |title=Life Guide |date=24 November 1961 |magazine=LIFE |volume=51 |issue=21 |page=27 |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Variety'' thought that "much of the fundamental charm, grace and novelty of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's "Flower Drum Song" has been overwhelmed by the sheer opulence and glamour [of the film]".&lt;ref name=Variety-1960&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/1960/film/reviews/flower-drum-song-1200419967/ |title=Flower Drum Song |date=31 December 1960 |work=Variety |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotebox |float=right |width=25em |text=As a boomer Asian American, you didn't often see people that looked like you on TV. And the idea that the younger generation, at least, was portrayed as American [in the movie] was unusual. So growing up, the musical represented one of the few positive portrayals of people that looked like me. And then, at another point in my life, it became something to be demonized. |author=&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;David Henry Hwang |source=2001 ''Los Angeles Times'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/16/entertainment/ca-46207 |title=Let the Debate Begin |author=Phillips, Michael |date=16 September 2001 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Lewis calls it "a bizarre pastiche of limping mediocracy". He comments that since the 1958 version of the musical was only rarely revived for decades after its initial run, the film "would in future years come to stand for the stage musical it so crassly misrepresented"{{sfn|Lewis, ''Flower Drum Songs''|p=108}} and would serve as the version that academics and latter-day theatre critics would judge when they analyzed the musical. James Deaville countered that Koster and Hunter "wanted to make the musical more relevant and accessible ... [by] intensify[ing] the generational conflict ... [and] required spelling out much that the musical left to the audience's imagination."&lt;ref name=Deaville-17 /&gt;

Asian-Americans often found the film offensive in later years due to common tropes and what was seen as miscasting Japanese American actors Shigeta and Umeki in Chinese American roles.&lt;ref name=LAT-2002-01-25 /&gt; [[David Henry Hwang]], who revised the musical for a 2001 revival, "had a secret soft spot for the movie version. 'It was kind of a guilty pleasure ... and one of the only big Hollywood films where you could see a lot of really good Asian actors onscreen, singing and dancing and cracking jokes.'"&lt;ref name=Berson&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Berson |first=Misha |url=http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/2002/drum.cfm |title=A 'Drum' with a Difference |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000643/http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/2002/drum.cfm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |magazine=American Theatre |publisher=[[Theatre Communications Group]] |date=2002 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Joanna Lee (writer)|Joanna Lee]] praised the film's portrayal of Asian Americans as "prominent and legitimate American citizens".&lt;ref name=Deaville-17 /&gt;{{sfn|Lewis, ''Flower Drum Songs''|p=111}}

Gray Area hosts exhibitions and music events, software and electronics classes, a media lab and resident-artist program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Heather Knight, Chronicle Staff Writer | title=Arts district to transform lower Taylor Street | url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-02-21/news/17189827_1_arts-district-large-arts-institutions-arts-gallery  | accessdate=8 February 2011 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=21 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray Area Foundation for the Arts’ stated purpose is to bring “together the best creative coders, data artists, designers, and makers to create experiments that build social consciousness through digital cultur''e.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Gray Area | title=Mission | url=http://grayarea.org/about/mission/ | year=2012 | accessdate=31 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Founded in 2006 by its Executive Director Josette Melchor and Board Chairman Peter Hirshberg, Gray Area joins similarly focused institutions, like [[Eyebeam Art and Technology Center]] and [[Ars Electronica]], in promoting the intersections of art, technology and community by working to produce, exhibit, and develop the creative technical skills that allow for experimentation with and exploration of the most contemporary technologies.

==History==
Following a conversation in 2006 about the lack of proper venues for the exhibition of new media and technology based art work, Melchor and Hirshberg initially opened ''Gray Area Gallery'' in San Francisco's [[South of Market, San Francisco|South of Market (SoMa)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=forward/slash: The Gray Area Foundation for the Arts Story | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ulwcLVzT7w | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mid-Market Street Monitor | title=Examiner on Mid-Market Street revival | url=http://www.midmarketstreet.com/2009/07/examiner-on-mid-market-street-revival.html | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the gallery incorporated as a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] and was renamed ''Gray Area Foundation for The Arts''. In June 2009, Gray Area relocated to its present facility near the end of Taylor Street . In total, the {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} location had included in addition to the pornography arcade, a bar (Club 65) and liquor store. Leased from property owner Jack Sumski, the space allowed Gray Area to expand its well-established exhibition platform to include artist residencies, educational workshops and symposiums, growing Gray Area into the comprehensive and integrated center for the creation and promotion of technology-based art it is today.

When the Art Theatres [[Adult video arcade|pornography arcade]] that had been there since the 1970s moved out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=San Francisco Chronicle | title=An art gallery blossoms on seedy Taylor Street | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/cityinsider/detail?entry_id=48594  | accessdate=6 January 2011 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=SF Weekly | title=Arts groups create new music opportunities in the Tenderloin | url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2009-03-18/music/arts-groups-create-new-music-opportunities-in-the-tenderloin/ | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sumski decided that "it was time to do something in my old age, to get something going, and give the Tenderloin a future" and invested heavily to prepare the site for Gray Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=San Francisco Business Times | title=Mid-Market arts district may finally premiere | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2009/05/25/story16.html | accessdate=6 January 2011 | date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mid-Market Street Monitor | title=Examiner on Mid-Market Street revival | url=http://www.midmarketstreet.com/2009/07/examiner-on-mid-market-street-revival.html | year=2009 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray Area Foundation for The Arts is part of a coalition of city agencies, arts organizations and community service providers seeking to revitalize a neighborhood that has historically struggled with the effects of substance abuse, addiction and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=SF Gov: Office of the Mayor | title=Mayor Newsom Announces San Francisco Arts Commission Awarded $250,000 Grant... | url=http://sfmayor.org/press-room/press-releases/press-release-mayor-newsom-announces-san-francisco-arts-commission-awarded-250000-grant-from-the-national-endowment-for-the-arts-for-mid-market-revitalization/ | year=2010 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=SF Examiner | title=Steve Falk: Mid-Market Street’s best new hope can happen | url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/opinion/steve-falk-mid-market-street-s-best-new-hope-can-happen | year=2010 | accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilcox.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] (1863–1935)]]

An '''illustration''' is a decoration, interpretation or visual explanation of a text, concept or process,&lt;ref&gt;cf. the freely available international [http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi Database of Scientific Illustrators 1450-1950] with 20 search fields and nearly 7000 entries of illustrators in science, medicine &amp; technology active prior to 1950&lt;/ref&gt; designed for integration in published media, such as posters, flyers, magazines, books, teaching materials, animations, video games and films.

The origin of the word “illustration” is late Middle English (in the sense ‘illumination; spiritual or intellectual enlightenment’): via Old French from Latin ''illustratio(n- )'', from the verb ''illustrate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/illustration|title=Oxford Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 02.png|thumb|right|The [[White Rabbit]] from [[Alice in Wonderland]], illustrated by [[John Tenniel]] (1820–1914) ]]

Contemporary illustration uses a wide range of styles and techniques, including [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[collage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[digital design]], [[multimedia]], [[3D modelling]]. Most illustrators work on a freelance basis. 

Depending on the purpose, illustration may be expressive, stylised, realistic or highly technical.

[[Technical illustration|Technical]] and [[scientific illustration]] communicates information of a technical or scientific nature. This may include [[Exploded-view drawing|exploded view]]s, [[Cutaway drawing|cutaways]], fly-throughs, reconstructions, instructional images, component designs, [[diagrams]]. The aim is "to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer"&lt;ref name="ViGr05"&gt;Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gröller (2005). "[http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2005/Viola-05-Smart/Viola-05-Smart-Paper.pdf Smart Visibility in Visualization]". In: ''Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging''. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical and scientific illustration is generally designed to describe or explain subjects to a nontechnical audience, so must provide "an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer's interest and understanding".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm Industriegrafik.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814125052/http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm |date=2009-08-14 }} website, Last modified: June 15, 2002. Accessed february 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary illustration practice, 2D and 3D software is often used to create accurate representations that can be updated easily, and reused in a variety of contexts.

== Illustration as fine art ==
[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' by [[William Blake]] (1786) ]]

In the art world, illustration has at times been considered of less importance than [[graphic design]] and fine art.

Today, however, due in part to the growth of [[graphic novel]] and [[video game]] industries, as well as increased use of illustration in magazines and other publications, illustration is now becoming a valued art form, capable of engaging a global market.

Original illustration art has been known to attract high prices at auction. The US artist [[Norman Rockwell]]'s painting "Breaking Home Ties" sold in a 2006 [[Sotheby's]] auction for USD15.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/media/norman-rockwell-art-rises-in-value-and-his-museum-gets-priced-o/19366251/ Norman Rockwell's Rising Value Prices Out His Museum] Zac Bissonnette, AOL Daily Finance, 2-22-10&lt;/ref&gt; Many other illustration genres are equally valued, with pinup artists such as [[Gil Elvgren]] and [[Alberto Vargas]], for example, also attracting high prices.

Historically, the art of illustration is closely linked to the industrial processes of [[printing]] and [[publishing]].

=== Early history ===

The illustrations of medieval [[codices]] were known as [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations]], and were individually hand drawn and painted. With the invention of the [[printing press]] during the 15th century, [[books]] became more widely distributed, often illustrated with [[woodcuts]].

1600s Japan saw the origination of [[Ukiyo-e]], an influential illustration style characterised by expressive line, vivid colour and subtle tones, resulting from the ink-brushed [[woodblock printing in Japan|wood block printing]] technique. Subjects included traditional folk tales, popular figures and every day life. [[Hokusai]]’s ''The Great Wave of Kanazawa'' is a famous image of the time.

During the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, the main reproduction processes for illustration were [[engraving]] and [[etching]]. In 18th Century England, a notable illustrator was [[William Blake]] (1757–827), who used [[relief etching]]. By the early 19th century, the introduction of [[lithography]] substantially improved reproduction quality.

=== 19th Century ===

In Europe, notable figures of the early 19th Century were [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Dickens]] illustrator [[Hablot Knight Browne]], and, in France, [[Honoré Daumier]]. All contributed to both satirical and “serious” publications. At this time, there was a great demand for [[caricature]] drawings encapsulating social mores, types and classes.

The British humorous magazine [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank's [[Comic Almanac]] (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir [[John Tenniel]], the [[Dalziel Brothers]], and [[George du Maurier|Georges du Maurier]]. Although all fine art trained, their reputations were gained primarily as illustrators.

Historically, Punch was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s. The magazine was the first to use the term "[[cartoon]]" to describe a humorous illustration and its widespread use led to [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] being known as the world's first "[[cartoonist]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Punch Magazine Changed Everything|url=http://illustrationchronicles.com/How-Punch-Magazine-Changed-Everything|website=Illustration Chronicles|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In common with similar magazines such as the Parisian [[Le Voleur]], Punch realised good illustration sold as well as good text. With publication continuing into the 21st Century, Punch chronicles a gradual shift in popular illustration, from reliance on caricature to sophisticated topical observation.

=== The "Golden Age" ===

From the early 1800s [[newspaper]]s, mass market [[magazine]]s, and illustrated books had become the dominant consumer media in Europe and the New World. By the 19th century, improvements in printing technology freed illustrators to experiment with color and rendering techniques. These developments in printing effected all areas of literature from cookbooks, photography and traveling guides, as well as children's books. Also, due to advances in printing, it became more affordable to produce color photographs within books and other materials. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Books: A Living History|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2011|isbn=9780500291153|location=London|pages=193-196}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, almost 100 percent of paper was machine-made, and while a person working by hand could produce 60-100lbs of paper per day, mechanization yielded around 1,000lbs per day.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Broadview Anthology of Victorian Prose: 1832- 1901|last=Leighton|first=Mary Elizabeth|last2=Surridge|first2=Lisa|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Peterborough, ON|pages=14|chapter=Victorian Print Media and the Reading Public}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the 50 year period between 1846 and 1916, book production increased 400% and the price of books was cut in half.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[America]], this led to a "golden age of illustration" from before the 1880s until the early 20th century. A small group of illustrators became highly successful, with the imagery they created considered a portrait of American aspirations of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafoxsociety.com/what-was-the-golden-age-of-illustration/ The R. Atkinson Fox Society: What Was the Golden Age of Illustration?]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best known illustrators of that period were [[N. C. Wyeth|N.C. Wyeth]] and [[Howard Pyle]] of the [[Brandywine School]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], and [[James Montgomery Flagg]].

Membership in the John Ford Stock Company did not necessitate membership in Ford's social circle, and indeed many of the actors in the Stock Company never encountered Ford outside of work situations.&lt;ref&gt;''Pappy:  The Life of John Ford'', by Dan Ford&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and interpretation==
Suzanne Valadon's ''Joy of Life'' depicts a landscape with four [[Nude (art)|nude]] and seminude women who are watched by a nude man.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVOPnrEcKKsC&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=%22charlotte%20du%20val%20d'ognes%22&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charlotte%20du%20val%20d'ognes%22&amp;f=false|title=Concise Dictionary of Women Artists|last=Perry|first=Gill|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|editor-last=Gaze|editor-first=Delia|location=New York|pages=669|chapter=Valadon, Suzanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nude male was modeled by Valadon's lover, [[André Utter]].&lt;ref name=Faxon&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vxXAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;ots=cYBO5--VEQ&amp;dq=%22La%20Joie%20de%20vivre%22%20valadon&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22La%20Joie%20de%20vivre%22%20valadon&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Artist's Models|last=Faxon|first=Alicia Craig|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=2001|editor-last=Jiminez|editor-first=Jill Berk|location=London|pages=529-531|chapter=Utter, Andre}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met through her son, [[Maurice Utrillo]], and Utter modeled nude for several of Valadon's paintings, including ''Adam and Eve'' (1909) and ''Casting the Net'' (1914).&lt;ref name=Faxon/&gt;
 
''Joy of Life'' is based on the theme of "women as nature," a typical subject at the time.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Gill Perry]] has argued that the painting reworks the theme of bathers in [[nature]].&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt; She notes that the women "seem strangely separate from each other, the male viewer and from the nature that surrounds them," which suggests a "more ambiguous, dislocated relationship with both nature and the male spectator."&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt; Perry's reading is echoed by Patricia Mathews, who has described the figures as being ''in'' nature, but not ''equivalent'' to nature.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She suggests that the male viewer "has no other role in the painting except as this near-caricature of the dominating [[male gaze]]," as the women are unaware of being watched.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUe_iyI2EfUC&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=%22joy%20of%20life%22%20valadon&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joy%20of%20life%22%20valadon&amp;f=false|title=Passionate Discontent: Creativity, Gender, and French Symbolist Art|last=Mathews|first=Patricia Townley|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|location=Chicago|pages=199-202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosemary Betterton]] has argued that the figures disrupt the male gaze and are, in fact, being caught in a moment without being [[Sexualization|sexualized]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; According to Mathews, the painting does not offer the "coherent narrative that so clearly dominated [[Masculism|masculinist]] images."&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; Valadon's ''Joy of Life'', Mathews has noted, is consistent with the ways in which "various narratives intersect in her work in often uncomfortable ways to dislodge and destabilize conventional gendered interpretations."&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; In ''Casting the Net'', completed three years later, Valadon actually reversed the traditional active male/passive female concept by casting the nude male in the role of object.&lt;ref name=Diamand&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamand-Rosinsky|first=Thérèse|title=Suzanne Valadon|chapter=Les multiples de Suzanne Valadon: Marie-Clémentine, «Biqui», ou «Terrible Maria»?|editor-last=Marchesseau|editor-first=Daniel|location=Martigny, Switzerland|publisher=Fondation Pierre Gianadda|date=1996|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Jarcho grew up in New York City, where she attended [[Hunter College High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/23/movies/theater-review-works-by-playwrights-too-young-to-drink.html|title=THEATER REVIEW; Works by Playwrights Too Young to Drink|first=Bruce|last=Weber|date=23 November 2001|publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/2/7/soundbites-of-a-generation-in-between/|title=Soundbites of a Generation|publisher=FM: The Harvard Crimson Magazine|first=M.

==Career==
Jarcho began her career in experimental theater as a performer, acting in plays by [[Richard Maxwell (director)|Richard Maxwell]] in Downtown New York theaters such as the [[Incubator Arts Project#Ontological Theater (1992-2005)|Ontological Theater]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/theater/farewell-to-the-second-floor-theater-at-st-marks-church.html|title=Farewell to the Second-Floor Theater at St. Mark’s Church|first=Alexis|last=Soloski|date=19 June 2014|publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soho Rep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/06/theater/theater-review-drone-on-the-range-adventures-in-the-mild-mild-west.html|title=Drone on the Range: Adventures in the Mild, Mild West|date=6 April 1999|work=The New York Times|first=Peter|last=Marks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
Nursery, written when she was a senior at Hunter College High School, was a winner of the Young Playwrights Festival National Playwriting Competition and was performed at the Cherry Lane Theater in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/23/movies/theater-review-works-by-playwrights-too-young-to-drink.html|title=Works by Playwrights Too Young to Drink|date=23 November 2001|work=The New York Times|first=Bruce|last=Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her adaptation of [[Alfred Noyes]]’ poem, ''[[The Highwayman (poem)|The Highwayman]]'' was presented at the [[National Theater of the United States of America|NTUSA]] performance space in Brooklyn in December 2004 and published in ''The Best American Short Plays 2005-2006''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/223807521|title=The Best American Short Plays 2005-2006|first1=Barbara|last1=Parisi|first2=David|last2=Ives|first3=Quiara Alegría|last3=Hudes|first4=Jules|last4=Tasca|first5=Pamela|last5=Sneed|first6=Carol K|last6=Mack|first7=Michael|last7=Roderick|first8=Jeni|last8=Mahoney|first9=Dano|last9=Madden|first10=James|last10=Armstrong|first11=Cary|last11=Pepper|first12=Adam|last12=Kraar|first13=Joan|last13=Lipkin|first14=Cara|last14=Restaino|first15=Julia|last15=Jarcho|first16=Murray|last16=Schisgal|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Delmar'' was staged at the Prenzlkasper theater in Berlin, Germany, in October 2005. Jarcho later collaborated with visual artist, Meredith James, who adapted the play as a video installation at the Jack Hanley Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meredith-james.com/work/delmar/1 |title=Work : Delmar |publisher=Meredith James |date= |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the playwrights' collective, 13P, Jarcho's ''American Treasure'' was staged at Paradise Factory Theatre in November 2009. ''The New York Times'' called the play, "an odd, dense, oblique but haunting work" and noted that Jarcho is "a remarkably clever, bewitching writer and a master of stylized behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/theater/reviews/09american.html|title=Historical Whodunit by Julia Jarcho at Paradise Factory|first=Anita|last=Gates|date=8 December 2009|publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grimly Handsome'' premiered at the Incubator Arts Project in January 2013 as part of the Other Forces Festival and won the Obie for Best New American Play that year. In January 2015 it was remounted at JACK in Brooklyn.

Other productions by Jarcho include: ''Dreamless Land'' which premiered with [[New York City Players]] at the [[Abrons Arts Center]] in November 2011; ''Nomads'', directed by [[Alice Reagan]], was the final play performed at the Incubator Arts Project in June 2014; ''Every Angel is Brutal'', directed by Knud Adams, was part of [[Clubbed Thumb]]'s Summerworks 2016 lineup and staged at the Wild Project.

Her most recent play, ''The Terrifying'', premiered at the Abrons Arts Center in March 2017.

The playwright [[Mac Wellman]] described Jarcho’s work as a writer and director as “[[Menippean satire]]...dealing with the whole analysis of what theater is.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323485704578255950313410458|title=Every Golden Age Needs a Sage|first=Lizzie|last=Simon|date=21 January 2013|work=WSJ}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playwrightslocal4181.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Every-Golden-Age-Needs-a-Sage-WSJ-2013.pdf|title=Every Golden Age Needs a Sage|first=Lizzie|last=Simon|date=21 January 2013|work=WSJ|via=playwrightslocal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Killing Jesus: A History''''' is a 2013 book by [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Martin Dugard (author)|Martin Dugard]] about the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life]] and [[crucifixion of Jesus]], referred to in the book as [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. It is the follow-up to ''[[Killing Kennedy]]'' and ''[[Killing Lincoln]]''. ''Killing Jesus'' was released September 24, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/killing-jesus-bill-oreilly/1114668114?ean=9780805098549 |title=Killing Jesus: A History |author=Bill O'Reilly |isbn=9780805098549|publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Henry Holt and Company]]. The book was a commercial success, debuting at #1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times Non-Fiction Best Sellers of 2013|bestseller list]] and remaining on the list for 52 weeks. Popular reviews of the book were mixed, with both Christian and non-Christian reviewers faulting the book for its tedious writing and its claims of historical objectivity. Scholars and historians have extensively criticized the book for its inaccurate, politically-motivated portrayal of Jesus as a "[[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] Son of God", its uncritical approach to [[primary source]]s, its omission of some of Jesus' teachings, and its oversimplified, sensationalist portrayal of history. Like both its predecessors, the book was adapted into a [[Killing Jesus (miniseries)|television miniseries with the same name]] for [[National Geographic Channel]].

==Writing and research==
According to ''[[The Washington Times]]'', while writing ''Killing Jesus'', O'Reilly and Dugard found that sources were far less plentiful than for the previous books in their ''Killing...'' series.&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vernon |first1=Wes |title=BOOK REVIEW: 'Killing Jesus' |url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/25/book-review-killing-jesus/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=The Washington Times |publisher=The Washington Times, LLC |date=25 September 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that the Internet was "a treasure",&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; but complained that the information on various websites was "contradictory",&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; that "hearsay was often quoted as truth",&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; and that information from one website was frequently shown to be unreliable when checked against information from more reliable sources.&lt;ref name="Vernon2013"/&gt; Bill O'Reilly stated that he believes the book was [[divine inspiration|inspired]] by the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book begins with "A Note to Readers" by Bill O'Reilly, which promises, "...this is not a religious book. We do not address Jesus the Messiah, only as a man who galvanized a remote area of the Roman Empire and made very powerful enemies while preaching a philosophy of peace and love." After a lengthy quotation from the conservative journalist [[Vermont C. Royster]], the introduction concludes: "But the incredible story behind the lethal struggle between good and evil has not been fully told. Until now." The first chapter begins with a [[novel]]istic description of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] from {{bibleverse|Matthew|2:16–2:18|9}}. The remaining portion of the chapter focusses on [[Herod the Great]], the king of Judaea, the politics of his reign, the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], and the birth of Jesus. A lengthy footnote at the end of the chapter defends the historical accuracy of the [[canonical gospels]] and their traditional attributions to [[Matthew the Apostle]], [[John Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist]], and [[John the Apostle]].

The second chapter describes the life of the Roman general and dictator [[Julius Caesar]], his conquests, his seduction by the Egyptian [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic queen]] [[Cleopatra]], and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his eventual assassination]]. Chapter Three summarizes the aftermath of Caesar's murder, the [[Battle of Philippi]], the [[Second Triumvirate]], the [[Octavian]]'s defeat of [[Mark Antony]] and Cleopatra in the [[Battle of Actium]], and Octavian's ascension to the title of ''[[Roman emperor|emperor]]''. The fourth chapter returns to the life of Jesus, describing his worried parents looking for him after he has gone missing during a trip to [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]]. It describes some of the politics of [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judaea]], heavily emphasizing the idea that the Jews were victims of Roman totalitarian oppression. Chapter Five describes the [[finding in the Temple]] from {{bibleverse|Luke|2:41-52|9}}, the architecture of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], [[Nazareth]], and the government and political background of [[Galilee]].

[[File:Detail of three disciples on the far left side of the table in Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Detail of three disciples on the far left side of the table in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', who are shown in a [[black and white]] photograph on page 219 of ''Killing Jesus'']]

Chapter Six describes the preaching of [[John the Baptist]], the arrival of [[Pontius Pilate]] in Judaea, the [[baptism of Jesus]], and John the Baptist's arrest. Chapter Seven describes the alleged debaucheries of the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] at [[Capri]], described by the Roman historian [[Seutonius]], accepting all of them as historical. Chapter Eight narrates the [[Cleansing of the Temple]] from {{bibleverse|John|2:13-16|9}}, Jesus's meeting with [[Nicodemus]] from {{bibleverse|John|3:1–21|9}}, and the beginning of his ministry. Chapter Nine details the calling of the apostles, the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the [[anointing of Jesus]] from {{bibleverse||Luke|7:36-50|9}}. Following [[Sacred tradition|Catholic tradition]] rather than the gospels, the authors identify the unnamed "sinful woman" in this passage as [[Mary Magdalene]]. The chapter concludes with the [[Beheading of St John the Baptist|beheading of John the Baptist]]. Chapter Ten entails Jesus's conflicts with the [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]] and concludes with a characterization of [[Judas Iscariot]].

Chapter Eleven describes Pontius Pilate's governance of Judaea and Chapter Twelve [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|Jesus's entry to Jerusalem]]. In Chapter Thirteen, Jesus cleanses the Temple again and [[Cursing the fig tree|curses the fig tree]]. In Chapter Fourteen, he [[Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary|goes to the house of Mary and Martha]], proclaims the [[Golden Rule]], tells the Pharisees to "[[Render unto Caesar]]", weeps over Jerusalem, and predicts his own death. Chapter Fifteen has the betrayal of Judas and Chapter Sixteen has the [[Last Supper]], the [[Agony in the Garden]], and the [[arrest of Jesus]]. Chapters Seventeen through Nineteen describe Jesus's [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], and [[Burial of Jesus|burial]]. Chapter Twenty-One has the account of the [[women at the tomb]]. The "Afterward" describes [[Sources for the historicity of Jesus#Non-Christian sources|non-Christian mentions of Jesus]], the [[Apostles#Deaths|fates of the Apostles according to Catholic tradition]], as well as what happened to Tiberius, [[Caligula]], [[Caiaphas]], [[Herod Antipas]], Jerusalem, and the [[History of early Christianity|early Christian movement]].

==Publication and sales==
Upon its publication, ''Killing Jesus'' debuted at #1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2013-10-13/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|title=Hardcover : Non-Fiction Best Sellers List|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was on the list for 52 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/|title=Best Sellers List|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Killing Jesus'' surpassed the sales of the book ''[[Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth]]'' by [[Reza Aslan]], a professor of creative writing, which had been published only a few months before.&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt; Of its sales success, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "The most popular titles in the Washington area have a distinctly biblical glow: for the second week in a row, ''Killing Jesus'' by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard is No. 1. This is the third in their spectacularly successful assassination series, following ''Killing Kennedy'' and ''Killing Lincoln''."&lt;ref name="Charles2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Charles |first=Ron |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2013/10/13/an-answer-to-publishers-prayers/ |title=An answer to publishers’ prayers |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=13 October 2013|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the concurrent popularity of other religion-related books, the article concludes, "Publishers have long known that religion sells. Even in Washington."&lt;ref name="Charles2013"/&gt;

==Reception==
===Popular reviews===

In its fall books preview, ''[[USA Today]]'' called it "a suspenseful thriller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/interactive/2764697/ |title=Fall preview: This season's 30 coolest books |website=USA Today |accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of the book by Erik Wemble in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' remarked that ''Killing Jesus'' and its predecessors "may not advance the scholarship on their respective topics, but who'll take issue with millions of Americans getting a quick-read tutorial on history via O’Reilly?"&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wemble |first1=Erik |title=Bill O’Reilly and ‘Killing Jesus’: So it is! |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/11/11/bill-oreilly-and-killing-jesus-so-it-is/?noredirect=on |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=The Washington Post |publisher=Nash Holdings, LLC |date=11 November 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Wemble complained that the book's writing was full of annoying verbal [[tic]]s.&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; In particular, Wemble criticizes O'Reilly's constant countdown of how much time the person he is writing about has left to live&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; and his use of the phrase "so it is..." at the beginnings of sentences.&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; Wemble calls the phrase a "a four-word clump of throat-clearing mumbo-jumbo"&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; and states that another reviewer counted roughly sixteen or so occurrences of it in ''Killing Jesus''.&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt; Wemble speculates that O'Reilly may have intended this phrase as "a retroactive cliché, a little riff that would sound impressive in a book about antiquity."&lt;ref name="Wemble2013"/&gt;

In the book, O'Reilly and Dugard state that they are only including events that can be proven as historical fact,&lt;ref name="Wilensky-Lanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"/&gt; a claim which has drawn criticism from both critics of Christianity and evangelical Christians.&lt;ref name="Wilensky-Lanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"/&gt; A 2013 review by Dan Delzell for ''[[The Christian Post]]'' criticizes this statement for implying that not everything in the gospels can be proven as historical fact.&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Delzell |first1=Dan |date=1 October 2013|title=Bill O'Reilly's 'Killing Jesus' Spiritualizes the Historical Christ |url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/bill-oreillys-killing-jesus-spiritualizes-the-historical-christ-105658/ |website=The Christian Post |publisher=Christian Media Corp. |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the reviewer insists that everything in the gospel accounts is demonstrably factual and that O'Reilly's selective omission of stories found in the gospels from his book is tantamount to "cut[ting] Christ in half."&lt;ref name="Delzell2013"/&gt; A review by Tim Chaffey from [[Answers in Genesis]] criticizes the book for deliberately omitting several of [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus's miracles]] and glossing over others.&lt;ref name="Chaffey"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chaffey |first1=Tim |date=20 November 2013|title=''Killing Jesus: A History'' by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard |url=https://answersingenesis.org/reviews/books/killing-jesus-a-history-by-bill-oreilly-and-martin-dugard/ |website=''answersingenesis.com'' |publisher=Answers in Genesis |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review criticized the book for its "graphic description of sexual activity"&lt;ref name="Chaffey"/&gt; and for portraying [[Mary Magdalene]] as a repentant prostitute, an idea that is not based on the Bible.&lt;ref name="Chaffey"/&gt;

In an article for ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', [[Robert M. Price]], an atheist theologian and self-identified fan of Bill O'Reilly, labels ''Killing Jesus'' a work of complete fiction comparable to ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'',&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Robert M. |date=4 September 2014|title=Bill O’Reilly's "Killing Jesus" is fiction: Fact-checking the Fox News' anchor's "history" of Jesus's death: A conservative theology professor unearths mistruth after mistruth in "Killing Jesus" and calls a pinhead a pinhead|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/09/04/bill_oreillys_killing_jesus_is_fiction_fact_checking_the_fox_news_anchors_history_of_jesuss_death/ |website=Salon  |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states, "There is no sign whatsoever that the authors of "Killing Jesus" have even begun to do their homework here. In the end notes, true, we find a number of book recommendations, but it is revealing that virtually every one of the New Testament and Jesus books mentioned are the work of evangelical/fundametalist spin doctors dedicated to defending the proposition that the gospels are entirely accurate, miracles and all."&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; A 2015 review of both the book and the television miniseries based on it by Brook Wilensky-Lanford in ''The Guardian'' criticizes O'Reilly for accepting Jesus's alleged miracles as potentially historical&lt;ref name="Wilensky-Lanford"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilensky-Lanford |first1=Brook |title=Killing Jesus: Bill O'Reilly's film is touted as history.

[[Candida Moss]], a professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the [[University of Notre Dame]], criticizes the book for its many historical inaccuracies in two articles written in September and October 2013 for ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' and [[CNN]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moss |first1=Candida |title=Five things Bill O'Reilly flubs in ''Killing Jesus'' |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/04/five-things-bill-oreilly-gets-wrong-in-killing-jesus/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=CNN Belief Blog |publisher=Cable News Network |date=4 October 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moss states that, although O'Reilly and Dugard do attempt to separate between fact and fiction, they do so inconsistently and accordingly to their previously held beliefs.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; In her ''Daily Beast'' article, she states: "...without a method, ''Killing Jesus'' has all the critical rigor of your local church's [[Nativity play]]."&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; She notes that O'Reilly and Dugard accept late, unsubstantiated legends about the fates of the apostles after the period covered by the New Testament as historical fact.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; They also uncritically accept the legend formalized in the fifth century by [[Pope Gregory I]] about Mary Magdalene having previously been a prostitute, which is not supported by the New Testament or any early Christian writings,&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; but ignore the statement actually recorded in the gospels that Mary Magdalene was one of the people funding Jesus's ministry.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; They include statements from John the Baptist accusing tax collectors of overcharging people,&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; but omit all reference to Jesus's repeated injunctions to "support the poor, orphans, and widows"&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; as well as to the saying, "whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise" ({{bibleverse|Luke|3:11|9}}).&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

[[File:Rubens tribute money.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[The Tribute Money (Rubens)|The Tribute Money]]'' (1612–1614) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. One of many recurring criticisms of the book is its portrayal of the [[Pharisees]] as what [[Candida Moss]] calls "self-righteous bloviators", a view which is no longer supported by mainstream scholars.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt;]]

In her CNN article, Moss cites the example of how they omit the line "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do", which {{bibleverse||Luke|23:34|9}} attributes to Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|as he was being crucified]], because, as O'Reilly later said in a [[CBS]] interview, it is impossible to speak audibly while a person is being crucified.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She then points out that they chose ''not'' to omit the line "It is finished", also attributed to Jesus while he was on the cross, in {{bibleverse||John|19:30|9}}.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; Moss suggests that perhaps "there [is just] something about the word 'forgiveness' that sticks in [their throats]".&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She also criticizes them for taking everything written by Roman historians like [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] completely at face value, as though these writers were totally unbiased.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She also particularly criticizes O'Reilly and Dugard's portrayal of the Pharisees as "self-righteous bloviators",&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; stating that modern Biblical scholars no longer view them this way,&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; and that this portrayal is, ironically, based more on the stereotype of Roman Catholics promoted by [[Protestants]] during the [[Reformation]] and [[Early Modern Period]] than on actual ancient texts.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;

Moss states that ''Killing Jesus'''s description of the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] converting to "Christianity" is [[Anachronism|anachronistic]]&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; because, at the time, Christianity was still a Jewish sect and the word "Christian" was not even coined until near the end of the first century.&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; Instead, she says "the first generation of Jesus' followers lived and died as Jews."&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; Moss also notes O'Reilly and Dugard's unusual interpretations of various passages,&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; such as {{bibleverse||Luke|3:17|9}}, which O'Reilly and Dugard apparently interpret to mean that [[John the Baptist]] told the Pharisees that they will either "burn ''or'' be condemned to Hell."&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt; She concludes: "Apart from the methodological problems, the entire book is written in the style of a novel, not a history book. We hear the thoughts of Herod as he orders the execution of the male children of Bethlehem, for instance. It's entertaining, but it's historical fan fiction, not history."&lt;ref name="Moss2013"/&gt;

In an article from November 2013, Joel L. Watts, author of ''Mimetic Criticism and the Gospel of Mark'', calls ''Killing Jesus'' nothing more than "an attempt at agenda-driven drivel produced for the lowest common denominator."&lt;ref name="Watts2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Watts |first1=Joel L. |date=25 November 2013|title=Review of Killing Jesus: A History |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/joel-l-watts/review-of-killing-jesus_b_3984134.html |work=HuffPost |accessdate=9 June 2018 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, "I wish I had my day back."&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; In addition to raising many of the same accuracy concerns as Moss, Watts also criticizes the book for imputing post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of [[individualism]] to ancient Galileean Jews&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; and for referring to the [[Sadducees]] (who believed that the [[Torah]] was the only authoritative scripture and opposed the more progressive theology promoted by the Pharisees) as "liberals".&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; He also criticizes a statement that the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]] had been established "500 years" before Jesus, when, in reality, many of the books in the Hebrew Bible were not written until after that point&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; and the canon of the Hebrew Bible was still debated long after Jesus's death.&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; Watts accuses the authors of being arrogant and dismissive of the opinions of actual experts.&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt; He determines that "they destroy context and literary construction to, and I can only assume this based on the evidence of reading the book, hide the actual message of the Gospels."&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt;

[[File:Tea Party - Pennsylvania Avenue.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Numerous scholars have criticized ''Killing Jesus'' for its anachronistic portrayal of Jesus as an advocate of "smaller government and lower taxes" similar to the supporters of the United States [[Tea Party movement]] (''protest pictured''), rather than the first-century Galilean Jew he really was.&lt;ref name="Ehrmanlecture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrman2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watts2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;]]

A December 2013 review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by Selina O'Grady, author of ''And Man Created God: Kings, Cults, and Conquests at the Time of Jesus'', remarks that, "Everyone creates God in their own image, so it's not surprising that [[Fox News|Fox television]]'s aggressively conservative down-home-let's-hear-it-for-the-ordinary-guy talk show host should have created a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] son of God. Jesus, the little guy, is an enemy of the big corrupt tax-oppressing [[Roman empire]], which is itself just a version of [[Washington, D. C.|Washington]], only even more venal and sexually depraved. This Jesus is a tax-liberating rebel who incurs the wrath of the Jewish and Roman powers by threatening their joint fleecing of the people. As a member of the populist right, he is not, of course, in favour of redistribution: Bill O'Reilly's Jesus does not tell the rich to give away their money to the poor."&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Grady|first=Selina|title=Killing Jesus: A History by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard – review: The right-wing talk show host gives us salacious gossip, gory details and a Tea Party Son of God|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/18/killing-jesus-bill-oreilly-review|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review criticizes ''Killing Jesus'' for its "bodice-ripping treatment of history",&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; stating that the book oversimplifies, sensationalizes, and misrepresents the historical events it purports to describe.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; According to O'Grady, ''Killing Jesus'' presents the Romans, Jewish elites, and Pharisees as categorically "bad" and "ordinary Jews" as "good", without any background or nuance.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; O'Grady also criticizes O'Reilly and Dugard for relying almost entirely on the gospels&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and ignoring the centuries' worth of books written by Biblical scholars about the historical Jesus.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

During a Q&amp;A session following a 2014 lecture at [[Dickinson College]] on "Jesus and the Historian", [[Bart D. Ehrman]], James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of [[religious studies]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], laughed at his own mention of ''Killing Jesus'', commenting "Bill O'Reilly!

On its premiere airing, the film was watched by 3.7 million viewers, averaging a 1.0 rating among adults in the 25-54 demographic.

A review by Neil Genzlinger in ''[[The New York Times]]'', however, panned the film,&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Genzlinger |first1=Neil |title=Review: 'Killing Jesus,' Biblical Tale Retold, Softer on Its Politics |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/arts/television/review-killing-jesus-biblical-tale-retold-softer-on-its-politics.html |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=26 March 2015 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring, "It's a costume pageant devoid both of the reverence that has made some previous film versions work and of the intrigue that might provide a secular ''[[Game of Thrones]]''-like appeal. More effort went into the jewelry and headwear than into the storytelling."&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"/&gt; The same review compared the miniseries unfavorably with the book, stating, "The book tried to put Jesus' story in the broader context of the politics and practices of the day, but here the account is largely pared down to the biblical rendition, with Jesus casting out a demon, preventing the stoning of a woman accused of adultery and delivering the touchstone teachings that all Christians know by heart."&lt;ref name="Genzlinger"/&gt;

'''Landscape architecture''' is the design of outdoor areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioural, or aesthetic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, Susan Jellicoe, The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day {{ISBN|9780500274316}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome.  The scope of the profession includes [[landscape design]]; [[site planning]]; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|stormwater management]]; erosion control; [[natural environment|environmental]] [[ecological restoration|restoration]]; [[park]]s and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private [[estate (land)|estate]] and [[house|residence]] landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a [[landscape architect]].

==Definition==
Landscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[soil sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], [[ecology]], and [[civil engineering]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces with limitations toward the landscape or park aspect of the design - large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].  The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues.

Landscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in [[forestry]], nature [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[agriculture]].

Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as [[soil science]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]] or [[botany]] that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular [[species]] in a given area.

Landscape planners are concerned with [[landscape planning]] for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural and coastal land use.
Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as [[landscape archaeology]] or law to the process of landscape planning.

== History ==
[[File:Orangerie.jpg|thumb|300px|Orangery at the Palace of Versailles, outside Paris]]
{{Main|History of landscape architecture}}
For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The first person to write of ''making'' a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828, and [[John Claudius Loudon]] (1783–1843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the ''Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton''.&lt;ref&gt;London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term "landscape architect" was used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in the United States in 1863{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} and 
[[Andrew Jackson Downing]] (1815–1852),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6412257 Find a Grave]&lt;/ref&gt; another early American [[landscape designer]], was editor of ''The Horticulturist'' magazine (1846–52). In 1841 his first book, ''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America'', was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Horticulture|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=24 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716204051/http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect begun to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and [[Beatrix Farrand|Beatrix Jones (later Farrand)]] with others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at [[Cambridge]], [[England]], in 1948 with [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]] as its first president, representing 15 countries from [[Europe]] and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name=IFLAbook&gt;IFLA Past, Present, Future - A publication about the history of IFLA. {{ISBN|3-9522080-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=123501&amp;set=48C9DF56_2_0&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNCESCO Documents and Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflaonline.org/ The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to urban planning==
[[File:Central park photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|333px|The combination of the traditional landscape gardening and the emerging city planning combined together gave landscape architecture its unique focus. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]  used the term 'landscape architecture' using the word as a profession for the first time when designing the [[Central Park]]. ]]
Through the 19th century, [[urban planning]] became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of [[History of gardening|landscape gardening]] and the emerging field of urban planning offered Landscape Architecture an opportunity to serve these needs.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the century, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] completed a series of parks which continue to have a huge influence on the practices of Landscape Architecture today. Among these were [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and Boston's [[Emerald Necklace]] park system. [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and private estates for the Ford family including [[Fair Lane]] and [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House|Gaukler Point]]. One of the original ten founding members of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and the only woman, was [[Beatrix Farrand]]. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]; [[Yale]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]; and the [[Arnold Arboretum]] for [[Harvard]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Her numerous private [[estate (land)|estate]] projects include the landmark [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, other architects — most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins—changed certain elements of the Farrand design.

Since this period [[Urban Planning]] has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as [[Civil Engineering]], [[Architecture]] and [[Public Administration]]. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulletin of Information for the AICP Comprehensive Planning Examination|url=https://planning-org-uploaded-media.s3.amazonaws.com/legacy_resources/certification/pdf/bulletin.pdf#page=13|website = www.planning.org|quote=There are important distinctions between planners and allied professionals and between planning and related fields. Planners approach problems comprehensively, have a long-range perspective, and deal with unique place-based issues. Although people in related professions (e.g., law, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, real estate development, etc.) and disciplines (humanities, psychology, etc.) often work with planners, they do not necessarily have the same knowledge base, skillset, and approach.

Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline, and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]] was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession. [[Roberto Burle Marx]] in [[Brazil]] combined the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.

[[Ian McHarg]] was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture.&lt;ref name=Corbett&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Ian McHarg: Overlay Maps and the Evaluation of Social and Environmental Costs of Land Use Change|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/23|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ozio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ozio|first1=Ron|title=Obituary: Ian McHarg Dies|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/university-pennsylvania-prof-ian-mcharg-dies|website=Penn News|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=6 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth's surface and is similarly used by Urban Planners, Geographers, Forestry and Natural Resources professionals, etc.

==Profession==
In many countries, a professional [[institute]], comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In [[Europe]], [[North America]], parts of [[South America]], [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]], landscape architecture is a regulated profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oala.on.ca |title=The Ontario Association of Landscape Architects |publisher=Oala.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Since 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper [[Carlos Thays]], recommended to recreate the National Capital's parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the [[University of Buenos Aires|UBA University of Buenos Aires]]''"UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo"'' (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor’s degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the [[Buenos Aires Botanical Garden]].

===Australia===
The [[Australian Institute of Landscape Architects]] (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia.

AILA's system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aila.org.au/iMIS_Prod/AILAWeb/Become_an_AILA_Member/Join/AILAWeb/Join_or_Renew.aspx?hkey=2d670d90-0f9a-49c9-a901-68bc8fd5ef5e]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness.

===Canada===
In Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute.  For example, Ontario's profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the ''Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act''.  Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing.

Provincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects|Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L'Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada]] (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csla-aapc.ca/csla-aapc Canadian Society of Landscape Architects Official Site - English]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
AIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects' Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
In Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture:
*Architects
*Landscape designers
*Doctor landscape agronomists and Doctor landscape foresters, often called Landscape agronomists.
*Agrarian Experts and Graduated Agrarian experts.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ [http://www.nzila.co.nz www.nzila.co.nz].

In April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand.  The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic.

Within NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.

NZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture.

===Republic of Ireland===
The Irish Landscape Institute [ILI] (www.irishlandscapeinstitute.com) is the officially recognized (by the Irish State) professional body representing landscape architects and parks professionals, in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The ILI was formed in 1992 by the merger of the ILHI (Institute of Landscape Horticulture of Ireland) and the IILA (Irish Institute of Landscape Architects), representing the related disciplines of landscape architecture and landscape horticulture. The Institute currently (October 2017) has a total membership of 160 (approx.) within 7 membership categories (student, graduate, affiliate, parks professional, corporate, fellow, honorary). In the absence of state regulation of the profession or title 'landscape architect', ILI is self-regulating, as for example in its adoption of the trade-marked title, 'Registered Landscape Architect', that is solely permissible for use by corporate members.

At international level, the ILI is a full member of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) through its European Region (IFLA-Europe). The ILI has play a consistent and active role in IFLA and the current president of IFLA-Europe is Irishman and ILI Past President, Mr. Tony Williams MILI.
In the Republic of Ireland, the ILI is a member institute of the Urban Forum, which represents 5 built-environment professional bodies in engineering, architecture, planning, quantity surveying and landscape architecture.

ILI promotes the landscape profession by its accreditation of the master's degree programme in University College Dublin, its certification of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for its members, administration of professional practice examinations, advocacy and lobbying in respect of government policies, guidelines and standards (e.g. the National Landscape Strategy, National Planning Framework, Blue-Green Infrastructure), conferences and seminars, public lectures and design awards.

The profession grew rapidly during the Irish economic boom of the early 21st. century, benefiting from the upsurge in the construction and development sectors and from the States' capital investment in infrastructure. The recession brought a sharp reduction in membership numbers. The profession and ILI has proven resilient with clear evidence of a slow but steady recovery through growth in membership and in employment, since the commencement of economic recovery in 2014.

A key challenge remains: there is still no professional regulation or protection registration of title in Ireland, despite calls for such on successive government by ILI over many years. Therefore, there is no state-guarantee or protection of clients, for example in terms of insuring and verifying educational qualifications, professional indemnity insurance or Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of those claiming to be landscape architects. Notwithstanding this, there is a growing awareness in some important sectors (e.g. government departments, media, construction, tourism) of the profession. This is due - to some degree - to the ongoing work of the ILI in promoting the benefits of landscape architecture to Irish society, economy and environment.

Landscape architects in Ireland work in private practice, public sector bodies at local government level and in some state bodies (e.g. transport, national heritage) and in academia. The demand for their professional services is often associated with public infrastructure projects (e.g. roads, motorways, renewable energy facilities, water treatment plants, etc.), Blue-Green Infrastructure (planning, design and management of parks, greenspaces, amenity trees) and with construction projects related to land use developments, principally residential, commercial and mixed-use developments in urban landscapes.

Landscape architects are employed in design of:  green infrastructure, public realm, institutional/medical/industrial campuses and settings, parks, play facilities, transport (road/rail/cycle/port) corridors, retail complexes, residential estates (including plans for remediation of now-abandoned housing 'ghost' estates), village improvements, accessibility audits, graveyard restoration schemes, wind farms, wetland drainage systems and coastal zones.
They are also significantly employed in preparation/review of statutory impact assessment reports on landscape, visual and ecological impacts of planning proposals.

=== South Africa ===
In May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilasa.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt; ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession. It consists of three regional bodies namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA’s mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the Institute. ILASA holds the country’s membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).

In South Africa, the profession is regulated by The South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saclap.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt; established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act – Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP’s mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community.

After completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the [[University of Cape Town]] or the [[University of Pretoria]], or landscape technology at the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]], professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist.We also can study landscape architect in various FET institution.

===United Kingdom===
The UK's professional body is the [[Landscape Institute]] (LI). It is a [[charter]]ed body which accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members.

The Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience.

In 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled "I want to be a Landscape Architect" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aims to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building [[sustainable communities]] and fighting [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |title=CC Position Statement |first= |last= |work=landscapeinstitute.org |year=2011 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613043428/http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, Landscape Architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called [[The Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.)]]. Several states require passage of a state exam as well. In the United States licensing is overseen both at the state level, and nationally by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB).  Landscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'''s list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2009/12/28/landscape-architect-2.html |title=Career Advice and Guide for Job Searches - US News Business |publisher=Money.usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]].

'''''The  Last Supper''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Jacopo Tintoretto]].  An oil painting on canvas executed in 1592–94, it is housed in the [[Basilica di San Giorgio Maggiore]] in [[Venice]], northern Italy.

==Overview==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - The Last Supper - WGA7259.jpg|left|thumb|[[Albrecht Dürer]]'s woodcut ''The Last Supper'' (1523) exemplifies the frontal composition that is customary for this subject.]]
Tintoretto depicted the [[Last Supper]] several times during his artistic career. His earlier paintings for the Chiesa di San Marcuola (1547) and for the Chiesa di San Felice (1559) depict the scene from a frontal perspective, with the figures seated at a table placed parallel to the picture plane. This follows a convention observed in most paintings of the Last Supper, of which [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Leonardo da Vinci's late 1490s mural painting]] in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], is perhaps the best-known example. 

Tintoretto's painting of 1592–94, a work of his final years, departs drastically from this compositional formula. The centre of the scene is occupied not by the apostles but instead by secondary characters, such as a woman carrying a dish and the servants taking the dishes from the table. The table at which the apostles sit recedes into space on a steep diagonal. Also personal is Tintoretto's use of light, which appears to come into obscurity from both the light on the ceiling and from Jesus' [[aureola]]. A host of [[angels]] hover above the scene.

Tintoretto's ''Last Supper'' makes use of [[Mannerist]] devices, notably its complex and radically asymmetrical composition. In its dynamism and emphasis on the quotidian—the setting is similar to a Venetian inn—the painting points the way to the [[Baroque]].  "The ability of this dramatic scene to engage viewers was well in keeping with [[Counter-Reformation]] ideals and the Catholic Church's belief in the didactic nature of religious art."&lt;ref&gt;''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', Volume II, 13th edition. p. 494.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Latvian National Opera''' (LNO, Latvijas Nacionālā opera), [[Riga]], is the national opera of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bousfield ''Baltic States'' Rough Guides 2004 "The [[Latvian National Symphony Orchestra]] and the Latvian National Opera are the biggest shows in town, but be sure to look out for performances by [[Kremerata Baltica]], a chamber ensemble put together by the Riga-born violinist [[Gidon Kremer]]"&lt;/ref&gt; The opera company includes the '''Latvian National Ballet''' (LNB), LNO Chorus, and LNO Orchestra.

==History==
Riga already had a German-speaking theatre, which also offered opera and ballet, from 1782, and this was housed in the [[Riga City Theatre]] from 1863. 

The first attempt to create a Latvian national opera was 1893, when Jēkabs Ozols' ''Spoku stunda'' ("The Ghostly Hour") was performed.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin O'Connor ''Culture and customs of the Baltic states'' 2006 p181 "The first attempt to create a Latvian national opera was J. Ozols's (1863–1902) ''The Ghostly Hour'', performed in 1893, but cultural historians agree that the first real Latvian opera was ''Baņuta'' by the organist and composer [[Alfrēds Kalniņš]]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Latvian opera (Latviešu Opera) was founded in 1912 by Pāvuls Jurjāns, though almost immediately, during the [[First World War]], the opera troupe was evacuated to Russia. In 1918, the opera restarted (Latvju Opera) led by [[Jāzeps Vītols]], the founder of the [[Latvian Academy of Music]]. The debut performance, on January 23, 1919, was of Wagner’s ''[[Der fliegende Holländer]]''. From 1944, following the occupation of Latvia by Soviet Union, and incorporation into the Soviet Union, the Latvian National Opera became the '''Latvian S.S.R. State Opera and Ballet Theater.''' In 1990, the theater was renamed the Latvian National Opera, but almost immediately the building was closed till 1995 for renovation and the company moved to temporary premises. For the reopening in 1995, the first opera was [[Jānis Mediņš]]’ ''Uguns un nakts'' (Fire and Night).

==Building==
[[File:National Opera House Riga.jpg|thumb|National Opera House building in the early 20th century.]]
The National Opera House was constructed in 1863 by the St. Petersburg architect [[Ludwig Bohnstedt]] (interiors made by the firm of [[August Volz]]), for the then German-speaking City Theatre, and has been refurbished several times; 1882–1887 (following a fire in 1882), 1957–1958, 1991–1995 (following independence).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barlas, Winnie Wong Latvia- 2010 p98 "Since independence in 1991, the National Opera building has received a major facelift, restoring the original facilities to their former grandeur and adding new ones."&lt;/ref&gt; A modern annex was  added in 2001 with a 300-seat New Hall.

This is a list of case colors and styles that have been produced for the [[Nintendo DS]] line of handheld systems.

==Nintendo DS==

===Colors===
* Titanium
* Sky Blue
* Candy Pink
* Snow White
* Lava Red

===Retail bundles===
*The red Nintendo DS model, released in Japan on August 8, 2005, is part of a promotional offer that includes the game ''[[Jump Superstars]]''.
*In October 2005, Nintendo released two new colors to North America: Teal and Pearl Pink (not the same Candy Pink as was released in Europe and Japan, but a tint identical to that of the Mystic Pink model released in Australia). These systems are bundled with the game ''[[Nintendogs|Nintendogs Best Friends Version]]'', as well as a bone-shaped screen cleaner. These bundles were released in Europe on October 7, 2005. In Europe, the pink DS included the Dachshund and Friends version of ''Nintendogs'', and the teal DS included the Lab and Friends version of ''Nintendogs''. These were priced at the same price as a lone Nintendo DS (£99). On that same day, the Nintendo DS received a price cut to £89.
*The Electric Blue was released in North America, initially bundled with ''Super Mario 64 DS'', for the same price as a lone DS ($149.99) on June 30, 2005. One million copies were sold, making it the best-selling game during that time. As of February 27, 2006 ''Animal Crossing: Wild World'' is included with the Electric Blue system.
*The ''Mario Kart DS'' Pack was released in Europe on November 25, 2005, which contained a silver-colored DS and a copy of ''Mario Kart DS''. The same Pack was available in New Zealand and Australia
*The Red Hot Bundle was released in North America on November 29, 2005, including a red and silver Nintendo DS system ("Hot Rod Red"), optional racing decals, a normal Nintendo DS wrist strap/thumb pad, a bonus checkerboard wrist strap (strangely, with no thumb pad), a Mario Kart metal charm, and a copy of ''Mario Kart DS''. It also came with [[racecar]] [[decal]] [[stickers]] that could be placed on your DS. It is the same as the original red DS that debuted in Japan alongside ''[[Jump Superstars]]''; the only difference is that the underside of the Japanese model is black, while the underside of the American model is silver.
*The Titanium Nintendo DS was released with a demo of the game ''Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt'', on November 21, 2004, in North America and on March 11, 2005, in Europe. The bundle is no longer available in the vast majority of American and European stores.
*On June 22, 2008, a special edition Guitar Hero DS was released on online retailers to help launch the new game ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'' that featured the Guitar Hero logo on the bottom right. It was available to anyone for a limited time for approx. US $179.99. This also includes the game. It can still be found at the Nintendo World Store, for approx. US $129.99, albeit in very limited copies.

===Loyalty, one-of-a-kind, charity and promotional units===
*Five variants of existing Nintendo DS colors were produced for the Japanese online Super Mario Club. Each color has a wireframe of a character's face imprinted on the front cover of the system. There were 200 made for each unit. The designs include:
**Titanium/[[Mario]]
**Graphite Black/[[Bowser (Nintendo)|Bowser]]
**Gray/[[Wario]]
**Candy Pink/[[Princess Peach]]
**Turquoise Blue/[[Yoshi]].
*Nintendo auctioned off three custom Nintendo DS systems for charity at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]]. The systems went to [[Jay Mohr]] for $10,000, [[Poppy Montgomery]] for $2,500, and [[Alan Cumming]] for $1,500. Nintendo added money to the final bids, and a portion of the funds went towards victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].
*Rapper [[50 Cent]] ordered a custom-made Nintendo DS from Nintendo, featuring a [[khaki]] [[camouflage]] design, and the [[G-Unit]] insignia on the front cover. 50 were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ds.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=1649 | title=Rapper Has A Custom Nintendo DS Made | author=Chris Playo |date=March 4, 2005 | work=NintendoDS Advanced | publisher=Advanced Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As a special gift, 55 people who attended the May 9, 2006, VIP party at the Nintendo World Store were able to get a commemorative E3 engraving put on the cover of their Nintendo DS.
*The winner of the [[Pokémon]] Journey Across America, Minh Ba Le, won a [[diamond]]-encrusted DS.
*Shortly before the system's official launch in Europe, a bundle was available on the Nintendo VIP 24:7 scheme consisting of a European silver DS system, a demo of [[WarioWare: Touched!]], a copy of Super Mario 64 DS, and a T-shirt, in exchange for 1000 Stars and £129.99.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://n-europe.com/news.php?nid=7389|title=Nintendo DS VIP Package|date=January 28, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-29|work=N-Europe|format=PHP|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070927072543/http://n-europe.com/news.php?nid=7389|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An extremely limited edition was created and given to selected members of the press for the release of [[Advance Wars: Dual Strike]]. There were around 50 made but only a handful are known. It had a camouflage design, and was presented in a metal ammunition box with a copy of the game and a mug.

===Publicly available limited editions===
*Special dark blue Nintendo DS systems were released at [[Poképark]] in Japan and Wal-Mart in the US. The systems have the Poképark logo on the front cover, and a [[Pikachu]] silhouette superimposed over the right speaker grill.
*A light blue Nintendo DS, with a limited run of 1,000 units, was released in Japan as part of a joint promotional offer with [[Pepsi-Cola|Pepsi]].
*Nintendo released a gold-colored DS that is exclusive to Japanese Toys "R" Us stores.
*A Nintendo DS with [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]] has been released in Japan. It is tinted purple with the Pokémon lightly printed on the front and adjacent to the top screen.
*50 white Nintendo DS units featuring artwork of characters from the popular anime ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' were given away by Sega to commemorate the release of ''[[Bleach: The Blade of Fate|Bleach DS: Souten ni Kakeru Unmei]]''.
*As of 2006, Sega is holding a contest whose prize is a white Nintendo DS with a skin of [[Doraemon]] on the front.

The listing was picked up and featured on many major online gaming websites such as [[IGN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-07-20 |title=Canadians To Get Crimson-Black DS Lite?

*On the same day, Nintendo also released a similar color scheme for the DS Lite, known as Cobalt/Onyx, and in certain regions was bundled the same as its Crimson/Onyx color variation. They both feature a glossy upper half of the DS Lite's lid, whereas the rest of the unit is matte black. This varied from earlier Onyx (Black) models as the exterior casings were not done in a matte coating; rather a glossy exterior prone to fingerprints and scratches.
*In September 2007, in North America Nintendo released a DS Lite to commemorate the launch of ''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pokémon Pearl'' video games. The black Pokémon Nintendo DS Lite was bundled with a special Pokémon cartoon episode and a carrying case. The Pokémon Dialga and Palkia guarded the system's upper lid, etched in gold and silver respectively. The Nintendo DS Lite for a while after was still available in onyx black until supplies ran out; but its casing lacks the Pokémon design. A similar model was released in white around the debut of ''Pokémon Platinum'' Version featuring the Pokémon, Giratina, etched on the lid in grey.
*In April 2009, for the launch of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars]]'', Nintendo showcased 20 Nintendo DS Lite units, shown in dark navy blue and red with GTA logos on top, displayed at the Nintendo World Store.

'''''Natural Law and Natural Rights''''' is a 1980 book by the philosopher [[John Finnis]]. A restatement of [[natural law]] doctrine, it is considered a seminal contribution to the [[philosophy of law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oxf20|Oxford University Press 2013]].&lt;/ref&gt; The work was commissioned by [[H. L. A. Hart]] for the Clarendon Law Series.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;[[#Geo05|George 2005]]. p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on secondary sources discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
Finnis argues that social theory cannot be value free and that Humean ethics, unlike genuine (as opposed to neo-scholastic) Thomist ethics, commits a [[naturalistic fallacy]]. He bases his radically rearticulated Aristotelian political and legal theory on dialectically defended first principles of [[practical reason]] and methodological principles of practical reasonableness (morality).&lt;ref name="George" /&gt; He defends the following basic human goods: life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability (friendship), practical reasonableness, and religion, defined as "all those beliefs that can be called matters of ultimate concern; questions about the point of human existence."&lt;ref name="Buckle"&gt;[[#Buc97|Buckle 1997]]. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosophy lecturer Stephen Buckle sees Finnis's list of proposed basic goods as plausible, but notes that Finnis's account of the basic requirements of practical reasonableness is more controversial. Buckle sees Finnis's requirement of "respect for every basic value in every act" as intended both to rule out [[consequentialism]] in ethics and also to support the moral viewpoint of the [[Catholic Church]] on a range of contentious issues, including [[contraception]] and [[masturbation]], which in his view undermines its plausibility.&lt;ref name="Buckle" /&gt;

== Work ==
His work has been exhibited extensively in the United States and internationally. In October 2015, a monographic exhibition of Fast’s work titled Present Continuous opened at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, and subsequently travelled to the [[Baltic Center of Contemporary Art]], Gateshead, UK, and the KUNSTEN Museum of Modern Art, Aalborg. Denmark.

Fast's work is included in the permanent collections of numerous institutions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, NY; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], CA; [[Tate Modern]], London, UK; [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], Paris, France; and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands among others. Fast Lives and works in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jamescohan.com/artists/omer-fast&lt;/ref&gt;

Fast is one of several contemporary artists who restages existing films, including [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[Robert Melee]] and [[Yasumasa Morimura]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (March 8, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/08/arts/art-in-review-brice-delsperger.html ART IN REVIEW; Brice Delsperger] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''August'' (2017)===
In 2017, Fast was met with protests and allegations of [[racism]] by the Chinatown Art Brigade and others, including the [[Korean Americans|Korean American]] artist and 47 Canal gallery owner Margaret Lee,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.affidavit.art/articles/chinatown&lt;/ref&gt; for his August exhibition in the James Cohan gallery on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]]. The show was titled “August” after its centerpiece, a fine 3D video from 2016 that was inspired by the life of [[August Sander]], a German portrait and documentary photographer. But that video, along with an earlier one, has been upstaged by a surrounding installation that transforms Cohan’s white-box space into a New York Chinatown shop or bus-company waiting room with metal chairs, broken A.T.M.s and a shabby facade. Fast seems to have intended the Cohan gallery “waiting room” not as a replication of any real Chinatown but as the kind of fantasy version of immigrant neighborhoods evoked to justify “slum clearance.” While the work was intended to provoke a strong reaction&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/chinatown-omer-fast-art-poverty-porn&lt;/ref&gt;, a group of Chinatown-based activists have called out&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/arts/artists-chinatown-depiction-ignites-protests.html&lt;/ref&gt; the piece as racist “poverty porn,” pure and simple, and demanded its removal.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/arts/design/omer-fast-chinatown-art-show-james-cohan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Remainder'' (2015)===
In 2015 Fast released his first [[feature film]],{{where|date=December 2017}} based on the [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]] novel ''[[Remainder (novel)|Remainder]]''
.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://variety.com/2014/film/news/cannes-first-image-from-omer-fasts-remainder-starring-tom-sturridge-1201176279/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Continuity'' (2012) ===
''Continuity'' features an older couple who hires male escorts to play out their dead son’s return from Afghanistan. The 40-minute work explores loss and grief as much as the narrative constructions of fiction and the cinematic conventions used in documentary films.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Rojas (August 14, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Cardiff-prize-show-isnt-afraid-to-talk-politics/33386 Cardiff prize show isn’t afraid to talk politics] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''5000 Feet is the Best'' (2011)===
Fast is the director of this [[short film]] shown on the [[Biennale di Venezia]] in 2011.

=== ''Nostalgia'' (2009)===
In October 2009, Fast’s exhibition "Nostalgia" opened at [[South London Gallery]]. The exhibition included ''Nostalgia'', a three-part film installation that intermingles a man’s account of his struggle for asylum in Britain with a reenactment of his story as a 1970s [[science fiction movie]] in which he attempts to flee a dystopian Europe and relocate to a colony in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Carnelia. "[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32955/omer-fast/ Omer Fast]." ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fast's 2009-2010 Nostalgia at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] was part of the 2008 [[Bucksbaum Award]], given to the most prominent artist in that year's [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAdams|first=Shane|title=Omer Fast|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=February 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/02/artseen/omer-fast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Casting'' (2007) ===
In the four-channel video piece ''Casting'',&lt;ref&gt;Holland Cotter (January 7, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/arts/design/08fast.html Is It Reality or Fantasy? The Boundaries Are Blurred] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the viewer walks into the screening room initially encountering two hanging projection screens.  Each screen contains a different depiction of a narrative showing the characters acting while silent and remaining completely still.  The projection screens are double sided and contain two additional images on the rear side where the viewer sees two men engaged in an interview.  The two men are a young American Army sergeant and the artist in a dialog about the narrative.  The artist states during the interview that he is interested only in memory and how memory gets mediated; he says the work he is trying to achieve has or should have no political slant.  Although the work is politically ambiguous it shows the powerlessness of an American Army sergeant in the current Iraqi conflict and possibly the powerlessness of perceived American hegemonic power.

=== ''CNN Concatenated'' (2002)===
In 2002, Fast released ''CNN Concatenated'', an 18-minute-long single-channel video which uses CNN news anchor clips. The video is cut so that each word is spoken by a different newsperson. The pieces literally asks the viewers questions about media authenticity and gives CNN a distinct voice.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Wong: [http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/reviews/wong/wong7-22-02.asp Televisions], July 22nd, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Spielberg's List'' ===
The 59-minute two-channel work centers on interviews with residents of [[Krakow]], Poland, who worked as extras in the concentration camp scenes in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film ''[[Schindler's List]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (April 18, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/18/arts/art-in-review-omer-fast.html ART IN REVIEW; Omer Fast] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The video suggests that, whatever their experience, many of them conflated the Hollywood version of the Holocaust with historical reality.&lt;ref&gt;Holland Cotter (January 7, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/08/arts/design/08fast.html Is It Reality or Fantasy? The Boundaries Are Blurred] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palmo's Opera House''' (afterword '''Burton's Theater''' and the '''Chambers Street Theatre''') was a 19th-century theatre in [[Manhattan]], New York that was located on [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] between [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[Centre Street (Manhattan)|Centre Street]]. It was one of the earliest [[opera house]]s in New York before it was converted into one of the earliest [[Broadway theatre]]s. The theatre was conceived by Ferdinand Palmo, an Italian immigrant and successful restaurateur in New York City. It was located inside the former Stoppani's Arcade Baths building. Modest alteration to the building was done in 1843 to convert the building into a theater.

In 1848 opera performances at Palmo's Opera House ceased and the theater was leased to [[William Evans Burton]]. It was rechristened the Burton's Theater and became a performance venue for plays and other theatrical entertainments. It operated under that name until 1856 when the theater was leased to Edward Eddy and it was rebranded again as the Chambers Street Theatre. The theatre operated under that name until it closed in 1864. The building was then leased to the United States Government, and was used as a Federal Court building until it was demolished in 1876.

==Palmo's Opera House==
Palmo's Opera House, designed by [[John M. Trimble]],&lt;ref name=1847-10-02/&gt; opened on February 3, 1844&lt;ref name=1844-02-05/&gt;&lt;ref name=1844-02-03/&gt; with a production of Bellini's ''[[I puritani]]'' with Euphrasia Borghese as Elvira, [[Emma Albertazzi]] as Henrietta, and Michael Rapetti conducting. This was soon followed by performances of Bellini's ''[[Beatrice di Tenda]]'' and the New York premiere of Donizetti's ''[[Belisario]]''. In April 1844 the theater staged Rossini's ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' with basso buffo [[Antonio Sanquirico]] making his professional stage debut as Dr Bartolo. The following month the opera house presented the operas ''[[La sonnambula]]'' and ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' for their first presentations in the original Italian language in New York City.

The Fall 1844 season at Palmo's opened with a production of Rossini's ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'' with [[Laure Cinti-Damoreau]] as Isabella. The singer was later heard to rave reviews that season as Rosina in a revival of the company's production of ''The Barber of Seville''. Also performed that season was Rossi's ''[[Chiara Rosenberg]]'' with Rosina Pico in the title role.

In 1847 the Sanquirico-Patti Opera Company became the resident opera company at Palmo's Opera House. The company's first presentation there was the United States premiere of Donizetti's ''[[Linda di Chamounix]]'' on January 4, 1847 with Clotilda Barili in the title role and Sesto Benedetti as the Vicomte de Serval. The company went on to present the first opera by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] ever staged in the United States, ''[[I Lombardi alla prima crociata]]'' on March 3, 1847. Other operas staged that year at Palmo's included the New York premiere of ''[[Lucrezia Borgia]]'' and another staging of ''The Barber of Seville''.

Despite making some notable achievements, the Sanquirico-Patti Opera company did not fare well financially against a new opera rival in the city, the touring Havana Opera Company, partly due to the much nicer accommodations and better production value at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]] where the Havana company was playing. In the Fall of 1847 the Sanquirico-Patti Opera Company left Palmo's for the newly built [[Astor Opera House]]. Faced with strong competition and mounting losses, Palmo ceased presenting opera at the house and the theater was leased in 1848 to William Evans Burton.

==Burton's Theatre==
[[File:Old Burton's Theatre.jpg|thumb|A colored lithograph from a cigarette card (c. 1910) of Old Burton's Theatre]]
Burton's Theatre opened on July 10, 1848 with a performance of the play ''Maiden's Beware!''. Later that month Burton presented the world premiere of [[John Brougham]]'s stage adaptation of Dicken's ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' with Burton as Captain Cuttle to great success. In July 1849 the theater presented [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''[[London Assurance]]'' with [[Fanny Wallack]] as Lady Gay Spanker. On December 3, 1849 the theater presented the world premiere of [[Morris Barnett]]'s ''The Serious Family''. In 1852 the theatre staged [[John Poole (playwright)|John Poole]]'s ''Paul Pry'' with [[Henry Placide]] as Colonel Harding. The theatre also staged several plays by Burton, including the comedy ''Romance and Reality'', the burlesque ''Pocahontas'', and an adaptation of ''The Duke's Motto''.

Burton assembled several notable performers of the era in his troupe at the theatre, including Rosa Bennett, William R. Blake, W. Humphrey Bland, Julis Daly, [[Edward Loomis Davenport]], Jane Hill (later Mrs W. E. Burton), Josephine Shaw Russell Hoey, Mrs. Hughes, Mrs. George Jordan, John Sefton, Emma Skerret, Mary Cecilia Taylor, [[John Lester Wallack]], and Lizzie Weston among others.

==Chambers Street Theatre==
In 1856 Burton left for another theatre in uptown Manhattan and Edward Eddy took over the lease of the theatre which he renamed the Chamber Street Theatre.

[[File:Looking west across Porthmeor beach towards Tate St Ives - geograph.org.uk - 1549481.jpg|thumb|Fishing lofts on Porthmeor Beach]]
The '''Penwith Society of Arts''' is an art group formed in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], [[Cornwall]], England, UK, in early 1949 by [[abstract art]]ists who broke away from the more conservative [[St Ives School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/p/penwith-society-of-arts |title=Penwith Society of Arts &amp;#124; Tate |first= |last= |work=tate.org.uk |year=2014  |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally led by [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Ben Nicholson]], and included members of the [[Crypt Group]] of the St Ives Society, including [[Peter Lanyon]] and [[Sven Berlin]].  Other early members included: [[Leonard Fuller (artist)|Leonard Fuller]], [[Isobel Heath]], [[Alexander Mackenzie (artist)|Alexander Mackenzie]], [[John Wells (artist)|John Wells]], [[Bryan Wynter]], [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]], [[David Haughton]], [[Denis Mitchell (sculptor)|Denis Mitchell]], and the printer [[Latin Press|Guido Morris]].  [[Herbert Read]] was invited to be the first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cornwallartists.org/cornwall-artists/herbert-read |title=Herbert READ &amp;#124; cornwall artists index |first= |last=|work=cornwallartists.org |year=2014 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The group bought fishing lofts along Porthmeor beach to use as artists' studios, after an acrimonious split from the established St Ives Society of Artists.  Then on 8 February 1949, after a town meeting at the Castle Inn, a dissident group set up shop in Fore street, St Ives.  In 1960 and old pilchard factory was taken over with converted studios above.  After ten years of sincere guidance and deep interest, funds raised by Barbara Hepworth, with the aim of converting adjacent buildings into studios for craft and sculpture as well as painting expanded the project still further at Back Road, St Ives.  In 1967 [[Kathleen Watkins]] was appointed curator and secretary (1967-2013) of the society advising, among other things, clients on potential purchases.

'''Priam's Treasure''' is a cache of [[gold]] and other artifacts discovered by classical [[archaeologist]] [[Heinrich Schliemann]]. The majority of the artifacts are currently in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in Moscow.

Schliemann claimed the site to be that of [[Iliad|Homeric]] [[Troy]], and assigned the artifacts to the Homeric king [[Priam]]. This assignment is now thought to be a result of Schliemann's zeal to find sites and objects mentioned in the [[Homeric epics]] which take place in northwestern Turkey. At the time the stratigraphy at Troy had not been solidified, which was done subsequently by the archaeologist [[Carl Blegen]]. The layer in which Priam's Treasure was alleged to have been found was assigned to Troy II, whereas Priam would have been king of Troy VI or VII, occupied hundreds of years later.

== Background ==

With the rise of modern critical history, Troy and the [[Trojan War]] were consigned to the realms of legend. In 1871-73 and 1878–79, Schliemann excavated a hill called [[Hisarlik|Hissarlik]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]], near the town of Chanak ([[Çanakkale]]) in north-western [[Anatolia]], Turkey. Here he discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities, dating from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. Schliemann declared one of these cities—at first Troy I, later Troy II—to be the city of Troy, and this identification was widely accepted at that time.

Concerning events on or about May 27, 1873 Schliemann reported:

{{quote|In excavating this wall further and directly by the side of the palace of King Priam, I came upon a large copper article of the most remarkable form, which attracted my attention all the more as I thought I saw gold behind it. … In order to withdraw the treasure from the greed of my workmen, and to save it for archaeology, … I immediately had "paidos" (lunch break) called. … While the men were eating and resting, I cut out the Treasure with a large knife…. It would, however, have been impossible for me to have removed the Treasure without the help of my dear wife, who stood by me ready to pack the things which I cut out in her shawl and to carry them away.}}

Schliemann's oft-repeated story of the treasure being carried by his wife, Sophie, in her shawl was untrue. Schliemann later admitted making it up, saying that at the time of the discovery Sophie was in fact with her family in Athens, following the death of her father.&lt;ref&gt;Moorehead, Caroline (1994). ''The Lost Treasures of Troy'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, page 133. {{ISBN|0-297-81500-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The treasure ==
[[File:Sophia schliemann treasure.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Sophia Schliemann|de}} (''née'' Engastromenos) wearing the "Jewels of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]" excavated by her husband, [[Heinrich Schliemann]], in [[Hisarlik]] (photograph taken ''ca.'' 1874)]]
[[File:Tesoro di priamo, grande diadema con pendenti, oro, cat. 10, 01.JPG|thumb|The "big" diadem in modern exhibition]]
[[File:Tesoro di priamo, nastro d'oro, cat. 12; piccolo diadema con pendenti, cat. 11; due orecch. con pendenti, cat. 15-16.JPG|thumb|The "small" diadem]]

A partial catalogue of the treasure is approximately as follows:
* A copper shield
* a copper cauldron with handles
* an unknown copper artifact, perhaps the hasp of a chest
* a silver vase containing two gold [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadems]] (the "Jewels of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]"), 8750 gold rings, buttons and other small objects, six gold bracelets, two gold goblets
* a copper vase
* a wrought gold bottle
* two gold cups, one wrought, one cast
* a number of red terra cotta goblets
* an [[electrum]] cup (mixture of gold and silver and copper)
* six wrought silver knife blades (which Schliemann put forward as money)
* three silver vases with fused copper parts
* more silver goblets and vases
* thirteen copper lance heads
* fourteen copper axes
* seven copper daggers
* other copper artifacts with the key to a chest

== The treasure as an art collection ==

Apparently, Schliemann smuggled Priam's Treasure out of Anatolia. The officials were informed when his wife, Sophia, wore the jewels for the public. The Ottoman official assigned to watch the excavation, [[Amin Effendi]], received a prison sentence. The Ottoman government revoked Schliemann's permission to dig and sued him for its share of the gold. Schliemann went on to [[Mycenae]]. There, however, the [[Greek Archaeological Society]] sent an agent to monitor him.

Later Schliemann traded some treasure to the government of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in exchange for permission to dig at Troy again. It is located in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]]. The rest was acquired in 1881 by the [[Berlin State Museums|Royal Museums of Berlin]] ''(Königliche Museen zu Berlin)'',&lt;ref&gt;Urice, Stephen K., editor (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_8AddekkdZ8C Law, Ethics and the Visual Arts]'', Kluwer Law International, page 63. {{ISBN|90-411-2517-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Jeanette (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-r032DSDsOIC The Return of Cultural Treasures]'', Cambridge University Press, page 197. {{ISBN|0-521-80216-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in whose hands it remained until 1945, when it disappeared from a protective bunker beneath the [[Zoologischer Garten Berlin|Berlin Zoo]].

In fact, after the capture of the bunker by the [[Red Army]] Professor [[Wilhelm Unverzagt]] turned the treasure over to the Soviet commendant and thus saved it from plunder and division. The commander promised to guarantee the safety of the art treasures. The artefacts were taken away to [[Moscow]]. During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet government denied any knowledge of the fate of Priam's Treasure. However, in September 1993 the treasure turned up at the [[Pushkin Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstikov, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/8567721.html?dids=8567721&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;date=Sep+6%2C+1993&amp;author=Atkinson%2C+Rick&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C1&amp;desc=Trojan+treasure+unlocks+art+war | title=Trojan treasure unlocks art war | date=September 6, 1993 | first=Rick | last=Atkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia keeps what the West terms the [[looted art]] as compensation for the destruction of Russian cities and looting of Russian museums by [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]]. A 1998 Russian law, the [[Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation]], legalizes the looting in Germany as compensation and prevents Russian authorities from proceeding to restitutions.

== Authenticity of the treasure ==

There have always been doubts about the authenticity of the treasure. Within the last few decades these doubts have found fuller expression in articles and books.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, 1987; Silberman, 1989; Traill, 1997.{{pages needed|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The treasures are actually a thousand years older than Homer's King Priam of Troy, who died about 1200 B.C.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The '''Prix Blumenthal''' (or ''Blumenthal Prize'') was a [[grant (money)|grant]] or [[stipend]] awarded through the philanthropy of [[Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] (1875–1930) &amp;mdash; and the foundation she created, ''Fondation franco-américaine Florence Blumenthal (Franco-American Florence Blumenthal Foundation)'' &amp;mdash; to discover young French artists, aid them financially, and in the process draw the United States and France closer together through the arts.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; 

Winners were designated by seven juries in the fields of the literature, painting, sculpture, decorative arts, structure, engraving and music &amp;mdash; to receive a [[prize money|purse]] of six thousand francs per year, given for two years.  The purse increased in 1926 until Blumenthal's death in 1930 to ten thousand francs for two years. 

Jurors included philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]; novelist [[Roland Dorgelès]]; novelist, essayist, diplomat and playwright [[Jean Giraudoux]]; writer [[Anna de Noailles]]; poet and essayist [[Paul Valéry]]; painter [[Paul Signac]],&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; painter and printmaker [[Édouard Vuillard]], sculptor [[Paul Landowski]], painter and sculptor [[Aristide Maillol]],&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; architect [[Auguste Perret]], composer [[Paul Dukas]], composer [[Maurice Ravel]] and composer/conductor [[Guy Ropartz]].

Composer [[Georges Migot]] served as vice-president and subsequently as president (1931–1935)&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;  of the foundation, as well as the archivist of the winners.&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;   

Beginning in 1919 the foundation awarded nearly two hundred grants, and on April 11, 1937, the Prix Blumenthal was declared ''d'utilité publique ("of public service")'', giving it a special tax classification.&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;  Awards were given through 1954.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;  At the time of the foundation's dissolution in 1973&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt; it was under the direction of [[:fr:Georges Huisman|Georges Huisman]], director of the [[école des Beaux-Arts]], along with author [[André Maurois]] and novelist [[Roland Dorgelès]].&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;  

In 2010 (May 14 – June 5), the [[Médiathèque]] of [[Haguenau]] hosted an exhibit of the Florence Blumenthal archives.&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;

 |quote       = By today's standards, George and Florence Blumenthal would definitely be considered a power couple. With palatial homes in New York and Paris, and Mediterranean yachting vacations, the Blumenthals lived vibrantly in a vibrant time. In her autobiography, retired Washington Post editor Katharine Graham described her aunt, Florence Blumenthal, as her father's much-loved sister with the perfect figure. Known as Florie to the family, she was known for bringing home massive amounts of clothing from Paris. She was also related to the powerful Levi Strauss family through her older sisters, Rosalie and Elise, each of whom had married a nephew of Strauss'. Eccentric and generous, Mrs. Blumenthal endowed the Franco-American Foundation's Florence Blumenthal Prize, and had a street named for her in Paris.

In 1925, Blumenthal moved to Paris with her husband, later donating large sums to the [[Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital|Children’s Hospital in Paris]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. Blumenthal died in Paris in 1930, at age fifty-five,&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"&gt;{{cite web

==Impact of the Prix==
As an example of the impact of the Prix Blumenthal, textile artist [[Paule Marrot]] received the stipend in 1928, which allowed Marrot to open her workshop in [[Batignolles]] on rue Truffaut &amp;mdash; where she became widely known for furniture textiles.&lt;ref name="legion"&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://haydenharnett.com/?action=about_paule_marrot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marrot went on to experience strong popularity and commercial success in the U.S. after World War II, made a strong impact at Renault by [[Renault Dauphine#Paule Marrot|pioneering the company's textile and color division]], and redefined furnishing fabrics in [[France]]. In 1952 Marrot was awarded the French [[Légion d'honneur|Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honor)]], (''Chevalier'') &amp;mdash; and her textiles continue under license to diverse companies including  [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Urban Outfitters|Anthropologie]] and the handbag maker, [[Hayden-Harnett]].&lt;ref name="legion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://furniture.about.com/od/furniturephotogalleries/ig/Rowe-Furniture/Chair-Paule-Marrot-Collection-.htm |title=Clayton Marcus chair for Rowe Furniture using Marrot Print |publisher=Furniture.about.com |date=2013-07-14 |accessdate=2013-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513032918/http://furniture.about.com/od/furniturephotogalleries/ig/Rowe-Furniture/Chair-Paule-Marrot-Collection-.htm |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purchaze.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/nike_dunk_hi_spmg.jpg |title=Nike shoe using Marrot Print |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SpiralIsland2000.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Spiral Island I in early March 2000]]

'''Spiral Island''' is the name of a [[floating island|floating]] [[artificial island]] built in [[Mexico]] by British artist Richart "Reishee" Sowa. It was destroyed by [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] in 2005; a replacement, Joyxee Island, has been open for tours since 2008.

Spiral Island has been featured in a number of [[newspaper]]s and TV [[Documentary film|documentaries]] around the world, including in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], and has been featured in an episode of the ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' TV series, and on the MTV program Extreme Cribs in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-of-recycled-plastic-bottle-eco-art-is |title=Grand Launch of Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiral Island==
The first Spiral island was located in a [[lagoon]] near [[Puerto Aventuras]], on the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Mexico]] south of [[Cancún]]; Richart Sowa began constructing it in 1998.  He filled nets with empty discarded plastic bottles to support a structure of [[plywood]] and [[bamboo]], on which he poured sand and planted numerous plants, including [[mangrove]]s. The island sported a two-story house, a [[solar oven]], a self-[[composting toilet]], and three beaches. He used some 250,000 bottles for the {{convert|66|x|54|ft|m|adj=on}} structure. 

Sowa was ordered to take the island out of the man-made canal in 2004 because many private homes and condos were being built and he lived for one year tied to the end of a loose rock pier. Richart was offered a new location in the bay of Soliman about 200 km south, Finally, he was permitted by Port authorities to tow Spiral Island but the island was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005. &lt;ref&gt;[http://greentravelife.com/richart-sowa-a-green-island-made-of-plasti-bottles/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joyxee Island==
In late 2007 and 2008, Sowa built a replacement for Spiral Island in the waters of [[Isla Mujeres]], the "Island of Women", also near Cancun. It opened for tours in August 2008. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-recycled-plastic-bottle-ecological-ar |title=Birthing of Floating Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new island was initially {{convert|20|m|ft}} in diameter and contained about 100,000 bottles. It has since expanded to 25 metres (82 ft) due to various plants and mangroves growing from the island.  The new island has three beaches, a house, two ponds, a wave-powered washing machine, solar panels, a solar-powered waterfall and river. The island is a constant work in progress with volunteers and Sowa himself continually making improvements.

In May 2011, Reishee embarked on a project to berth his island out in Isla Mujeres Bay, as it was now too big for its current site off a pier in Laguna Majax. The Mexican Government also recognized Joyxee Island as an "Eco Boat" and therefore needed to comply with all current boating regulations, which involved the purchase of fire extinguishers, life ring buoys and emergency kits. The project was launched on kickstarter.com with a goal of $18,000 that it failed to reach. Reishee later successfully relaunched the project with a more conservative $9,000 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottmader/grand-launch-of-recycled-plastic-bottle-eco-art-is |title=Grand Launch of Recycled Plastic Bottle Eco Art Island by Scott Mader |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2481">'''Stasimon''' ({{Lang-grc|στάσιμον}}) in [[ancient Greek theatre|Greek tragedy]] is a stationary song, composed of strophes and [[antistrophe]]s and performed by the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Characteristics of the buildings|orchestra]] ({{Lang-grc|ὀρχήστρα}}, "place where the chorus dances").&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Chantraine]], ''[https://archive.org/details/Dictionnaire-Etymologique-Grec Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque: histoire des mots]'' (Paris: Éditions Klincksieck, 1968–80): 3:830.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] states in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1452b23) that each choral song (or melos) of a tragedy is divided into two parts, first the ''[[parodos]]'' ({{Lang-grc|πάροδος}}) and then the ''stasimon''. He defines the latter as "a choral song without [[anapaest]]s or [[trochaic]]s".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0086,034:1452b:23&amp;lang=original Translation] by William Hamilton Fyfe, in ''Aristotle in 23 Volumes'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1932).&lt;/ref&gt; This comment about the absence of anapest and trochee has been interpreted to mean that the music was not based on the usual “walking” meters, since the chorus sings the stasimon while remaining in the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[[LSJ]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dsta%2Fsimos stasimos] Actively: "stopping"; Pass. "standing", "stationary".&lt;/ref&gt; After making its entrance singing the parodos, it does not usually leave the orchestra until the end of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Mathiesen, ''Apollo's Lyre: Greek Music and Music Theory in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', Publications of the Center for the History of Music Theory and Literature 2 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1999): 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Suda]]'', an 11th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, attributes the establishment of the choral singing of a stasimon to the celebrated [[Citharede|kitharode]] [[Arion|Arion of Hermione]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Mathiesen, ''Apollo's Lyre: Greek Music and Music Theory in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', Publications of the Center for the History of Music Theory and Literature 2 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1999): 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12479">'''Teaching stories''' is a term used to describe narratives that have been deliberately created as vehicles for the transmission of wisdom. Whilst it is a term that has been used in a number of religious and other traditions, Shah's use of it was in the context of [[Sufi]] teaching and learning, within which this body of material has been described as the "most valuable of the treasures in the human heritage".&lt;ref name="Lessing1"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of teaching stories is enormous, including anecdotes, accounts of meetings between teachers and pupils, biographies, [[myths]], [[fairy tales]], [[fables]] and [[jokes]]. Such stories frequently have a long life beyond the initial teaching situation and (sometimes in deteriorated form) have contributed vastly to the world's store of [[folklore]] and [[literature]].

==Function==
It is the teaching function of teaching stories that characterises them rather than any other categorisation, however much they may have other uses. Shah likened the Sufi story to a peach:

:"A person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior as if the peach were lent to you. You can eat the peach and taste a further delight ... You can throw away the stone – or crack it and find a delicious kernel within. This is the hidden depth."

Thus these narratives also often have a wide circulation outside of any instructional function, where they frequently have cultural significance and entertainment value, or contain a moral answer or solution of some kind, or are put to use to reinforce belief. What makes them distincively teaching stories however is something different: they are likely to be open-ended, depending on the individual members of their audience for a variety of interpretations. Their purpose is ultimately to change the thinking process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hardin |first1=Shields Nancy |date=October 1977|title= The Teaching Story and Doris Lessing|journal= Twentieth Century Literature |volume=23 |pages= 314–25 |doi=10.2307/441260}}&lt;/ref&gt; They put at the disposal of those who know them an instrument for measuring themselves, the world and situations that they encounter.&lt;ref&gt;from Learning from Stories, A lecture by Idries Shah before a live audience in 1976 available as audio to download at {{cite web |url=http://ishk.net/sufis/shahaudio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328085109/http://ishk.net/sufis/shahaudio.html |archivedate=2010-03-28 |df= }}. Accessed March 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that the reading, rereading, discussion and interpretation of narratives in a group setting became a significant part of the activities in which the members of Shah's study circles engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He would say: ‘that person only wants a guru’, or ‘this person can’t be taught, because he isn’t ready yet to learn’. Those whom he accepted were directed to Sufi teaching-stories and other writing by the great masters – among them Omar Khayyam, Jalaluddin Rumi, Hakim Sanai, El Ghazali and Saadi of Shiraz."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Doris Lessing]]:
:"A real teaching story, whether thousands of years old, or new, goes far beyond the parables that are still part of our culture. A parable has a simple message: this means that. But in a Sufi teaching story, there may be layers of meaning, some of them not to be verbalized. Current ways of "teaching" literature in schools and universities may make it difficult for literary people to approach Sufi literature as it should be: Sufis do not pull apart a tale to find its meaning, but cite the case of the child who has dismantled a fly and, left with a heap of wings, a head, legs, asks "Where is the fly?" In other words, a student learns to use the mind in ways unfamiliar to us. They "soak themselves" in the material. They ignore the analytical approach, and the practice of memorizing and regurgitating. The meaning of a Sufi tale comes through contemplation, and may take years."&lt;ref name="Lessing1" /&gt;

==Folktales==
Shah described many of the [[Folklore|folktales]] widely dispersed across the world as teaching stories, writing in the introduction to one such tale, [[The Three Princes of Serendip#The lost camel|The Lost Camel]], collected in his ''[[World Tales]]'':

:"Most of the instrumental and interpretative function of the folktale have tended to be overlooked in the literature, which still usually concentrates upon origins, upon fragmentary beliefs enshrined in the tales, and upon the light which is cast by plots and treatments on the attitudes of the people among whom the story is told."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | first = Idries
  | title = World Tales
  | publisher = Octagon Press
  | year = 1991
  | pages = 336
  | isbn = 0-86304-036-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Without denying the entertainment or moral value in the stories, Shah emphasised that there is in such tales an often hidden dimension of instruction. Stories, such as those from the [[Thousand and One Nights]] and other collections of traditional myths and folktales, are considered to fall into this category. Modern examples (although maybe not generally recognized as such) are some of the stories that have been retold and adapted by [[Disney animated feature film source material#From folk tales, fairy tales or legends|Disney]]. These tales have been adapted and laid out in the simplest form of their wisdom, making them easily accessible for children in particular. As [[Robert Ornstein]] has written:

:"On the surface teaching stories often appear to be little more than fairy or folk tales. But they are designed to embody - in their characters, plots and imagery - patterns and relationships that nurture a part of the mind that is unreachable in more direct ways, thus increasing our understanding and breadth of vision, in addition to fostering our ability to think critically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2002/02-147.html|title= Robert Ornstein To Speak at Library of Congress on Afghan "Teaching-Stories" and the Brain|date= October 16, 2002 |publisher= Library of Congress|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fables==
Though a "moral" is appended to many fables, for instance [[Aesop's Fables|the fables]] of [[Aesop]], Shah insisted that there were levels of meaning hidden in them that lay beyond the merely didactic:
:"The fables of all nations provide a really remarkable example of this, because, if you can understand them at a technical level, they provide the most striking evidence of the persistence of a consistent teaching, preserved sometimes through mere repetition, yet handed down and prized simply because they give a stimulus to the imagination or entertainment for the people at large."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ishk.net/teaching-stories/ | title = The Teaching Story: Observations on the Folklore of Our "Modern" Thought | first = Idries| last = Shah| accessdate = 2017-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nasrudin stories ==
Shah published four books of tales of the [[Mulla Nasrudin]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin'', {{ISBN|0-86304-022-5}}, ''The Subtleties of the Inimitable Mulla Nasrudin'', {{ISBN|0-86304-021-7}}, ''[[The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin]]'', {{ISBN|0-86304-023-3}} and ''The World of Nasrudin'', {{ISBN|0-86304-086-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories are known throughout the [[Muslim world]]. Superficially, most of the stories may be told as jokes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and caravanserais of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasrudin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, but there is also the structure of the tale that functions as an analogy or metaphor for some aspect of human nature or learning.

{{quotation|A friend came to visit Nasrudin at home bringing a duck, and Nasrudin had it cooked to share with him. The next week someone called by, claiming to be the cousin of the man who had brought the duck. Nasrudin fed him. The week after that someone came claiming to be the friend of the cousin of the man who had brought the duck. Nasrudin fed him too. This continued, with the connection to the friend with the duck becoming more and more remote each time. Finally, when the next friend-of-cousin-of-friend-of-man-with-duck arrived, Nasrudin heated water up in a pot and then served it to the new guest. 
&lt;br /&gt;
"What's this?" said the man, tasting the hot water.
&lt;br /&gt;
"This," said Nasrudin, "is the soup of the soup of the soup of the duck."}}

==Worldwide dispersal and diffusion==
It is impossible to say how far back in time teaching stories go. Shah's collection ''[[World Tales]]'' includes the [[Tale of Two Brothers]], an [[ancient Egypt]]ian story from around the 12th century BC. [[Jataka tales]] from India as far back as the 3rd century BC have travelled westwards via the [[Panchatantra]] and have long been recognised as having a teaching function. An example is [[The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal]] which made its first appearance In Europe some 900 years ago in [[Petrus Alphonsi]]'s collection of tales, the ''Disciplina Clericalis'' (which, according to E.L. Ranelagh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Ranelagh
  | first = E.L.
  | title = The Past we Share
  | publisher = Quartet Books Ltd
  | year = 1979
  | location = London, Melbourne, New York
  | page = 165
  | isbn = 0-7043-2234-X}} A cleric here could mean an educated layman as well as an ecclesiastic.&lt;/ref&gt; could be translated as "a course of study for the reader").

The [[blind men and an elephant]] is a well-known tale that has been used among [[Jainism|Jainists]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] in India, as well as by [[Persian people|Persian]] Sufi writers [[Sanai]] of [[Ghazni]], [[Attar of Nishapur]] and [[Rumi]]. Shah's ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'', a collection of narratives gathered from classical [[Sufi]] texts and oral sources spanning a period from the 7th to the 20th centuries, gives Sanai's version.

Parallels with other religious traditions are obvious, wherever narratives are used instructionally rather than to generate or perpetuate belief or conformity. Examples might be [[Zen]] [[koan]]s,  Hasidic tales, and the [[parables]] of [[Jesus]]. Sometimes, as in The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal or The Blind men and an elephant, versions of the same story are put to use.

==Some examples of teaching stories==
*The [[Pancatantra]]
*Narratives from Sufi writers, to name a few: [[Sanai]], [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], [[Rumi]], [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], [[Amir Khusrow]]
*Stories from the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' such as [[The Franklin's Tale]], [[The Pardoner's Tale]] and [[The Merchant's Tale]]
*The [[Hymn of the Pearl]]
*[[Cinderella]]
*Tales from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''
*[[Aladdin]]
*Myths such as ''[[Cupid and Psyche]]''
*Tales collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], such as [[The Water of Life (German fairy tale)|The Water of Life]]

{{Cleanup|date=February 2010}}
'''''The Transporters''''' is an animation series produced by Catalyst Pictures Ltd designed to help children with [[autism]] aged between two and eight years old recognise and understand emotions. 

It was developed by the Autism Research Centre at the [[University of Cambridge]] by a team led by Professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] and including Dr Ofer Golan. 

''The Transporters'' is based on the idea that children with autism may find faces confusing because they are unpredictable, because the autistic brain cannot cope with unpredictability. In Baron-Cohen's theory, children with autism are strong 'systemizers' and faces are hard to systemize. In contrast, children with autism have a preference for predictable systems. The Transporters therefore focuses on mechanical vehicles that only travel along tracks, because they are highly predictable systems. Grafted onto these animated vehicles are human faces. In this way, social skills teaching takes place in an [[autism friendly]] format.

A study &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/y4164n56855305p0/?p=86f98a5391de4cd185ed81fa3b570b6a&amp;pi=12 Enhancing Emotion Recognition in Children with Autism Spectrum Conditions: An Intervention Using Animated Vehicles with Real Emotional Faces]&lt;/ref&gt; published in the ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders'' found that after watching the DVD for 15 minutes a day for four weeks most children with ASC (autistic spectrum condition) caught up with typically developing children in their ability to recognise emotions on four different tasks.

== The series ==

''The Transporters'' DVD consists of 15 five-minute episodes, each featuring a key emotion. There are also 30 interactive quizzes and an accompanying booklet to reinforce learning.  In 2007, the series was nominated for a [[BAFTA]] award. 

The series features eight animated toy vehicles. Each has an actual human face so that viewers learn to recognise real rather than cartoon expressions.  All the expressions were verified by an independent panel before they were included in the series. 

There are two versions of the DVD, with different accents and vocabulary. The North American version is voiced by [[Kerry Shale]] and the British English version is voiced by [[Stephen Fry]]. 

''The Transporters'' was originally commissioned by Culture Online, which was part of the UK government’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

'''''Things the Grandchildren Should Know''''' is an [[autobiography]] by [[Mark Oliver Everett]], the front man of the [[independent music|independent rock band]] [[Eels (band)|Eels]]. Everett spent a year writing the book&lt;ref name="dfb"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/Eels,8964 |title=Eels "If you’re going to boo somebody, you better know who you’re booing, bitch."  |publisher=Tiny Mix Tapes |date=May 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the release of the retrospectives ''[[Meet The Eels: Essential Eels, Vol. 1 (1996–2006)]]'' and ''[[Useless Trinkets: B-Sides, Soundtracks, Rarities and Unreleased 1996–2006]]'' and the composition of 2009's ''[[Hombre Lobo]].''

==Title==
The book shares its title with the closing track from the Eels' 2005 album ''[[Blinking Lights and Other Revelations]].'' In that song Everett takes on the [[persona]] of an elderly grandfather sharing the wisdom he has learned about life shortly before his death. The parallels between the song and the book are loose, as Everett is much younger than his song persona. He remarks in the final chapter the irony of the title given that he has no children, let alone grandchildren. The German edition's title “Glückstage in der Hölle”&lt;ref&gt;JohnDoe: [http://www.tcboyle.de/wordpress/?p=256 Mark Oliver Everett: Glückstage in der Hölle], review (German)&lt;/ref&gt; translates to "Lucky days in hell", resembling the name of the Eels' song ''[[Your Lucky Day in Hell]].''

==Marketing==
Unusually for a modern autobiography, neither inside the book nor the cover (first edition) includes photos of the author. Likewise, the cover refers to Everett's full name, rather the better-known moniker '''E'''. The front and back cover avoid referring to his status as the front man of the Eels. Readings of portions of the text occurred during live sets during the 2008 Eels tour. Eels guitarist [[Jeff Lyster|The Chet]] would later read the [[audiobook]] edition.

==Reception==
''Things the Grandchildren Should Know'' received generally positive reviews from critics from the United States—such as [[Joel Stein]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eelstheband.com/grandchildren.php |title=Eels: Official band website |publisher=[[Mark Oliver Everett]] |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as well as British press—including ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/09/featuresreviews.guardianreview9|title=Lives less ordinary|first=Claire|last=Armitstead|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=2008-02-09|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Independent]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/things-the-grandchildren-should-know-by-mark-oliver-everett-773529.html|title=Things the Grandchildren Should Know, By Mark Oliver Everett

A rare skill in the writers of memoirs," and sums up the book as "a subtle, touching thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article3159966.ece|title=Things the Grandchildren Should Know by Mark Oliver Everett|first=Antonia|last=Quirke|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date=2008-01-13 |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pete Townshend]]'s cover blurb calls it "[O]ne of the best books ever written by a contemporary artist." Everett's hometown press considered it "intellectual, wry and unflinching as it conveys complex emotions with simple, graceful language."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/19/entertainment/ca-eels19 |title=Mark Everett – E of Eels – unravels why his dad was so pained |author=Geoff Boucher |publisher=''[[L.

==Publication history==
After the initial British pressing, the book was released in the United States by [[Thomas Dunne Books]] and [[St. Martin's Press]] on October 14, 2008 ({{ISBN|978-0-312-38513-2}}). An audio edition of this book was released on [[cassette tape]], [[CD-ROM]], and [[Compact Disc]] by [[Blackstone Audio]] on November 30, 2008.

The '''Tree of physiology''' is a Tibetan [[Thangka]] depicting [[human physiology]] and certain [[pathology|pathological]] transformations.

==Epistemology==
[[Tibetan medicine]] had developed a rather sophisticated knowledge of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], which was acquired from their long-standing experience with human [[dissection]]. [[Tibetans]] out of necessity, had long ago adopted the practice of ''celestial burial'' (also [[Sky burial]]) because of [[Tibet]]'s harsh terrain in most of the year and deficit of wood for [[cremation]]. This form of [[Sky burial]], still practiced, begins with a ritual [[dissection]] of the deceased, and then followed by the feeding of the parts to [[Vulture]]s on the hill tops. Both the location of the ritual dissection and the place of feeding is understood as the [[charnel ground]]. Over time, [[anatomical]] knowledge found its way into [[Ayurveda]]&lt;ref&gt;The Roots of Ayurveda (Penguin Classics) by Various and Dominik Wujastyk (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and to an Iesser extent into [[China]]. As result, [[Tibet]] has become a home of the [[Buddhist]] medical centers Chogppori and Menchikhang (or Menhang),&lt;ref&gt;His Holiness the Dalai Lama: The Oral Biography by Deborah Hart Strober and Gerald S. Strober (2005) p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tao &amp; Dharma: Chinese Medicine &amp; Ayurveda by Robert Svoboda and Arnie Lade (1995) p.89&lt;/ref&gt; between the twelfth to sixteenth century A.D., where monks came to study even from foreign countries.

==Fisher donation==
Emily Fisher, a trustee at The [[American Museum of Natural History]], donated modern copies of a series of seventy-nine Tibetan [[Buddhist]] [[tangka]]s (religious paintings) that were originally commissioned in 1687 by the [[Lozang Gyatso, 5th Dalai Lama|fifth]] [[Dalai Lama]]'s regent, [[Sangye Gyamtso]] (1653-1705).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tibetan Medical Paintings: Illustrations to the Blue Beryl Treatise of Sangye Gyamtso |first1=Gyurme |last1=Dorje | author-link1=Gyurme Dorje| first2=Yuri | last2=Parfionovitch |first3=Fernand |last3=Meyer| location=London |publisher=Serindia / Harry N Abrams |date= 1992 |isbn= 0810938618}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had the paintings done to elucidate his commentary on the "Four [[Tantras]]" (Tib. ''Gyushi'')&lt;ref&gt;The Quintessence Tantras of Tibetan Medicine by Barry Clark (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; - eighth-century [[vajrayana|Tantric]] [[Buddhist]] texts that form the foundation of Tibetan medicine and cover physiology, pathology, diagnosis, and cure. With such depictions, the [[Tantric Buddhist]] system of healing&lt;ref&gt;Tibetan Book of Healing by Lobsang Rapgay (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; could, according to [[Sangye Gyamtso]], be "perceived by everybody, from the scholar to the child, as dearly as one would see a [[myrobalan]]&lt;ref&gt;Eating And Healing: Traditional Food As Medicine (Crop Science) (Crop Science) by Andrea Pieroni and Lisa Leimer Price (2006) pp.346-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tao &amp; Dharma: Chinese Medicine &amp; Ayurveda by Robert Svoboda and Arnie Lade (1995) p.90&lt;/ref&gt; (the foremost healing plant in the Tibetan tradition) held in the palm of one's hand."

==Art history==
The original set of these [[thangka]]s, which were kept in [[Lhasa]], were destroyed by the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese military]] in 1959, but these recent copies, based on three surviving sets, were painted over the course of seven years by [[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] atelier Romio Shrestha,&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Art of Healing by lan Baker, Dalai Lama, Romio Shrestha, and Deepak Chopra (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; who followed religious and artistic conventions in copying the seventeenth-century originals. Shrestha's paintings on cloth, which are filled with astonishing renditions of a variety of physical conditions and illnesses, have been digitally photographed and incorporated into the Museum of Natural History, [http://anthro.amnh.org/anthro.html Division of Anthropology's] image database.

'''Twine''' is an [[online marketplace]] and network that connects creative freelancers in music, design and film to buyers. Twine rebranded from Clowdy in January 2016 with a marketplace focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seedcamp-backed Twine launches marketplace for creatives|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twine/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester entrepreneurs secure £350,000 for tech start-up Twine|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/manchester-entrepreneurs-secure-350000-tech-10766922|publisher=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twine allows creative freelancers to tag collaborators on a creative project, enabling all those who worked on it to receive credit and build a portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Professional Hub for Creators and their Crew|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/10/30/clowdy-professional-hub-content-creators-director-intern/|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twine also has portfolio feature that has no file upload limits and removes the common restriction of only allowing one media type on the site by encouraging quality creative content regardless of format. It has been described as the LinkedIn of the creative industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Could Clowdy Be The LinkedIn Of The Creative Industry?|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2014/10/could-clowdy-be-the-linkedin-of-the-creative-industry.html|publisher=HypeBot|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site serves the same interface and platform for both of its users, namely artists (musicians, filmmakers, designers, animators), and buyers who commission the users services. Twine users can post project briefs that creatives can work on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I post a project brief?|url=http://help.twine.fm/customer/en/portal/articles/2327642-how-do-i-post-a-project-brief-|publisher=Twine help|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also can follow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to become a recommended follower|url=http://blog.clowdy.com/become-recommended-follower/|publisher=Clowdy Blog|accessdate=22 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060807/http://blog.clowdy.com/become-recommended-follower/|archivedate=23 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; other users of the site and this forms the backbone of the sharing element of the site.

Twine's office is located in Manchester's Northern Quarter.

In July 2014, Twine, was voted as Winner of the UK Creative Business Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Creative Business Cup UK Winner and Clowdy.com Co-Founder Stuart Logan|url=http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/story/interview-creative-business-cup-uk-winner-and-clowdy.com-co-founder-stuart-logan|publisher=Creative England|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
