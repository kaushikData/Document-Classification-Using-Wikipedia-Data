Used in [[perfumery]] and [[aromatherapy]], '''absolutes''' are similar to [[essential oil]]s. They are concentrated, highly [[aroma compound|aromatic]], oily mixtures extracted from plants. Whereas essential oils are produced by [[distillation]], [[boiling]] or [[Expeller pressing|pressing]], absolutes are produced through [[solvent extraction]], or more traditionally, through [[enfleurage]].

== Production ==
First, plant material is extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent, such as [[hexane]], to yield a [[Concrete (perfumery)|concrete]]. The concrete is then extracted with [[ethanol]]. The ethanol extract is cooled (e.g., to -15 °C) to solidify waxes, and [[cold filtration|cold filtered]] to yield a liquid extract. When the ethanol evaporates, an oil &amp;mdash; the absolute &amp;mdash; is left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=Arza Seidel et al. | author=K. Hüsnü Can Başer et al. | chapter=Essential Oils | title=Kirk-Othmer Chemical Technology of Cosmetics | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-118-40692-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the absolute was obtained by [[enfleurage]], where the resulting [[pommade]] was extracted with ethanol to yield the absolute.

==Character and use==
Some raw materials are either too delicate or too inert to be steam-distilled and can only yield their aroma through solvent extraction. Examples of these are [[jasmine]] and [[beeswax]]. Absolutes in demand include [[rose]], [[jasmine]], [[tuberose]], [[Narcissus jonquilla|jonquil]], [[ylang-ylang]], [[mimosa]], [[boronia]], [[lavender]], [[lavandin]], [[geranium]], [[clary sage]], [[Violet (flower)|violet]], [[oak moss]], [[tonka bean]].

[[Rose oil]], [[jasmine]] absolute, [[tuberose]] absolute, [[orris root]] oil, [[ambrette seeds]] oil, [[angelica root]] oil, and [[orange flower oil]] are valuable and expensive fragrance and flavor ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Karl-Georg Fahlbusch | contribution=Flavors and Fragrances | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | page=83|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual solvents may remain in the absolutes. Therefore, some absolutes are considered undesirable for [[aromatherapy]].{{Fact|date=May 2010}}

'''AliExpress''' is an [[online retail]] service based in China that is owned by [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://service.alibaba.com/buyer/faq_detail/12320786.htm|title=Alibaba.com Help Center|website=service.alibaba.com|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched in 2010, it is made up of small businesses in China and elsewhere, such as Singapore, that offer products to international online buyers. It is the most visited e-commerce website in Russia and was the 10th most popular website in Brazil.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chinacheckup.com/blogs/articles/what-is-aliexpress|title=What is Aliexpress?|first=China|last=Checkup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It facilitates small businesses to sell to customers all over the world, and one can find almost anything for sale. It is more accurately compared to [[eBay]], as sellers are independent, using AliExpress as a host to sell to consumers and other businesses.

Sellers on AliExpress can be either companies or individuals. AliExpress is different from Amazon because it acts only as an e-commerce platform and doesn’t sell products directly to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/safe-shop-aliexpress/|title=AliExpress Is Cheap, But Is It Safe to Shop There?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It directly connects Chinese businesses with buyers. The main difference from the Chinese shopping site [[Taobao]] is that AliExpress is aimed primarily at international buyers mostly in the United States, Russia, Brazil and Spain.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
[[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] is using AliExpress to expand its reach outside of Asia and challenge online giants like Amazon and eBay.
AliExpress is using affiliate marketing to find new consumers.

== History ==
AliExpress started as a [[business-to-business]] buying and selling portal. It has since expanded to [[business-to-consumer]], [[consumer-to-consumer]], [[cloud computing]], and payment services, as well. AliExpress is currently available in the languages English, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Polish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Customers outside of the country boundaries for these languages are automatically served the English version of the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://alixblog.com/en/history-aliexpress-alibaba/|title=A Brief History of Jack Ma, Alibaba and AliExpress|date=2016-03-23|work=Alixblog|access-date=2017-05-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restrictions ==
AliExpress doesn't allow ''customers'' in [[mainland China]] to buy from the platform, even though all ''retailers'' are mostly Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Affiliates ==
AliExpress has a popular [[affiliate marketing]] program where partners are rewarded for sending visitors to the site with a commission on sales.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8023">'''Business intelligence software''' is a type of [[application software]] designed to retrieve, analyze, transform and report data for [[business intelligence]].  The applications generally read data that has been previously stored, often - though not necessarily - in a [[data warehouse]] or [[data mart]].

==History==
===Development of business intelligence software===
The first comprehensive business intelligence systems were developed by [[IBM]] and [[Siebel Systems|Siebel]] (currently acquired by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) in the period between 1970 and 1990.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite news | last = | first =| title =History of Business Intelligence Software| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''business-intelligence.financesonline.com''| date =| url =https://business-intelligence.financesonline.com/#history | accessdate =28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite news | last = | first =| title =A Detailed Look At The History Of Business Intelligence Software| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''comparecamp.com''| date =| url =http://comparecamp.com/detailed-look-history-business-intelligence-software | accessdate =28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, small developer teams were emerging with attractive ideas, and pushing out some of the products companies still use nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/us/support/licensecodes/siebel/siebel-crm-bi-integration-166917.html "Integrating Oracle Business Intelligence / Siebel Analytics with Siebel CRM"], ''oracle.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, specialists and vendors organized a Multiway Data Analysis Consortium in [[Rome]], where they considered making data management and analytics more efficient, and foremost available to smaller and financially restricted businesses. By 2000, there were many professional reporting systems and analytic programs, some owned by top performing software producers in the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470238004.fmatter/pdf "Applied Multiway Data Analysis"], ''onlinelibrary.wiley.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud-hosted business intelligence software===
In the years after 2000, business intelligence software producers became interested in producing universally applicable BI systems which don’t require expensive installation, and could hence be considered by smaller and midmarket businesses which could not afford on premise maintenance. These aspirations emerged in parallel with the cloud hosting trend, which is how most vendors came to develop independent systems with unrestricted access to information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compudata.com/cloud-bi/ "Cloud BI: 5 Benefits of Cloud Business Intelligence"], ''compudata.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 onwards, the positive effects of cloud-stored information and data management transformed itself to a completely mobile-affectioned one, mostly to the benefit of decentralized and remote teams looking to tweak data or gain full visibility over it out of office. As a response to the large success of fully optimized uni-browser versions, vendors have recently begun releasing mobile-specific product applications for both [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/Mobile-business-intelligence-brings-benefits-and-barriers "Mobile business intelligence brings benefits -- and barriers"], ''searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com'',.&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud-hosted data analytics made it possible for companies to categorize and process large volumes of data, which is how we can currently speak of unlimited visualization, and intelligent decision making.

== Types ==
The key general categories of business intelligence applications are:
* [[Spreadsheets]]
* [[List of reporting software|Reporting and querying software]]: applications that extract, sort, summarize, and present selected data
* [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP)
* [[Dashboard (management information system)|Digital dashboards]]
* [[Data mining]]
* [[Business activity monitoring]]
* [[Data warehouse]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180726071809/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-warehouses-and-data-quality Exploring Data Warehouses and Data Quality] Published by Spotless Data Retrieved 15 May, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Local information systems]]
* [[Data cleansing]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171018181046/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-analysis Exploring Data Analysis] Published by Spotless Data Retrieved 15 May, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for spreadsheets, these tools are provided as standalone applications, suites of applications, components of [[Enterprise resource planning]] systems, [[application programming interface]]s or as components of software targeted to a specific industry. The tools are sometimes packaged into [[data warehouse appliance]]s.

'''Button copy''' is a deprecated physical design of [[road sign]]s in the [[United States]]. Round plastic [[retroreflectors|retroreflective]] buttons made of transparent plastic are placed in rows following the contours of sign legend elements, usually painted white, such as letters, numbers, arrows, and borders. In daylight, the buttons visually blend with the white sign legend elements and so are minimally conspicuous. At night, light from each approaching vehicle's [[headlamp]]s strikes the retroreflective buttons and is reflected back towards the eyes of the vehicle's driver. Thus the sign is made sufficiently conspicuous and legible for adequately fast and accurate recognition and interpretation by drivers.

Button copy is no longer manufactured; technologically it has been supplanted by [[retroreflective sheeting]] made by various manufacturers in numerous colors and grades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trafficsign.us/signsheet.html Retroreflective Sheetings Used for Sign Faces]&lt;/ref&gt; As state departments of transportation increasingly stopped specifying button copy signs in favor of signs made with sheeting, it became uneconomic to maintain production of the materials and supplies to make button copy signs. The last state to specify button copy signs was [[Arizona]], which switched to sheeting in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/misc.transport.road/msg/3d4e957b8741f740 Farewell to Button Copy]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5720">'''Cognitive infocommunications''' ('''CogInfoCom''')&lt;ref name="CICwebsite"&gt;[http://www.coginfocom.hu Cognitive infocommunications]&lt;/ref&gt; investigates the link between the research areas of [[infocommunications]] and the [[cognitive science]]s, as well as the various engineering applications which have emerged as the synergic combination of these sciences.

The primary goal of CogInfoCom is to provide a systematic view of how [[cognitive process]]es can co-evolve with infocommunications devices so that the capabilities of the [[human brain]] may not only be extended through these devices, irrespective of [[geographical distance]], but may also interact with the capabilities of any [[Artificial cognition|artificially cognitive system]]. This merging and extension of cognitive capabilities is targeted towards engineering applications in which artificial and/or natural [[cognitive system]]s are enabled to work together more effectively.

Two important dimensions of cognitive infocommunications are the '''mode''' of communication and the '''type''' of communication.
The mode of communication refers to the actors at the two endpoints of communication:

* '''Intra-cognitive communication''': [[information transfer]] occurs between two cognitive beings with equivalent cognitive capabilities (e.g.: between two humans).
* '''Inter-cognitive communication''': [[information transfer]] occurs between two cognitive beings with different cognitive capabilities (e.g.: between a human and an artificially cognitive system).

The type of communication refers to the type of information that is conveyed between the two communicating entities, and the way in which this is done:

* '''Sensor-sharing communication''': entities on both ends use the same [[sensory modality]] to perceive the communicated information.
* '''Sensor-bridging communication''': [[sensory information]] obtained or experienced by each of the entities is not only transmitted, but also transformed to an appropriate and different sensory modality.
* '''Representation-sharing communication''': the same [[information representation]] is used on both ends to communicate information.
* '''Representation-bridging communication''': sensory information transferred to the receiver entity is filtered and/or adapted so that a different information representation is used on the two ends.

==Remarks==

#A sensor-sharing application of CogInfoCom brings novelty to traditional infocommunications in the sense that it can convey any kind of signal normally perceptible through the actor's senses (i.e., without a distance to communicate across) to the other end of the communication line. The transferred information may describe not only the actor involved in the communication, but also the environment in which the actor is located. The key determinant of sensor-sharing communication is that the same sensory modality is used to perceive the sensory information on the receiving end of communication as would be used if the two actors were on the same end (in which case there would be no need for infocommunication).
#Sensor bridging can in cases reflect not only the way in which the information is conveyed (i.e., by changing sensory modality), but also the kind of information that is conveyed. Whenever the transferred information type is imperceptible to the receiving actor due to the lack of an appropriate sensory modality (e.g., because its cognitive system is incompatible with the information type) the communication of information will necessarily occur through sensor bridging.
#A CogInfoCom application can be regarded as an instance of representation sharing even if it bridges between different sensors. For example, if text is conveyed to a blind person using Braille writing, the tactile sensory modality is used instead of vision, but the representation still consists of a linear succession of textual elements which represent individual characters in the alphabet. By the same token, a CogInfoCom application can be regarded as representation bridging even if it uses sensor sharing.

The first draft definition of CogInfoCom was given in "Cognitive Infocommunications: CogInfoCom".&lt;ref name = "CogInfoCom_2010"&gt;Baranyi P, Csapo A (2010). "Cognitive Infocommunications: CogInfoCom". ''11th IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics'', Budapest, Hungary.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition was finalized based on the paper with the joint participation of the Startup Committee at the 1st [[International Workshop on Cognitive Infocommunications]], held in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] in 2010.  A recent overview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baranyi|first1=Péter|last2=Csapo|first2=Adam|last3=Sallai|first3=Gyula|title=Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom)|date=2015|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-19607-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-19608-4|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319196077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further information can be found in,&lt;ref name = "CogInfoCom_AP"&gt;Baranyi P, Csapo A (2012).

The '''Computing Technology Industry Association''' ('''CompTIA'''), a non-profit [[Industry trade group|trade association]], issuing [[professional certification]]s for the [[information technology]] (IT) industry. It is considered one of the IT industry's top trade associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://sync-magazine.com/2015/comptia/| title=CompTIA's Update Ready to Install| author=Peter Fabris| publisher=Sync Magazine| date=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in Downers Grove, Illinois, CompTIA issues vendor-neutral professional certification in over 120 countries. The organization releases over 50 industry studies annually to track industry trends and changes. Over 2.2&amp;nbsp;million people have earned CompTIA certifications since the association was established.&lt;ref name=naper&gt;{{cite web| url=http://napervillemagazine.com/2016/08/ceo-profile-todd-thibodeaux/| title=CEO Profile – Todd Thibodeaux| author=Mark Zonca| date=August 2016| publisher=Naperville Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CompTIA was created in 1982 as the Association of Better Computer Dealers (ABCD).&lt;ref name=dummies&gt;{{cite book| title=Getting a Networking Job For Dummies| author=Peter H. Gregory, Bill Hughes| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABCD later changed its name to the Computing Technology Industry Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://theartofservice.com/abcd-to-comptia-explaining-the-history-of-comptia-security-training.html| title=ABCD to CompTIA Explaining the History of CompTIA Security Training| date=November 5, 2009| publisher=The Art of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, CompTIA moved into its world headquarters in Downers Grove, Illinois. The building was designed to meet LEED CI Certification standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/project-gallery/comptia-the-computing-technology-industry-association-inc| title=CompTIA: The Computing Technology Industry Association Inc.| date=April 27, 2012| publisher=The Journal of American Institute of Architects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CompTIA portal moved to a hybrid version of the open-access model in April 2014 with exclusive content for due-paying members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://associationsnow.com/2014/04/comptia-opts-new-open-access-membership-model/|title=CompTIA Opts for New Open-Access Membership Model: Associations Now|website=associationsnow.com|access-date=2017-01-04|date=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/news/2240217375/CompTIA-adds-free-open-access-option-to-membership-structure|title=CompTIA adds free open-access option to membership structure|newspaper=SearchITChannel|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move expanded the organization's reach to engage a broader, more diverse set of members and within a year, CompTIA's membership grew from 2,050 members to more than 50,000 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.asaecenter.org/resources/articles/an_plus/2015/october/from-2000-to-50000-lessons-learned-from-comptias-openaccess-membership-model|title=From 2,000 to 50,000: Lessons Learned From CompTIA's Open-Access Membership Model|newspaper=ASAE|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the close of 2016, the organization boasted more than 100,000 members worldwide.

CompTIA launched the Dream IT program in 2014 to provide resources for girls and women in the United States interested in the IT industry. In October 2015, the program was expanded into the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wearethecity.com/comptia-brings-dream-it-programme-to-uk-to-inspire-girls-and-create-role-models/| title=CompTIA brings Dream IT programme to UK to inspire girls and create role models| date=October 26, 2015| publisher=We Are The City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skillsboost, CompTIA's online resource for schools, was launched in June 2015. It contained resources for students, parents and teachers to promote the importance of computer skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2414571/comptia-launches-skillsboost-website-to-entice-more-students-into-it| title=CompTIA launches Skillsboost website to entice more students into IT| author=Ronald Moore-Colyer| publisher=V3| date=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2015/06/24/comptia-launches-online-resource-for-students-interested-in-it-careers.aspx?admgarea=News1| title=CompTIA Launches Online Resource for Students Interested in IT Careers| author=Joshua Bolkan| date=June 24, 2015| publisher=The Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; CompTIA held its first annual ChannelCon Vendor Summit in 2015. The Vendor Summit is exclusive to people attending ChannelCon, the industry's premier conference for collaboration, education and networking. It addresses issues within the IT industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bsminfo.com/doc/comptia-channelcon-vendor-summit-examines-channel-0001| title=CompTIA ChannelCon 2016 Vendor Summit Examines How To Thrive in the IT Channel| date=June 15, 2016| publisher=Business Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2017, CompTIA launched an IT professional association built on its acquisition of the Association of Information Technology Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/comptia-launches-professional-association-to-help-fill-skills-gap-in-it/| title=CompTIA launches professional association to help fill skills gap in IT| author=Conner Forrest| date=January 9, 2017| publisher=TechRepublic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.channelpronetwork.com/news/comptia-create-new-association-it-professionals| title=CompTIA to Create New Association For IT Professionals| author=Rich Freeman| publisher=ChannelPro Network| date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification expiration==
Previously, CompTIA marketed its flagship A+, Network+ and Security+ certifications as being valid for a lifetime. In January 2011, CompTIA changed the status of these certifications so that they would expire every three years. Under this proposal, certified individuals would have to re-certify for the exams or pay a yearly maintenance fee for a CEU (Continuing Education Units) system. CompTIA modified the guidelines so that only certificates received after January 1, 2011, would need to be renewed every three years; however, a certain amount of documented hours geared towards use of the certification will automatically renew the certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/01/comptia-backs-down-past-certs-remain-valid-for-life.ars |title=CompTIA backs down; past certs remain valid for life |first=Nate |last=Anderson |date=January 26, 2010 |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The un-expirable certificates, issued before 2011, are officially called Good-for-Life, and getting a more updated (and expirable) certification does not replace the Good-for-Life one – the professional can have both.&lt;ref&gt;[https://help.comptia.org/hc/en-us/articles/115005364303-Good-for-Life-Certifications?tracking=help/continuing-education/good-for-life Good-for-Life Certifications]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Compact Cassette''' ('''DCC''') is a [[magnetic tape sound recording]] format introduced by [[Philips]] and [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] in late 1992 and marketed as the successor to the standard [[analog signal|analog]] [[Compact Cassette]]. It was also a direct competitor to [[Sony]]'s [[MiniDisc]] (MD), but neither format toppled the then-ubiquitous [[analog signal|analog]] cassette despite their technical superiority. Another competing format, the [[Digital Audio Tape]] (DAT) had by 1992 also failed to sell in large quantities (although it was established in recording studios)—DCC was envisaged as a less expensive alternative to DAT. DCC shares a similar form factor to analog compact cassettes, and DCC recorders can play back either type of cassette. This [[backward compatibility]] allowed users to adopt digital recording without rendering their existing tape collections completely obsolete.

== History ==
[[Image:DCCplayer.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Philips DCC player]]
DCC signalled the parting of ways of [[Philips]] and [[Sony]], who had worked together successfully on the standard [[Compact disc|Compact Disc]], [[CD-ROM]], and [[CD-i]] before. Based on the success of [[Digital Audio Tape]] in professional environments, both companies saw a market for a new consumer-oriented digital audio recording system that would be less expensive and perhaps less fragile. Sony decided to create the entirely new [[MiniDisc]] format (based on their experience with [[magneto-optical]] recording and Compact Disc) while Philips decided on a tape format that was compatible with their earlier analog Compact Cassette format.

DCC, initially referred to as S-DAT (stationary-head digital audio tape, as opposed to R-DAT—rotary-head digital audio tape),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technofileonline.com/texts/newtapeformats91.html "As new digital audio tape formats shape up, the analog cassette keeps its lead", Al Fasoldt, The Syracuse Newspapers, 1991.] Retrieved 2017-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in cooperation with [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]], and the first DCC recorders, were introduced at the [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] in [[Chicago]] in May, 1992&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-05-22/entertainment/9202150851_1_lcd-projection-tv-ces-home-theater Consumer Electronics Show Carries A World`s Fair Air], Chicago Tribune, 1992-05-22. Retrieved 2017-01-16&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[:nl:Firato|Firato]] consumer electronics show in [[Amsterdam]] in September 1992. At that time, not only Philips and [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] (brand of Matsushita) announced DCC recorders but also other brands such as [[Grundig]] and [[Marantz]] (both related to Philips at the time).

More recorders and players were introduced by Philips and other manufacturers in the following years, including some portable players and recorders as well as in-dash DCC/radio combinations for automotive use.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

At the HCC-dagen computer fair in [[Utrecht]], Netherlands, on November 24, 25, and 26, 1995, Philips presented the DCC-175 portable recorder that can be connected to an [[IBM]]-compatible [[personal computer|PC]] using the "PC-link" cable. This was the only DCC recorder that can be connected to and controlled by a computer, and it was only ever available in the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Philips marketed the DCC format in Europe, the United States, and Japan. According to the newspaper article that announced the demise of DCC, DCC was more popular than MiniDisc in Europe (especially in the Netherlands).&lt;ref name="Demise"&gt;[http://xs4all.goudsm.it/dcc_is_dead.txt Newspaper article on the demise of DCC]&lt;/ref&gt;

DCC was quietly discontinued in October 1996&lt;ref name="Demise"/&gt; after Philips admitted it had failed at achieving any significant market penetration with the format, and unofficially conceded victory to Sony. However, the MiniDisc format had not done very well either; the price of both systems had been too high for the younger market, and audiophiles rejected MD and DCC because in their opinion, the lossy compression deteriorated the audio quality too much.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-27/entertainment/ca-37950_1_74-minute-minidiscs "Sony Revives MiniDisc in Package Deal", LA Times 1996-08-27]. Retrieved 2017-1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 a documentary called [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_pfnrGqxwI&amp;t=43s DCC....There is still music left to write], will be released.  All parties involved, inventing, creating, managing and rejuvenating the DCC format will finally be able to share the true story about DCC.

== Technology ==
[[File:Platine et cassettes DCC.jpg|thumb|right|Hi-Fi-system-sized DCCs and recorder]]

===Magneto-resistive stationary heads===
DCC uses a 9-track [[magnetoresistance|magneto-resistive]] (MR) head for playback. The head is fixed to the mechanism of the recorder, unlike rotary heads that are used in [[helical scan]] systems such as DAT or [[VHS]] to increase head-to-tape speed. Because of the reduced number of moving parts, DCC decks are less sensitive to shock and vibration. And because of the dimensions that are so similar to analog compact cassettes, existing auto-reverse audio cassette recorder mechanisms can easily be adapted for use in DCC recorders simply by mounting a DCC head instead of only an analog head. In fact, Philips did this during development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchaudioclassics.nl/Philips_early_DCC_deck_prototype/ Philips Early DCC Deck Prototype], Dutch Audio Classics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magneto-resistive heads do not use iron so they do not build up residual magnetism. They never need to be demagnetized, and if a [[cassette demagnetizer]] is used on MR heads, they are easily damaged or destroyed.

Various head assemblies were used, according to the service manuals:
* Stationary DCC recorders (i.e. recorders meant for use in home stereo systems) such as the DCC-900 use a head assembly that has 9 (MR) playback heads and 9 (coil) recording heads for DCC, and two (MR) heads for playing analog compact cassettes. This type of head assembly was designed to be rotated by the mechanism when the recorder/player switched from side A to side B.
* Playback-only portable players such as the DCC-130 and DCC-134 used head assemblies with 18 MR heads, nine for each side of the cassette. When playing analog cassettes, two of the MR heads are used. The head assembly is fixed to the mechanism and does not need to rotate for side B.
* Portable recorders such as the DCC-170 and DCC-175 use head assemblies with 18 MR heads for DCC playback, 18 coil heads for DCC recording, and 4 MR heads for analog playback (a total of 40 heads in one head assembly). This head assembly is fixed to the mechanism and does not need to rotate for side B.

===Tape specifications and PASC audio compression===
The tape speed of DCC is the same as for analog compact cassettes: {{convert|1+7/8|in|cm}} per second, DCCs use tape that is the same width as that from analog compact cassettes: 1/8 of an inch (3.175&amp;nbsp;mm). The tape that is used in production cassettes is chromium dioxide- or cobalt-doped ferric-oxide, 3-4&amp;nbsp;µm thick in a total tape thickness of 12&amp;nbsp;µm,&lt;ref name="Philips DCC page"&gt;[http://xs4all.goudsm.it/philips/dcc.html Philips DCC page] preserved as part of the [http://xs4all.goudsm.it/dcc-faq.html DCC FAQ page]&lt;/ref&gt; identical to the tape that was widely in use for video tapes.

Nine heads are used to read/write half the width of the tape; the other half of the width are used for the B-side. Eight of these tracks contain audio data, the ninth track is used for auxiliary information such as song titles and track markers, as well as markers to make the player switch from side A to side B (with or without winding towards the end of the tape first) and end-of-tape markers.

The (theoretical) maximum capacity of a DCC tape is 120 minutes, compared to 3 hours for DAT; however, no 120-minute tapes were ever produced. Also, because of the time needed for the mechanism to switch direction, there is always a short interruption in the audio between the two sides of the tape. DCC recorders can record from digital sources that use the [[S/PDIF]] standard, at sample rates of 32&amp;nbsp;kHz, 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz or 48&amp;nbsp;kHz, or they can record from analog sources at 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Because of the low tape speed, the achievable [[bit rate]] of DCC is limited. To compensate, DCC uses an [[audio data compression|audio compression]] [[codec]] based on [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer I]] (MP1) and termed PASC (precision adaptive sub-band coding). MPEG and PASC use digital filters to convert the audio into 32 frequency subbands, and then use adaptive allocation and scaling to decide how many bits should be assigned to represent each frequency band. When decoding, the subband bit stream is used to synthesize an uncompressed bit stream again. PASC lowers the typical bitrate of a CD recording of approximately 1.4&lt;!--44100*16*2=1411200--&gt; [[megabits]] per second to 384 [[kilobits]] per second, a compression ratio of around 4:1. The difference in quality between PASC and the 5:1 compression used by early versions of [[ATRAC]] in the original MiniDisc is largely a subjective matter.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

After adding system information (such as emphasis settings, SCMS information, time code) and adding [[Reed-Solomon error correction]] bits to the 384 kbit/s data stream, followed by [[8b/10b encoding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|4,620,311}}Method of transmitting information, encoding device for use in the method, and decoding device for use in the method, June 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting bit rate is 768 kbit/s, which is recorded onto the eight data tracks at 96 kbit/s per track in a checkered pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieri.net/Documenti/Documenti%20audio/Digital%20Compact%20Cassette%20(DCC)%20-%20Matsushita%20and%20Philips%20Develop%20New%20Standard.pdf Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) - Matsushita and Philips Develop New Standard]. Retrieved 2017-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Philips webpage,&lt;ref name="Philips DCC page"/&gt; it is possible for a DCC recorder to recover all missing data from a tape even if one of the 8 audio tracks is completely unreadable, or if all tracks are unreadable for 1.45&amp;nbsp;mm (about 0.03 seconds).

===Auxiliary track===
On prerecorded tapes, the information about album artist, album title, and track titles and lengths is recorded in the auxiliary ninth track continuously for the length of the entire tape. This makes it possible for players to recognize immediately what the tape position is and how to get to any of the other tracks (including which side of the tape to turn to), as soon as a tape is inserted and playback is started, regardless of whether the tape was rewound before inserting or not.

On user tapes, a track marker is recorded at the beginning of every track, so that it is possible to skip and repeat tracks automatically. The markers are automatically recorded when a silence is detected during an analog recording, or when a track marker is received in the S/PDIF signal of a digital input source (this track marker is automatically generated by CD players). It is possible to remove these markers (to "merge tracks"), or add extra markers (to "split tracks") without rerecording the audio. Furthermore, it is possible to add markers afterwards that will signal the end of the tape or the end of the tape side, so that during playback, the player will stop the mechanism or fast-forward to the end of the A-side or will switch from A-side to B-side immediately.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

On later generations of recorders, it is possible to make a third tape type, referred to by service documentation as "super-user tapes". The DCC-730 and DCC-951 make it possible to enter title information for each track, which is recorded on the auxiliary track after the start-of-track marker. Because the title information is only stored in one place, so unlike prerecorded tapes where users can see the names of all tracks on a tape, it is not possible to see tracks names of any other track than the one that is currently playing.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

The three tape types (prerecorded, standard-user, and super-user) are compatible with all recorders and it is impossible (and unnecessary) to recognize the difference between a standard-user tape and a super-user tape without playing it. There are some interesting minor compatibility problems with text on super-user tapes; for example:
* On stationary recorders that have simple [[fourteen-segment display]]s, all track information is converted to upper case. They are capable of displaying symbols that are impossible to enter with their own track information editors (such as the apostrophe), but they are unable to show lower-case characters.
* The Philips DCC-822/DCC-824 car stereo with DCC player has a full [[dot matrix display|dot-matrix text display]] which can display upper-case and lower-case titles from prerecorded tapes as well as super-user tapes.
* Later-generation portable recorders DCC-170 and DCC-175 are capable of displaying text information from prerecorded tapes, but not from super-user tapes. The DCC-175 is capable of writing and reading the text information to/from a super-user tape via the PC, but does not show the text information on the display.

===Copy protection===
All DCC recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System|SCMS]] copy-protection system, which uses two [[bit]]s in the S/PDIF digital audio stream and on tape to differentiate between protected vs. unprotected audio, and between original vs. copy:
* Recording digitally from a source marked "protected" and "original" (produced by an audio CD or a prerecorded DCC, for example) was allowed, but the recorder will change the "original" bit to the "copy" state on the new tape to prevent copying of the copy.
* Recording digitally from a source marked "unprotected" is also allowed; the "original/copy" marker is ignored.
* Recording digitally from a source marked "protected" and "copy" is not allowed: the record button will not work and any ongoing recordings will stop, and an error message is shown on the display.

Analog recording is not restricted: tapes recorded from analog source are marked "unprotected". The only limitation to analog recording on DCC as compared to that on DAT recorders is that the [[analog-to-digital converter|A/D converter]] is fixed to a sample frequency of 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz. On the DCC-175 portable recorder it is possible to circumvent the SCMS protection by copying audio to the hard disk and then back to another tape, using the DCC Studio program.

===Cassettes and cases===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Philips Digital Compact Cassette open.JPG|thumb|right|DCC with the shutter manually opened]]
DCCs are similar to compact cassettes, except that there are no "bulges" where the tape-access holes are located. The top side of a DCC is flat and there are no access holes for the hubs on there (they are not required because auto-reverse is a standard feature on all DCC decks), so this side can be used for a bigger label than can be used on an analog compact cassette. A spring-loaded metal shutter similar to the shutters on 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch [[floppy disk]]s and MiniDiscs covers the tape access holes and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use. Cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that DCC recorders can tell a DCC apart from an analog compact cassette, and so they can tell what the length of a DCC tape is. Also, there is a sliding marker on the DCC to enable and disable recording. Unlike the break-away notches on analog compact cassettes and VHS tapes, this marker makes it easier to make a tape recordable again, and unlike on analog compact cassettes, the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side.

The cases that DCCs come in generally do not have the characteristic folding mechanism of those for analog compact cassettes. Instead, DCC cases tend to be simply plastic boxes that are open on one of the short sides. The front side has a hole that is almost the size of the cassette, so that any label on the cassette is exposed even when the cassette is in its case. This allows the user to slide the cassette into and out of the case with one hand, and it reduced production costs, especially for prerecorded cassettes, because a label is needed only for the cassette rather than for the case. Format partner Matsushita does, however, produce blank cassettes (under their Panasonic brand) with a clam-shell-style case. Because DCCs have no "bulges" near the tape access holes, there is more space in the case behind the cassette to insert, for example, a booklet for a prerecorded tape, or a folded up card on which users could write the contents of the tape. In spite of the differences, the outside measurements of the standard DCC cases are exactly identical to the cases of analog compact cassettes, so they can be used in existing storage systems. The Matsushita-designed clam-shell case is slightly thinner than an analog compact cassette case is.

===Data recording===
There is only one DCC recorder that has the capability of being connected to and controlled by a computer: the DCC-175. It is a portable recorder that was developed by Marantz in Japan (unlike most of the other Philips recorders which were developed in the Netherlands and Belgium), and looks very similar to the other portables available from Philips and Marantz at the time: the DCC-134 and the DCC-170. The DCC-175 was sold only in the Netherlands, and was available separately or in a package with the "PC-link" data cable which can be used to connect the recorder to a [[parallel port]] of an [[IBM PC compatible|IBM-compatible PC]]. Only small quantities of both recorder and cable were made, leaving many people searching for one or both at the time of the demise of DCC.

The DCC-175 Service Manual&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://github.com/jacgoudsmit/DCC/blob/master/Documentation/Service%20Manuals/DCC170%20DCC175%20Service%20Manual.zip?raw=true DCC-175 Service Manual.] Retrieved 2017-01-24.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that in the recorder, the cable was connected to the [[I²S]] bus that carries the PASC bitstream, and it is also connected to a dedicated serial port of the microcontroller, to allow the PC to control the mechanism and to read and write auxiliary information such as track markers and track titles. The parallel port connector of the cable contains a custom chip created especially for this purpose by Philips Key Modules, as well as a standard [[random-access memory|RAM]] chip. Philips made no detailed technical information available to the public about the custom chip and therefore it is impossible for people who own a DCC-175 but no PC-link cable to make their own version of the PC-link cable.

The PC-link cable package included software consisting of:
* DCC Backup for Windows, a backup program
* DCC Studio, a sound recorder and editor for Windows
* A DCC tape database program that works together with DCC Studio

Philips also provided a DOS backup application via their [[bulletin board system|BBS]], and later on they provided an upgrade to the DCC Studio software to fix some bugs and provide better compatibility with Windows 95 which had come out just before the release of the DCC-175. The software also works with Windows 98 but not with any later versions of Windows.

The backup programs for DOS as well as Windows does not support long file names which had been introduced by Windows 95 just a few months before the release. Also, because the tape runs at its usual speed and data rate, it takes 90 minutes to record approximately 250 [[megabytes]] of uncompressed data. Other backup media common in those days are faster, have more capacity, and support long file names, so the DCC backup programs are relatively uninteresting for users.

The DCC Studio application, however, was a useful application that makes it possible to copy audio from tape to hard disk and vice versa, regardless of the SCMS status of the tape. This makes it possible to circumvent SCMS with DCC Studio. The program also allows users to manipulate the PASC audio files that were recorded to hard disk in various ways: they can change equalization settings, cut/copy and paste track fragments, and place and move audio markers and name those audio markers from the PC keyboard. It is possible to record a mix tape by selecting the desired tracks from a list, and moving the tracks around in a playlist. Then the user can click on the record button to copy the entire playlist back to DCC tape, while simultaneously recording markers (such as reverse and end-of-tape) and track titles. It is not necessary to record the track titles and tape markers separately (as you would do with a stationary recorder), and thanks to the use of a PC keyboard, it is possible to use characters in song titles that are not available when using a stationary machine's remote control.

The DCC Studio program uses the recorder as playback and recording device. Most PCs of that era do not have a sound card and none is needed either. Working with the PASC data directly without the need to compress and decompress, it also saves a lot of hard disk space, and most computers in that time would have had a hard time compressing and decompressing PASC data in real time anyway. However, many users complained that they would have liked to have the possibility of using uncompressed [[WAV file|WAV audio files]] with the DCC Studio program, and Philips responded by mailing a [[floppy disk]] to registered users, containing programs to convert a WAV file to PASC and vice versa. Unfortunately this software is extremely slow (it takes several hours to compress a few minutes of PCM music in a WAV file to PASC) but it was soon discovered that the PASC files are simply MPEG-1 Audio Layer I files that use an under-documented padding feature of the MPEG standard to make all frames the same length, so then it became easy to use other MPEG decoding software to convert PASC to [[pulse-code modulation|PCM]] and vice versa

=== DCC Revival ===
After YouTuber [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5I2hjZYiW9gZPVkvzM8_Cw Techmoan] released a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkGMJBqZawA&amp;t=491s video] in 2014 about the DCC format, it started a revival of interest in the format across the globe. The next year (2015) the [http://www.dccmuseum.com DCCMuseum] opened its doors in Redondo Beach, California. The DCCMuseum has kept most of the momentum going by releasing [https://www.dccmuseum.com/cassettes new albums] in 2017 and 2018 (in cooperation With [https://jeremyheiden.com/ Jeremy Heiden] and Causing Change Media) and is curated by Ralf Porankiewicz AKA DrDCC.

==Derivatives==
The technology of using stationary MR heads was later developed by [[OnStream]] for use as a data storage media for computers. MR heads are now also commonly used in [[hard disk drive|hard disks]], although hard disks now use the [[giant magnetoresistance|GMR]] variant, whereas DCCs use the earlier [[magnetoresistance#Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)|AMR]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Iefd6kCbFxsC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=dcc+gmr&amp;source=web&amp;ots=NcA78wFnIa&amp;sig=PAa7m29Ia1mWQNvP8NJas5d-zHA Magnetic Multilayers and Giant Magnetoresistance - Uwe Hartmann, R.

A derivative technology developed originally for DCC is now being used for filtering beer. Silicon wafers with micrometer-scale holes are ideal for separating yeast particles from beer. The beer flows through the silicon wafer leaving the yeast particles behind, which results in a very clear beer. The manufacturing process for the filters was originally developed for the read/write heads of DCC decks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6121-hi-fi-failure-helps-to-brighten-beer Hi-fi failure helps to brighten beer - New Scientist] Retrieved 2007-4-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="844">A '''disgorger''' is used in [[coarse fishing]] to remove a [[fish hook]] from deep inside the mouth of a fish that is not possible to reach using fingers alone. It is also known as the '''[[Unhooker]]''' or '''[[Hook remover]]'''. It is typically made of plastic or metal and is used on smaller fish. Larger fish that are hooked deep inside the mouth can be unhooked using a pair of [[forceps]] or a pair of [[long-nose pliers]].

== Usage ==
A disgorger is used by slipping the end over a tight line and sliding down to the bend of the hook. A push is then needed to remove the hook. Under the pressure of the line, the hook will tighten against the end of the disgorger and can be removed from the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4342171.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ETAOI keyboard''' is a text input software for touch screen-reliant devices. It is based on ETAOI method for coding.

The keyboard uses five keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Escribe de manera diferente con Morse Keyboard y ETAOI Keyboard|url=http://losensayos.com/tag/etaoi-keyboard/|publisher=LOS ENSAYOS|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters and signs are typed using single and multiple taps, or slides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Joe|title=Alternative Keyboard Shootout!|url=http://www.landofdroid.com/2012/alternative-keyboard-shootout/|publisher=Land of Droid|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are unique combinations of taps and slides for each character.

With no upper limit on the number of keys on which each combination is based, the keyboard can be used for typing an unlimited variety of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lund|first=Emmanuel|title=AndroidZoom|url=http://www.androidzoom.com/android_applications/tools/etaoi-keyboard-free-demo_bjopu.html|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combinations encompassing up to three keys are used for typing in Latin-derived alphabets.

==Name and mechanics==
ETAOI name is derived from the [[Letter frequency|5 most frequently used letters]] in English: e, t, a, o, i. These characters are typed using just single taps.

The same efficiency-driven approach has been followed when assigning meaningful combinations of taps and slides to all other letters, numbers and signs: the most frequently used ones are also the quickest to produce. This constitutes a radical departure from the QWERTY layout, where the position of specific letters remains unrelated to the frequency of their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karol|first=Manys|title=Jak pisać łatwiej, czyli rewolucja pięciu kolorowych klawiszy|journal=Bloomberg Businessweek Polska|date=16–29 April 2012|issue=8/12|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Because to its novel conceptual basis, ETAOI is particularly well suited for use with screens of limited size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=kschang|title=Android Soft Keyboard Alternatives: Comparing 48 different (free) input methods from ABC Keyboard to ZetaType for Droid|publisher=HubPages}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once mastered, its five keys allow for [[touch typing]] (typing without looking) commonly associated with physical keyboards. Top recorded speeds are currently 55 [[Wpm|words per minute]].

With all the keys presented as just one horizontal line placed at the screen’s bottom edge, the keyboard allows the viewing area to be used much more effectively as it usually takes only a third of the space required by QWERTY keyboard variants. The keys’ larger size results in a significantly reduced number of typing errors.

Other benefits include immediate access to characters other than letters without the need to recall additional screens, by simply applying the relevant combinations of taps and slides. In the same manner, the software can be used to quickly produce letters specific to only some Latin-derived alphabets. Languages currently supported are Spanish, German, French, Italian and Polish.

The keyboard also includes a suite of editing tools with in-built commands allowing to precisely select, copy and paste text.

==Learning==
Given its novelty, ETAOI keyboard is accompanied by a wide range of training materials. These aim to reduce the initial learning times to about 40–60 minutes.

''ETAOI alphabet'' is the recommended starting training programme. It helps the user memorize all the combinations, from the most frequently encountered to the least common ones.

''ETAOI speed'' helps the user learn how to type quicker, with the training material consisting of the most popular words, as well as [[pangram]]s (sentences using all letters of the alphabet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Android apps review|url=http://apk-apps.com/apk_app/120915_ETAOI_speed_EN.html|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
The keyboard is currently available on the [[Google Play]] store and includes versions for smart phones and tablet computers.

The '''Eclipse windmill''' was one of the more successful designs of windmill used to pump water in the nineteenth century [[United States]].  It was invented by Leonard Wheeler, a Presbyterian minister who was working among the [[Ojibwe]] on the south shore of Lake Superior.  Wheeler perfected the device on his missionary homestead for nearly two decades, unknown to the larger technological world.  In 1866 health issues forced him to move to [[Beloit, Wisconsin]], then a bustling industrial city, where  he was persuaded to patent the basic function of the device.  Although Wheeler died before he could witness the success of his invention, his sons carried on the legacy.  Some of the companies that succeeded the original Eclipse Windmill Company remain viable in the 21st century.

Leonard Hemenway Wheeler was born in [[Shrewsbury, MA]], on April 18, 1811.  His mother died when he was one month old.{{sfn|Wheeler|1914}}  He was raised by his father and an aunt in [[Bridport, VT]].  He attended college at [[Middlebury College]], where he graduated in 1837, and [[Andover Theological Seminary]], where he graduated in 1840.{{sfn|Larson|2005}}  Around this time he met and married Harriet Wood, similarly devout in her religious beliefs.  Since Leonard was already committed to missionary work among the [[Ojibwe]], the couple soon found themselves setting up a household at [[La Pointe, Wisconsin]] on [[Madeline Island]] in [[Wisconsin Territory]].{{sfn|Davidson|1895|p=233}}

Wheeler eventually became committed to the notion of helping the Ojibwe learn the agricultural skills needed to sustain themselves, especially since the fur trade, upon which they had been economically dependent for several generations, was declining dramatically.  The island was not conducive to farming, so Wheeler moved to the mainland, and established a home and mission, naming it [[Odanah]], the Ojibwe word for village.{{sfn|Davidson|1895|p=249}}  Many Ojibwe (there were around 1000 in the Chequamegon Bay region) were already semi-permanent residents of that location, because of wild rice fields at the mouth of the Bad River.  The Ojibwe name of the location was Kietiganing.{{sfn|Larson|2005|p=58}}

Wheeler originally built his first windmill for the purpose of pumping water out of a deep ravine up to his home.  He continually improved it over time, and it was eventually used for a variety of farming purposes such as grinding corn.{{sfn|Larson|2005|p=81}}

The hard winter life in the far north woods eventually took a toll on Wheeler.  In 1866 he moved his family to Beloit, where many of his professional colleagues lived and where he was able to find friendship and support for his family while he sought out an alternative career.{{sfn|Davidson|1895|p=250}}

==Patenting of the device==
After moving to Beloit a cousin from Indiana, Samuel Chipman, became interested in Wheeler's windmill.  Chipman persuaded Wheeler to work on a patent and provided financial support while Wheeler did so.{{sfn|Davisson|1895|p=251}} On September 10, 1867, US Patent No, 68674 was issued.{{sfn|Wheeler|1867}}  The patent had three [[Claim (patent)|claims]].

The principal claim was for a regulating mechanism to keep wheel pointed at an optimum angle based on both the wind speed and direction.  The main design problem for windmills is to capture as much power as possible in light wind, but not be damaged or destroyed by high-speed winds.  In prior art, windmills had a simple tail vane which kept the wheel pointed directly at the wind, a simple design still in use in decorative garden windmills.  Wheeler developed a mechanism that pointed the wheel into the wind at low to moderate wind speeds, but turned the wheel to point obliquely to the wind at high speeds.  This was accomplished by the means of a secondary vane which shifted angles, held in an optimum position by weights through a series of pulleys. which operated against the main directional vane to optimize the angle.

An additional benefit to Wheeler's invention, which became second patent claim, was that by a simple shift in one of the hanging weights the motion of the wheel could be stopped altogether.  His third claim was for a means by which to mount the vertical axis for the entire mechanism with a hollow shaft so that the ropes operating the regulating pulleys could pass down to the weights without restricting the rotational angle of the platform.

In an 1868 letter to his elderly father (still in Vermont), Wheeler described the device and his hopes for it this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You will like to know, perhaps, how I succeeded with the mill. I have spent a good deal of time on it, experimenting and getting it into good shape. It now suits, so far as the general plan of it is concerned. Two points have especially engaged my attention: 1: To get the mill so as to run nicely. 2 : To simplify and improve the construction of it, so that it will be strong and cheaply built. I have, as yet, put up but two hundred-dollar mills, both of which drive pumps in wells fifty feet deep, and give good satisfaction. Practical mechanics and machinists are much pleased with it, — it is so simple in its construction and accomplishes such important ends. It is self-regulating and will take care of itself in any wind, however gusty and strong it may blow. For deep wells on our prairies to raise water for watering stock, it is a mill, we think, which will be much wanted. It is not yet remunerative, the balance has been out of pocket thus far, but I hope the scale will turn it my favor before long. I suffer, as many inventors do, in not having the means to bring it rapidly into notice. But, as in every new thing,  we must be contented to move slowly and wait patiently for results. The mill in its present form, is used only to work pumps. I hope soon to get up another form for driving machinery. I feel quite confident I can get one up in a shape that will give better satisfaction than anything now out, though it must be confessed there are not a few difficulties in the way. So you see I continue to keep busy, and, having something of the versatility common to the Yankees, if I can not do one thing I turn my hand to another. I shall never be able to preach any more, but if I can get up a useful mill and provide for the wants of my family, one part of the end of life will be answered.{{sfn|Davidson|1895|p=251}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As Wheeler mentions in the letter, a key aspect of his device, although not part of the patent, was the use of inexpensive interchangeable parts, lowering the overall manufacturing costs.

==Growth of company==
At first the windmill was manufactured by L. H. Wheeler and Sons.{{sfn|Baker|1985|p=210}}  In February 1872 Wheeler died.  In 1873  Wheeler's sons, along with S. T. Merrill and C. B. Salmon, organized the Eclipse Wind Mill Company and the company began to grow steadily.{{sfn|Browne|1900|p=149}}  At first the wheel design used four vanes, but this was changed to a wheel with a dense pattern of fins, a signature of the Eclipse, and was manufactured in several diameters from 8 1/2 to 14 feet.{{sfn|Baker|1985|p=210}}

===Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876===
The [[Centennial International Exhibition]] of 1876, the first official [[World's Fair]] in the [[United States]], was held in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], from May 10 to November 10, 1876, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in Philadelphia.  About 10 million visitors attended, equivalent to about 20% of the population of the United States at the time.  Hundreds of machines and devices were exhibited, including a special exhibit of windmills, among which were three models by Eclipse as well as by the United States Wind-Engine &amp; Pump Company (Batavia, Illinois), E. Stover &amp; Brothers (Freeport, Illinois) and Gammon &amp; Deering (Chicago, Illinois).{{sfn|Walker|1877|pp=45-46}}  The Eclipse windmill received the following citation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Commended as a thoroughly efficient, well-made engine, economical in work. We find a strong solid wheel varying in size from ten feet to sixteen feet diameter. The special claim is for a small controllable side vane, which acts as an overbalance and draws the sail away from the wind in a storm. It is prevented from acting unfavorably in a light wind, because it must first overcome the leverage of a weighted arm, which can be made adjustable by moving the weight nearer or farther from the centre. The turn-table travels on four friction balls running on a grooved surface. Table casting is made in one piece with the cap or bed plate, and has flanges on under side to receive the heads of the posts. The end of the piston-rod has a ball attachment which keeps it in place. There is no method for taking up the wear of this ball.{{sfn|Walker|1877|p=75}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Expansion of Beloit factories===

In 1880 Merrill and Salmon retired, and the company was renamed the Eclipse Wind Engine Company, with W. H. Wheeler as president.  Twice thereafter the manufacturing plant was rebuilt, and Wheeler added friction clutch and gas engine products.{{sfn|Browne|1900|p=149}}

===Merge with Fairbanks-Morse===

In the early 1890s, Charles Morse bought shares in the Eclipse Wind Engine Company.  Eventually Morse merged the interests of Eclipse with those of the Fairbanks Company as well as other enterprises, organizing the combined company known as [[Fairbanks-Morse|Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co.]].{{sfn|Browne|1900|p=xxx}}

At the turn of the 20th Century, the products of Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co., including the various models of the Eclipse Windmill, were sold all over the world.{{sfn|Browne|1900|p=xxix}}  Eclipse windmills at the time were one of the top two brands in the United States and were also manufactured extensively in Germany.{{sfn|Wolff|1900|pp=87-88}}  When the patent rights expired in 1901, many competing windmill companies copied the design.{{sfn|Baker|1985|p=211}}

After World War I, the Fairbanks Morse company no longer manufactured the classic wood-fin Eclipse.  However, they did produce several steel windmills that carried the Eclipse brand name.{{sfn|Baker|1985|pp=220-223}}

==Antique and historical versions of the Eclipse==
Eclipse windmills are restored and protected by preservationists,{{sfn|Baker|1985|p=211}} two examples being:
* [[Moriarty Eclipse Windmill]]
* [[Canon Ranch Railroad Eclipse Windmill]]

'''EHEDG''', the ('''European Hygienic Engineering and Design Group''') is a [[Europe]]an-based [[non-governmental organization]] devoted to the advancement of [[hygienic design]] and [[food engineering]].
EHEDG is a consortium of equipment manufacturers, food industries, research institutes and public health authorities, founded in 1989 with the aim to promote hygiene during the processing and packing of food products.

European legislation requires that handling, preparation, processing, packaging, etc. of food is done hygienically, with hygienic machinery in hygienic premises (the food hygiene directive, the machine directive and the [[food contact materials]] directive).

How to comply with these requirements, however, is left to the industry. EHEDG provides practical guidance on hygienic engineering aspects to help complying to these requirements. As food safety does not end at the borders of Europe, the EHEDG actively promotes global harmonization of guidelines and standards.

EHEDG publicise guidelines (approx. 25) on different aspects of hygienic design and provides certification for industries on equipment used in the food industry.

Together with [[EFFoST]] and [[Wageningen University]], EHEDG runs the website [http://www.food-info.net Food-Info], which provides general information on foods to the public.

==Executive committee==
The Executive Committee consists of a President, Past President and twelve Members-At-Large.

==Headquarters==
EHEDG is headquartered at the VDMA in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]].

'''Gboard''' is a [[virtual keyboard]] [[Mobile app|app]] developed by [[Google]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] devices. It was first released on iOS in May 2016, followed by a release on Android in December 2016, debuting as a major update to the already-established Google Keyboard app on Android.

Gboard features [[Google Search]], including web results and predictive answers, easy searching and sharing of [[GIF]] and [[emoji]] content, a [[machine learning|predictive typing engine]] suggesting the next word depending on context, and [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] language support. Updates to the keyboard have enabled additional functionality, including GIF suggestions, options for a dark color theme or adding a personal image as the keyboard background, support for [[Dictation machine|voice dictation]], next-phrase prediction, and hand-drawn emoji recognition. At the time of its launch on iOS, the keyboard only offered support for the English language, with more languages being gradually added in the following months, whereas on Android, the keyboard supported more than 100 languages at the time of release.

In August 2018 Gboard passed 1 billion installs on the [[Google Play|Google Play Store]], making it one of the most popular Android apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/22/gboard-passes-one-billion-installs-play-store/|title=Gboard passes one billion installs on the Play Store|date=2018-08-22|work=Android Police|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gboard was first launched on the [[iOS]] operating system in May 2016,&lt;ref name="iOS launch"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Google launches Gboard, an iOS keyboard that lets you search without a browser |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/12/google-launches-gboard-an-ios-keyboard-that-lets-you-search-without-a-browser/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 12, 2016 |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a release on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in December 2016, debuting as a major update for the already-established Google Keyboard app.&lt;ref name="Gboard introduction"&gt;{{cite web |first=Reena |last=Lee |title=Gboard, now available for Android |url=https://blog.google/products/search/gboard-now-on-android/ |work=The Keyword Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=December 16, 2016 |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Whitwam |title=[Update: Official] Google Keyboard is now Gboard with v6.0 update—includes integrated search, dedicated number row, multiple active languages, and more [APK Download] |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/17/google-keyboard-now-gboard-v6-0-update-includes-integrated-search-dedicated-number-row-multiple-active-languages-apk-download/ |website=Android Police |date=December 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adi |last=Robertson |title=Google’s great iOS keyboard is now on Android |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/12/13922300/gboard-google-ios-keyboard-android-support |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=December 12, 2016 |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018 Gboard surpassed 1 billion installs on Android making it one of the most popular apps on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-Gboard-keyboard-app-1-billion-downloads_id108061|title=Google's Gboard keyboard app exceeds 1 billion downloads in the Play Store|last=Vasile|first=Cosmin|work=Phone Arena|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is measured by the [[Google Play|Google Play Store]] and includes downloads by users as well as pre-installed instances of the app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/22/gboard-passes-one-billion-installs-play-store/|title=Gboard passes one billion installs on the Play Store|date=2018-08-22|work=Android Police|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Gboard is a [[virtual keyboard]] app. It features [[Google Search]], including web results and predictive answers, easy searching and sharing of [[GIF]] and [[emoji]] content, and a [[machine learning|predictive typing engine]] suggesting the next word depending on context.&lt;ref name="iOS launch"/&gt; At its May 2016 launch on iOS, Gboard only supported the English language,&lt;ref name="iOS launch"/&gt; while it supported "more than 100 languages" at the time of its launch on the Android platform. Google states that Gboard will add more languages "over the coming months".&lt;ref name="Gboard introduction"/&gt;

Gboard also supports one-handed mode on Android after its May 2016 update. This functionality was added to the app when it was branded as Google Keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lifehacker.com/google-keyboard-now-has-a-one-handed-mode-1774293892|title=Google Keyboard Now Has a One-Handed Mode|last=Klosowski|first=Thorin|work=Lifehacker|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An update for the iOS app released in August 2016 added French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish languages, as well as offering "smart GIF suggestions", where the keyboard will suggest GIFs relevant to text written. The keyboard also offers new options for a dark theme or adding a personal image from the camera roll as the keyboard's background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rajan |last=Patel |title=Olá Gboard: new languages, personal keyboards and more |url=https://blog.google/products/search/ola-gboard-new-languages-personal_4/ |website=The Keyword Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=August 4, 2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another new update in March 2018 added Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Polish, Romanian, Balochi, Swedish, Catalan, Hungarian, Malay, Russian, Latin American Spanish, and Turkish languages, along with support for voice dictation, enabling users to "long press the mic button on the space bar and talk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan |last=Ni |title=Gboard for iPhone gets an upgrade |url=https://blog.google/products/search/gboard-iphone-gets-upgrade/ |website=The Keyword Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=February 23, 2017 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Google upgrades its iPhone keyboard with voice dictation and 15 new languages |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/23/14708578/google-keyboard-gboard-voice-typing-ios |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=February 23, 2017 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Google significantly increased the amount of Indian languages supported on Gboard, adding 11 new languages, bringing the total number of supported [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] to 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Martonik |title=Google dramatically improves support for Indian languages across Translate, Gboard and more |url=http://www.androidcentral.com/google-dramatically-improving-support-indian-languages |website=Android Central |date=April 25, 2017 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Abhishek |last=Baxi |title=Google improves support for Indian languages in Google Translate, Gboard, and more |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/google-improves-support-for-indian-languages-in-google-translate-gboard-and-more-766986/ |website=Android Authority |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the Android app was updated to support recognition of hand-drawn emoji and the ability to predict whole phrases rather than single words. The functionality is expected to come to the iOS app at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Statt |title=Gboard for Android now recognizes hand-drawn emoji and anticipates your next phrase |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/12/15743130/google-gboard-android-update-keyboard-emoji-ai |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 12, 2017 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Cheng |title=Google's Gboard smart keyboard gets new bells and whistles |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/googles-gboard-smart-keyboard-gets-new-bells-and-whistles/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=June 12, 2017 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virtual keyboard of Android i.e. Gboard also supports sending emojis that looks like you using Bitmoji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Janglu |last=Kumar |title=Google Gboard lets you create emojis that looks like you |url=https://www.kumarjanglu.online/2018/10/google-gboard-lets-you-create-emoji-that-looks-like-you.html |date=November 23, 2018 |accessdate=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' praised the keyboard, particularly the integrated Google search feature. However, it was noted that the app does not currently support integration with other apps on the device, meaning that queries such as "Buy [[Captain America]] movie tickets" sends users to the web browser rather than an app for movie tickets installed on their phone. ''The Wall Street Journal'' also praised the predictive typing engine, stating that it "blows past most competitors" and "it gets smarter with use". They also discovered that Gboard "cleverly suggests emojis as you type words". It was noted that there was the lack of a one-handed mode, as well as lack of options for changing color or size of keys, writing that "If you're looking to customize a keyboard, Gboard isn't for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nathan |last=Olivarez-Giles |title=Review: Gboard Adds Google’s Search Box to iPhone Keyboards |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/review-gboard-adds-googles-search-box-to-iphone-keyboards-1463058321 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=May 12, 2016 |accessdate=January 8, 2017 |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gobby''' is a [[free software]] [[collaborative real-time editor]] available on Windows and [[Unix-like]] platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/collaborative-text-editing-gobby|title=Collaborative text editing with Gobby}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It runs on [[Mac OS X]] using Apple's [[X11.app]].) It was initially released in June 2005 by the 0x539 dev group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/wiki/News#a2005-06-07:Gobby0.1.1released |title=What is Gobby? |website=Gobby.0x539.de |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[hexadecimal]] value 0x539 is equal to [[Leet|1337]] in [[decimal]].)
Gobby uses [[GTK+]] for its [[GUI widget]]s.

It features a client-server architecture which supports multiple documents in one session, document synchronisation on request, password protection and an [[IRC]]-like chat for communication [[out of band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/group-text-editing-gobby|title=Group text editing with Gobby}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can choose a colour to highlight the text they have written in a document. Gobby is fully [[Unicode]]-aware, provides [[syntax highlighting]] for most programming languages and has basic [[Zeroconf]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/wiki/News#a2005-07-30:Releaseday-gobby-0.2.0obby-0.2.0net6-1.1.0 |title=What is Gobby? |website=Gobby.0x539.de |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dedicated server called Sobby is also provided, together with a script which could format saved sessions for the web (e.g. to provide logs of meetings with a collaboratively prepared transcript). The collaborative editing protocol is named Obby, and there are other implementations that use this protocol (e.g. Rudel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Rudel |title=Rudel |website=EmacsWiki.org |date=2014-10-23 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a plugin for [[GNU Emacs]]). Gobby 0.5 replaces Sobby with a new server called infinoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/wiki/Infinote/Infinoted |title=What is Gobby? |website=Gobby.0x539.de |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 0.4.0 featured [[GnuTLS|fully encrypted]] connections and further usability enhancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/wiki/News#a2006-04-11:Firstreleasecandidateofthe0.4.xseries |title=What is Gobby? |website=Gobby.0x539.de |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions numbered 0.4.9x are preview releases for version 0.5.0. The most noticeable improvement is [[undo]] support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/wiki#a2008-10-18:Gobby0.4.90 |title=What is Gobby?|website=Gobby.0x539.de |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Operational transformation#OT control (integration) algorithms|adOPTed]] algorithm for concurrency control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/wiki/Infinote/Protocol#ConcurrencyControl |title=What is Gobby?|website=Gobby.0x539.de |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grove Field''' {{airport codes|||1W1}} is a public [[airport]] located three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) north of the [[central business district]] of [[Camas, Washington|Camas]], a city in [[Clark County, Washington]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=FAA /&gt; It is located near [[Lacamas Lake]] which has a [[seaplane]] base. Due to the closing of [[Evergreen Field]], many aircraft have moved to Grove Field.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Grove Field covers an area of {{convert|23|acre|ha}} which contains one [[runway]] (7/25) with a 2,710 x 40&amp;nbsp;ft (826 x 12 m) [[asphalt]] pavement. For the 12-month period ending May 31, 2007, the airport had 10,000 [[general aviation]] aircraft operations, an average of 27 per day. At that time there were 86 aircraft based at this airport: 99% single-engine and 1% multi-engine.&lt;ref name=FAA /&gt; Flight training, aircraft rental and minor maintenance services are available at Grove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Camas Washougal Aviation Association - Services|url=http://www.cwaagrovefield.org/services|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306022447/http://www.cwaagrovefield.org/services|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The air field is named for Ward Grove who built the airfield in 1945. Grove moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]] in 1924 and learned to fly in [[Portland, Oregon]] at the Rankin Flying School operated by [[Tex Rankin]]. During [[World War II]], Grove taught flying in California and returned to Clark County, Washington after the war.The [[Port of Camas-Washougal]] bought the airstrip from him in 1961 and in 1984, the Port Commission voted to name the field in his honor. Grove died in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Jolotta, Pat, "Naming Clark County, Vancouver Historical Society, 1993, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; A fire on October 6, 2014, did $1 million in damage to 10 hangars at the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Kasia|title=Grove Field Airport hanger fire sparked by electrical failure, fire investigators say.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36217">'''Homogeneous charge compression ignition''' ('''HCCI''') is a form of [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] in which well-mixed [[fuel]] and [[oxidizer]] (typically air) are compressed to the point of auto-ignition. As in other forms of [[combustion]], this [[exothermic reaction]] releases energy that can be transformed in an engine into [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] and heat.



HCCI combines characteristics of conventional [[gasoline engine]] and [[diesel engine]]s. Gasoline engines combine ''homogeneous charge''  (HC) with ''[[spark ignition]]'' (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. Diesel engines combine ''[[stratified charge]]'' (SC) with ''[[compression ignition]]'' (CI), abbreviated as SCCI.

As in HCSI, HCCI injects fuel during the intake stroke. However, rather than using an electric discharge (spark) to ignite a portion of the mixture, HCCI raises density and temperature by compression until the entire mixture reacts spontaneously.

Stratified charge compression ignition also relies on temperature and density increase resulting from compression. However, it injects fuel later, during the compression stroke. Combustion occurs at the boundary of the fuel and air, producing higher emissions, but allowing a [[Lean burn|leaner]] and higher compression burn, producing greater efficiency.

[[control theory|Controlling]] HCCI requires microprocessor control and physical understanding of the ignition process. HCCI designs achieve gasoline engine-like emissions with diesel engine-like efficiency.

HCCI engines achieve extremely low levels of oxides of nitrogen emissions ({{chem|NO|x}}) without a [[catalytic converter]]. Hydrocarbons (unburnt fuels and oils) and carbon monoxide emissions still require  treatment to meet [[automobile emissions control]] regulations.

Recent research has shown that the hybrid fuels combining different reactivities (such as gasoline and diesel) can help in controlling HCCI ignition and burn rates. RCCI, or reactivity controlled compression ignition, has been demonstrated to provide highly efficient, low emissions operation over wide load and speed ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.wisc.edu/news/headlines/2009/Aug03.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225044550/http://www.engr.wisc.edu/news/headlines/2009/Aug03.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-02-25 |title=College of Engineering @ The University of Wisconsin-Madison, initiatives in energy, health, nanotechnology, security, and information technology |publisher=Engr.wisc.edu |accessdate=2014-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.This HCCI  system can be highly efficient with the help of free piston engine

== History ==

HCCI engines have a long history, even though HCCI has not been as widely implemented as spark ignition or diesel injection. It is essentially an [[Otto cycle|Otto combustion cycle]]. HCCI was popular before electronic [[ignition system|spark ignition]] was used. One example is the [[Hot bulb engine|hot-bulb engine]] which used a hot vaporization chamber to help mix fuel with air. The extra heat combined with compression induced the conditions for combustion. Another example is the [[Carbureted compression ignition model engine|"diesel" model aircraft engine]].

== Operation ==

=== Methods ===

A mixture of fuel and air ignites when the concentration and temperature of reactants is sufficiently high. The concentration and/or temperature can be increased in several different ways:

* Increasing compression ratio
* Pre-heating of induction gases
* Forced induction
* Retained or re-inducted exhaust gases

Once ignited, combustion occurs very quickly. When auto-ignition occurs too early or with too much chemical energy, combustion is too fast and high in-cylinder pressures can destroy an engine. For this reason, HCCI is typically operated at lean overall fuel mixtures.

=== Advantages ===

* Since HCCI engines are fuel-lean, they can operate at diesel-like compression ratios (&gt;15), thus achieving 30% higher efficiencies than conventional SI gasoline engines.&lt;ref&gt;

* Homogeneous mixing of fuel and air leads to cleaner combustion and lower emissions. Because peak temperatures are significantly lower than in typical SI engines, [[NOx|{{chem|NO&lt;span style="color:#777;"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;NOx}}]] levels are almost negligible. Additionally, the technique does not produce [[soot]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control ===

HCCI is more difficult to control than other combustion engines, such as SI and diesel. In a typical [[gasoline engine]], a spark is used to ignite the pre-mixed fuel and air. In [[Diesel engines]], combustion begins when the fuel is injected into pre-compressed air. In both cases, combustion timing is explicitly controlled. In an HCCI engine, however, the homogeneous mixture of fuel and air is compressed and combustion begins whenever sufficient pressure and temperature are reached. This means that no well-defined combustion initiator provides direct control. Engines must be designed so that ignition conditions occur at the desired timing. To achieve dynamic operation, the [[control system]] must manage the conditions that induce combustion. Options include the compression ratio, inducted gas temperature, inducted gas pressure, fuel-air ratio, or quantity of retained or re-inducted exhaust. Several control approaches are discussed below.

==== Compression ratio ====

Two compression ratios are significant. The ''[[geometric compression ratio]]'' can be changed with a movable plunger at the top of the [[cylinder head]]. This system is used in diesel [[Model engine|model aircraft engines]]. The ''[[effective compression ratio]]'' can be reduced from the geometric ratio by closing the intake valve either very late or very early with [[variable valve actuation]] ([[variable valve timing]] that enables the [[Miller cycle]]). Both approaches require energy to achieve fast response. Additionally, implementation is expensive, but is effective.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of compression ratio on HCCI combustion has also been studied extensively.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Induction temperature ====

HCCI's autoignition event is highly sensitive to temperature. The simplest temperature control method uses resistance heaters to vary the inlet temperature, but this approach is too slow to change on a cycle-to-cycle frequency.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique is ''fast thermal management'' (FTM). It is accomplished by varying the intake charge temperature by mixing hot and cold air streams. It is fast enough to allow cycle-to-cycle control.&lt;ref&gt;

 | id = 2004-01-0943 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is also expensive to implement and has limited bandwidth associated with actuator energy.

==== Exhaust gas percentage ====

Exhaust gas is very hot if retained or re-inducted from the previous combustion cycle or cool if recirculated through the intake as in conventional [[Exhaust gas recirculation|EGR]] systems. The exhaust has dual effects on HCCI combustion. It dilutes the fresh charge, delaying ignition and reducing the chemical energy and engine output. Hot combustion products conversely increase gas temperature in the cylinder and advance ignition. Control of combustion timing HCCI engines using EGR has been shown experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Valve actuation ====

''[[Variable valve actuation]]'' (VVA) extends the HCCI operating region by giving finer control over the temperature-pressure-time envelope within the combustion chamber. VVA can achieve this via either:

* Controlling the effective compression ratio: VVA on intake can control the point at which the intake valve closes. Retarding past bottom dead center (BDC), changes the compression ratio, altering the in-cylinder pressure-time envelope.
* Controlling the amount of hot exhaust gas retained in the combustion chamber: VVA can control the amount of hot EGR within the combustion chamber, either by valve re-opening or changes in valve overlap. Balancing the percentage of cooled external EGR with the hot internal EGR generated by a VVA system, makes it possible to control the in-cylinder temperature.

While electro-hydraulic and camless VVA systems offer control over the valve event, the componentry for such systems is currently complicated and expensive. Mechanical variable lift and duration systems, however, although more complex than a standard valvetrain, are cheaper and less complicated. It is relatively simple to configure such systems to achieve the necessary control over the valve lift curve.

==== Fuel mixture ====

Another means to extend the operating range is to control the onset of ignition and the heat release rate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory1.html Controlling Heat Release Using Advanced Fuels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405164105/http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory1.html |date=2011-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

* Upstream blending: Fuels are mixed in the liquid phase, one with low ignition resistance (such as diesel) and a second with greater resistance (gasoline). Ignition timing varies with the ratio of these fuels.
* In-chamber blending: One fuel can be injected in the intake duct (port injection) and the other directly into the cylinder.

==== Direct Injection: PCCI or PPCI Combustion ====

Compression Ignition Direct Injection (CIDI) combustion is a well-established means of controlling ignition timing and heat release rate and is adopted in [[diesel engine]] combustion. [[Partially premixed combustion|Partially Pre-mixed Charge Compression Ignition]] (PPCI) also known as Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) is a compromise offering the control of CIDI combustion with the reduced exhaust gas emissions of HCCI, specifically lower [[soot]].&lt;ref name="Kal"&gt;

 | author2 = Hildingsson, L.
 | author3 = Johansson, B.
 | title = Low NOx and low smoke operation of a diesel engine using gasoline-like fuels
 | journal = ASME ICES2009
 | year = 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The heat release rate is controlled by preparing the combustible mixture in such a way that combustion occurs over a longer time duration making it less prone to [[engine knocking|knocking]]. This is done by timing the injection event such that a range of air/fuel ratios spread across the combustion cylinder when ignition begins. Ignition occurs in different regions of the combustion chamber at different times - slowing the heat release rate. This mixture is designed to minimize the number of fuel-rich pockets, reducing soot formation.&lt;ref name="cmcl2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory2.html |title=Partially-Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) and Low-Temperature Combustion (LTC) modes |department= |website=Cmcl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309041652/http://www.cmclinnovations.com/userstories/userstory2.html |archive-date=2012-03-09 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2016-04-06 |quote=One promising approach is that of Partially-Premixed Compression Ignition (PPCI) or Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) mode. Using this approach, smoke can be reduced in compression ignition engines by promoting the mixing of fuel and air prior to combustion. NOx levels can be reduced by reducing combustion temperatures by burning leaner, pre-mixed or using EGR, exhaust gas recirculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of high EGR and diesel fuels with a greater resistance to ignition (more "gasoline like") enable longer mixing times before ignition and thus fewer rich pockets that produce soot and {{chem|NO|x}}&lt;ref name="Kal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cmcl2"/&gt;

=== Peak pressure and heat release rate ===

In a typical ICE, combustion occurs via a flame. Hence at any point in time, only a fraction of the total fuel is burning. This results in low peak pressures and low energy release rates. In HCCI however, the entire fuel/air mixture ignites and burns over a much smaller time interval, resulting in high peak pressures and high energy release rates. To withstand the higher pressures, the engine has to be structurally stronger. Several strategies have been proposed to lower the rate of combustion and peak pressure. Mixing fuels, with different autoignition properties, can lower the combustion speed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this requires significant infrastructure to implement. Another approach uses dilution (i.e. with exhaust gases) to reduce the pressure and combustion rates (and output).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''divided combustion chamber''' approach[http://www.pattakon.com/pattakonPatBam.htm], there are two cooperating combustion chambers: a small auxiliary and a big main.&lt;br&gt;
A high compression ratio is used in the auxiliary combustion chamber. &lt;br&gt;
A moderate compression ratio is used in the main combustion chamber wherein a homogeneous air-fuel mixture is compressed / heated near, yet below, the auto-ignition threshold.&lt;br&gt;
The high compression ratio in the auxiliary combustion chamber causes the auto-ignition of the homogeneous lean air-fuel mixture therein (no spark plug required); the burnt gas bursts - through some "transfer ports", just before the TDC - into the main combustion chamber triggering its auto-ignition.&lt;br&gt;
The engine needs not be structurally stronger.

=== Power ===

In ICEs, power can be increased by introducing more fuel into the combustion chamber. These engines can withstand a boost in power because the heat release rate in these engines is slow. However, in HCCI engines increasing the fuel/air ratio results in higher peak pressures and heat release rates. In addition, many viable HCCI control strategies require thermal preheating of the fuel, which reduces the density and hence the mass of the air/fuel charge in the combustion chamber, reducing power. These factors make increasing the power in HCCI engines challenging.

One technique is to use fuels with different [[autoignition]] properties. This lowers the heat release rate and peak pressures and makes it possible to increase the equivalence ratio. Another way is to thermally stratify the charge so that different points in the compressed charge have different temperatures and burn at different times, lowering the heat release rate and making it possible to increase power.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Emissions ===

Because HCCI operates on lean mixtures, the peak temperature is much lower than that encountered in SI and diesel engines. This low peak temperature reduces the formation of {{chem|NO|x}}, but it also leads to incomplete burning of fuel, especially near combustion chamber walls. This produces relatively high carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. An oxidizing catalyst can remove the regulated species, because the exhaust is still oxygen-rich.

=== Difference from knock ===

Engine knock or pinging occurs when some of the unburnt gases ahead of the flame in an SI engine spontaneously ignite. This gas is compressed as the flame propagates and the pressure in the combustion chamber rises. The high pressure and corresponding high temperature of unburnt reactants can cause them to spontaneously ignite. This causes a shock wave to traverse from the end gas region and an expansion wave to traverse into the end gas region. The two waves reflect off the boundaries of the combustion chamber and interact to produce high amplitude [[standing waves]], thus forming a primitive thermoacoustic device where the resonance is amplified by the increased heat release during the wave travel similar to a [[Rijke tube]].

A similar ignition process occurs in HCCI. However, rather than part of the reactant mixture igniting by compression ahead of a flame front, ignition in HCCI engines occurs due to piston compression more or less simultaneously in the bulk of the compressed charge. Little or no pressure differences occur between the different regions of the gas, eliminating any shock wave and knocking, but the rapid pressure rise is still present and desirable from the point of seeking maximum efficiency from near-ideal isochoric heat addition.

=== Simulation of HCCI Engines ===

Computational models for simulating combustion and heat release rates of HCCI engines require detailed chemistry models.&lt;ref name="cmcl1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-pls.llnl.gov/?url=science_and_technology-chemistry-combustion |title=Combustion Chemistry |publisher=Pls.llnl.gov |accessdate=2014-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817184821/https://www-pls.llnl.gov/?url=science_and_technology-chemistry-combustion |archivedate=2014-08-17 |df= }}&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cmclinnovations.com/?page_id=67&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely because ignition is more sensitive to chemical kinetics than to turbulence/spray or spark processes as are typical in SI and diesel engines. Computational models have demonstrated the importance of accounting for the fact that the in-cylinder mixture is actually in-homogeneous, particularly in terms of temperature. This in-homogeneity is driven by turbulent mixing and heat transfer from the combustion chamber walls. The amount of temperature stratification dictates the rate of heat release and thus tendency to knock.&lt;ref&gt;

== Prototypes ==

As of 2017, no HCCI engines were produced at commercial scale. However, several car manufacturers had functioning HCCI prototypes.

* The 1994 [[Honda EXP-2]] motorcycle used "ARC-combustion". This had a two stroke engine uses an exhaust valve to mimic a HCCI mode. Honda sold a CRM 250 AR.
* In 2007-2009, [[General Motors]] demonstrated HCCI with a modified 2.2 L [[GM Ecotec engine|Ecotec engine]] installed in [[Opel Vectra]] and [[Saturn Aura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Sam Abuelsamid RSS feed |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/08/26/abg-tech-analysis-and-driving-impression-gms-hcci-engine |title=ABG Tech analysis and driving impression: GM's HCCI Engine |publisher=Autobloggreen.com |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|author= Sam Abuelsamid RSS feed |url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/05/25/gms-hcci-engines-now-run-from-idle-to-60-mph |title=GM's HCCI engines now run from idle to 60 mph! |publisher=Green.autoblog.com |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/gmhcci-20110503.html |title=GM exploring different valving strategies to extend HCCI operation for high loads; benefits of a Positive Valve Overlap approach |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine operates in HCCI mode at speeds below {{convert|60|mph|km/h}} or when cruising, switching to conventional SI when the throttle is opened and produces fuel economy of {{convert|43|mpgimp}} and carbon dioxide emissions of about 150&amp;nbsp;grams per kilometre, improving on the {{convert|37|mpgimp}} and 180 g/km of the conventional [[GM Ecotec engine#DI|2.2 L direct injection]] version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Scarlett |url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/firstdrives/222168/vauxhall_vectra_22_hcci.html |title=Vauxhall Vectra 2.2 HCCI |publisher=Auto Express |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM is also researching smaller [[GM Family 0 engine#HCCI|Family 0]] engines for HCCI applications.

* [[Mercedes-Benz]] developed a prototype engine called [[DiesOtto]], with controlled auto ignition. It was displayed in its [[Mercedes-Benz F700|F 700]] concept car at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122567 |title=2007 Frankfurt Auto Show: Mercedes-Benz F 700 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012160822/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId%3D122567 |work=Edmunds |date=2007-09-11 |archivedate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Volkswagen]] are developing two types of engine for HCCI operation. The first, called Combined Combustion System or CCS, is based on the VW Group 2.0-litre diesel engine, but uses homogeneous intake charge. It requires [[synthetic fuel]] to achieve maximum benefit. The second is called Gasoline Compression Ignition or GCI; it uses HCCI when cruising and spark ignition when accelerating. Both engines have been demonstrated in [[Volkswagen Touran|Touran]] prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christian Steinert, The German Car Blog |url=http://www.germancarblog.com/2007/06/vw-inside-secret-laboratory.html |title=VW: Inside the secret laboratory |publisher=The German Car Blog |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2014-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518205856/http://www.germancarblog.com/2007/06/vw-inside-secret-laboratory.html |archivedate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applications ==

To date, few prototype engines run in HCCI mode, but HCCI research has resulted in advancements in fuel and engine development. Examples include:

* PCCI/PPCI combustion—A hybrid of HCCI and conventional diesel combustion offering more control over ignition and heat release rates with lower soot and {{chem|NO|x}} emissions.&lt;ref name="Kal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cmcl2"/&gt;
* Advancements in fuel modelling—HCCI combustion is driven mainly by chemical kinetics rather than turbulent mixing or injection, reducing the complexity of simulating the chemistry, which results in fuel oxidation and emissions formation. This has led to increasing interest and development of chemical kinetics that describe hydrocarbon oxidation.
* Fuel blending applications—Due to the advancements in fuel modelling, it is now possible to carry out detailed simulations of hydrocarbon fuel oxidation, enabling simulations of practical fuels such as gasoline/diesel&lt;ref name="cmcl1"/&gt; and [[ethanol]].&lt;ref name="cmcl3"/&gt; Engineers can now blend fuels virtually and determine how they will perform in an engine context.

{{wpspace}}

'''Interstellar travel''' is the term used for [[Human spaceflight|crewed]] or uncrewed travel between [[star]]s or [[planetary system]]s. Interstellar travel will be much more difficult than [[interplanetary spaceflight]]; the distances between the [[planet]]s in the [[Solar System]] are less than 30 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU)—whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, and usually expressed in [[light-year]]s. Because of the vastness of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the [[speed of light]]; huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer; or a combination of both.

The speeds required for interstellar travel in a human lifetime far exceed what current methods of [[spacecraft propulsion]] can provide. Even with a hypothetically perfectly efficient propulsion system, the [[kinetic energy]] corresponding to those speeds is enormous by today's standards of [[energy development]]. Moreover, collisions by the spacecraft with [[cosmic dust]] and gas can produce very dangerous effects both to passengers and the spacecraft itself.

A number of strategies have been proposed to deal with these problems, ranging from giant arks that would carry entire societies and ecosystems, to microscopic [[space probe]]s. Many different [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems have been proposed to give spacecraft the required speeds, including [[nuclear propulsion]], [[beam-powered propulsion]], and methods based on speculative physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis-space.com/what-we-do/advocacy/interstellar-travel|title=Interstellar Travel|website=www.bis-space.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both crewed and uncrewed interstellar travel, considerable technological and economic challenges need to be met. Even the most optimistic views about interstellar travel see it as only being feasible decades from now. However, in spite of the challenges, if or when interstellar travel is realised, a wide range of scientific benefits is expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I. A.|title=The Astronomical, Astrobiological and Planetary Science Case for Interstellar Spaceflight|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2009|volume=62|pages=415–421|arxiv=1008.4893|bibcode = 2009JBIS...62..415C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most interstellar travel concepts require a developed space logistics system capable of moving millions of tons to a construction / operating location, and most would require gigawatt-scale power for construction or power (such as [[Starwisp|Star Wisp]] or [[Solar sail|Light Sail]] type concepts). Such a system could grow organically if [[space-based solar power]] became a significant component of Earth's energy mix. Consumer demand for a multi-terawatt system would automatically create the necessary multi-million ton/year logistical system.&lt;ref&gt;Conclusion of the 2016 Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop Space Solar Power Working Track run by Peter Garretson &amp; Robert Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==

=== Interstellar distances ===
Distances between the planets in the Solar System are often measured in astronomical units (AU), defined as the average distance between the Sun and Earth, some {{convert|1.5E8|km|e6mi|sp=us|abbr=off}}. [[Venus]], the closest other planet to Earth is (at closest approach) 0.28 AU away. [[Neptune]], the farthest planet from the Sun, is 29.8 AU away. As of January 2018, [[Voyager&amp;nbsp;1]], the farthest man-made object from Earth, is 141.5 AU away.&lt;ref name="voyager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/|title=Where are the Voyagers – NASA Voyager|last=JPL.NASA.GOV|website=voyager.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest known star, [[Proxima Centauri]], is approximately {{convert|4.243|ly|AU|0|disp=output only}} away, or over 9,000 times farther away than Neptune.
&lt;!--
1 A.U. = 149,597,870,700 meters,
1 light-year = 9,460,730,472,580,800 meters or 63241.077 AU,
Venus perihelion = 0.7184 AU
Neptune perihelion = 29.809946 AU
Voyager 1 distance (2014/sep) = 129.18 AU
Proxima = 4.243 ± 0.002 light years away.

Because of this, distances between stars are usually expressed in [[light-year]]s, defined as the distance that a [[light]] [[photon]] travels in a year. Light in a vacuum travels around {{convert|300000|km|mi|-3}} per second, so this is some {{convert|{{convert|1|ly|Pm|3|disp=number}}e12|km|e12mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} or {{convert|1|ly|AU|0}} in a year. Proxima Centauri is 4.243 light-years away.

Another way of understanding the vastness of interstellar distances is by scaling: One of the closest stars to the Sun, [[Alpha Centauri A]] (a Sun-like star), can be pictured by scaling down the [[astronomical unit|Earth–Sun distance]] to {{convert|1|m|ft|2|spell=in|sp=us}}. On this scale, the distance to Alpha Centauri A would be {{convert|276|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}}&lt;!--Using 4.37 ly from Alpha Centauri page--&gt;.

The fastest outward-bound spacecraft yet sent, [[Voyager 1#Interstellar mission|Voyager 1]], has covered 1/600 of a light-year in 30 years and is currently moving at 1/18,000 the speed of light. At this rate, a journey to Proxima Centauri would take 80,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/scales.html | title= A Look at the Scaling | website= nasa.gov | publisher= NASA Glenn Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Required energy ===
A significant factor contributing to the difficulty is the energy that must be supplied to obtain a reasonable travel time. A lower bound for the required energy is the [[kinetic energy]] &lt;math&gt;K = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the final mass. If [[deceleration]] on arrival is desired and cannot be achieved by any means other than the engines of the ship, then the lower bound for the required energy is doubled to &lt;math&gt;mv^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |last=Millis |first=Marc G. |year=2011 |title=Energy, incessant obsolescence, and the first interstellar missions |journal=&lt;!-- --&gt; |volume=&lt;!-- --&gt; |issue=&lt;!-- --&gt; |eprint=1101.1066 |class=physics.gen-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The velocity for a manned round trip of a few decades to even the nearest star is several thousand times greater than those of present space vehicles. This means that due to the &lt;math&gt;v^2&lt;/math&gt; term in the kinetic energy formula, millions of times as much energy is required. Accelerating one ton to one-tenth of the speed of light requires at least {{convert|450|PJ|J TWh|sigfig=3|abbr=off|disp=or}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zirnstein|first1=E.J|title=Simulating the Compton-Getting Effect for Hydrogen Flux Measurements: Implications for IBEX-Hi and -Lo Observations |journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=2013|volume=778|issue=2|pages=112–127|doi=10.1088/0004-637x/778/2/112|bibcode=2013ApJ...778..112Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[world energy consumption]] 2008 was 143,851&amp;nbsp;terawatt-hours),{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} without factoring in efficiency of the propulsion mechanism. This energy has to be generated onboard from stored fuel, harvested from the interstellar medium, or projected over immense distances.

=== Interstellar medium ===
A knowledge of the properties of the [[interstellar medium|interstellar gas and dust]] through which the vehicle must pass is essential for the design of any interstellar space mission.&lt;ref name="ism" /&gt; A major issue with traveling at extremely high speeds is that interstellar dust may cause considerable damage to the craft, due to the high relative speeds and large kinetic energies involved. Various shielding methods to mitigate this problem have been proposed.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite conference | url= http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/637131main_radiation%20shielding_symposium_r1.pdf | title= Active Radiation Shielding Utilizing High Temperature Superconductors | author= Westover, Shayne | conference= NIAC Symposium | date= 27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger objects (such as macroscopic dust grains) are far less common, but would be much more destructive. The risks of impacting such objects, and methods of mitigating these risks, have been discussed in the literature, but many unknowns remain&lt;ref name="HGarrett"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/systems2012/presentations/garrett.pdf | title= There and Back Again: A Layman’s Guide to Ultra-Reliability for Interstellar Missions | author= Garrett, Henry | date= 30 July 2012 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140508062130/http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/systems2012/presentations/garrett.pdf | archivedate= 8 May 2014 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, owing to the inhomogeneous distribution of interstellar matter around the Sun, will depend on direction travelled.&lt;ref name=ism&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I. A.|title=Project Icarus: A review of local interstellar medium properties of relevance for space missions to the nearest stars|journal=Acta Astronautica|date=2011|volume=68|issue=7–8|pages=691–699|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2010.10.016|arxiv=1010.4823|bibcode = 2011AcAau..68..691C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a high density interstellar medium may cause difficulties for many interstellar travel concepts, [[Bussard ramjet|interstellar ramjets]], and some proposed concepts for decelerating interstellar spacecraft, would actually benefit from a denser interstellar medium.&lt;ref name="ism" /&gt;

=== Hazards ===
The crew of an interstellar ship would face several significant hazards, including the psychological effects of long-term [[solitude|isolation]], the effects of exposure to [[ionizing radiation]], and the physiological effects of [[weightlessness]] to the muscles, joints, bones, immune system, and eyes. There also exists the risk of impact by [[micrometeoroid]]s and other [[space debris]]. These risks represent challenges that have yet to be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Space Dangers: Outer Space Perils|last= Gibson|first=Dirk|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dvYADgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=risks%20of%20space%20travel&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=risks%20of%20space%20travel&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wait calculation ===
It has been argued that an interstellar mission that cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity and not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion (the incessant obsolescence postulate).&lt;ref name="Bob Forward 1996" /&gt; On the other hand, Andrew Kennedy has shown that if one calculates the journey time to a given destination as the rate of travel speed derived from growth (even exponential growth) increases, there is a clear minimum in the total time to that destination from now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Interstellar Travel: The Wait Calculation and the Incentive Trap of Progress |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=59 |number=7 |date=July 2006|pages=239–246 |last= Kennedy |first=Andrew |url= http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2006.59.239 &lt;!--|id=Refcode 2006.59.239--&gt;|bibcode = 2006JBIS...59..239K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voyages undertaken before the minimum will be overtaken by those that leave at the minimum, whereas voyages that leave after the minimum will never overtake those that left at the minimum.

== Prime targets for interstellar travel ==
There are 59 known [[stellar system]]s within 40 light years of the Sun, containing 81 visible stars. The following could be considered prime targets for interstellar missions:&lt;ref name="Bob Forward 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Robert L. |last=Forward |title=Ad Astra! |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=23–32 |date=1996|bibcode = 1996JBIS...49...23F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing and near-term astronomical technology is capable of finding planetary systems around these objects, increasing their potential for exploration

== Proposed methods ==

=== Slow, uncrewed probes ===
{{Main|Interstellar probe}}
Slow interstellar missions based on current and near-future propulsion technologies are associated with trip times starting from about one hundred years to thousands of years. These missions consist of sending a robotic probe to a nearby star for exploration, similar to interplanetary probes such as used in the [[Voyager program]].&lt;ref name="National Aeronautics and Space Administration"&gt;{{cite book|title=Voyager|date=1977|publisher=ERIC Clearing House|location=Louisiana State University|page=12|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=76390b8e-3776-42f2-87d0-14f9ce6435e2%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4210&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=lalu.2943532&amp;db=cat00252a|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By taking along no crew, the cost and complexity of the mission is significantly reduced although technology lifetime is still a significant issue next to obtaining a reasonable speed of travel. Proposed concepts include [[Project Daedalus]], [[Project Icarus (interstellar)|Project Icarus]], [[Project Dragonfly (space study)|Project Dragonfly]], [[Project Longshot]],&lt;ref name="centauri-dreams.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=31478|title=Project Dragonfly: The case for small, laser-propelled, distributed probes|work=Centauri Dreams|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently [[Breakthrough Starshot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161003-the-myths-and-reality-about-interstellar-travel|title=The myths and reality about interstellar travel|last=Nogrady|first=Bianca|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fast, uncrewed probes ===
{{Main|Interstellar probe}}

==== Nanoprobes ====
Near-lightspeed nano spacecraft might be possible within the near future built on existing microchip technology with a newly developed nanoscale thruster. Researchers at the [[University of Michigan]] are developing thrusters that use nanoparticles as propellant. Their technology is called "nanoparticle field extraction thruster", or [[Nano-particle field extraction thruster|nanoFET]]. These devices act like small particle accelerators shooting conductive nanoparticles out into space.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Wilson. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31665236/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/near-lightspeed-nano-spacecraft-might-be-close/#.T9v9Dz5Yu44 Near-lightspeed nano spacecraft might be close]. ''msnbc.msn.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michio Kaku]], a theoretical physicist, has suggested that clouds of "smart dust" be sent to the stars, which may become possible with advances in [[nanotechnology]]. Kaku also notes that a large number of nanoprobes would need to be sent due to the vulnerability of very small probes to be easily deflected by magnetic fields, micrometeorites and other dangers to ensure the chances that at least one nanoprobe will survive the journey and reach the destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Physics of the Impossible|last = Kaku|first = Michio|publisher =Anchor Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the light weight of these probes, it would take much less energy to accelerate them. With onboard solar cells, they could continually accelerate using solar power. One can envision a day when a fleet of millions or even billions of these particles swarm to distant stars at nearly the speed of light and relay signals back to Earth through a vast interstellar communication network.

As a near-term solution, small, laser-propelled interstellar probes, based on current CubeSat technology were proposed in the context of [[Project Dragonfly (space study)|Project Dragonfly]].&lt;ref name="centauri-dreams.org" /&gt;

=== Slow, manned missions ===
In crewed missions, the duration of a slow interstellar journey presents a major obstacle and existing concepts deal with this problem in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=A. M.|title=How Will Humans Fly to the Stars?|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=22561|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be distinguished by the "state" in which humans are transported on-board of the spacecraft.

==== Generation ships ====
{{Main|Generation ship}}
A [[generation ship]] (or '''world ship''') is a type of [[interstellar ark]] in which the crew that arrives at the destination is descended from those who started the journey. Generation ships are not currently feasible because of the difficulty of constructing a ship of the enormous required scale and the great biological and sociological problems that life aboard such a ship raises.&lt;!---So? nothing else in this article is, either---&gt;&lt;ref name="Hein 2012 119–133"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hein|first=A.

==== Suspended animation ====
{{Main|Sleeper ship}}

Scientists and writers have postulated various techniques for [[suspended animation]]. These include human [[hibernation]] and [[cryonics|cryonic preservation]]. Although neither is currently practical, they offer the possibility of [[sleeper ship]]s in which the passengers lie inert for the long duration of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Various articles on hibernation|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2006|volume=59|pages=81–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Frozen embryos ====
{{Main|Embryo colonization}}
A [[robotic]] interstellar mission carrying some number of frozen early stage human [[embryo]]s is another theoretical possibility. This method of [[space colonization]] requires, among other things, the development of an [[artificial uterus]], the prior detection of a habitable [[terrestrial planet]], and advances in the field of fully autonomous [[robotics|mobile robots]] and educational robots that would replace human parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crowl|first=A.|author2=Hunt, J. |author3=Hein, A.M. |title=Embryo Space Colonisation to Overcome the Interstellar Time Distance Bottleneck|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=2012|volume=65|pages=283–285|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2012.65.283|bibcode = 2012JBIS...65..283C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Island hopping through interstellar space ===
Interstellar space is not completely empty; it contains trillions of icy bodies ranging from small asteroids ([[Oort cloud]]) to possible [[rogue planet]]s. There may be ways to take advantage of these resources for a good part of an interstellar trip, slowly hopping from body to body or setting up waystations along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=21719|title=‘Island-Hopping’ to the Stars|work=Centauri Dreams|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fast missions ===
If a spaceship could average 10&amp;nbsp;percent of light speed (and decelerate at the destination, for manned missions), this would be enough to reach [[Proxima Centauri]] in forty years. Several propulsion concepts have been proposed &lt;ref name=crawist&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I. A.| date= 1990|title=Interstellar Travel: A Review for Astronomers|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=31|pages=377–400|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1990QJRAS..31..377C&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf|bibcode=1990QJRAS..31..377C}}&lt;/ref&gt; that might be eventually developed to accomplish this (see [[Interstellar travel#Propulsion|§ Propulsion]] below), but none of them are ready for near-term (few decades) developments at acceptable cost.

==== Time dilation ====
{{Main|Time dilation}}

Assuming faster-than-light travel is impossible, one might conclude that a human can never make a round-trip farther from Earth than 20 light years if the traveler is active between the ages of 20 and 60. A traveler would never be able to reach more than the very few star systems that exist within the limit of 20 light years from Earth. This, however, fails to take into account relativistic [[time dilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkinson|first1=Bradford W.|last2=Spilker|first2=James J. Jr.|last3=Axelrad|first3=Penina|last4=Enge|first4=Per|title=18.2.2.1Time Dilation|date=2014|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|isbn=978-1-56347-106-3|url=http://app.knovel.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/hotlink/pdf/rcid:kpGPSVTA03/id:kt00C9LNA2/global-positioning-system/time-dilation?kpromoter=federation.|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clocks aboard an interstellar ship would run slower than Earth clocks, so if a ship's engines were capable of continuously generating around 1&amp;nbsp;g of acceleration (which is comfortable for humans), the ship could reach almost anywhere in the galaxy and return to Earth within 40 years ship-time (see diagram). Upon return, there would be a difference between the time elapsed on the astronaut's ship and the time elapsed on Earth.

For example, a spaceship could travel to a star 32 light-years away, initially accelerating at a constant 1.03g (i.e. 10.1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for 1.32 years (ship time), then stopping its engines and coasting for the next 17.3 years (ship time) at a constant speed, then decelerating again for 1.32 ship-years, and coming to a stop at the destination. After a short visit, the astronaut could return to Earth the same way. After the full round-trip, the clocks on board the ship show that 40 years have passed, but according to those on Earth, the ship comes back 76 years after launch.

From the viewpoint of the astronaut, onboard clocks seem to be running normally. The star ahead seems to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 light years per ship-year. The universe would appear contracted along the direction of travel to half the size it had when the ship was at rest; the distance between that star and the Sun would seem to be 16 light years as measured by the astronaut.

At higher speeds, the time on board will run even slower, so the astronaut could travel to the center of the [[Milky Way]] (30,000 light years from Earth) and back in 40 years ship-time. But the speed according to Earth clocks will always be less than 1 light year per Earth year, so, when back home, the astronaut will find that more than 60 thousand years will have passed on Earth.

==== Constant acceleration ====
{{See also|Space travel using constant acceleration}}

[[File:Roundtriptimes.png|thumb|upright=1.4|This plot shows a ship capable of 1-[[Gravitational acceleration|g]] (10&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or about 1.0 ly/y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) "felt" or proper-acceleration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Clock paradox III | url= http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf}} {{cite book | author1= Taylor, Edwin F. | author2= Wheeler, John Archibald | date= 1966 | title= Spacetime Physics | publisher= W.H.

Regardless of how it is achieved, a propulsion system that could produce acceleration continuously from departure to arrival would be the fastest method of travel. A constant acceleration journey is one where the propulsion system accelerates the ship at a constant rate for the first half of the journey, and then decelerates for the second half, so that it arrives at the destination stationary relative to where it began.  If this were performed with an acceleration similar to that experienced at the Earth's surface, it would have the added advantage of producing artificial "gravity" for the crew. Supplying the energy required, however, would be prohibitively expensive with current technology.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, Benjamin (2011), Light and Matter Section 4.3&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of a planetary observer, the ship will appear to accelerate steadily at first, but then more gradually as it approaches the speed of light (which it cannot exceed). It will undergo [[hyperbolic motion (relativity)|hyperbolic motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Yagasaki|first1 = Kazuyuki|title = Invariant Manifolds And Control Of Hyperbolic Trajectories On Infinite- Or Finite-Time Intervals|journal = Dynamical Systems: an International Journal|date = 2008|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 309–331|doi = 10.1080/14689360802263571|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?sid=d00eb956-7105-4cbf-9f16-c9099d40da11%40sessionmgr4001&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%253fdirect%253dtrue%2526db%253dcph%2526AN%253d34168097%2526site%253deds-live%2526scope%253dsite%2526profile%253deds-main&amp;hid=4111&amp;vid=0&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=34168097&amp;db=cph|accessdate = 27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship will be close to the speed of light after about a year of accelerating and remain at that speed until it brakes for the end of the journey.

From the perspective of an onboard observer, the crew will feel a [[gravitational field]] opposite the engine's acceleration, and the universe ahead will appear to fall in that field, undergoing hyperbolic motion. As part of this, distances between objects in the direction of the ship's motion will gradually contract until the ship begins to decelerate, at which time an onboard observer's experience of the gravitational field will be reversed.

When the ship reaches its destination, if it were to exchange a message with its origin planet, it would find that less time had elapsed on board than had elapsed for the planetary observer, due to [[time dilation]] and [[length contraction]].

The result is an impressively fast journey for the crew.

== Propulsion ==

=== Rocket concepts ===
All rocket concepts are limited by the [[rocket equation]], which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, the ratio of initial (''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, including fuel) to final (''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, fuel depleted) mass.

Very high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], the ratio of thrust to total vehicle mass, is required to reach interstellar targets within sub-century time-frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= VISTA – A Vehicle for Interplanetary Space Transport Application Powered by Inertial Confinement Fusion | author= Orth, C. D. | date= 16 May 2003 | publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | url= https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/318478.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some heat transfer is inevitable and a tremendous heating load must be adequately handled.

Thus, for interstellar rocket concepts of all technologies, a key engineering problem (seldom explicitly discussed) is limiting the heat transfer from the exhaust stream back into the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Exploration of Space | author= Clarke, Arthur C. | publisher= New York: Harper | date= 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ion engine ====
A type of electric propulsion, spacecraft such as [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]] use an [[ion engine]]. In an ion engine, electric power is used to create charged particles of the propellant, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets is limited by the chemical energy stored in the fuel’s molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5&amp;nbsp;km/s. They produce a high thrust (about 10⁶ N), but they have a low specific impulse, and that limits their top speed. By contrast, ion engines have low force, but the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and on the gas ions being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15&amp;nbsp;km/s to 35&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name="http://www.iflscience.com"&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.iflscience.com/space/dawn-new-era-revolutionary-ion-engine-took-spacecraft-ceres | title= Dawn Of A New Era: The Revolutionary Ion Engine That Took Spacecraft To Ceres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nuclear fission powered ====

===== Fission-electric =====
Nuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, have the potential to reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles or nuclear-thermal rockets. Such vehicles probably have the potential to power solar system exploration with reasonable trip times within the current century. Because of their low-thrust propulsion, they would be limited to off-planet, deep-space operation. [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]] powered by a portable power-source, say a [[nuclear reactor]], producing only small accelerations, would take centuries to reach for example 15% of the [[velocity of light]], thus unsuitable for interstellar flight during a single human lifetime.&lt;ref name="scholar.googleusercontent.com"&gt;{{citation|url=http://daedalus-zvezdolet.narod.ru/doceng/07eng.doc |title=Project Daedalus: The Propulsion System Part 1; Theoretical considerations and calculations. 2.

===== Fission-fragment =====
[[Fission-fragment rocket]]s use [[nuclear fission]] to create high-speed jets of fission fragments, which are ejected at speeds of up to {{convert|12,000|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}}. With fission, the energy output is approximately 0.1% of the total mass-energy of the reactor fuel and limits the effective exhaust velocity to about 5% of the velocity of light. For maximum velocity, the reaction mass should optimally consist of fission products, the "ash" of the primary energy source, so no extra reaction mass need be bookkept in the mass ratio.

===== Nuclear pulse =====
{{Main|Nuclear pulse propulsion}}
[[File:Modern Pulsed Fission Propulsion Concept.jpg|thumb|Modern Pulsed Fission Propulsion Concept.]]Based on work in the late 1950s to the early 1960s, it has been technically possible to build spaceships with [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] engines, i.e. driven by a series of nuclear explosions. This propulsion system contains the prospect of very high [[specific impulse]] (space travel's equivalent of fuel economy) and high [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]].&lt;ref name="GeneralDynamics1964NuclearPulseVehicleCondensed"&gt;{{cite web

[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] team member [[Freeman Dyson]] proposed in 1968 an interstellar spacecraft using nuclear pulse propulsion that used pure [[deuterium fusion]] detonations with a very high fuel-[[burnup]] fraction. He computed an exhaust velocity of 15,000&amp;nbsp;km/s and a 100,000-tonne space vehicle able to achieve a 20,000&amp;nbsp;km/s [[delta-v]] allowing a flight-time to [[Alpha Centauri]] of 130 years.&lt;ref name="Interstellar Transport"&gt;{{cite journal

A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a [[magnetic sail]] to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Use of Mini-Mag Orion and superconducting coils for near-term interstellar transportation | author1= Lenard, Roger X. | author2= Andrews, Dana G. | journal= Acta Astronautica | date= June 2007 | volume= 61 | issue= 1–6 | url= http://www.space-nation.org/images/a/a1/Mini-Mag_Orion_and_superconducting_coils_for_near-term_interstellar_transportation_LenardAndrews.pdf | doi= 10.1016/j.actaastro.2007.01.052 | pages=450–458|bibcode = 2007AcAau..61..450L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include [[Project Longshot]], [[Project Daedalus]], and [[Mini-Mag Orion]]. The principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for interstellar flight without external power beaming and for very high-performance interplanetary flight.

In the 1970s the Nuclear Pulse Propulsion concept further was refined by [[Project Daedalus]] by use of externally triggered [[inertial confinement fusion]], in this case producing fusion explosions via compressing fusion fuel pellets with high-powered electron beams. Since then, [[laser]]s, [[ion beam]]s, [[neutral particle beam]]s and hyper-kinetic projectiles have been suggested to produce nuclear pulses for propulsion purposes.&lt;ref name="The Release of Thermonuclear Energy by Inertial Confinement"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A current impediment to the development of ''any'' nuclear-explosion-powered spacecraft is the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty]], which includes a prohibition on the detonation of any nuclear devices (even non-weapon based) in outer space. This treaty would, therefore, need to be renegotiated, although a project on the scale of an interstellar mission using currently foreseeable technology would probably require international cooperation on at least the scale of the [[International Space Station]].

Another issue to be considered, would be the [[g-force]]s imparted to a rapidly accelerated spacecraft, cargo, and passengers inside (see [[Inertia negation]]).

==== Nuclear fusion rockets ====
[[Fusion rocket]] starships, powered by [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, should conceivably be able to reach speeds of the order of 10% of that of light, based on energy considerations alone. In theory, a large number of stages could push a vehicle arbitrarily close to the speed of light.&lt;ref name="L.D. Jaffe 1963, pp. 49-58" /&gt; These would "burn" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li. Because fusion yields about 0.3–0.9% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases &lt;0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. The maximum exhaust velocities potentially energetically available are correspondingly higher than for fission, typically 4–10% of c. However, the most easily achievable fusion reactions release a large fraction of their energy as high-energy neutrons, which are a significant source of energy loss. Thus, although these concepts seem to offer the best (nearest-term) prospects for travel to the nearest stars within a (long) human lifetime, they still involve massive technological and engineering difficulties, which may turn out to be intractable for decades or centuries.

[[File:Daedalus ship.png|thumb|Daedalus interstellar vehicle.]]Early studies include [[Project Daedalus]], performed by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] in 1973–1978, and [[Project Longshot]], a student project sponsored by [[NASA]] and the [[US Naval Academy]], completed in 1988. Another fairly detailed vehicle system, "Discovery II",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051632/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-213559.pdf PDF] C. R. Williams et al., 'Realizing "2001: A Space Odyssey": Piloted Spherical Torus Nuclear Fusion Propulsion', 2001, 52 pages, NASA Glenn Research Center&lt;/ref&gt; designed and optimized for crewed Solar System exploration, based on the D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He reaction but using hydrogen as reaction mass, has been described by a team from NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]]. It achieves characteristic velocities of &gt;300&amp;nbsp;km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7•10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'', with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%. Although these are still far short of the requirements for interstellar travel on human timescales, the study seems to represent a reasonable benchmark towards what may be approachable within several decades, which is not impossibly beyond the current state-of-the-art. Based on the concept's 2.2% [[burnup]] fraction it could achieve a pure fusion product exhaust velocity of ~3,000&amp;nbsp;km/s.

==== Antimatter rockets ====
{{Main|Antimatter rocket}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
An [[antimatter rocket]] would have a far higher energy density and specific impulse than any other proposed class of rocket.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt; If energy resources and efficient production methods are found to make [[antimatter]] in the quantities required and store&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/engineering/storing-antimatter|title=Storing antimatter - CERN|website=home.web.cern.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2011/06/05/alpha-quarter-hour/|title=ALPHA Stores Antimatter Atoms Over a Quarter of an Hour – and Still Counting - Berkeley Lab|date=5 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it safely, it would be theoretically possible to reach speeds of several tens of percent that of light.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt; Whether antimatter propulsion could lead to the higher speeds (&gt;90% that of light) at which relativistic [[time dilation]] would become more noticeable, thus making time pass at a slower rate for the travelers as perceived by an outside observer, is doubtful owing to the large quantity of antimatter that would be required.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt;

Speculating that production and storage of antimatter should become feasible, two further issues need to be considered. First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the energy is lost as high-energy [[gamma radiation]], and especially also as [[neutrino]]s, so that only about 40% of ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally.&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt; Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.

Second, heat transfer from the exhaust to the vehicle seems likely to transfer enormous wasted energy into the ship (e.g. for 0.1''g'' ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding was provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.

More recently, [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] proposed that a matter-antimatter GeV gamma ray laser photon rocket is possible by a relativistic proton-antiproton pinch discharge, where the recoil from the laser beam is transmitted by the [[Mössbauer effect]] to the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="AA-20120821"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winterberg |first=F. |title=Matter–antimatter gigaelectron volt gamma ray laser rocket propulsion |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576512002640 |date=21 August 2012 |journal=[[Acta Astronautica]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=34–39 |accessdate=25 April 2015 |bibcode = 2012AcAau..81...34W |doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rockets with an external energy source ====
Rockets deriving their power from external sources, such as a [[laser]], could replace their internal energy source with an energy collector, potentially reducing the mass of the ship greatly and allowing much higher travel speeds. [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] has proposed for an [[interstellar probe]], with energy supplied by an external laser from a base station powering an [[Ion thruster]].&lt;ref name="geoffreylandis.com"&gt;{{cite conference | url= http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion_pres.htp | title= Laser-powered Interstellar Probe | author= Landis, Geoffrey A. | conference= Conference on Practical Robotic Interstellar Flight | location= NY University, New York, NY | date= 29 August 1994 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131002200923/http://www.geoffreylandis.com/laser_ion_pres.htp | archivedate= 2 October 2013 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-rocket concepts ===
A problem with all traditional rocket propulsion methods is that the spacecraft would need to carry its fuel with it, thus making it very massive, in accordance with the [[rocket equation]]. Several concepts attempt to escape from this problem:&lt;ref name="crawist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Bolonkin (2005). ''Non Rocket Space Launch and Flight''. Elsevier. {{ISBN|978-0-08-044731-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interstellar ramjets ====
In 1960, [[Robert W. Bussard]] proposed the [[Bussard ramjet]], a fusion rocket in which a huge scoop would collect the diffuse hydrogen in interstellar space, "burn" it on the fly using a [[proton–proton chain reaction]], and expel it out of the back. Later calculations with more accurate estimates suggest that the thrust generated would be less than the drag caused by any conceivable scoop design.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Yet the idea is attractive because the fuel would be collected ''en route'' (commensurate with the concept of ''energy harvesting''), so the craft could theoretically accelerate to near the speed of light. The limitation is due to the fact that the reaction can only accelerate the propellant to 0.12c. Thus the drag of catching interstellar dust and the thrust of accelerating that same dust to 0.12c would be the same when the speed is 0.12c, preventing further acceleration.

==== Beamed propulsion ====
[[File:Forward-sailcraft-scheme.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates [[Robert L. Forward]]'s scheme for slowing down an interstellar [[solar sail|light-sail]] at the star system destination.]]

A [[solar sail|light sail]] or [[magnetic sail]] powered by a massive [[laser]] or particle accelerator in the home star system could potentially reach even greater speeds than rocket- or pulse propulsion methods, because it would not need to carry its own [[reaction mass]] and therefore would only need to accelerate the craft's [[Payload (air and spacecraft)|payload]]. [[Robert L. Forward]] proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar light sail in the destination star system without requiring a laser array to be present in that system. In this scheme, a smaller secondary sail is deployed to the rear of the spacecraft, whereas the large primary sail is detached from the craft to keep moving forward on its own. Light is reflected from the large primary sail to the secondary sail, which is used to decelerate the secondary sail and the spacecraft payload.&lt;ref name="Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Forward, R.L. | title=Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails | journal=J Spacecraft | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=187–195 | date=1984 | doi=10.2514/3.8632 |bibcode = 1984JSpRo..21..187F }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Geoffrey A. Landis]] of [[NASA]]'s Glen Research center also proposed a laser-powered, propulsion, sail ship that would host a diamond sail (of a few nanometers thick) powered with the use of [[solar energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&amp;u=mcc_pv&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A444067493&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon|title=Alpha Centauri: Our First Target for Interstellar Probes|last=|first=|date=|via=go.galegroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this proposal, this interstellar ship would, theoretically, be able to reach 10 percent the speed of light.

A [[magnetic sail]] could also decelerate at its destination without depending on carried fuel or a driving beam in the destination system, by interacting with the plasma found in the solar wind of the destination star and the interstellar medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magnetic Sails and Interstellar Travel |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |date=1990 |last=Andrews |first=Dana G. |last2=Zubrin |first2=Robert M. |volume=43 |pages=265–272 |url=http://www.lunarsail.com/LightSail/msit.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012182359/http://www.lunarsail.com/LightSail/msit.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-10-12 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/fellows/nov99/320Zubrin.pdf |format=PDF |title=NIAC Study of the Magnetic Sail |last=Zubrin |first=Robert |last2=Martin |first2=Andrew |date=1999-08-11 |accessdate=2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pre-accelerated fuel ====
Achieving start-stop interstellar trip times of less than a human lifetime require mass-ratios of between 1,000 and 1,000,000, even for the nearer stars. This could be achieved by multi-staged vehicles on a vast scale.&lt;ref name="L.D. Jaffe 1963, pp. 49-58"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.F. Spencer |author2=L.D.

=== Theoretical concepts ===

==== Faster-than-light travel ====
[[File:Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA.jpg|thumb|Artist's depiction of a hypothetical ''Wormhole Induction Propelled Spacecraft'', based loosely on the 1994 [[Alcubierre drive|"warp drive"]] paper of [[Miguel Alcubierre]].]]
{{Main|Faster-than-light}}

Scientists and authors have postulated a number of ways by which it might be possible to surpass the speed of light, but even the most serious-minded of these are highly speculative.&lt;ref name="crawftl"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Ian A.|title=Some thoughts on the implications of faster-than-light interstellar space travel|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=1995|volume=36|pages=205–218|bibcode=1995QJRAS..36..205C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also debatable whether faster-than-light travel is physically possible, in part because of [[Tachyonic antitelephone|causality]] concerns: travel faster than light may, under certain conditions, permit travel backwards in time within the context of [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feinberg|first1=G.|title=Possibility of faster-than-light particles|journal=Physical Review|date=1967|volume=159|issue=5|pages=1089–1105|doi=10.1103/physrev.159.1089|bibcode = 1967PhRv..159.1089F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed mechanisms for [[faster-than-light]] travel within the theory of general relativity require the existence of [[exotic matter]]&lt;ref name="crawftl" /&gt; and it is not known if this could be produced in sufficient quantity.

===== Alcubierre drive =====

{{Main|Alcubierre drive}}
In physics, the [[Alcubierre drive]] is based on an argument, within the framework of [[general relativity]] and without the introduction of [[wormhole]]s, that it is possible to modify a spacetime in a way that allows a spaceship to travel with an arbitrarily large speed by a local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it.&lt;ref name="Warp Alcubierre"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |year=1994 |last=Alcubierre |first=Miguel |volume=11 |issue=5 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/11/5/001 |accessdate=2015-09-01 |pages=L73–L77|arxiv = gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode = 1994CQGra..11L..73A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this concept would require the spaceship to incorporate a region of [[exotic matter]], or hypothetical concept of [[negative mass]].&lt;ref name="Warp Alcubierre" /&gt;

===== Artificial black hole =====

{{Main|Black hole starship}}
A theoretical idea for enabling interstellar travel is by propelling a starship by creating an artificial black hole and using a parabolic reflector to reflect its Hawking radiation. Although beyond current technological capabilities, a black hole starship offers some advantages compared to other possible methods. Getting the black hole to act as a power source and engine also requires a way to convert the Hawking radiation into energy and thrust. One potential method involves placing the hole at the focal point of a parabolic reflector attached to the ship, creating forward thrust. A slightly easier, but less efficient method would involve simply absorbing all the gamma radiation heading towards the fore of the ship to push it onwards, and let the rest shoot out the back.&lt;ref name="cranewestmoreland2009"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.1803 "Are Black Hole Starships Possible?"], Louis Crane, Shawn Westmoreland, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427361.000-dark-power-grand-designs-for-interstellar-travel.html |title=Dark power: Grand designs for interstellar travel |journal=New Scientist |date=25 November 2009 |issue=2736 |last=Chown |first=Marcus}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5391989/a-black-hole-engine-that-could-power-spaceships A Black Hole Engine That Could Power Spaceships]. Tim Barribeau, November 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Wormholes =====
[[Wormhole]]s are conjectural distortions in spacetime that theorists postulate could connect two arbitrary points in the universe, across an [[Einstein–Rosen Bridge]]. It is not known whether wormholes are possible in practice. Although there are solutions to the Einstein equation of general relativity that allow for wormholes, all of the currently known solutions involve some assumption, for example the existence of [[negative mass]], which may be unphysical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/ideachev.html#worm |title=Ideas Based On What We’d Like To Achieve: Worm Hole transportation |publisher=NASA Glenn Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cramer ''et al.'' argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by [[cosmic string]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= John G.

== Designs and studies ==

=== Enzmann starship ===
{{Main|Enzmann starship}}
The Enzmann starship, as detailed by [[G. Harry Stine]] in the October 1973 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', was a design for a future [[starship]], based on the ideas of Robert Duncan-Enzmann. The spacecraft itself as proposed used a 12,000,000 ton ball of frozen [[deuterium]] to power 12–24 thermonuclear pulse propulsion units. Twice as long as the [[Empire State Building]] and assembled in-orbit, the spacecraft was part of a larger project preceded by [[interstellar probe]]s and telescopic observation of target star systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=1142 |work=Centauri Dreams |title=A Note on the Enzmann Starship |first=Paul |last=Gilster |date=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA research ===
[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] has been researching interstellar travel since its formation, translating important foreign language papers and conducting early studies on applying fusion propulsion, in the 1960s, and laser propulsion, in the 1970s, to interstellar travel.

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (terminated in FY 2003 after a 6-year, $1.2-million study, because "No breakthroughs appear imminent.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp] "Breakthrough Propulsion Physics" project at NASA Glenn Research Center, Nov 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; identified some breakthroughs that are needed for interstellar travel to be possible.&lt;ref name="NASAWarpDriveBreakthruTechs"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/warp.html http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/warp.html] ''Warp Drive, When? Breakthrough Technologies'' January 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey A. Landis]] of NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]] states that a laser-powered interstellar sail ship could possibly be launched within 50 years, using new methods of space travel. "I&amp;nbsp;think that ultimately we're going to do it, it's just a question of when and who," Landis said in an interview. Rockets are too slow to send humans on interstellar missions. Instead, he envisions interstellar craft with extensive sails, propelled by laser light to about one-tenth the speed of light. It would take such a ship about 43 years to reach Alpha Centauri if it passed through the system without stopping. Slowing down to stop at Alpha Centauri could increase the trip to 100 years,&lt;ref name="Malik20020319"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327233721/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }} Malik, Tariq, "Sex and Society Aboard the First Starships." Science Tuesday, Space.com March 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a journey without slowing down raises the issue of making sufficiently accurate and useful observations and measurements during a fly-by.

=== 100 Year Starship study ===
The [[100 Year Starship]] (100YSS) is the name of the overall effort that will, over the next century, work toward achieving interstellar travel. The effort will also go by the moniker 100YSS. The 100 Year Starship study is the name of a one-year project to assess the attributes of and lay the groundwork for an organization that can carry forward the 100 Year Starship vision.

== Feasibility ==
The energy requirements make interstellar travel very difficult. It has been reported that at the 2008 Joint Propulsion Conference, multiple experts opined that it was improbable that humans would ever explore beyond the Solar System.&lt;ref name="O’Neill"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ian |last=O’Neill |date=Aug 19, 2008 |work=Universe Today |title=Interstellar travel may remain in science fiction |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2008/08/19/bad-news-insterstellar-travel-may-remain-in-science-fiction/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brice N. Cassenti, an associate professor with the Department of Engineering and Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, stated that at least 100 times the total energy output of the entire world [in a given year] would be required to send a probe to the nearest star.&lt;ref name="O’Neill" /&gt;

Astrophysicist Sten Odenwald stated that the basic problem is that through intensive studies of thousands of detected exoplanets, most of the closest destinations within 50 light years do not yield Earth-like planets in the star's habitable zones.&lt;ref name="Odenwald"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sten |last=Odenwald |date=April 2, 2015 |work=Huffington Post Blog |title=Interstellar travel: Where should we go?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-sten-odenwald/interstellar-travel-so-where-should-we-go_b_6971584.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the multi-trillion-dollar expense of some of the proposed technologies, travelers will have to spend up to 200 years traveling at 20% the speed of light to reach the best known destinations. Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), they will not be able to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.

Moving at a speed close to the speed of light and encountering even a tiny stationary object like a grain of sand will have fatal consequences. For example, a gram of matter moving at 90% of the speed of light contains a kinetic energy corresponding to a small nuclear bomb (around 30kt TNT).

=== Interstellar missions not for human benefit ===

Explorative high-speed missions to [[Alpha Centauri]], as planned for by the [[Breakthrough Starshot|Breakthrough Starshot initiative]], are projected to be realizable within the [[21st century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1710.10732|last1=Kulkarni|first1=Neeraj|title=Relativistic Spacecraft Propelled by Directed Energy|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=155|issue=4|pages=155|last2=Lubin|first2=Philip|last3=Zhang|first3=Qicheng|year=2017|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aaafd2|bibcode=2018AJ....155..155K}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is alternatively possible to plan for unmanned slow-cruising missions taking millennia to arrive. These probes would not be for human benefit in the sense that one can not foresee whether there would be anybody around on earth interested in then back-transmitted science data. An example would be the Genesis mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=Claudius |title=Developing ecospheres on transiently habitable planets: the genesis project |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |date=5 September 2016 |volume=361 |issue=10 |doi=10.1007/s10509-016-2911-0|arxiv=1608.06087 |bibcode=2016Ap&amp;SS.361..324G }}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to bring unicellular life, in the spirit of [[directed panspermia]], to habitable but otherwise barren planets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/08/genesis-missions/497258/ How to Jumpstart Life Elsewhere in Our Galaxy], The Atlantic, 08-25-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively slow cruising Genesis probes, with a typical speed of &lt;math&gt;c/300&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to about &lt;math&gt;1000\,\mbox{km/s}&lt;/math&gt;, can be decelerated using a [[magnetic sail]]. Unmanned missions not for human benefit would hence be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2153165-should-we-seed-life-through-the-cosmos-using-laser-driven-ships/ Should we seed life through the cosmos using laser-driven ships?], New Scientist, 11-13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery of Earth-Like planets ==

In February 2017, NASA announced that its [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] had revealed seven Earth-size planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star 40 light-years away from our solar system.&lt;ref name="NASA Press Release Feb 22nd 2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Press Release Feb 22nd 2017 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-telescope-reveals-largest-batch-of-earth-size-habitable-zone-planets-around }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water. The discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – the key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1475">The '''K-NFB Reader''' (an acronym for '''Kurzweil — National Federation of the Blind Reader''') is a handheld electronic reading device for the [[Blindness|blind]]. It was developed in a partnership between [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[National Federation of the Blind]].

The original version of the reader was composed of a [[digital camera]] and a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]], which contained specialised [[optical character recognition|OCR]] software and [[Speech synthesis|speech synthesizers]] to read the scanned material aloud.  It was released at a price of $3,495.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The KNFB Reader becomes the Property of the Nation's Blind|url=https://nfb.org/images/nfb/publications/bm/bm15/bm1506/bm150603.htm|accessdate=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software was later ported to the [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] operating system, to be used on [[Nokia N82]] [[camera phone]]s, with a new price of $1,595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KNFB Reader Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|archivedate=2009-02-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208144803/http://knfbreader.com/faq.php|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an [[iOS]] port was released at a price of $99.  An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was released shortly after.

[[Image:Liberty.png|thumbnail|right|Logo of the LPF]]
'''League for Programming Freedom''' (LPF) was founded in 1989 by [[Richard Stallman]] to unite [[free software]] developers as well as developers of [[proprietary software]] to fight against [[software patent]]s and the extension of the scope of [[copyright]]. Their logo is the [[Statue of Liberty]] holding a [[floppy disk]] and [[Magnetic tape data storage|tape spool]].

Among other initiatives, the League started the "Burn all [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]]s" campaign in opposition to the actions of [[Unisys]] in enforcing their patent on [[Lempel-Ziv-Welch|LZW]] compression used by [[CompuServe]] when creating the image format.

The League produced a newsletter, ''Programming Freedom''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://progfree.org/Newsletter/newsletter.html |title=Programming Freedom, the Newsletter of the League for Programming Freedom (LPF) |publisher=League for Programming Freedom |work=Progfree.org |volume= |quote= |issue= |accessdate=2011-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727190452/http://www.progfree.org/Newsletter/newsletter.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 issues in 1991-1995. These primary source materials chronicle the work of the organization.

The single event that had the most influence on the creation of the League was [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s lawsuits against [[Microsoft]] about supposed copyrights violations of the [[look and feel]] of the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] in the development of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].  After the lawsuit ended, the League went dormant, to be resurrected by those who were increasingly troubled by the enforcement of software patents.

In September 2009, LPF President Dean Anderson sent a notice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://progfree.org/return.html |title=Letter to Former Members of LPF |author=Dean Anderson |author2=LPF Board of Directors |publisher=League for Programming Freedom |work=Progfree.org |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2011-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006164520/http://progfree.org/return.html |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to former members announcing the return of the LPF and reviving its membership, with plans for an election on 12 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://progfree.org/2010-Annual-Meeting.html |title=Notice of Annual Meeting |publisher=League for Programming Freedom |work=Progfree.org |accessdate=2011-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006164601/http://progfree.org/2010-Annual-Meeting.html |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Standardgraph 2522 2.5–7 mm lettering guides.jpg|thumb|350px|{{convert|2.5|to|7|mm|1}} lettering guides for technical drawings]]
[[Image:Pennini da normografo.jpg|thumb|Lettering pens for lettering guide template]]

A '''lettering guide template''' is a special type of [[stencil|template]] used to write uniform characters. It consists of a sheet of plastic or other material with cut-outs of letters, numbers, and other shapes used especially for creating technical drawings. For decades they have been essential for lettering a [[drawing nameplate]] so text and other designs could be made quickly and uniformly.

Although they have been superseded by the use of computers,  during the greater part of the last century they were used to relatively ease the lettering process in the creation of technical drawings. They were an indispensable tool for [[architect]]s and [[Technical drawing|technical illustrators]] in general, for labeling their drawings and plans but also for the description of projects, in which it was good practice to use a lettering template to achieve uniform and well-written text.

A lettering template could also be used by people [[illiteracy|illiterate]] or semi-illiterate to learn to type, or improve their handwriting.  In the course of political history some politicians, such as [[Bettino Craxi]], have used them to help people with writing difficulties. They distributed cardboard templates with the sequence of characters of their last name, so they could be easily written during the [[vote|voting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1992/03/20/spini-il-normografo-lecito-purche-il.html|title=Spini: il normografo è lecito purché il voto resti segreto|publisher=[[La Repubblica]]|date=20 March 1992|page=10|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9714">The '''Lorenz beam''' was [[Instrument Landing System|blind-landing]] radio navigation system developed by [[C. Lorenz AG]] in [[Berlin]]. The first system had been installed in 1932 at Berlin-[[Tempelhof Central Airport]], followed by [[Dübendorf Air Base|Dübendorf]] in [[Switzerland]] (1934) and others all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;For example at [[Essendon Airport]] (Australia) in November 1936, according to: [http://www.airwaysmuseum.com/Lorenz%20system%20article.htm The 33Mc 'Lorenz' Radio Range System]&lt;/ref&gt; The Lorenz company referred to it simply as the '''Ultrakurzwellen-Landefunkfeuer''', [[German language|German]] for "ultra-short-wave landing radio beacon", or '''LFF'''. Prior to the [[World War II]] the Germans had deployed the landing aid system at many [[Luftwaffe]] airfields in and outside Germany and equipped most of their bombers with the radio equipment needed to use it. The RAF continued using the system as late as 1960 at RAF Ternhill, under the name '''Standard Beam Approach''' (SBA).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Blanchard, "Hyperbolic Airborne Radio Navigation Aids", ''The Journal of Navigation'', Volume 44 Number 3, September 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic idea behind the short-range LFF system was later developed into a long-range system for air navigation known as '''Elektra'''. Further development produced a system that worked over very long distances, hundreds or thousands of kilometres, known as '''[[Sonne (navigation)|Sonne]]''' (or often, '''Elektra-Sonnen''') that allowed aircraft and [[U-Boat]]s to take fixes far into the Atlantic. The British captured Sonne receivers and maps and started to use it for their own navigation under the name '''Consol'''.

==Description==
The blind approach navigation system was developed starting in 1932 by Dr. Ernst Kramar of the Lorenz company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radarworld.org/flightnav.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted by [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Deutsche Lufthansa]] in 1934 and sold around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Brown, ''A Radar History of World War II: Technical and Military Imperatives'', CRC Press, 1999, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The Lorenz company was founded in 1880 by Carl Lorenz and is now part of [[ITT Corporation|ITT]]. 

Lorenz used a single radio [[transmitter]] at 33.33&amp;nbsp;MHz (Anflugfunkfeuer) and three [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] placed in a line parallel to the end of the [[runway]]. The center antenna was always powered, while the other two were short circuited by a mechanical rotary switch turned by a simple motor. This resulted in a "kidney" shaped broadcast pattern centered on one of the two "side" antennas depending on which antenna had been short-circuited. The contacts on the switch were set so that one antenna was shorted for the time to be considered a "Dot" by a morse operator and the other as a "Dash". The signal could be detected for some distance off the end of the runway, as much as 30&amp;nbsp;km. The Lorenz obtained a sharper beam than could be created by an aerial array by having two lobes of signal.&lt;ref name=Jones78&gt;[[R. V.

A pilot approaching the runway would tune his radio to the broadcast frequency and listen for the signal. If he heard a series of dots, he knew he was off the runway centerline to the left (the ''dot-sector'') and had to turn to the right to line up with the runway. If he was to the right, he would hear a series of dashes instead (the ''dash-sector''), and turned left. The key to the operation of the system was an area in the middle where the two signals overlapped. The dots of the one signal "filled in" the dashes of the other, resulting in a steady tone known as the ''equi-signal''. By adjusting his path until he heard the equi-signal, the pilot could align his aircraft with the runway for landing.

Two small [[marker beacon]]s were also used: one 300&amp;nbsp;m off the end of runway, the ''HEZ'' (Haupteinflugzeichen), and another 3&amp;nbsp;km away, the ''VEZ'' (Voreinflugzeichen), both were broadcast on 38&amp;nbsp;MHz and modulated at 1700 and 700&amp;nbsp;Hz, respectively. These signals were broadcast directly upward, and would be heard briefly as the aircraft flew over them. To approach the runway, the pilot would fly to a published altitude and then use the main directional signals to line up with the runway and started flying toward it. When he flew over the {{audio|Lorenz-VEZ.ogg|VEZ}}, he would start descending on a standard [[glide slope]], continuing to land or abort at the {{audio|Lorenz-HEZ.ogg|HEZ}}, depending on whether or not he could see the runway.

Lorenz could fly a plane down a straight line with relatively high accuracy, enough so that the aircraft could then find the runway visually in all but the worst conditions. However it required a fairly constant monitoring of the radio by the pilot, who would often also be tasked with talking to the local [[control tower]]. In order to ease the workload, Lorenz later introduced a cockpit indicator that could listen to the signals and display the direction to the runway centerline as an arrow telling the pilot which direction to turn. The indicator also included two [[neon lamps]] to indicate when the aircraft crossed over each of the marker beacons. Later derivatives of the system had signals of equal length in the pattern left-right-silence, to operate a visual indicator in the cabin.

The Lorenz system was similar to the Diamond-Dunmore equi-signal radio guidance system, developed by the US Bureau of Standards in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Diamond and F. Dunmore, [http://www.pnas.org/content/16/11/678.full.pdf "A Radio System for Blind Landing of Aircraft in Fog"], ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', Volume 16 (19 September 1930), pp. 678-685&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use for blind bombing==
In the [[Second World War]] the Lorenz beam principle was used by the German [[Luftwaffe]] as the basis of a number of blind bombing aids, notably [[Knickebein]] ('crooked leg') and the [[X-Gerät]] ('X-Apparatus'), in their bombing offensive against English cities during the winter of 1940/41. Knickebein was very similar to LFF, modifying it only slightly to be more highly directional and work over much longer distance. Using the same frequencies allowed their [[bomber]]s to use the already-installed LFF receivers, although a second receiver was needed in order to pinpoint a single location.

The [[X-Gerät]] involved cross-beams of the same characteristics but on different frequencies, which would both enable the pilot to calculate his speed (from the time between crossing the Fore Cross Signal and crossing the Main Cross Signal), and indicate when he should drop his payload. The calculation was performed by a mechanical computer. Lorenz modified this system to create the Viktoria/Hawaii lateral guidance system for the [[V-2]] rocket.

==Allied jamming effort==
{{Main|Battle of the Beams}}
When the British discovered the existence of the 'Knickebein' system, they rapidly jammed it, however the 'X-Gerät' was not successfully jammed for quite some time.  A later innovation by the Germans was the 'Baedeker' or 'Taub' modification, which used supersonic modulation.  This was so quickly jammed that the Germans practically gave up on the use of beam-bombing systems, with the exception of the 'FuGe 25A', which operated for a short time towards the end of [[Operation Steinbock]], known as the "Baby Blitz".

A further operational drawback of the system was that bombers had to follow a fixed course between the beam transmitter station and the target; once the beam had been detected, defensive measures were made more effective by knowledge of the course.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Denis G. G. Lepage,''Aircraft of the Luftwaffe 1935-1945: An Illustrated History'', McFarland, 2009,{{ISBN|0-7864-3937-8}}, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sonne/Consol==
{{Main|Sonne (navigation)}}

'Sonne' (Eng. 'Sun') was a derivation of Lorenz used by the Luftwaffe for long-range navigation out over the Atlantic using transmitters in Occupied Europe, and another in neutral Spain, and after its existence had been discovered by the British, under the direction of [[Reginald Victor Jones|R. V. Jones]] it was allowed to continue in use, un-jammed, because it was felt that it was actually more useful to [[RAF Coastal Command]] than it was to the Germans. In British use the German system was named 'Consol', and it remained un-jammed for the period of the war.

==Sonne/Consol after World War II==

The long range version developed by the Germans during the war was used by many countries for civilian purposes after the war, mostly under its English name Consol. Transmitters were installed in the US, the UK and the USSR.

==Technical considerations==
The reason the Lorenz beam principle was necessary, with its overlapping beams, was because the sharpness of a beam increases approximately logarithmically with the length of the aerial array with which it is generated. A law of [[diminishing returns]] operates, such that to attain the sharpness achieved by the Lorenz system with a single beam (approximately 1 mile wide over a range of two hundred miles), an array of prohibitive size would be required.

'''Lyman James Briggs''' (May 7, 1874 – March 25, 1963) was an American engineer, physicist and administrator.  He was a director of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] during the [[Great Depression]] and chairman of the [[Uranium Committee]] before America entered the Second World War. The [[Lyman Briggs College]] at [[Michigan State University]] is named in his honor.

== Life and work ==
Briggs was born on a farm in [[Assyria, Michigan]], near [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]. He was the eldest of two brothers in a family that descended from [[Clement Briggs]], who arrived in America in 1621 on the ''[[Fortune (Plymouth Colony ship)|Fortune]]'', the first ship to follow the ''[[Mayflower]]''. He grew up in an outdoor life with duties to attend such as would be found on an active farm in the late 19th century. He went to the [[Briggs School]] built by his grandfather and later was a teacher there.

Briggs entered [[Michigan Agricultural College]] (now [[Michigan State University]]) in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], entering by examination at age 15. Michigan State was a [[Land Grant college]], so courses were taught in agriculture and mechanical arts. He majored in agriculture, but by graduation time in 1893 his interests had moved on to mechanical engineering and physics. He next entered the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], completing a master's degree in [[physics]] in 1895. From there he entered [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and began work on his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]].

In 1896 Briggs married Katharine Cook whom he met as an undergraduate at Michigan Agricultural College. Lyman and Katharine Cook Briggs had two children, a boy, Albert (known as "Bertie") and a girl, [[Isabel Briggs Myers|Isabel]]. Albert died in infancy, and Isabel would eventually marry Clarence Myers and go on to generate the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]] with her mother ([http://www.capt.org/mbti-assessment/isabel-myers.htm]).

In 1896 he also joined the [[US Department of Agriculture]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] While in Washington, he also continued his research at Johns Hopkins under [[Henry Augustus Rowland]]. Although he spent time working with the newly discovered [[Roentgen Rays]], he ultimately graduated in 1903 with a Ph.D. in agriculture with a dissertation ''On the absorption of water vapor and of certain salts in aqueous solution by quartz''. He was also elected to the [[Cosmos Club]] the same year.

===US Department of Agriculture===
In Briggs' first professional position he was put in charge of the Physics Laboratory (later the [[Bureau of Soils]]) of the [[US Department of Agriculture]]. He was one of a new breed of multi-disciplinary scientists studying the [[biology]] and [[ecology]] of plant life. His research work was concentrated on water retention of soils and he was a founder of the science of [[soil physics]]. In 1906 he devised a soil classification technique called the [[moisture equivalent]] based on centrifuging, which is now thought of as the first [[Pedotransfer function]]. In the same year he also organized a biophysical laboratory that later became the [[Bureau of Plant Industry (United States)|Bureau of Plant Industry]]. Briggs worked with [[Homer Leroy Shantz]] on the effect of environment on the water uptake by plants, and was an early contributor to ecology.

===World War I===
Briggs was detailed by an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] to the [[Department of Commerce]]'s [[Bureau of Standards]] in 1917 due to mobilization pressures of World War I. There he developed an artificial horizon device for naval vessels with [[John Hayford]] which established a stable zenith independent of the roll of the vessel for the aiming of naval guns. This allowed for the roll of the ship to be observed, so that the firing of the guns could be timed with the roll of the ship. The device was so successful it found its way into the control rooms of most naval vessels. A confidential report called the Hayford–Briggs report was given to the Navy, but never published.

===National Bureau of Standards (1917–1945)===
In 1920 Briggs officially left the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and joined the National Bureau of Standards, where he was chief of the Engineering Physics Division (later the Mechanics and Sound Division). He appointed [[Hugh L. Dryden]] to head the Aerodynamics Physics Section, and together they pioneered research in the [[aerodynamics]] of airfoils moving near the [[speed of sound]] in an airstream. This work had significant application in developing blade forms for aircraft propellers.

He also retained an interest in navigational devices, and with [[Paul R. Heyl]] invented the [[Heyl–Briggs earth inductor compass]][http://oldbeacon.com/beacon/earth_inductor_compass.htm]. The compass used a spinning electric coil subjected to the magnetic field of the Earth to determine the bearing of an airplane in relation to the Earth's [[magnetic field]]. For this invention, they received the [[Magellanic Premium|Magellan Medal]] of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1922. This type of compass was used by [[Admiral Byrd]] in his flight to the [[North Pole]] and by [[Charles Lindbergh]] on his 1927 trans-Atlantic flight.

In 1926 Briggs was appointed assistant director for research and testing by National Bureau of Standards Director [[George Kimball Burgess]]. On Burgess's death in 1932, Briggs was nominated by [[US President]] [[Herbert C. Hoover]] to Burgess as director of the National Bureau of Standards. However, none of Hoover's nominations were acted on by the [[US Congress]] before he left office. After [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] took office as president in 1933 he was pressed to name "a good Democrat" as director of the National Bureau of Standards. Roosevelt, not wishing to make a patronage appointment, replied, "I haven't the slightest idea whether Briggs is a Republican or a Democrat; all I know is that he is the best qualified man for the job." {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Briggs took over the Bureau during difficult times. It was the height of the depression and his first task was to reduce costs 50%. He managed to save the jobs of about 2/3 of the career employees by putting many on part-time employment and transferring others to the [[American Standards Association]] while they continued their work at the bureau. He emphasized doing work with direct economic impact and got money from the [[Works Progress Administration]] to hire unemployed mathematicians to develop math tables. Due to Briggs outstanding persuasive powers, he managed to get Congress to increase its appropriation for the Bureau in 1935, and many of the employees that were let go were re-hired.

===Uranium Committee (1939–1941)===
[[Image:S1 Committee 1942.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|S-1 Executive Committee at the [[Bohemian Grove]], September 13, 1942. From left to right are [[Harold C. Urey]], [[Ernest O. Lawrence]], [[James B. Conant]], [[Lyman J. Briggs]], [[E. V. Murphree]] and [[Arthur Compton]]]]
In 1939, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] called on Briggs, by then aged 65, to head the [[Advisory Committee on Uranium]] to investigate the fission of uranium, as a result of the [[Einstein–Szilárd letter]]. Even though Roosevelt had sanctioned a project, progress was slow and was not directed exclusively towards military applications.  [[Eugene Wigner]] said that "We often felt we were swimming in syrup".  [[Boris Pregel]] said "It is wonder that after so many blunders and mistakes anything was accomplished at all".  [[Leó Szilárd]] believed that the project was delayed for a least a year by the short-sightedness and sluggishness of the authorities.  At the time Briggs was not well and was due to undergo a serious operation.  He was unable to take the energetic action that was often needed.

Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom German refugees [[Otto Frisch]] and [[Rudolf Peierls]] under professor [[Marcus Oliphant]] made a breakthrough, indicating that it would be possible to make a bomb from purified [[U-235]].  From June 1940, copies of British progress reports were sent to Briggs via a British contact in Washington, [[Ralph H. Fowler]].  In March 1941 a British committee of Nobel Prize–winning scientists, called the [[MAUD Committee]], concluded that an atomic bomb was "not only feasible, it was inevitable".  They also pointed out that a large part of a laboratory in Berlin had been devoted to nuclear research.  A copy of the MAUD Committee's interim report was sent to the Briggs in the USA because Britain lacked the resources to undertake such a large and urgent program on its own.  Britain also wished to move its key research facilities to safety across the Atlantic.  The MAUD Committee issued another report giving technical details on the design and costs on 15 July 1941.

Britain was at war and felt an atomic bomb should have the highest priority, especially because the Germans might soon have one; but the US was not at war at that time and many Americans did not want to get involved.  One of the members of the MAUD Committee, [[Marcus Oliphant]] flew to the United States in late August 1941 in an unheated bomber to find out why the United States was ignoring the MAUD Committee's findings.  Oliphant said that: "The minutes and reports had been sent to Lyman Briggs, who was the Director of the Uranium Committee, and we were puzzled to receive virtually no comment.  I called on Briggs in Washington, only to find out that this inarticulate and unimpressive man had put the reports in his safe and had not shown them to members of his committee.  I was amazed and distressed."

Oliphant then met the whole Uranium Committee.  [[Samuel King Allison|Samuel K. Allison]] was a new committee member, a talented experimentalist and a protégé of [[Arthur Compton]] at the [[University of Chicago]].  "Oliphant came to a meeting", Allison recalls, "and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms.  He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb and said we had no right to work on power plants or anything but the bomb.  The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us."  Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark.

Oliphant visited other physicists to galvanise the USA into action. As a result, in December 1941 [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the powerful [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], undertook to launch a full-scale effort to develop atomic bombs.  As the scale of the project became clearer, it came under direct military control as the [[Manhattan Project]].

===World War II===
Briggs sought new business for the Bureau. In 1939 he sent [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Daniel C. Roper]] a list of services the Bureau could provide in the event of armed conflict in Europe. By 1942 90% of the Bureau's activities were classified work for the war effort. Some of the Bureau's activities were the non-rotating [[proximity fuze]], [[guided missile]] developments (see the [[Bat (guided bomb)|Bat]][http://museum.nist.gov/panels/batmissile/index.html]), establishment of a [[Radio propagation|Radio Propagation]] Laboratory, critical materials research on [[optical glass]] which Germany had previously supplied, on [[quartz]] and [[synthetic rubber]] and measurement and calibration services. Briggs changed the Bureau's culture from one of open access to one of secrecy.

Briggs retired from the Bureau in 1945, at the age of 72. He was appointed director emeritus of NBS after working for 49 years in federal government. Bureau employees erected a bronze sundial in his honor through their Employees Welfare Association. At his request the names of the first three directors of Bureau are cast onto the rim of the instrument: [[Samuel Wesley Stratton]], [[George Kimball Burgess]], and Lyman James Briggs.

In 1948 Briggs received the Medal of Merit from [[US President]] [[Harry Truman]] for his distinguished work in connection with World War II.

At the request of [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Henry A. Wallace]], he wrote a 180-page account on NBS war research that was published in 1949.

===Later life===
In his retirement Briggs returned to research, establishing a laboratory for studying fluids under negative pressure at the [[National Bureau of Standards]]. This topic was directly related to his earlier research in the water uptake of plants. In one famous experiment he measured the negative pressure (or tension) that would break a column of water held in a capillary tube by [[capillary action]]. It turned out that at room temperature the maximum attainable tension in water was 250 bar and in mercury nearly 500 bar. This was published in several papers between (1950–1953), and the 1950 paper remains a classic and is still regularly cited in the literature on [[metastable water]].

Briggs' love for baseball triggered another piece of research. During World War II the government had mandated that rubber in baseballs be replaced by cork. Complaints about the new balls lead Briggs to test them, and in 1945 he demonstrated that the new baseballs were inferior. This was done by addressing the issue of whether or not a pitched baseball could curve out of the plane of the pitch. With the help of two pitchers from the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] baseball club and his 1917 wind tunnel he studied the effect of spin and speed on the [[trajectory]] and established the relationship between the amount of spin and the curvature of the ball (''see'' [[curveball]]). To measure the spin, he attached a lightweight tape to the ball and counted the number of twists in the tape. This was a popular topic in newspapers and is probably the most widely known of his research.

Another of Briggs many interests was the [[National Geographic Society]] and in 1934 he chaired the Society's Committee on Research and Exploration. During this time he instrumented two stratospheric balloon flights, the second of which broke the existing record for altitude in 1936. During retirement he became more active in the Society, and lead an expedition to study the solar eclipse in Brazil in 1947. Briggs often wrote articles for the [[National Geographic Magazine]].

Briggs died March 25, 1963, aged 88, after a diverse life of scientific exploration and service. He is remembered for his range of interests.  Briggs was almost universally liked, and had a reputation for even headedness and serenity. [[Edward U. Condon]], Briggs' successor at the Bureau said: "''Briggs should always be remembered as one of the great figures in Washington during the first half of the century, when the Federal Government was slowly and stumblingly groping towards a realization of the important role science must play in the full future development of human society''."

In 2007, Michigan State University honored the Lyman Briggs school, named for Briggs, by allowing it to become the Lyman Briggs College.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4173">[[Image:Machmeter.SVG|thumb|right|Illustration showing the face of a Machmeter reading a [[Mach number]] of 0.83]]

A '''Machmeter''' is an [[aircraft]] [[pitot-static system]] [[flight instrument]] that
shows the [[ratio]] of the [[true airspeed]] to the [[speed of sound]], 
a [[dimensionless quantity]] called [[Mach number]].  This is shown on a Machmeter as a [[decimal fraction]].
An aircraft flying at the speed of sound is flying
at a Mach number of one, expressed as ''Mach&amp;nbsp;1''.

==Use==
As an aircraft in [[transonic]] flight approaches the speed of sound, 
it first reaches its [[critical mach]] number, where air flowing
over low-pressure areas of its surface locally reaches the
speed of sound, forming [[shock wave]]s. The [[indicated airspeed]]
for this condition changes with ambient temperature, 
which in turn changes with [[altitude]].
Therefore, indicated airspeed is not entirely adequate to
warn the pilot of the impending problems. Mach number is
more useful, and most [[High-speed flight|high-speed aircraft]] are limited to a maximum operating Mach number, also known as '''M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

For example, if the '''M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt;''' is Mach&amp;nbsp;0.83, then at {{convert|30000|ft|m|0}} where the speed of sound under [[International Standard Atmosphere|standard conditions]] is {{convert|590|kn|0}}, the [[true airspeed]] at M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt; is {{convert|489|kn|0}}. The speed of sound increases with air temperature, so at Mach&amp;nbsp;0.83 at {{convert|10000|ft|m|0}} where the air is much warmer than at {{convert|30000|ft|m|0}}, the true airspeed at M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt; would be {{convert|530|kn|0}}.

==Operation==
Modern electronic Machmeters use information from an [[Air data computer|air data computer system]] which makes calculations using inputs from a [[pitot-static system]]. Some older mechanical Machmeters use an altitude [[Barometer#Aneroid barometers|aneroid]] and an [[airspeed indicator|airspeed]] capsule which together convert pitot-static pressure into Mach number. The Machmeter suffers from instrument and position errors.

==Calibration==
In subsonic flow the Mach meter can be calibrated according to:

:&lt;math&gt;
{M}=\sqrt{5\left[\left(\frac{q_c}{p}\right)^\frac{2}{7}-1\right]}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\ M\,&lt;/math&gt; is Mach number
:''q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[impact pressure]] (dynamic pressure)
:&lt;math&gt;\ p&lt;/math&gt; is [[static pressure]]
:and assuming the [[heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]] is 1.4

When a shock wave forms across the pitot tube the required formula is derived from the Rayleigh Supersonic Pitot equation, and is solved iteratively:

:&lt;math&gt;{M}=0.88128485\sqrt{\frac{p_t}{p}\left(1-\frac{1}{[7M^2]}\right)^\frac{5}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;\ p_t&lt;/math&gt; is now [[stagnation pressure|total pressure]] measured behind the normal shock.

Note that the inputs required are [[stagnation pressure|total pressure]] and static pressure. Air temperature input is not required.

'''Markus Neteler''' received his degree in Physical Geography and Landscape Ecology from the University of Hannover, Germany, in 1999 where he worked as a researcher and teaching assistant for two years.

== Biography ==
From 2001-2007, he was a researcher at Bruno Kessler Foundation (FBK)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fbk.eu&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly ITC-irst), Trento, Italy. In the period 2005-2007, while preserving the work of FBK researcher, he worked as the same figure for the Centro di Ecologia Alpina&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cealp.it&lt;/ref&gt; of Trento (Italy). From 2008 to 2016, he worked at the Edmund Mach Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmach.it&lt;/ref&gt; (FEM) - San Michele all'Adige (Trento, Italy), as the coordinator of the [[GIS]] and [[Remote Sensing]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gis.cri.fmach.it/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117004935/http://gis.cri.fmach.it/ |archivedate=2011-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he moved to Bonn, Germany, where he co-founded the Mundialis company.

His main interests are remote sensing for environmental risk assessment and Free Software GIS development, especially [[GRASS GIS]] (of which he is the coordinator since 1999).

He co-authored two books on the use of the free and open source software GRASS GIS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grassbook.org&lt;/ref&gt; and several scientific papers on GIS.&lt;ref name=benito2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Garzón | first1 = M.

A '''mill''' is a device that breaks [[solid]] materials into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such [[comminution]] is an important [[unit operation]] in many [[process (engineering)|processes]]. There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g., via a [[crank (mechanism)|hand crank]]), [[working animal]] (e.g., [[horse mill]]), wind ([[windmill]]) or water ([[watermill]]). Today they are usually powered by [[electricity]].

The grinding of solid materials occurs through mechanical forces that break up the structure by overcoming the interior bonding forces. After the grinding the state of the solid is changed: the grain size, the grain size disposition and the grain shape.

Milling also refers to the process of breaking down, separating, sizing, or classifying aggregate material.  For instance rock crushing or grinding to produce uniform aggregate size for construction purposes, or separation of rock, soil or aggregate material for the purposes of structural fill or land reclamation activities.  Aggregate milling processes are also used to remove or separate contamination or moisture from aggregate or soil and to produce "dry fills" prior to transport or structural filling.

Grinding may serve the following purposes in engineering:
*increase of the surface area of a solid
*manufacturing of a solid with a desired grain size
*pulping of resources

==Grinding laws==
In spite of a great number of studies in the field of fracture schemes there is no formula known which connects the technical grinding work with grinding results. To calculate the needed grinding work against the grain size changing three semi-empirical models are used. These can be related to the [[Hukki relationship]] between particle size and the energy required to break the particles. In stirred mills, the Hukki relationship does not apply and instead, experimentation has to be performed to determine any relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=A|title=Fractures, fractals and breakage energy of mineral particles|journal=International Journal of Mineral Processing|volume=57|page=285|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S0301-7516(99)00029-0|last2=Filippov|first2=L.O.|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

with ''W'' as grinding work in kJ/kg, ''c'' as grinding coefficient, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; as grain size of the source material and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; as grain size of the ground material.
 
A reliable value for the grain sizes ''d''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is ''d''&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;. This value signifies that 80% (mass) of the solid matter has a smaller grain size. 
The Bond's grinding coefficient for different materials can be found in various literature. To calculate the KICK's and Rittinger's coefficients following formulas can be used

&lt;math&gt;c_K=1.151 c_B (d_{BU})^{-0.5}\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_R=0.5 c_B (d_{BL})^{0.5}\,&lt;/math&gt;

with the limits of Bond's range: upper ''d''&lt;sub&gt;BU&lt;/sub&gt; = 50&amp;nbsp;mm and lower ''d''&lt;sub&gt;BL&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm.

To evaluate the grinding results the grain size disposition of the source material (1) and of the ground material (2) is needed. Grinding degree is the ratio of the sizes from the grain disposition. There are several definitions for this characteristic value:

*Grinding degree referring to grain size ''d''&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_d=\frac{d_{80,1}}{d_{80,2}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:Instead of the value of ''d''&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; also ''d''&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; or other grain diameter can be used.
 
*Grinding degree referring to specific surface
:&lt;math&gt;Z_S=\frac{S_{v,2}}{S_{v,1}}=\frac{S_{m,2}}{S_{m,1}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
 
:The specific surface area referring to volume ''S''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; and the specific surface area referring to mass ''S''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can be found out through experiments.

*Pretended grinding degree
:&lt;math&gt;Z_a=\frac{d_1}{a}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:The discharge die gap a of the grinding machine is used for the ground solid matter in this formula.

==Grinding machines==
In materials processing a '''grinder''' is a machine for producing fine particle size reduction through [[Wear|attrition]] and [[compression (physical)|compressive]] [[force]]s at the grain size level. See also [[crusher]] for mechanisms producing larger particles. In general, grinding processes require a relatively large amount of energy; for this reason, an experimental method to measure the energy used locally during milling with different machines was recently proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baron|first1=M.|last2=Chamayou|first2=A.|last3=Marchioro|first3=L.|last4=Raffi|first4=J.|title=Radicalar probes to measure the action of energy on granular materials|journal=Advanced Powder Technology|volume=16|page=199|year=2005|doi=10.1163/1568552053750242|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ball mill.gif|thumb|right|Operation of a ball mill]]

===Ball mill===
A typical type of fine grinder is the [[ball mill]]. A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with [[sphere|ball]]s, usually [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[metal]], which grind material to the necessary fineness by [[friction]] and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%. Ball mills are characterized by their smaller (comparatively) diameter and longer length, and often have a length 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter. The feed is at one end of the cylinder and the discharge is at the other. Ball mills are commonly used in the manufacture of [[Portland cement]] and finer grinding stages of mineral processing, one example being the [[Sepro Mineral Systems#Sepro Tyre Drive Grinding Mills|Sepro tyre drive Grinding Mill]]. Industrial ball mills can be as large as 8.5&amp;nbsp;m (28&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter with a 22 MW motor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABB|url=http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/8231666baa1c0a45c1257842002fe89b.aspx|work=ABB Communications|publisher=ABB Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing approximately 0.0011% of the total world's power (see [[List of countries by electricity consumption]]). However, small versions of ball mills can be found in laboratories where they are used for grinding sample material for quality assurance.

The power predictions for ball mills typically use the following form of the Bond equation:&lt;ref name="onemine1"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E= 10 W \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt {P_{80}}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt {F_{80}}}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''E'' is the energy (kilowatt-hours per metric or short ton)
* ''W'' is the work index measured in a laboratory ball mill (kilowatt-hours per metric or short ton)
* ''P&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mill circuit product size in micrometers
* ''F&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mill circuit feed size in micrometers.

===Rod mill===
A rotating drum causes friction and attrition between steel [[Cylinder (geometry)|rods]] and ore particles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} But note that the term 'rod mill' is also used as a synonym for a [[slitting mill]], which makes rods of iron or other metal.  Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals.

The rods used in the mill, usually a high-carbon steel, can vary in both the length and the diameter. However, the smaller the rods, the larger is the total surface area and hence, the greater the grinding efficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wills|first1=B.A.|title=Mineral Processing Technology: An Introduction to the Practical Aspects of Ore Treatment and Mineral Recovery|page=157|volume=7th ed. Amsterdam ; Boston, MA |year=2006|isbn=0750644508
|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autogenous mill===
Autogenous or autogenic mills are so-called due to the self-grinding of the ore: a rotating drum throws larger rocks of ore in a cascading motion which causes impact breakage of larger rocks and compressive grinding of finer particles. It is similar in operation to a SAG mill as described below but does not use steel balls in the mill.  Also known as ROM or "Run Of Mine" grinding.

===SAG mill===
[[File:Principle of SAG Mill operation.jpg|thumb|350px|Principle of SAG Mill operation]]

SAG is an acronym for Semi-Autogenous Grinding. SAG mills are autogenous mills but use grinding balls like a ball mill. A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder. SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.&lt;ref&gt;Strohmayr, S. and Valery, W. Jr. [http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/mct_service.nsf/WebWID/WTB-120106-22576-29D77/$File/057.pdf SAG mill circuit optimisation at Ernest Henry Mining]. metso.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mular, Andrew L. |author2=Halbe, Doug N.  |author3=Barratt, Derek J.  |title=Mineral Processing Plant Design, Practice, and Control: Proceedings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GibosO9NKWwC&amp;pg=PA2369 |accessdate=26 October 2012 |year=2002 |publisher=SME |isbn=978-0-87335-223-9 |pages=2369–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter, powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=van de Vijfeijken, Maarten  |url=http://www04.abb.com/global/seitp/seitp202.nsf/0/bbe9642b2886578cc1257842003f2c64/$file/Mills+and+GMDs.pdf |title=Mills and GMDs |page=30 |journal=International Mining |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SAG mill with a 44' (13.4m) diameter and a power of 35 MW (47,000 HP) has been designed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot244.nsf/veritydisplay/b5413bc88649e680c1257a5300514f7e/$file/Gearless%20mill%20drives_3BHS%20490275%20RevD_low.pdf Gearless mill drives]. abb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Attrition between grinding balls and ore particles causes grinding of finer particles. SAG mills are characterized by their large diameter and short length as compared to ball mills. The inside of the mill is lined with lifting plates to lift the material inside the mill, where it then falls off the plates onto the rest of the ore charge. SAG mills are primarily used at gold, copper and platinum mines with applications also in the lead, zinc, silver, alumina and nickel industries.

===Pebble mill===
A rotating drum causes friction and attrition between rock [[pebble]]s and ore particles. May be used where product contamination by [[iron]] from [[steel]] balls must be avoided. Quartz or silica is commonly used because it is inexpensive to obtain.

===High pressure grinding rolls===
A high pressure grinding roll, often referred to as [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234128538_Energy_Consumption_in_a_Phosphate_Concentrator_Jhamarkotra_India HPGRs or roller press], consists out of two rollers with the same dimensions, which are rotating against each other with the same circumferential speed. The special feeding of bulk material through a hopper leads to a material bed between the two rollers. The bearing units of one roller can move linearly and are pressed against the material bed by springs or hydraulic cylinders. The pressures in the material bed are greater than 50 MPa (7,000 [[Pounds per square inch|PSI]]). In general they achieve 100 to 300 MPa. By this the material bed is compacted to a solid volume portion of more than 80%.

The roller press has a certain similarity to roller crushers and roller presses for the compacting of powders, but purpose, construction and operation mode are different.

Extreme [[pressure]] causes the particles inside of the compacted material bed to [[fracture]] into finer particles and also causes microfracturing at the grain size level.  Compared to ball mills HPGRs achieve a 30 to 50% lower specific energy consumption, although they are not as common as ball mills since they are a newer technology.

A similar type of intermediate crusher is the edge runner, which consists of a circular pan with two or more heavy [[wheel]]s known as mullers rotating within it; material to be crushed is shoved underneath the wheels using attached [[plow]] blades.

===Buhrstone mill===
[[File:Table top hammer mill.jpg|thumb|Table top hammer mill]]
Another type of fine grinder commonly used is the [[buhrstone mill]], which is similar to old-fashioned [[flour mill]]s.

===Vertical shaft impactor mill (VSI mill)===
{{Main|VSI mill}}
A VSI mill throws rock or ore particles against a wear plate by slinging them from a spinning center that rotates on a vertical shaft. This type of mill uses the same principle as [[Rock crusher#Vertical shaft impactor (VSI)|VSI Crusher]]

===Tower mill===

Tower mills, often called vertical mills, stirred mills or regrind mills, are a more efficient means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes, and can be used after ball mills in a grinding process. Like ball mills, grinding (steel) balls or pebbles are often added to stirred mills to help grind ore, however these mills contain a large screw mounted vertically to lift and grind material.  In tower mills, there is no cascading action as in standard grinding mills.  Stirred mills are also common for mixing quicklime (CaO) into a lime slurry. There are several advantages to the tower mill: low noise, efficient energy usage, and low operating costs.

==Types of grinding mills==
* [[Windmill]], wind powered
* [[Watermill]], water powered
* [[Horse mill]], animal powered
* [[Treadwheel]], human powered (archaic: "treadmill")
* [[Ship mill]], floats near a river bank or bridge
*[[Arrastra]], simple mill for grinding and pulverizing (typically) gold or silver ore.
* [[Roller mill]], an equipment for the grinding or pulverizing of grain and other raw materials using cylinders
* [[Stamp mill]], a specialized machine for reducing ore to powder for further processing or for fracturing other materials
* A place of business for making articles of manufacture.  The term mill was once in common use for a factory because many factories in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution were powered by a watermill, but nowadays it is only used in a few specific contexts; e.g.,
** [[Bark mill]] produces tanbark for tanneries
** [[Cider mill]] crushes apples to give cider
** [[Gristmill]] grinds grain into flour
** [[Oil mill]], see [[expeller pressing]], [[extrusion]]
** [[Paper mill]] produces paper
** [[Sawmill]] cuts timber
** [[Starch mill]]
** [[Steel mill]] manufactures steel
** Sugar mill (also called a [[sugar refinery]]) processes sugar beets or sugar cane into various finished products
** [[Textile mill (disambiguation)]]
*** [[Silk mill]], for silk
*** [[Flax mill]], for flax
*** [[Cotton mill]], for cotton
** [[Huller]] (also called a rice mill, or rice husker) is used to hull rice
** [[Powder mill]] produces gunpowder

A '''nail clipper''' (also called '''nail clippers''', a '''nail trimmer''', a '''nail cutter''' or '''nipper type''') is a [[hand tool]] used to [[cutting|trim]] [[fingernails]], [[toenails]] and [[hangnail]]s.

Nail clippers are usually made of stainless steel but can also be made of plastic and aluminium. Two common varieties are the [[plier]] type and the [[compound lever]] type. Most nail clippers usually come with another tool attached, which is used to clean dirt out from under nails. A nail clipper often has a miniature [[File (tool)|file]] fixed to it to allow rough edges of nails to be [[manicure]]d. A nail file allows for removal of any excess nail that is jagged or has been missed. Nail clippers occasionally come with a [[pocket knife]] or a nail catcher; the multi-purpose nail clipper was invented by Hungarian inventor [[David Gestetner]]. The nail clipper consists of a head which may be concave or convex. Specialized nail clippers which have convex clipping ends are intended for trimming toenails, while concave clipping ends are for fingernails. The cutting head may be manufactured to be [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or [[perpendicular]] to the [[Principal axis (mechanics)|principal axis]] of the cutter. Cutting heads which are parallel to the principal axis are made to address accessibility issues involved with cutting toenails.

==History==
[[File:Magdalenenberg cut and shave.jpg|thumb|left|Razor (top) and nail cutter with bone handle (bottom) found in a grave of the [[Hallstatt culture]] (c. 6th–8th centuries BC)]]
[[File:H. C. Cook Company - nail trimmer, 1902.png|thumb|right|1902 advertisement from ''Good Housekeeping'' for Carter's nail cutter, produced by the [[H. C. Cook Company]] of Ansonia, Connecticut]] 
Prior to the invention of the modern nail clipper, people would use small knives to trim or pare their nails. Descriptions of nail trimming in literature date as far back as the 8th century BC. The [[Book of Deuteronomy]] exhorts in 21:12 that a man, should he wish to take a captive as a wife, "shall bring her home to [his] house, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails". A reference is made in [[Horace]]'s ''[[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]'', written circa 20 BC, to "A close-shaven man, it's said, in an empty barber's booth, penknife in hand, quietly cleaning his nails."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Ernie |title=Fingernail Trimming: What We Did Before Nail Clippers |url=https://tedium.co/2017/02/07/fingernail-trimming-history/ |website=Tedium.co |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first United States patent for an improvement in a finger-nail clipper was filed in 1875 by Valentine Fogerty and in the United Kingdom, Hungarian inventor [[David Gestetner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

'''Oak''' is used in [[winemaking]] to vary the color, flavor, [[tannins (wine)|tannin]] profile and texture of wine. It can be introduced in the form of a [[barrel]] during the [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] or [[aging barrel|aging]] periods, or as free-floating chips or [[stave (wood)|staves]] added to wine fermented in a vessel like stainless steel. Oak barrels can impart other qualities to wine through [[evaporation]] and low level exposure to [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 91-93"&gt;J. Robinson ''Jancis Robinson's Wine Course'' Third Edition pg 91-93 Abbeville Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-7892-0883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Barrel fermented California Chard.jpg|left|thumb|A California Chardonnay that shows on the label that it has been barrel fermented.]]
In early [[History of wine|wine history]], the [[amphora]] was the vessel of choice for the [[storage (wine)|storage]] and transportation of wine. Due to the perishable nature of wood material it is difficult to trace the usage of [[barrel]]s in history. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] noted that ancient [[Mesopotamians]] used barrels made of [[palm wood]] to transport wine along the [[Euphrates]]. Palm is a difficult material to bend and fashion into barrels, however, and wine merchants in different regions experimented with different wood styles to find a better wood source.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 25-26"&gt;H. Johnson ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 25-26 Simon and Schuster 1989 {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of oak has been prevalent in winemaking for at least two [[millennia]], first coming into widespread use during the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. In time, winemakers discovered that beyond just storage convenience, wine kept in oak barrels took on properties that improved it by making it softer and, in some cases, better-tasting.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 40"&gt;K.

==Effects on wine==
[[Image:Oakagingcolour.jpg|thumb|The effect of oak aging on two Penedès region Cabernet Sauvignon varietals, a two-year-old ''cosecha'' (left) and six-year-old ''crianza'' (right). As the wine matures, its color shifts from deep purple or crimson to a lighter brick-red, and takes on a more graduated appearance in the glass.]]

The porous nature of an oak barrel allows evaporation and [[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]] to occur in wine but typically not at levels that would cause [[oxidation]] or [[wine faults|spoilage]]. The typical 59-[[gallon]] (225-liter) barrel can lose anywhere from 5{{frac|1|2}} to 6{{frac|1|2}} gallons (21 to 25 liters) (of mostly [[ethanol|alcohol]] and [[water]]) in a year through evaporation. This allows the wine to concentrate its [[flavor]] and [[aroma compounds (wine)|aroma compounds]]. Small amounts of [[oxygen]] are allowed to pass through the barrel and act as a softening agent upon the wine's [[tannins (wine)|tannin]]s.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 40"/&gt;

The chemical properties of oak can have a profound effect on wine. [[phenolic content in wine|Phenols]] within the wood interact to produce [[vanilla]] type flavors and can give the impression of tea notes or sweetness. The degree of "toast" on the barrel can also impart different properties affecting the tannin levels as well as the aggressive wood flavors.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 41"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 41 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hydrolyzable tannin]]s present in wood, known as [[ellagitannins]], are derived from [[lignin]] structures in the wood. They help protect the wine from oxidation and [[redox|reduction]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 492"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 492 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FLOR-ValdiviaJerez59.jpg|thumb|Oak barrel aging [[sherry]]. It has a transparent front for people to see the process inside]]
Wines can be [[Fermentation (wine)|barrel fermented]] in oak or placed in oak after fermentation for a period of aging or maturation. Wine matured in oak receives more oak flavors and properties than wine fermented in oak because [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] cells present in fermentation interact with and "latch on" to oak components. When dead yeast cells are removed as [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] some oak properties go with them.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 45"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 45 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Characteristics of white wines fermented in oak include a pale color and extra silky texture. White wines fermented in steel and matured in oak will have a darker coloring due to heavy [[phenolic content in wine|phenolic]] compounds still present.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 93"&gt;J. Robinson ''Jancis Robinson's Wine Course'' Third Edition pg 93 Abbeville Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-7892-0883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flavor notes commonly used to describe wines exposed to oak include [[caramel]], [[cream]], [[smoke]], [[spice]] and vanilla. [[Chardonnay]] is a varietal with very distinct flavor profiles when fermented in oak, which include [[coconut]], [[cinnamon]] and [[cloves]] notes. The "toastiness" of the barrel can bring out varying degrees of [[Cafe mocha|mocha]] and [[toffee]] notes in red wine.&lt;ref name="Spectator"&gt;D. Sogg "[http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Archives/Show_Article/0,1275,3302,00.html White Wines, New Barrels: The taste of new oak gains favor worldwide]" Wine Spectator July 31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of time a wine spends in the barrel is dependent on the [[varietal]] and finished style the winemaker desires. The majority of oak flavoring is imparted in the first few months the wine is in contact with oak, while longer term exposure adds light barrel [[aeration]], which helps precipitate phenolic compounds and quickens the aging process.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 93"/&gt; [[New World wine|New World]] [[Pinot noir]] may spend less than a year in oak. Premium [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] may spend two years. The very tannic [[Nebbiolo]] grape may spend four or more years in oak. High end [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]] producers will sometimes [[age (wine)|age]] their wines up to ten years in American oak to get a desired earthy cedar and herbal character.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 45"/&gt;

==Oak types and sources==
[[Image:Chêne 02.jpg|left|thumb|The ''[[Quercus petraea]]'' tree responsible for French oak.]]
The species of oak typically used for American oak production is the ''[[Quercus alba]]'' which is a white oak species that is characterized by its relatively fast growth, wider grains and lower wood tannins. It is found in most of the [[Eastern United States]] as well as [[Missouri]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]] where many wine barrels are from. In [[Oregon]] the ''[[Quercus garryana]]'' white oak has started to gain usage due to its closer similarities to European oak. 

In France, both the ''[[Quercus robur]]'' (common oak) and ''[[Quercus petraea]]'' (white oak) are considered apt for wine making, however, the latter is considered far superior for its finer grain and richer contribution of aromatic components like [[vanillin]] and its derivates, methyl-octalactone and tannins, as well as phenols and volatile aldehydes.
French oak typically comes from one or more primary forests: [[Allier]], [[Limousin (région)|Limousin]], [[Nevers]], [[Forest of Tronçais|Tronçais]] and [[Vosges]]. The wood from each of these forests has slightly different characteristics. Many winemakers utilize barrels made from different cooperages, regions and degrees of toasting in blending their wines to enhance the complexity of the resulting wine.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 33-34"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 33-34 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Altersvergleich.jpg|right|thumb|The tighter grain of French oak allows for a more gradual integration of flavors in the wine.]]
[[Italian wine]]makers have had a long history of using [[Slavonia]]n oak from the ''[[Quercus robur]]'' which is known for its tight grain, low aromatics and medium level tannins. Slavonian oak tends to be used in larger barrel sizes (with less surface area relative to volume) with the same barrels reused for many more years before replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castellobanfi.com/tastroom/glossary.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017190607/http://www.castellobanfi.com/tastroom/glossary.php|date=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], ''Quercus petraea'' oak from the [[Baltic/European states]] especially from Hungary was the most highly sought after wood for [[French wine]]making. The trees in the Hungarian Zemplén Mountains grow slower in the volcanic soil and smaller, creating fine tight grain which sequentially lends itself to a very delicate extraction.

The hemicellulose in the Hungarian oak breaks down more easily, and conveys an exceptional selection of toasted, vanilla, sugary, woody, spicy and caramel-like flavors – imparting these aromas with less intensity, and slower than American or French oak.

Many winemakers favor the softer, smoother, creamier texture that Hungarian oak offers their wines. French winemakers preferred to use Hungarian barrels until the early 20th century, then – because of world wars, supply cut – the French wine industry was forced to find its own source in France, similar to the unique quality, legendary Hungarian Zemplén oak.

However, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the cooperages from France again became major consumers of the exclusive Quercus petraea/Sessile Hungarian Oak trees originating in the Zemplén Mountain Forest.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 92"/&gt; 

The Russian oak from the [[Adyghe Autonomous Oblast|Adygey]] region along the [[Black Sea]] is being explored by French winemakers as a cheaper alternative to French and Hungarian oak.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sogg "[http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Archives/Show_Article/0,1275,2904,00.html French Barrelmaker Turns to Russian Oak]" Wine Spectator October 15, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian wine]]ries have been experimenting with the use of Canadian oak, which proponents describe as a middle ground between American and French oak even though it is the same species as American oak.&lt;ref&gt;K. Ebjich  "[http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily/News/0,1145,2249,00.html Canadian Oak Barrels Get the Nod From Winemakers]" Wine Spectator November 11, 2003 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010143103/http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily/News/0,1145,2249,00.html |date=October 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Oak trees are typically between 80–120 years old prior to harvesting with the ideal conditions being a cool climate in a dense forest region that gives the trees opportunity to mature slowly and develop a tighter grain. Typically one tree can provide enough wood for two {{convert|225|L|USgal|adj=on}} barrels. The trees are typically [[harvest]]ed in the winter months when there is less [[sap]] in the trunk.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 92"&gt;J. Robinson ''Jancis Robinson's Wine Course'' Third Edition pg 92 Abbeville Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-7892-0883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences between French and American oak===
American oak tends to be more intensely flavored than French oak with more sweet and [[Vanillin|vanilla]] overtones due to the American oak having two to four times as many [[lactones]].&lt;ref name="Spectator"/&gt; Winemakers choose American oak typically for bold, powerful reds, base wines for "assemblage", or for warm climate [[Chardonnay]]s. Besides being derived from different species, a major difference between American and French oak comes from the preparation of the wood. The tighter [[Woodgrain|grain]] and less watertight nature of French oak obliges [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]] to split the wood along the grain. The wood is then aged or "seasoned" for 24 to 36 months in the open air, in a so-called wood-yard. 

[[File:Toneleria-nacional-wood-yard.png|thumb|left|Oak seasoning at the [[Tonelería Nacional]] wood yard]] 
Even though American coopers may use a [[kiln]]-dry method to season the wood, almost all others will season American oak in exactly the same way as French.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 92"/&gt; Open air seasoning has the advantage of leaching undesirable chemical components and bitter tannins, mellowing the oak in a manner that kiln-dry methods are incapable of replicating.&lt;ref name="Spectator"/&gt; 
Even though sun, rain, and wind may suffice in most cases to season oak, in drier climates coopers - such as [[Tonelería Nacional]] - apply up to 2000&amp;nbsp;mm (80&amp;nbsp;in) of water a year to their wood stacks in order to facilitate the seasoning process.

Since French oak must be split, only 20 to 25% of the tree can be utilized; American oak may be serrated, which makes it at least twice as economical.
Its more pronounced oxidation and a quicker release of aromas help wines to lose their astringency and harshness faster; which makes this the wood of choice for shorter maturations - six to ten months. Because of American oak’s modest tannin contribution, the perfect first fill is a wine with abundant tannins and good texture; it allows the fruit to interact harmoniously with the wood, which contributes a wide array of complex aromas and soft, yet very palatable tannins. 

French oak, on the other hand, generates silky and transparent tannins, which transmit a sensation of light sweetness combined with fruity flavors that persist in the mouth. Spices and toasted almond are noteworthy, combined with flavors of ripe red fruit in red wines, and notes of peach, exotic fruits and floral aromas like jasmine and rose in whites, depending on the grape variety employed.

==Wine barrel==

{{See also|Aging barrel}}
[[Image:Col Solare red band barrels.JPG|thumb|left|The "red band" on some wine barrels is the residue of spilt red wine. For aesthetics some wineries will paint this center portion of the barrel red for a cleaner look.]] 
Wine barrels, especially those made of oak, have long been used as containers in which wine is aged. Aging in oak typically imparts desirable vanilla, butter and spice flavors to wine. The size of the barrel plays a large role in determining the effects of oak on the wine by dictating the ratio of surface area to volume of wine with smaller containers having a larger impact. The most common barrels are the Bordeaux barriques style which hold {{convert|225|L|USgal}} followed by the Burgundy style barrel which hold {{convert|228|L|USgal}}. Some New World wine makers are now also using the larger [[hogshead]] {{convert|300|L|USGAL|adj=on}} barrel.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 93"/&gt; Larger barrels are also traditionally used in parts of Italy such as Barolo,&lt;ref name="wheaver"&gt;J Wheaver '[http://www.barol.org.uk/barriques.htm]" 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the south of France. 

New barrels impart more flavors than do previously used barrels. Over time many of the oak properties get "leached" out of the barrel with layers of natural deposits left from the wine building up on the wood to where after 3 to 5 [[vintages]] there may be little or no oak flavors imparted on the wine.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 41"/&gt; In addition, oxygen transport through the oak and into the wine, which is required for maturation, becomes severely limited after 3–5 years.  The cost of barrels varies due to the [[supply and demand]] market economy and can change with different features that a cooperage may offer. As of late 2007 the price for a standard American oak barrel was US$600 to 800, French oak US$1200 and up, and Eastern European US$600.&lt;ref&gt;World Cooperage [http://www.worldcooperage.com/pages/product_barrels_trad.html Product Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828121600/http://www.worldcooperage.com/pages/product_barrels_trad.html |date=August 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the expense of barrels, several techniques have been devised in an attempt to save money. One is to shave the inside of used barrels and insert new thin inner staves that have been toasted.&lt;ref name="Sogg"&gt;D. Sogg "[http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Archives/Show_Article/0,1275,3820,00.html Oak Flavorings]" Wine Spectator Sept.20th, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barrel construction===
[[Image:Preparando una Barrica.jpg|right|thumb|Barrel midway through construction.]]
Barrels are constructed in [[cooperages]]. The traditional method of European coopers has been to hand-split the oak into staves (or strips) along the grain. After the oak is split, it is allowed to "season" or dry outdoors while exposed to the elements. This process can take anywhere from 10 to 36 months during which time the harshest tannins from the wood are leached out. These tannins are visible as dark gray and black residue left on the ground once the staves are removed. The longer the wood is allowed to season the softer the potential wine stored in the barrels may be but this can add substantially to the cost of the barrel. In some American cooperage the wood is dried in a [[kiln]] instead of outdoor seasoning. While this method is much faster, it does not soften the tannins quite as much as outdoor seasoning.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 42-43"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 42-43 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The staves are then heated, traditionally over an open fire, and, when [[pliable]], are bent into the desired shape of the barrel and held together with iron rings. Instead of fire, a cooper may use steam to heat up the staves but this tends to impart less "toastiness" and complexity to the resulting wine. Following the traditional, hand worked style, a cooper is typically able to construct one barrel in a day's time. Winemakers can order barrels with the wood on the inside of the barrel having been lightly charred or toasted with fire, medium toasted, or heavily toasted.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 42-43"/&gt; Typically the "lighter" the toasting the more oak flavor and tannins that are imparted. Heavy toast or "charred" which is typical treatment of barrels in [[Burgundy wine]] have an added dimension from the char that medium or light toasted barrels do not impart.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 93"/&gt; Heavy toasting dramatically reduces the coconut note lactones, even in American oak, but create a high [[carbon]] content that may reduce the coloring of some wines. During the process of toasting, the [[furanic]] [[aldehyde]]s in the wood reach a higher level of concentration. This produces the "roasted" aroma in the wine. The toasting also enhances the presences of vanillin and the phenol [[eugenol]] which creates smokey and spicy notes that in some wines are similar to the aromatics of [[oil of cloves]].&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 33"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 33 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barrel alternatives==
[[File:Oak chips in chardonnay.jpg|right|thumb|Oak chips in fermenting [[Chardonnay]].]]
[[File:Russian river chard.jpg|left|thumb|A Chardonnay from the Russian River Valley labeling itself as "unoaked" to differentiate itself from other oak-influenced Chardonnays.]]
Although oak [[barrels]] have long been used by [[winemaker]]s, many [[wineries]] now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. It is a common misconception that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. This is not so. The butter flavors come from [[lactic acid]], naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to [[diacetyl]]. This process reverses itself, although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the diacetyl remains. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips have the benefit of imparting intense oak flavoring in a matter of weeks while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards the vanilla extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts.&lt;ref name="Sogg"/&gt; The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are a very practical alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak [[plank (wood)|plank]]s or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 93"/&gt; Improvements in [[micro-oxygenation]] have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 491"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 491 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2006, the practice of using oak chips was outlawed in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/04/WIGJIIJG561.DTL&amp;hw=wine&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=506|title=Giant 'teabags' of oak chips now legal in Europe|author=Jancis Robinson|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Bordeaux court of appeals fined four wineries, including third growth [[Chateau Giscours]], over $13,000 USD for the use of oak chips in their wine.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mann "''[http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily/News/0,1145,868,00.html Bordeaux Chateaus Fined for Use of Wood Chips]"'' Wine Spectator November 29, 1999 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925112257/http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Daily/News/0,1145,868,00.html |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other wood types==
[[File:W&amp;H-dsc02595.jpg|thumb|Weighing a sherry barrel]]
Throughout history other wood types, including [[chestnut]], [[pine]], [[redwood]], and [[black locust]], have been used in crafting winemaking vessels, particularly large fermentation vats. However none of these wood types possess the compatibility with wine that oak has demonstrated in combining its water tight, yet slightly porous, storage capabilities with the unique flavor and texture characteristic that it can impart to the wine that it is in contact with.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 91"&gt;J. Robinson ''Jancis Robinson's Wine Course'' Third Edition pg 91 Abbeville Press 2003 {{ISBN|0-7892-0883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chestnut is very high in tannins and is too porous as a storage barrel and must be coated with [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] to prevent excessive wine loss through evaporation. Redwood is too rigid to bend into the smaller barrel shapes and imparts an unpleasant flavor. Black Locust imparts a yellow tint to the wine. Other hardwoods like [[apple tree|apple]] and [[cherry tree|cherry wood]] have an off putting smell.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ross "[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-13619651.html Rethinking American vs. French oak]" Wines &amp; Vines November 1, 1992 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213221853/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-13619651.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austrian wine]]makers have a history of using black locust barrels. Historically, chestnut was used by [[Beaujolais]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Portuguese wine]] makers.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 775"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 775 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Rhône wine]]makers still use paraffin coated chestnut barrels but the coating minimizes any effect from the wood making its function similar to a neutral concrete vessel. In [[Chilean wine|Chile]] there are traditions for using barrels made of [[Nothofagus alpina|rauli]] wood but it is beginning to fall out of favor due to the musky scent it imparts on wine.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 32"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 32 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent behind Peerio is to provide a security program that is easier to use than the current [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] standard.&lt;ref name="Gigaom"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2015/01/14/peerio-is-a-chat-and-storage-service-with-big-security-claims/|title=Peerio is a chat and storage service with big security claims|last1=Meyer|first1=David|date=14 January 2015|website=Gigaom|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Peerio allows users to share encrypted messages and files in direct messages or groups that Peerio calls "rooms".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peerio.com/index.html|title=Peerio|website=www.peerio.com|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peerio "rooms" are offered as a team-oriented group chat, allowing administrative functionality to add and remove other users from the group chat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peerio.com/creating-a-secure-workspace-peerio-rooms.html|title=Peerio|website=www.peerio.com|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peerio allows users to store encrypted files online, offering limited cloud storage for free with optional paid upgrades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Peerio messages and files [[Persistent data structure|persist]] between logins and hardware, differing from [[Ephemeral data structure|ephemeral]] encrypted messaging apps which do not retain message or file history between logins or different devices.

Peerio supports application based [[multi-factor authentication]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Peerio allows users to share animated GIFs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peerio.com/3-2-1-saying-goodbye-to-peerio-legacy.html|title=Peerio|website=www.peerio.com|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==

=== End-to-End Encryption ===

Peerio utilizes end-to-end encryption and is applied by default to all message and file data. End-to-end encryption is intended to encrypt data in a way that only the sender and intended recipients are able to decrypt, and thus read, the data.

Taken from Peerio's privacy policy:

"Peerio utilizes the [[NaCl (software)|NaCl]] (pronounced "salt") cryptographic framework, which itself uses the following cryptographic primitives:
*  ''[[X25519]]'' for public key agreement over elliptic curves.
* ''[[ed25519]]'' for public key signatures.
*  ''XSalsa20'' for encryption and confidentiality.
*  ''[[Poly1305]]'' for ensuring the integrity of encrypted data.
Additionally, Peerio uses ''[[scrypt]]'' for memory-hard key derivation and ''[[BLAKE2s]]'' is used for various hashing operations.

For in-transit encryption, Peerio Services use [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) with best-practice cipher suite configuration, including support for [[Perfect Forward Secrecy|perfect forward secrecy]] (PFS). You can view a detailed and up-to-date independent review of Peerio’s TLS configuration on SSL Labs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=icebear.peerio.com|title=SSL Server Test: icebear.peerio.com (Powered by Qualys SSL Labs)|website=www.ssllabs.com|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peerio.com/privacy.html|title=Peerio|website=www.peerio.com|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Code Audits ===

Prior to Peerio's initial release, the software was [[Software audit review|audited]] by the German security firm [[Cure53]], which found only non-security related bugs, all of which were fixed prior to the applications release.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; 

According to Peerio's website, the application was also audited in March 2017 by Cure53.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Open Source ===

Peerio is partly [[Open-source software|open source]] and publishes code publicly on [[GitHub]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/PeerioTechnologies|title=Peerio Technologies|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bug Bounty ===

Peerio offers a [[Bug bounty program|bug bounty]], offering cash rewards for anyone who reports security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peerio.com/bug.html|title=Peerio|website=www.peerio.com|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peerio (Legacy)==
The first iteration of Peerio, '''Peerio (Legacy)''', was developed by [[Nadim Kobeissi]] and Florencia Herra-Vega and was released on 14 January 2015&lt;ref name="pcworld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; and was closed on 8 January 2018&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Peerio (Legacy) was a free application, available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], and as a [[Google Chrome extension]].&lt;ref name="SocialTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/peerio-simple-encryption-for-the-masses/613227|title=Peerio: Simple Encryption for the Masses|last1=Morrison|first1=Kimberlee|date=22 January 2015|website=SocialTimes|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peerio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.peerio.com/post/141088039469/android-and-ios-apps-are-here|title=Android and iOS apps are here!|last1=Peerio|date=15 March 2016|website=Peerio|accessdate=16 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321065435/http://blog.peerio.com/post/141088039469/android-and-ios-apps-are-here|archivedate=21 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It offered end-to-end encryption, which is enabled by default.  The encryption used the miniLock open-source security standard, which was also developed by Kobeissi.&lt;ref name="zdnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/nsa-busting-encryption-app-peerio-puts-privacy-first/|title=Meet the free encryption app that promises to put your privacy first|last1=Whittaker|first1=Zack|date=2 March 2015|website=ZDNnet.com|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On 15 June 2017, Peerio 2 was launched as the successor to Peerio (Legacy). According to the company's blog, Peerio 2 is purported to be a "radical overhaul" of the original application's core technology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Claimed benefits in comparison to Peerio (Legacy) include increased speed, support for larger file transfers (up to 7000GB), and a re-designed user interface. Peerio also stated a added focus towards businesses looking for encrypted team collaboration software.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''PhET Interactive Simulations,''' a project at the [[University of Colorado|University of Colorado Boulder]], is a non-profit&lt;ref name="phet"&gt;[http://phet.colorado.edu/donate Support PhET]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Open educational resources|open educational resource]] (OER) project founded in 2002 by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Laureate [[Carl Wieman]]. PhET began with Wieman's vision to improve the way science is taught and learned. Their stated mission is "To advance science and math literacy and education worldwide through free interactive simulations."

The project acronym "PhET" originally stood for "Physics Education Technology,"  but PhET soon expanded to other disciplines.  The project now designs, develops, and releases over 125 free interactive simulations for educational use in the fields of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], and [[mathematics]].  The simulations have been translated into over 65 different languages, including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[German language|German]], and [[Arabic]]; and in 2011, the PhET website received over 25 million visitors.&lt;ref name="NYT Web Tutors"&gt;{{cite news|last=Guttenplan|first=D.D.|title=Web Tutors Become Stars Far from Classroom|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/world/americas/12iht-educLede12.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, PhET Interactive Simulations was chosen as the 2011 Microsoft Education [[The Tech Awards|Tech Award]] laureate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tech Award 2011|url=http://thetechawards.thetech.org/laureate/archive/2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109202905/http://thetechawards.thetech.org/laureate/archive/2011|archivedate=2012-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tech Awards, presented by [[The Tech Museum of Innovation]], honor innovators from around the world for technology benefitting humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCracken|first=Harry|title=Meet the Winners of This Year's Tech Humanitarian Awards|journal=Time|date=October 21, 2011|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/10/21/meet-the-winners-of-this-years-tech-humanitarian-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After winning the Nobel prize in 2001, Wieman became particularly involved with efforts at improving [[science education]] and has conducted educational research on science instruction. He helped write Physics 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physics 2000|url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/index.pl|publisher=University of Colorado Boulder|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide simulations to explain his work in creating the Bose-Einstein Condensate. As he gave public lectures, some incorporating simulations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornell|first=E.A.|author2=C.E. Wieman |title=Nobel Lectures in Physics 2001|journal=Rev. Mod. Phys.|year=2002|volume=74|issue=3|pages=875–893|doi=10.1103/revmodphys.74.875}}&lt;/ref&gt; he noticed that "often the simulations would be the primary thing people would remember from my talk. Based on their questions and comments, it appeared that they consistently learned the physics represented in the simulations."&lt;ref name="Oersted"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wieman|first=Carl|author2=Katherine K. Perkins |author3=Wendy K. Adams |title=Oersted Medal Lecture 2007: Interactive simulations for teaching physics: What works, what doesn't, and why|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=April 2008|volume=76|issue=4|page=393|url=http://ajp.aapt.org/resource/1/ajpias/v76/i4/p393_s1?isAuthorized=no|doi=10.1119/1.2815365}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then used money from a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] Distinguished Teaching Scholars program, the Kavli Foundation, and a portion of his Nobel Prize money to found PhET to improve the way that physics is taught and learned. The PhET simulations differ from the Physics 2000 ones because users can interact with the simulation to change conditions whereas the Physics 2000 simulations are just videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews Web Watch- Interactive Simulations|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/40/1/M04/pdf/pe5_1_m04.pdf|work=2005 Phys. Educ. 40 81|publisher=IOP Publishing|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Wieman moved to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] while retaining 20% faculty position at the University of Colorado Boulder. The current director of PhET is Dr. Katherine Perkins, who has been with PhET since January 2003. Perkins hopes that the simulations’ accessibility and interactive nature will increase scientific literacy and promote student engagement in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Xue|first=Katherine|title=Alumni Science Simulator|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/07/science-simulator|accessdate=22 August 2013|newspaper=Harvard Magazine|date=July–August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

PhET Interactive Simulations is part of the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] which is a member of the [[Association of American Universities]].&lt;ref name="Association of American Universities"&gt;{{cite web| title=Association of American Universities|url=http://www.aau.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team changes over time and has about 16 members consisting of professors, post-doctoral students, researchers, education specialists, software engineers (sometimes contractors), educators, and administrative assistants.&lt;ref name="PhET Interactive Simulations"&gt;{{cite web| title=About PhET | url=https://phet.colorado.edu/en/about}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director of PhET is Dr. Katherine Perkins.

==Design and educational impact==
PhET Interactive Simulations incorporates research-based practices on effective teaching to enhance the learning of science and mathematics concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bryan|first=Joel|title=Technology for Physics Instruction|journal=Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education|date=June 2006|volume=6|issue=2|page=230|url=http://www.editlib.org/p/21004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simulations are designed to be flexible so that they can be used as lecture demonstrations, labs, or homework activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ash|first=Katie|title=Programming Digital Fun Into Science Education|url=http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2011/06/15/03science.h04.html|publisher=Education Week Digital Directions}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They use an intuitive, game-like environment where students can learn through scientist-like exploration within a simplified environment, where dynamic visual representations make the invisible visible, and where science ideas are connected to real-world phenomena.

A PhET simulation starts with three to five people including a content expert (scientist), a teacher, an educational researcher, and a professional software developer. The design begins with identifying specific learning goals that have proven to be conceptually difficult based on teachers' experiences in the classroom. The simulation design, look and feel is storyboarded, discussed, and then finally "coded." Each simulation is user tested through interviews with students and in classrooms, re-worked as needed and re-tested, before released on the PhET website.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maki|first=Peggy|title=Assessing for Learning: Building a Sustainable Commitment Across the Institution|year=2004|publisher=Stylus Publishing|location=Sterling, VA|isbn=1579224407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with testing every simulation, the PhET team performs education research on their simulations. They have shown in their research that when students explore simulations in addition to traditional labs, student concept understanding improves.&lt;ref name="Science PhET"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wieman|first=Carl |author2=Wendy K. Adams |author3=Katherine K. Perkins|title=PhET Research: Simulations that Enhance Learning|journal=Science|date=October 2008|volume=322|page=682|doi=10.1126/science.1161948 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5902/682.summary?sid=fcec2d9d-af26-454d-adfc-ed0ec290ad39|pmid=18974334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PhET usage by educators==
While PhET Interactive Simulations develops the simulations, it is primarily teachers and publishers who develop the educational activities which use the simulations, sharing these with the community. Contributors on the PhET site follow [[Open Educational Practices|Open Education Practices]] (OEP), enabling teachers to use or adapt the activities freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PhET For Teachers|url=http://phet.colorado.edu/en/for-teachers|publisher=PhET Interactive Simulations|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pirelli Internetional Award''' was first offered in 1996, as the first international [[multimedia]] competition for the communication of science &amp; technology conducted entirely on the [[internet]]. Since then, annual awards have been granted to the best multimedia presentations focussing on themes involving the diffusion of science and technology.  The multimedia presentations must deal with either [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]], [[life sciences]], or the enabling [[Information technology|information and communication technologies]] that empower [[multimedia]] itself. According to [[Marco Tronchetti Provera]], President of the Pirelli Group, the award was established in the belief that the diffusion of social, economic and technological advances are as important as their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080509060437/http://www.pirelliaward.com/ Pirelli INTERNETional Award - The Multimedia Science Communication Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; As the name indicates, the award is sponsored by the [[Pirelli|Pirelli Corporation]].

==Judging==

An international jury of notable people including [[Nobel Prize]] laureates reviews the top entries.

With an overall budget prize of 105,000 euro (about [[US$]] 130,000), awards are granted in the following major categories: [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]], [[life sciences]], and [[information technology|information and communications technology]].

==Award Categories==

===Physics===

This category rewards the best multimedia works coming from the field of physics and amounts to an award of 15,000 euro.

===Chemistry===

This category rewards the best multimedia works coming from the field of chemistry and amounts to an award of 15,000 euro.

===Mathematics===

This category rewards the best multimedia work coming from the field of mathematics and amounts to an award of 15,000 euro.

===Life Sciences===

This category rewards the best multimedia work coming from the field of life sciences and amounts to an award of 15,000 euro.

===Information and Communications Technology===

This special category prize rewards those multimedia works which represent a relevant contribution to Information and Communications Technology by means of a product, process, or service, and is deemed to be of particular significance to the jury in that the Pirelli Internetional Award is predicated in large degree to contributions such as these. The Information and Communications Technology prize amounts to 15,000 euro.

==Top Pirelli Prize==
[[Image:TopPrizeAward.jpg|thumb|350px|right]]
The Top Pirelli Prize is the supreme recognition that the international jury grants a multimedia work which best embodies the philosophy of the Pirelli Internetional Award. In fact, the Top Pirelli Prize is considered the overall winner. It amounts to an additional 10,000 euro on top of the monetary award granted in any of the five regular categories. The Top Pirelli Prize was first awarded in 2001 (five years after the inception of the Pirelli Award) to [[Robert C. Michelson|Prof. Robert C. Michelson]] for his work on the [[Entomopter]], a biologically inspired insect-like aerial robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pirelliaward.com/ed6_edf.html |title=Education Section and Pirelli Top Prize |date=2001-10-10 |accessdate=2015-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715085056/http://www.pirelliaward.com/ed6_edf.html |archivedate=July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://vimeo.com/72360673

A '''Powder Deaerator''' (also '''powder compactor''' or '''powder densifier''') is a working apparatus for deaerating and compacting / densifying of dry, [[Granularity|fine-grained]] powders. The machine removes excess air and open spaces in the powder, leaving it a more solid, compact, material.

== Construction ==
Powder Deaerators consist of two parallel drums – a filter drum and a pressure drum – which rotate in opposite directions. The drums are driven via drive motor and [[Gear|spur gear]]. The filter drum is coated with a porous [[Sintering|sinter]] metal layer. It is connected to a vacuum line via a hollow shaft creating a [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] within the filter drum. An adjusting device serves for the setting of the gap width between the rollers. On the adjusting device there are spring assemblies to generate the necessary pressure.

== Function ==
The material is aspirated (sucked in) and held on the filter drum by a vacuum, where it is drawn in the space between the filter and pressure drums. The combination of vacuum and pressure causes a deaerating and densification of the product. At the end of the densification process, the densified product is stripped off the filter drum by knives so it can leave the machine.

== Applications ==
Deaerators can be used for the deaerating and densification of all powders and other fine-piece bulk materials. The aim of the application is to raise the bulk density and/or improve the handling properties of a product. Deaerators are also used for the dosing and precompaction in granulation processes. Typical products which can be handled are silicic acid, [[carbon black]], pigments, [[aluminium oxide]], [[magnesium oxide]], etc. The product temperatures can reach up to 100&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Benefits ==
Deaerators achieve savings in package, transport and storage capacity by significantly reducing the powder volume.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. Hirschberg: ''Handbuch Verfahrenstechnik und Anlagenbau: Chemie, Technik und Wirtschaftlichkeit'', Verlag Springer, Berlin, 1999, S. 1065.&lt;/ref&gt; Explosive products can also be compacted as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7643">A '''project delivery method''' is a system used by an agency or owner for organizing and financing design, construction, operations, and maintenance services for a [[structure]] or facility by entering into legal agreements with one or more entities or parties.

== Types ==

Common project delivery methods include:

; [[Design-Bid-Build]] (DBB) or Design-Award-Build (DAB)
: An owner develops [[contract documents]] with an [[architect]] or an [[engineer]] consisting of a set of [[blueprint]]s and a detailed specification.  Bids are solicited from [[independent contractor|contractors]] based on these documents; a contract is then awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder.
; DBB with [[Construction Management]] (DBB with CM)
: With partially completed contract documents, an owner will hire a construction manager to act as an agent.  As substantial portions of the documents are completed, the construction manager will solicit bids from suitable subcontractors.   This allows construction to proceed more quickly and allows the owner to share some of the risk inherent in the project with the construction manager.
; [[Design-Build]] (DB) or Design-Construct
: An owner develops a conceptual plan for a project, then solicits bids from [[joint venture]]s of architects [[and/or engineer]] and builders for the design and construction of the project.
; [[Design-Build-Operate-Maintain]] (DBOM)
: DBOM takes DB one step further by including the operations and maintenance of the completed project in the same original contract.
; [[Build-Operate-Transfer]] (BOT)
: BOT represents complete integration of the project delivery: the same contract governs the design, construction, operations, maintenance and financing of the project.  After some [[concession (contract)|concessionary]] period, the facility is transferred back to the owner.
; General Contractor/Construction Manager (GC/CM, GCCM, or CM/GC)
: An owner will hire a contractor to act as a combined agent and general contractor.  As substantial portions of the documents are completed, the GC/CM or CM/GC will solicit bids from suitable subcontractors.  These may be bid openly (similar to DBB) or via an alternative subcontractor selection process (e.g. '''M/E CCM''' for a mechanical/electrical contractor/construction manager).&lt;ref&gt;[https://des.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/documents/About/CPARB/AdminDocs/PrinciplesGCCMAltSubSelect_RCW39-10-385_12-21-16.pdf CPARB “Principles For Alternative Subcontractor Selection Process”].  Retrieved 2018-05-16&lt;/ref&gt; Subcontractors and sub-CCM's are frequently contracted to the GC/CM or CM/GC but may be contracted directly to the owner. This may allow for accelerated construction and confirmation of pricing, sharing of risk between owner and contractor, and flexibility in construction investigation, sequencing, and procurement.
 
; [[Integrated Project Delivery]] (IPD)
: A project delivery method in which the interests of the primary team members are aligned in such a way that the members can be integrated for optimal project performance resulting in a collaborative, value-based process delivering high-outcome results to the entire building team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Integrated Project Delivery - A Working Definition | work=[[American Institute of Architects]] California Council May 15, 2007 | url=http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/ipd_definition_doc_final_with_supplemental_info.pdf | accessdate=2008-11-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122143108/http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/ipd_definition_doc_final_with_supplemental_info.pdf | archivedate=November 22, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Integrated Project Delivery: A Guide | work=[[American Institute of Architects]] 2007 version 1 | url=http://www.aia.org/ipdg | accessdate=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Integrated Project Delivery - An Example Of  Relational Contracting | work=[[Lean Construction Institute]] Nov. 18, 2004 | url=http://www.leanconstruction.org/files/LCI_Symposium/Relational_Contracting_18Nov04/Relational_PPT/4-OwensINTEGRATEDPROJECTDELIVERY.ppt | accessdate=2008-11-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629055816/http://www.leanconstruction.org/files/LCI_Symposium/Relational_Contracting_18Nov04/Relational_PPT/4-OwensINTEGRATEDPROJECTDELIVERY.ppt | archivedate=2010-06-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;  [[Public-private partnership]] (PPP, 3P, or P3)
: A public–private partnership is a cooperative arrangement between one or more public entities (typically the owner) and another (typically private sector) entity to design, build, finance, and at times operate and maintain, the project for a specified period of time on behalf of the owner.

== Trends in delivery method prevalence ==
Though DBB is now used for most private projects and the majority of public projects, it has not historically been the predominant delivery method of choice.  The [[master builder (occupation)|master builders]] of centuries past acted both as designers and constructors for both public and private clients.  In the [[United States]], [[Zane's Post Road]] in [[Ohio]] and the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] in [[New York City]] were both originally developed under more integrated delivery methods, as were most infrastructure projects until 1933.  Integrated Project Delivery offers a new delivery method to remove considerable waste from the construction process while improving quality and a return to more collaborative methods from the past. 
In an effort to assist industry professionals with the selection of appropriate project delivery systems, construction management researchers have prepared a Procurement Method and Contract Selection Model, which can be used for high level decision making for construction projects on a case by case basis. &lt;ref&gt;Salem, O., Salman, B., &amp; Ghorai, S. (2017). Accelerating construction of roadway bridges using alternative techniques and procurement methods. Transport, 33(2), 567-579. https://doi.org/10.3846/16484142.2017.1300942
&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Conceptual differences between delivery methods ==
[[Image:Project Delivery Methods.png|frame|right|A graphical representation of the conceptual differences between project delivery methods.]]There are two key variables which account for the bulk of the variation between delivery methods:
* The extent of the integration of the various service providers.
* The extent to which the owner is directly financing the project.

When the various service providers are segmented, the owner has the most amount of control, but this control is costly and doesn't give each provider an incentive to optimize its contribution for the next service.  When there is tight integration amongst providers, each step of the delivery is undertaken with future activities in mind, resulting in cost savings, but limiting the owner's influence throughout the project.

The owner's direct financing of a project simply means that the owner directly pays the providers for their services.  In the case of a facility with a consistent revenue stream, indirect financing becomes possible: rather than be paid by the owner, the providers are paid with the revenue collected from the facility's operation.

Indirect financing risks being mistaken for [[privatization]].  Though the providers do have a concession to operate and collect revenue from a facility that they built and financed, the structure itself remains the property of the owner (usually a government agency in the case of public infrastructure).

[[File:Visions big.jpg|thumb|[[Music visualization]]s are generated in real-time]]
'''Real-time computer graphics''' or '''real-time rendering''' is the sub-field of [[computer graphics]] focused on producing and analyzing images in [[Real-time computing|real time]]. The term can refer to anything from rendering an application's graphical user interface ([[Graphical user interface|GUI]]) to real-time [[image analysis]], but is most often used in reference to interactive [[3D computer graphics]], typically using a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). One example of this concept is a [[video game]] that rapidly renders changing 3D environments to produce an illusion of motion.

Computers have been capable of generating 2D images such as simple lines, images and [[Polygon|polygons]] in real time since their invention. However, quickly rendering detailed 3D objects is a daunting task for traditional [[Von Neumann architecture]]-based systems. An early workaround to this problem was the use of [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s, [[2D computer graphics|2D images]] that could imitate 3D graphics.

Different techniques for [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] now exist, such as [[Real-time ray tracing|ray-tracing]] and [[Rasterisation|rasterization]]. Using these techniques and advanced hardware, computers can now render images quickly enough to create the illusion of motion while simultaneously accepting user input. This means that the user can respond to rendered images in real time, producing an interactive experience.

== Principles of real-time 3D computer graphics ==
{{main|3D computer graphics}}
The goal of computer graphics is to generate [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]], or [[Film frame|frame]]s, using certain desired metrics. One such metric is the number of [[Image-based modeling and rendering|frames generated]] in a given second. Real-time computer graphics systems differ from traditional (i.e., non-real-time) rendering systems in that non-real-time graphics typically rely on [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]]. In this process, millions or billions of rays are traced from the [[Virtual camera system|camera]] to the [[Virtual world|world]] for detailed rendering—this expensive operation can take hours or days to render a single frame.
[[File:Real-time Raymarched Terrain.png|thumb|Terrain rendering made in 2014]]
Real-time graphics systems must render each image in less than 1/30th of a second. Ray tracing is far too slow for these systems; instead, they employ the technique of [[Z-buffering|z-buffer]] [[triangle rasterization]]. In this technique, every object is decomposed into individual primitives, usually triangles. Each triangle gets [[Shader#Vertex shaders|positioned, rotated and scaled]] on the screen, and [[Rasterisation|rasterizer]] hardware (or a software emulator) generates pixels inside each triangle. These triangles are then decomposed into atomic units called [[Fragment (computer graphics)|fragments]] that are suitable for displaying on a [[Computer monitor|display screen]]. The fragments are drawn on the screen using a color that is computed in several steps. For example, a [[Texture mapping|texture]] can be used to "paint" a triangle based on a stored image, and then [[shadow mapping]] can alter that triangle's colors based on line-of-sight to light sources.
{{see also|Level of detail}}

===Video game graphics===
Real-time graphics optimizes image quality subject to time and hardware constraints. GPUs and other advances increased the image quality that real-time graphics can produce. GPUs are capable of handling millions of triangles per frame, and current [[DirectX#DirectX 11|DirectX 11]]/[[OpenGL]] 4.x class hardware is capable of generating complex effects, such as shadow volumes, [[motion blur]]ring, and [[Shader#Geometry shaders|triangle generation]], in real-time. The advancement of real-time graphics is evidenced in the progressive improvements between actual [[gameplay]] graphics and the pre-rendered [[cutscenes]] traditionally found in video games.&lt;ref name="hoso"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=fvSbCgAAQBAJ|page=86}}|title=How Software Works: The Magic Behind Encryption, CGI, Search Engines and Other Everyday Technologies.|last=Spraul|first=V. Anton|publisher=No Starch Press|year=2013|isbn=1593276664|location=|page=86|pages=|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutscenes are typically rendered in real-time—and may be [[interactivity|interactive]].&lt;ref name="tvge"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XiM0ntMybNwC|page=86}}|title=The Video Game Explosion: A History from PONG to Playstation and Beyond|last=Wolf|first=Mark J. P.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=9780313338687|location=|page=86|pages=|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the gap in quality between real-time graphics and traditional off-line graphics is narrowing, offline rendering remains much more accurate.

=== Advantages ===
[[File:FaceRig with full body.png|thumb|Real-time full body and face tracking]]

Real-time graphics are typically employed when interactivity (e.g., player feedback) is crucial. When real-time graphics are used in films, the director has complete control of what has to be drawn on each frame, which can sometimes involve lengthy decision-making. Teams of people are typically involved in the making of these decisions.

In real-time computer graphics, the user typically operates an input device to influence what is about to be drawn on the display. For example, when the user wants to move a character on the screen, the system updates the character's position before drawing the next frame. Usually, the display's response-time is far slower than the input device—this is justified by the immense difference between the (fast) response time of a human being's motion and the (slow) [[Persistence of vision|perspective speed of the human visual system]]. This difference has other effects too: because input devices must be very fast to keep up with human motion response, advancements in input devices (e.g., the current Wii remote) typically take much longer to achieve than comparable advancements in display devices.

Another important factor controlling real-time computer graphics is the combination of [[Game physics|physics]] and [[Computer animation|animation]]. These techniques largely dictate what is to be drawn on the screen—especially ''where'' to draw objects in the scene. These techniques help realistically imitate  real world behavior (the [[Dimension#Time|temporal dimension]], not the [[Dimension|spatial dimensions]]), adding to the computer graphics' degree of realism.

Real-time previewing with [[graphics software]], especially when adjusting lighting effects, can increase work speed.&lt;ref name="dili"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IRrsAQAAQBAJ|page=442}}|title=Digital Lighting and Rendering: Edition 3|last=Birn|first=Jeremy|publisher=New Riders|year=2013|isbn=9780133439175|location=|page=442|pages=|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parameter adjustments in [[fractal generating software]] may be made while viewing changes to the image in real time.

== Rendering pipeline ==
[[File:Cessna 172P over Lago di Guardia in FlightGear.jpg|thumb|[[Flight simulator]] screenshot]]
The [[graphics pipeline|graphics rendering pipeline]] ("rendering pipeline" or simply "pipeline") is the foundation of real-time graphics.&lt;ref name="retire"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=g_PRBQAAQBAJ|page=11}}|title=Real-Time Rendering, Third Edition: Edition 3|last=Akenine-Möller|first=Tomas|author2=Eric Haines|author3=Naty Hoffman|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|isbn=9781439865293|location=|page=11|pages=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main function is to render a two-dimensional image in relation to a virtual camera, three-dimensional objects (an object that has width, length, and depth), light sources, lighting models, textures and more.

=== Architecture ===
The architecture of the real-time rendering pipeline can be divided into conceptual stages: application, geometry and [[rasterization]]. 

=== Application stage ===
The application stage is responsible for generating "scenes", or 3D settings that are drawn to a 2D display. This stage is implemented in software that developers optimize for performance. This stage may perform processing such as collision detection, speed-up techniques, animation and force feedback, in addition to handling user input.

Collision detection is an example of an operation that would be performed in the application stage. Collision detection uses algorithms to detect and respond to collisions between (virtual) objects. For example, the application may calculate new positions for the colliding objects and provide feedback via a force feedback device such as a vibrating game controller.

The application stage also prepares graphics data for the next stage. This includes texture animation, animation of 3D models, animation via [[Geometric transformation|transforms]], and geometry morphing. Finally, it produces primitives (points, lines, and triangles) based on scene information and feeds those primitives into the geometry stage of the pipeline.

=== Geometry stage ===
{{main|Polygonal modeling}}
The geometry stage manipulates polygons and vertices to compute what to draw, how to draw it and where to draw it. Usually, these operations are performed by specialized hardware or GPUs.&lt;ref name="frpi"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=W4bSBQAAQBA|page=5}}|title=Computer Graphics: From Pixels to Programmable Graphics Hardware|last=Boresko|first=Alexey|author2=Evgeniy Shikin|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=9781482215571|location=|page=5|pages=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations across graphics hardware mean that the "geometry stage" may actually be implemented as several consecutive stages.

==== Model and view transformation ====
Before the final model is shown on the output device, the model is transformed onto multiple spaces or [[coordinate system]]s. Transformations move and manipulate objects by altering their vertices. ''Transformation'' is the general term for the four specific ways that manipulate the shape or position of a point, line or shape.

==== Lighting ====
In order to give the model a more realistic appearance, one or more light sources are usually established during transformation. However, this stage cannot be reached without first transforming the 3D scene into view space. In view space, the observer (camera) is typically placed at the origin. If using a [[Cartesian_coordinate_system#Orientation_and_handedness|right-handed]] coordinate system (which is considered standard), the observer looks in the direction of the negative z-axis with the y-axis pointing upwards and the x-axis pointing to the right.

==== Projection ====
{{main|Graphical projection}}
Projection is a transformation used to represent a 3D model in a 2D space. The two main types of projection are [[orthographic projection]] (also called parallel) and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective projection]]. The main characteristic of orthographic projection is that parallel lines remain parallel after the transformation. Perspective projection utilizes the concept that if the distance between the observer and model increases, the model appears smaller than before. Essentially, perspective projection mimics human sight.

==== Clipping ====
Clipping is the process of removing primitives that are outside of the view box in order to facilitate the rasterizer stage. Once those primitives are removed, the primitives that remain will be drawn into new triangles that reach the next stage.

==== Screen mapping ====
The purpose of screen mapping is to find out the coordinates of the primitives during the clipping stage.

==== Rasterizer stage ====
The rasterizer stage applies color and turns the graphic elements into pixels or picture elements.

== History ==
[[Computer animation]] has been around since the [[History of computer animation|1940s and 1950s]], but it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that 3D techniques were implemented. 

The first step towards 3D graphics was taken in 1972 by [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Fred Parke]]. Their implementation featured a computer-generated hand and face that was created using wire-frame imagery. Up until 1975, wire-frame imagery was the only digital technology used to create 3D images. 

3D graphics have reached the point where animated humans look almost entirely realistic. Eventually, humans may not be able to tell the difference between filmed humans and animated humans.

The film, [[Beowulf (2007 film)]], showcases 3D graphics that get close to fooling the human eye. The film was created using 3D [[motion capture]] technology.

'''Rockwell Collins''' is a [[multinational corporation]] company headquartered in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] providing [[avionics]] and [[information technology]] systems and services to [[Government agency|government agencies]] and [[aircraft manufacturer]]s. The company was merged with [[UTC Aerospace Systems]] on November 27, 2018, and now operates as [[Collins Aerospace]]. 

== History ==
[[Arthur A. Collins|Arthur Collins]] founded '''Collins Radio Company''' in 1933 in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]. It designed and produced both [[shortwave radio]] equipment and equipment for the burgeoning AM Broadcast industry. Collins was solicited by the military, the scientific community and by the larger AM radio stations for special equipment. Collins supplied the equipment to establish a communications link with the [[South Pole]] expedition of [[Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] [[Richard E. Byrd|Richard Byrd]] in 1933.

In 1936, Collins had begun production of the 12H audio console, 12X portable field announcers box, the 300E and 300F broadcast transmitters. Throughout [[World War II]], the 212A1 and 212B1 replaced the 12H design. Collins became the principal supplier of radio and navigation equipment used in the military, where uncompromising performance was required.

In the post war years, the Collins Radio Company expanded its work in all phases of the communications field while broadening its technology. This moved Arthur Collins into a more active role as CEO guiding department leaders holding significant responsibilities.  New developments such as flight control instruments, radio communication devices and satellite voice transmissions created great opportunities in the marketplace. Collins Radio Company provided communications for the United States' role in the [[Space Race]], including equipment for astronauts to communicate with earth stations and equipment to track and communicate with spacecraft. Collins communications equipment was used for Projects [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and [[Project Apollo|Apollo]], providing voice communication for every American astronaut traveling through space. In 1973, the U.S. [[Skylab]] Program used Collins equipment to provide communication from the astronauts to earth.

=== Rockwell Collins ===
After facing financial difficulties, the Collins Radio Company was purchased by [[Rockwell International]] in 1973. In 2001 the avionics division of Rockwell International was spun off to form the current Rockwell Collins, Inc., retaining its name. Rockwell Collins is highly concentrated in the defense and commercial avionics markets and no longer markets receivers to the public. The Collins [[mechanical filter]] is still in production and does, however, find consumer and commercial use.

On April 28, 2000, Rockwell International Corp and its Rockwell Collins unit agreed to acquire Sony Corp's Sony Trans Com (Irvine, Calif) for undisclosed terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-global-world.html |title=  ROCKWELL TO BUY SONY TRANS COM | work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony had purchased the business from [[Sundstrand Corp.]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/0b3960e064a66f9a5c0057fd4525a89a|title=Sundstrand Selling Trans Com Systems To Sony|date=1991-07-10|accessdate=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/rockwell-collins-acquires-sony-trans-com-0|title=Rockwell Collins Acquires Sony Trans Com|date=2000-06-01|accessdate=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2000, Rockwell Collins expanded its services to commercial and executive aviation in [[Mercosur]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5287e/y5287e0d.htm |title= Rockwell Collins expands services to Mercosul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has acquired several companies, including Hughes-Avicom's in-flight entertainment business, Intertrade Ltd., Flight Dynamics, K Systems, Inc. (Kaiser companies), Communication Solutions, Inc., Airshow, Inc., NLX (Simulation Business) in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2003/12/12/rockwell-collins-buys-nlx.aspx|title=Rockwell Collins buys NLX -- Washington Technology|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; portions of [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]], [[Teldix|TELDIX GmbH]], IP Unwired, Anzus Inc. in 2006, Information Technology &amp; Applications Corporation in 2007, [[Athena Technologies]], Datapath Inc.

The company is among the major suppliers of [[in-flight entertainment]] on board aircraft.  Rockwell Collins' key competitors in this industry include [[Panasonic Avionics Corporation]], [[Thales Group]], and [[JetBlue]]'s IFE subsidiary [[LiveTV]].

As of 2010, the company employs over 20,000 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rockwell Collins Inc|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company/Rockwell_Collins_Inc/rfyjsyi-1-1njdap.html|publisher=Hoover's Inc|accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an annual turnover of 4.665 billion [[US dollar]]s. Its non-executive chairman is Anthony Carbone following the retirement of [[Clayton M. Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rockwellcollins.com/sitecore/content/Data/News/2014_Cal_Year/RC/FY14RC-NR-39-Chairman.aspx | title=Clay Jones to retire from Rockwell Collins Board of Directors on July 31 | date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2012, Kelly Ortberg was appointed as president of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/24/rockwellcollins-president-idINL1E8KOI4B20120924 | work=Reuters | title=Rockwell Collins appoints Ortberg as president | date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2013, Kelly Ortberg was appointed CEO of Rockwell Collins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockwellcollins.com/Data/News/2013%20Cal%20Yr/RC/FY13RCNR34-Ortberg.aspx|title=Kelly Ortberg appointed CEO of Rockwell Collins|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 2017, [[United Technologies]] of [[Farmington, Connecticut]] agreed to acquire the company for $30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-technologies-to-acquire-rockwell-collins-for-30-billion-300513597.html | title=United Technologies To Acquire Rockwell Collins For $30 Billion | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction closed on November 26, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-technologies-announces-intention-to-separate-into-three-independent-companies-completes-acquisition-of-rockwell-collins-300755507.html | title=United Technologies Announces Intention to Separate Into Three Independent Companies; Completes Acquisition of Rockwell Collins | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Past Products ==

=== Broadcast transmitters ===

In the mid-1930s, the Collins Radio Company constructed and sold [[transmitters]] and audio mixing consoles to the [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] industry.

In 1939, the model 12 Speech Input Console, in addition to the 26C limiter amplifier, was licensed to Canadian Marconi Co. for both sales in Canada and His Majesties Service for the war effort.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}  Collins success in constructing broadcast transmitters continued to grow, selling well over a thousand up to the start of World War II.  During [[World War II]], Collins expertise grew in higher power transmitters producing designs which ran well over 15 kilowatts of RF power on a continuous basis.  After the war a limited number of AM transmitters were produced called the 300G and remain the finest in low power AM transmitters (300W) ever produced.

Collins remained an important manufacturer of AM and FM broadcast radio [[transmitters]] for the commercial market surviving the drastic cost cutting market of the 1960s and 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}  The transmitter line was later sold to [[Continental Electronics]], which continued to produce a number of Collins designs under its own nameplate before phasing them out in the 1980s.

=== Shortwave transmitters ===
Collins produced several shortwave transmitters to the commercial market.  A "30" Series production catered to the growing need of state highway patrol agencies and Department of Commerce aviation needs. During World War II, Collins produced high power transmitters for aircraft, notably the [[ART-13]] equipped with automatic tuning circuits, which represented an important enhancement for airborne radio communications.&lt;ref name="Helfrick2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albert D. Helfrick|title=Electronics In The Evolution Of Flight|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EumPJQBViz4C&amp;pg=PA60|year=2004|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=978-1-58544-413-7|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, Collins supported both broadcast and the growing post-war amateur radio market. The [[United States Coast Guard Cutter]] [[USCGC Courier (WAGR-410)|USCGC Courier]] was employed as seagoing relay station for [[Voice of America]] programming using two [[Collins 207B-1 Transmitter|Collins 207B-1 transmitters]].&lt;ref name = uscgweb&gt;U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Courier. United States Coast Guard. 2010-06-04. URL:http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Courier_WAGR410_Photos.asp. Accessed: 2010-06-04. (Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5qEcH1yCd)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modestoradiomuseum.org/voa%20courier.html|title=Voice of America Broadcasts From Coast Guard Cutter|publisher=Modesto Radio Museum|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Amateur radio]] transmitters included the 32V-1, -2, and -3, KWS-1 and the rack mounted KW-1.&lt;ref&gt;W0YVA Web Site, [http://www.isquare.com/personal_pages/kw1-list.htm “Collins KW-1 Registry”]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Receivers ===

Around 1947, the company introduced their first [[amateur radio]] receiver, the 75A-1 (called the 75A).  This set achieved excellent stability for the time due to high build quality and the use of a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) in its second conversion stage.  It was one of the few double conversion [[superheterodyne]]s on the market and covered only the amateur bands.

With the experience gained in the design of the 75A-1, Collins released the 51J-1 receiver, a general coverage HF set covering .5 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz.  It would be produced in somewhat updated versions (51J-2, 51J-3, 51J-4) for about a decade. It was known as the R-388 and was used in multiple receiver diversity [[radioteletype|RTTY]] installations.

The 75A amateur line was updated throughout the early 50s, finishing with the [[75A-4 and KWS-1|75A-4]], which was released in 1955.  The Collins [[mechanical filter]] was introduced to consumers in the 75A-3, and the 75A-4 was one of the first receivers marketed specifically as a [[single sideband]] receiver.  
[[Image:R390A.png|thumb|right|200px|Collins [[R-390A]] radio receiver]]
Around 1950, Collins began designing the R-390 (.5–30&amp;nbsp;MHz) for the US military.  This was intended to be a receiver of the highest performance available, with the ruggedness and serviceability required for military duty.  It featured direct mechanical digital frequency readout.  The set is composed of several modules for easy field repair—a bad module could simply be swapped out and repaired later, or junked.  Sets built during the original 1951 contract cost the government about $2500 each and around 16,000 were produced.

Concurrently, Collins developed the R-389, a long-wave version with fewer than 1000 made.  The R-391, another variant of the R-390, allowed choice of 8 different auto-tuned channels.

Three years later, Collins delivered the [[R-390A]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.r390a.com/html/history.htm|title=r390a.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011719/http://www.r390a.com/html/history.htm|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the military. About 54,000 were produced and the set was a military workhorse until the 1970s.  Like the R-390, it can outperform many modern radios, to the point that it was designated [[top secret]] until the late 1960s.

In 1958 Collins replaced the 75A series with the much smaller 75S series, part of the S/Line, discussed in the next section.  These featured mechanical filters, very accurate frequency readout, and excellent stability.  At the request of the US government, Collins designed the 51S-1 general coverage set, which was essentially (in intended use) a physically smaller replacement for the 51J series.  It was not intended as a replacement for the higher performance R-390A, and unlike the R-390A, it was extensively marketed for commercial use.

Collins produced a few high performance [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] receivers in the 1970s, such as the 651S-1.  Like their [[Vacuum tube|tube]] predecessors, these are coveted by collectors today.

=== Transceivers and systems ===

With the introduction of the S/Line in 1958, Collins moved from designing individual products that could be ''used'' together, to ones that were designed to ''integrate and operate'' together, in various combinations, as a system.  They were the first equipment maker to take this approach.  Collins was also the first to introduce a compact [[High frequency|HF]] [[transceiver]], the KWM-1, the year before.  Together, these two innovations put Collins temporarily ahead of its competition and set the stage for other manufacturers and the next generation of amateur (and military) HF radio equipment.

The 75S-1 receiver and 32S-1 transmitter, comprising the heart of the S/Line, operated separately or together to transceive.  The units included crystal [[Band-pass filter|bandpass filters]] and a new compact PTO design that provided stable, highly linear tuning across 200&amp;nbsp;kHz [[Frequency range|band segments]].  The S/Line tuning dial mechanism was unique when introduced.  It used concentric dials and a gear mechanism that provided precise dial resolution, better than 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.

[[File:Collins S3 Line FSc 090326.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Collins S/Line – 516F-2 power supply, 75S-3B receiver, 32S-3 transmitter, 312B-4 console, SM-1 microphone, circa 1969]]
Within a few years Collins had introduced additional S/Line components, including the 30S-1 kilowatt power amplifier, the 30L-1 desktop power amplifier, and the 62S-1 [[transverter]], which provided coverage of the 6 meter (50&amp;nbsp;MHz) and 2 meter (144&amp;nbsp;MHz) amateur bands.  The KWM-2 transceiver replaced the KWM-1 using many of the S/Line's design features and matching its styling.  Other accessories included speakers, microphones and control consoles.

Illustrating the uniqueness of their new, smaller units in the market, Collins advertisements in the 1950s and early 1960s emphasized the S/Line's physical styling and size as often as they did its performance.&lt;ref&gt;WA3KEY Virtual Collins Radio Museum, [http://www.wa3key.com/crads.html “Advertisement Archive”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins continued to improve the S/Line, first introducing the S-2, then the S-3 units, the 75S-3 (and -3A, -3B and -3C) receiver, and the 32S-3 and -3A transmitters.  The -3A and -3C units were identical to the -3 and -3B units, respectively, except they provided an extra set of [[heterodyne]] oscillator crystals enabling them to cover extra bands – useful for military, amateur and [[Military Affiliate Radio System|MARS]] operation, where operation just outside the regular amateur bands was necessary.

[[Image:Collins 30L-1 090327.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Collins 30L-1 Amplifier ca. 1970]]
Among [[amateur radio]] operators, the S/Line established its reputation as perhaps the most solidly engineered equipment available – and the most costly.  As a result, S/Line equipment, and the A-Line and other predecessors, are restored, prized, and operated on the air by collectors today.

Collins continued to produce the S/Line well into the late 1970s and after its acquisition by Rockwell.

In 1978, with the move to [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] design, the S/Line came to an end after a two decade production run.  The KWM-380 transceiver was introduced the next year – a break with the past both in its use of transistors and digital technology, and its styling.  It would be Collins’ final entry in the amateur radio market until it was discontinued in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;WA3KEY Virtual Collins Radio Museum, [http://www.wa3key.com/collins.html “Collins Amateur Equipment”]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computers ===

In the 1960s, the company designed and sold C-System computerized message switching equipment, built an intranet, and began implementing computer storage of design data for circuit boards and assemblies.  They had a goal of automating all functions from parts ordering and inventory to factory scheduling to generation of maintenance provisioning.

With products technically successful and far ahead of their time in many respects, Mr. Collins continued to invest in development at a rate that could not be supported by sales when a downturn occurred, and began to have financial problems.

=== Network Transmission Systems ===

In 1991, Rockwell sold its Richardson, TX based Network Transmission Systems division to [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alcatel-Lucent Company History|url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/about/history|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105165822/http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/about/history|archivedate=2013-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New York Times coverage of Rockwell unit sale|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/13/business/company-news-rockwell-to-sell-unit-to-alcatel.html | work=The New York Times | date=13 July 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CGE acquires Rockwell|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Alcatel-SA-company-History.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisitions ==

=== B/E Aerospace Acquisition ===
In April 2017, Rockwell Collins entered the [[aircraft cabin]] interiors market through the acquisition of [[B/E Aerospace]] for $8.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/861361/000094787117000307/ss38796_8k.htm | title=B/E Aerospace Form 8-K | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Wellington, Florida]], B/E products included seating, food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, lighting and oxygen systems, and modular galley and lavatory systems for commercial airliners and business jets. B/E benefits of rival [[Zodiac Aerospace]] delivery troubles. Retrofit opportunities are provided by its $12 billion installed base. B/E shareholders received 20% of the new Rockwell which then had $8.1 billion in revenues and $1.9 billion in pre-tax earnings with nearly 30,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/rockwell-collins-buying-be-aerospace-8-billion|title=Rockwell Collins Buying B/E Aerospace For $8 Billion|date=Oct 23, 2016|work=Aviation Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockwell Collins filed for regulatory approval for its intended acquisition of [[B/E Aerospace]], a manufacturer and supplier of aircraft cabin interior products, including cabin seating, lighting, oxygen systems, food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, galleys and lavatories, before the [[Philippine Competition Commission]] since the latter has a branch in the Philippines operating a manufacturing plant in Tanauan, Batangas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phcc.gov.ph/commission-decision-no-04-m-0022017-acquisition-rockwell-collins-inc-aerospace-inc/|title=Commission Decision No. 04-M-002/2017: Acquisition by Rockwell Collins, Inc. of B/E Aerospace, Inc. - Philippine Competition Commission|website=phcc.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the acquisition, a newly created direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell, Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., will merge with and into B/E Aerospace, with the latter surviving the merger as a direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Organizational structure ==
Rockwell Collins has five main divisions:
* Commercial Systems (CS)
* Government Systems (GS)
* International and Service Solutions (I&amp;SS)
* Information Management Services (IMS)
* Interior Systems (IS)

The CS division services the commercial airline industry and business aircraft, providing navigation, communication, [[Synthetic vision]], other cockpit products such as [[autoland]] [[autopilot]]s, and cabin products such as In Flight Entertainment (IFE).  The GS division services primarily the US government and military, but also provides some products and services to foreign governments with close ties to the United States.  Notable government related projects that Rockwell Collins has involvement with are [[Common Avionics Architecture System]] (CAAS), [[Joint Tactical Radio System]] (JTRS), [[Tactical Targeting Network Technology]] (TTNT), [[Defense Advanced GPS Receiver]] (DAGR), and [[Future Combat Systems]]. The I&amp;SS division is an amalgamation of (IB) International Business organization whose responsibility is sales, engineering and human resource of personnel outside of North America and Service Solutions who provides support services such as customer support, simulation and training and technical publications. I&amp;SS provide a common service to both CS and GS divisions and its formation was announced on the Rockwell Collins press release web page on February 19, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://rockwellcollins.com/news/page12280.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Donald R. Beall Advanced Technology Center ==
The Donald R. Beall Advanced Technology Center (ATC) is a research and development center within Rockwell Collins that focuses on creating, identifying, and maturing technologies targeted at driving business growth. ATC maintains a portfolio that balances shorter term deliverables focused on core and adjacent markets with technologies for long term growth. ATC has three departments: Advanced Radio Systems, Communications and Navigation Systems, and Embedded Information Systems.

==Collector community==
As with several other brands of [[Vintage amateur radio|vintage radio]] equipment, there is an active community of Collins radio enthusiasts, with clubs, web sites and [[Internet forum|on-line discussions]] dedicated to restoring and operating the equipment.  The Collins Collectors Association (CCA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsradio.org/|title=Collinsradio|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Collins Radio Association (CRA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsra.com/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two examples of such organizations.

Groups of Collins users also organize meetings, gatherings at [[hamfest]]s and regularly scheduled on-air discussions called [[Amateur radio net|“nets”]].
&lt;!-- Probably should create an article about amateur radio nets and their various types --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2388">'''Servo bandwidth''' is the maximum trackable [[sinusoidal]] [[frequency]] of [[amplitude]] A, with tracking achieved at or before 10% of A amplitude is reached. The servo [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] indicates the capability of the [[Servomechanism|servo]] to follow rapid changes in the commanded input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Industrial Servo Control Systems: Fundamentals and Applications | author = YOUNKIN | page = 42 | year = 2002 | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 978-0-8247-4352-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually specified as a frequency in [[Hertz]] or radian/sec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Power electronics handbook: devices, circuits, and applications | author = M.

== Explanation ==
{{Section OR|date=October 2011}}
Bandwidth of systems is generally defined to be the frequency at which the system's amplitude is &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; times the signal amplitude. But if we apply same logic to servo systems it is difficult to analyze and develop a system to a sufficiently accurate specification. This is because of [[ambiguity]] with regard to frequency at which the amplitude should go to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

A simple and sound definition can be sought regarding this.
Let us say we want to design a position [[servo control]] system with following specifications:
* Bandwidth:  10&amp;nbsp;Hz
* Allowed amplitude range : ± 50°

The above definition is not enough to design a practical control system. The definitions above have inherent problems with regard to what amplitude the [[manufacturer]] should take to design the servo with 10&amp;nbsp;Hz bandwidth.
If the manufacturer takes the amplitude to be ±20° and rise time for this amplitude to be 0.025 sec (10&amp;nbsp;Hz sinusoid)
and some other manufacturer takes amplitude to be ±50°, the acceleration requirements calculated by two will be very different.

This leads us to understand that giving servo bandwidth alone with no amplitude specification is almost useless. Also defining the bandwidth as per normal bandwidth definition does not help (ambiguity with regard to frequency at which the amplitude should go to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Sheet music is a written, notated representation of musical [[melody|melodies]], [[rhythm]]s and [[lyrics]] (if lyrics are present). This is a [[hymn]]-style arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]" in standard two-staff format ([[bass staff]] and [[Treble Clef|treble staff]]) for [[Mixed choir|mixed voices]]. {{audio|Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:Tibetanmusicalscore.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[Tibet]]an musical score from the 19th century.]]

'''Sheet music''' is a handwritten or printed form of [[music notation]] that uses [[List of musical symbols|modern musical symbols]] to indicate the pitches (melodies), [[rhythm]]s or [[chord (music)|chord]]s of a [[song]] or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs &amp;ndash; printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages &amp;ndash; the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]]), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on [[computer screen]]s and the development of [[scorewriter]] computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, "play back" the notated music using a [[synthesizer]] or [[virtual instrumentation|virtual instruments]].

Use of the term "sheet" is intended to differentiate written or printed forms of music from [[sound recording]]s (on [[vinyl record]], [[compact cassette|cassette]], [[Compact disc|CD]]), radio or TV broadcasts or recorded live performances, which may capture film or video footage of the performance as well as the audio component. In everyday use, "sheet music" (or simply "music") can refer to the print publication of commercial sheet music in conjunction with the release of a new [[Movie|film]], [[TV show]], [[record album]], or other special or popular event which involves music. The first printed sheet music made with a [[printing press]] was made in 1473.

Sheet music is the basic form in which Western [[classical music]] is notated so that it can be learned and performed by solo singers or instrumentalists or [[musical ensemble]]s. Many forms of [[traditional music|traditional]] and [[popular music|popular]] Western music are commonly learned by singers and musicians "by ear", rather than by using sheet music (although in many cases, traditional and pop music may also be available in sheet music form).

The term ''score'' is a common alternative (and more generic) term for sheet music, and there are several types of scores, as discussed below. The term ''score'' can also refer to [[theatre music]], [[orchestra]]l music or [[song]]s written for a [[play (theatre)|play]], [[musical theatre|musical]], [[opera]] or [[ballet]], or to music or songs written for a [[television program]]me or [[Movie|film]]; for the last of these, see [[Film score]].

==Elements==
[[File:Hector Berlioz, Béatrice et Bénédict score title page - Restoration.jpg|thumb|The title page for the first-edition vocal score for [[Hector Berlioz]]'s ''[[Béatrice et Bénédict]]''.]]

===Title and credit===
Sheet music from the 20th and 21st century typically indicates the title of the song or composition on a [[title page]] or cover, or on the top of the first page, if there is no title page or cover. If the song or piece is from a [[movie]], [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]], or [[opera]], the title of the main work from which the song/piece is taken may be indicated.

If the [[songwriter]] or [[composer]] is known, her or his name is typically indicated along with the title. The sheet music may also indicate the name of the [[lyrics|lyric-writer]], if the lyrics are by a person other than one of the songwriters or composers. It may also the name of the [[arranger]], if the song or piece has been arranged for the publication. No songwriter or composer name may be indicated for old [[folk music]], [[traditional music|traditional]] songs in genres such as [[blues]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and very old traditional [[hymn]]s and [[spirituals]], because for this music, the authors are often unknown; in such cases, the word ''Traditional'' is often placed where the composer's name would ordinarily go.

===Musical notation===
The type of [[musical notation]] varies a great deal by genre or style of music. In most [[classical music]], the [[melody]] and [[accompaniment]] parts (if present) are notated on the lines of a [[staff (music)|staff]] using round note heads. In classical sheet music, the staff typically contains:

# a [[clef]], such as [[bass clef]] {{music|bass}} or [[treble clef]] {{music|treble}}
# a [[key signature]] indicating the [[key (music)|key]]—for instance, a key signature with three [[Sharp (music)|sharps]] {{music|a major}} is typically used for the key of either [[A major]] or [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|sharp}} minor]]
# a [[time signature]], which typically has two numbers aligned vertically with the bottom number indicating the [[note value]] that represents one [[Beat (music)|beat]] and the top number indicating how many beats are in a [[Bar (music)|bar]]—for instance, a time signature of {{music|time|2|4|}} indicates that there are two [[quarter note]]s (crochets) per bar.

Most songs and pieces from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (ca. 1750) onward indicate the piece's [[tempo]] using an [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|expression]]—often in Italian—such as ''Allegro'' (fast) or ''Grave'' (slow) as well as its [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness or softness). The [[lyrics]], if present, are written near the melody notes. However, music from the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] (ca. 1600–1750) or earlier eras may have neither a tempo marking nor a dynamic indication. The singers and musicians of that era were expected to know what tempo and loudness to play or sing a given song or piece due to their musical experience and knowledge. In the [[contemporary classical music]] era (20th and 21st century), and in some cases before (such as the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period in German-speaking regions), composers often used their native language for tempo indications, rather than Italian (e.g., "fast" or "''schnell''") or added [[metronome]] markings (e.g., {{music|quarternote}} = 100 beats per minute).

[[File:DwtkII-as-dur-fuga.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.5|A page from the autograph score of Fugue No. 17 in A{{music|flat}} major from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.]]

These conventions of classical music notation, and in particular the use of English tempo instructions, are also used for sheet music versions of 20th and 21st century [[popular music]] songs. Popular music songs often indicate both the tempo and genre: "slow blues" or "uptempo rock". Pop songs often contain chord names above the staff using letter names (e.g., C Maj, F Maj, G7, etc.), so that an [[acoustic guitar]]ist or pianist can improvise a chordal [[accompaniment]].

In other styles of music, different musical notation methods may be used. In [[jazz]], while most professional performers can read "classical"-style notation, many jazz tunes are notated using [[chord chart]]s, which indicate the [[chord progression]] of a song (e.g., C, A7, d minor, G7, etc.) and its [[song form|form]]. Members of a jazz [[rhythm section]] (a [[jazz piano|piano]] player, [[jazz guitar]]ist and [[jazz bass|bassist]]) use the chord chart to guide their [[jazz improvisation|improvised]] [[accompaniment]] parts, while the "lead instruments" in a jazz group, such as a [[saxophone]] player or [[trumpet]]er, use the chord changes to guide their solo improvisation. Like popular music songs, jazz tunes often indicate both the tempo and genre: "slow blues" or "fast bop".

Professional [[country music]] [[session musician]]s typically use music notated in the [[Nashville Number System]], which indicates the chord progression using numbers (this enables [[bandleader]]s to change the key at a moment's notice). Chord charts using letter names, numbers, or [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]] (e.g., I–IV–V) are also widely used for notating music by [[blues]], [[R&amp;B]], [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musicians. Some chord charts do not provide any rhythmic information, but others use slashes to indicate beats of a bar and [[rhythm]] notation to indicate [[syncopation|syncopated]] "hits" that the songwriter wants all of the band to play together. Many guitar players and [[electric bass]] players learn songs and note tunes using [[tablature]], which is a graphic representation of which frets and strings the performer should play. "Tab" is widely used by rock music and heavy metal guitarists. Singers in many [[popular music]] styles learn a song using only a lyrics sheet, learning the melody "by ear" from the recording.

== Purpose and use ==
[[File:Oregon, My Oregon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The sheet music for the song "[[Oregon, My Oregon]]".]]
Sheet music can be used as a record of, a guide to, or a means to perform, a [[song]] or piece of music. Sheet music enables instrumental performers who are able to read [[music notation]] (a pianist, [[orchestra|orchestral instrument players]], a [[jazz]] band, etc.) or singers to perform a song or piece. In [[classical music]], authoritative musical information about a piece can be gained by studying the written [[Sketch (music)|sketches]] and early versions of compositions that the composer might have retained, as well as the final autograph score and personal markings on proofs and printed scores.

Comprehending sheet music requires a special form of literacy: the ability to read [[music notation]]. An ability to read or write music is not a requirement to compose music. There have been a number of [[composer]]s and [[songwriter]]s who have been capable of producing music without the capacity themselves to read or write in musical notation, as long as an [[amanuensis]] of some sort is available to write down the [[melody|melodies]] they think of. Examples include the blind 18th-century composer [[John Stanley (composer)|John Stanley]] and the 20th-century songwriters [[Lionel Bart]], [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. As well, in [[traditional music]] styles such as the [[blues]] and [[folk music]], there are many prolific songwriters who could not read music, and instead played and sang music "by ear".

The skill of [[sight reading]] is the ability of a musician to perform an unfamiliar work of music upon viewing the sheet music for the first time. Sight reading ability is expected of professional musicians and serious amateurs who play classical music, jazz and related forms. An even more refined skill is the ability to look at a new piece of music and hear most or all of the sounds ([[Melody|melodies]], [[Harmony|harmonies]], [[timbre]]s, etc.) in one's head without having to play the piece or hear it played or sung. Skilled composers and conductors have this ability, with [[Beethoven]] being a noted historical example.
[[File:Full score.jpg|thumb|A [[Conductor (music)|conductor]]'s score and [[Baton (conducting)|baton]]|left]]
Classical musicians playing [[orchestra]]l works, [[chamber music]], [[sonata]]s and singing [[choral]] works ordinarily have the sheet music in front of them on a [[music stand]] when performing (or held in front of them in a music folder, in the case of a [[choir]]), with the exception of solo instrumental performances of solo pieces, [[concerto]]s, or solo vocal pieces ([[art song]], [[opera]] [[aria]]s, etc.), where memorization is expected. In [[jazz]], which is mostly [[improvisation|improvised]], sheet music (called a ''[[lead sheet]]'' in this context) is used to give basic indications of [[melody|melodies]], [[chord (music)|chord]] changes, and [[arrangement]]s. Even when a jazz band has a lead sheet, chord chart or arranged music, many elements of a performance are improvised.

Handwritten or printed music is less important in other traditions of musical practice, however, such as [[traditional music]] and [[folk music]], in which singers and instrumentalists typically learn songs "by ear" or from having a song or tune taught to them by another person. Although much [[popular music]] is published in notation of some sort, it is quite common for people to [[Learning music by ear|learn a song by ear]]. This is also the case in most forms of western [[folk music]], where songs and dances are passed down by oral &amp;ndash; and aural &amp;ndash; tradition. Music of other cultures, both folk and classical, is often transmitted orally, though some non-Western cultures developed their own forms of [[musical notation]] and sheet music as well.

Although sheet music is often thought of as being a platform for new music and an aid to composition (i.e., the composer "writes" the music down), it can also serve as a visual record of music that already exists. Scholars and others have made transcriptions to render Western and non-Western music in readable form for study, analysis and re-creative performance. This has been done not only with folk or traditional music (e.g., [[Béla Bartók|Bartók's]] volumes of [[Magyars|Magyar]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]] folk music), but also with sound recordings of improvisations by musicians (e.g., [[jazz piano]]) and performances that may only partially be based on notation.  An exhaustive example of the latter in recent times is the collection ''The Beatles: Complete Scores'' (London: Wise Publications, 1993), which seeks to transcribe into [[Staff (music)|staves]] and [[tablature]] all the songs as recorded by [[the Beatles]] in instrumental and vocal detail.

==Types==&lt;!--[[Short score]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
Modern sheet music may come in different formats. If a piece is composed for just one instrument or voice (such as a piece for a solo instrument or for ''[[a cappella]]'' solo voice), the whole work may be written or printed as one piece of sheet music. If an instrumental piece is intended to be performed by more than one person, each performer will usually have a separate piece of sheet music, called a [[Part (music)|''part'']], to play from. This is especially the case in the publication of works requiring more than four or so performers, though invariably a ''full score'' is published as well. The sung parts in a vocal work are not usually issued separately today, although this was historically the case, especially before music printing made sheet music widely available.

Sheet music can be issued as individual pieces or works (for example, a popular song or a [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] sonata), in collections (for example works by one or several composers), as pieces performed by a given artist, etc.

When the separate instrumental and vocal parts of a musical work are printed together, the resulting sheet music is called a ''score''. Conventionally, a score consists of [[musical notation]] with each instrumental or vocal part in vertical alignment (meaning that concurrent events in the notation for each part are orthographically arranged). The term ''score'' has also been used to refer to sheet music written for only one performer. The distinction between ''score'' and ''part'' applies when there is more than one part needed for performance.

Scores come in various formats.
[[File:Der 100. Psalm Max Reger.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The first page of the full score for [[Max Reger]]'s ''[[Der 100. Psalm]]'' for [[choir]], [[orchestra]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]].]]

=== Full scores, variants, and condensations {{anchor|full score}} ===

A '''full score''' is a large book showing the music of all instruments or voices in a composition lined up in a fixed order. It is large enough for a [[Conducting|conductor]] to be able to read while directing [[orchestra]] or [[opera]] rehearsals and performances. In addition to their practical use for conductors leading ensembles, full scores are also used by [[musicologist]]s, [[music theory|music theorists]], [[composer]]s and music students who are studying a given work.

A '''miniature score''' is like a full score but much reduced in size. It is too small for use in a performance by a conductor, but handy for studying a piece of music, whether it be for a large ensemble or a solo performer. A miniature score may contain some introductory remarks.

A '''study score''' is sometimes the same size as, and often indistinguishable from, a miniature score, except in name. Some study scores are [[Octavo (book)|octavo]] size and are thus somewhere between full and miniature score sizes. A study score, especially when part of an anthology for academic study, may include extra comments about the music and markings for learning purposes.

A '''piano score''' (or [[reduction (music)|'''piano reduction''']]) is a more or less literal [[Transcription (music)|transcription]] for piano of a piece intended for many performing parts, especially orchestral works; this can include purely instrumental sections within large vocal works (see ''vocal score'' immediately below). Such arrangements are made for either piano solo (two hands) or piano [[duet]] (one or two pianos, four hands). Extra small staves are sometimes added at certain points in piano scores for two hands to make the presentation more complete, though it is usually impractical or impossible to include them while playing.

As with vocal score (below), it takes considerable skill to reduce an orchestral score to such smaller forms because the reduction needs to be not only playable on the keyboard but also thorough enough in its presentation of the intended [[Harmony|harmonies]], [[Texture (music)|textures]], [[Figuration (music)|figurations]], etc. Sometimes markings are included to show which instruments are playing at given points.

While piano scores are usually not meant for performance outside of study and pleasure ([[Franz Liszt]]'s [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|concert transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies]] being one group of notable exceptions), [[ballet]]s get the most practical benefit from piano scores because with one or two pianists they allow the ballet to do many rehearsals at a much lower cost, before an [[orchestra]] has to be hired for the final rehearsals. Piano scores can also be used to train beginning conductors, who can conduct a pianist playing a piano reduction of a symphony; this is much less costly than conducting a full orchestra. Piano scores of operas do not include separate staves for the vocal parts, but they may add the sung text and stage directions above the music.

A [[Part (music)|'''part''']] is an extraction from the full score of a particular instrument's part. It is used by orchestral players in performance, where the full score would be too cumbersome. However, in practice, it can be a substantial document if the work is lengthy, and a particular instrument is playing for much of its duration.
[[File:CuiVil3 2p204.png|thumb|upright=1.5|An excerpt of a piano-vocal score for [[César Cui]]'s opera ''[[William Ratcliff (Cui)|William Ratcliff]]''. {{audio|CuiVil3 2p204.mid|Play}}|left]]

===Vocal scores===
A '''[[vocal score]]''' (or, more properly, '''piano-vocal score''') is a reduction of the full score of a vocal work (e.g., [[opera]], [[Musical theatre|musical]], [[oratorio]], [[cantata]], etc.) to show the vocal parts (solo and [[Choir|choral]]) on their [[musical staff|staves]] and the orchestral parts in a [[Piano Reduction|piano reduction]] (usually for two hands) underneath the vocal parts; the purely orchestral sections of the score are also reduced for piano. If a portion of the work is ''[[a cappella]]'', a piano reduction of the vocal parts is often added to aid in [[rehearsal]] (this often is the case with ''a cappella'' religious sheet music).

Piano-vocal scores serve as a convenient way for vocal soloists and choristers to learn the music and rehearse separately from the orchestra. The vocal score of a [[Musical theatre|musical]] typically does not include the spoken dialogue, except for cues. Piano-vocal scores are used to provide piano accompaniment for the performance of operas, musicals and oratorios by amateur groups and some small-scale professional groups. This may be done by a single piano player or by two piano players. With some 2000s-era musicals, keyboardists may play [[synthesizer]]s instead of piano.
[[File:Chichester-Psalms.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A choral score for [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[Chichester Psalms]]''.]]
The related but less common '''choral score''' contains the choral parts with reduced accompaniment.

The comparable '''organ score''' exists as well, usually in association with church music for voices and orchestra, such as arrangements (by later hands) of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''. It is like the piano-vocal score in that it includes staves for the vocal parts and reduces the orchestral parts to be performed by one person. Unlike the vocal score, the organ score is sometimes intended by the arranger to substitute for the orchestra in performance if necessary.

A collection of songs from a given [[Musical theatre|musical]] is usually printed under the label '''vocal selections'''. This is different from the vocal score from the same show in that it does not present the complete music, and the piano accompaniment is usually simplified and includes the melody line.

===Other types===
A '''short score''' is a reduction of a work for many instruments to just a few staves. Rather than composing directly in full score, many composers work out some type of short score while they are composing and later expand the complete orchestration. An opera, for instance, may be written first in a short score, then in full score, then reduced to a vocal score for rehearsal. Short scores are often not published; they may be more common for some performance venues (e.g., band) than in others. Because of their preliminary nature, short scores are the principal reference point for those composers wishing to attempt a 'completion' of another's unfinished work (e.g. Movements 2 thru 5 of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)|10th Symphony]] or the third Act of [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'').

An '''open score''' is a score of a [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] piece showing each voice on a separate staff. In Renaissance or Baroque keyboard pieces, open scores of four staves were sometimes used instead of the more modern convention of one staff per hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Open score|author=Lalage Cochrane|access-date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes synonymous with full score (which may have more than one part per staff).

Scores from the Baroque period (1600-1750) are very often in the form of a [[bass line]] in the bass clef and the melodies played by instrument or sung on an upper stave (or staves) in the treble clef. The bass line typically had figures written above the bass notes indicating which intervals above the bass (e.g., chords) should be played, an approach called ''[[figured bass]]''. The figures indicate which intervals the [[harpsichord]]ist, [[pipe organ]]ist or [[lute]] player should play above each bass note.
[[File:Trifle In Pyjamas lead sheet.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The lead sheet for the song "Trifle in Pyjamas"|left]]

===Popular music===
A '''[[lead sheet]]''' specifies only the melody, lyrics and harmony, using one staff with [[chord symbol]]s placed above and lyrics below. It is commonly used in [[popular music]] and in [[jazz]] to capture the essential elements of song without specifying the details of how the song should be arranged or performed.

A '''[[chord chart]]''' (or simply, '''chart''') contains little or no melodic information at all but provides fundamental harmonic information. Some chord charts also indicate the rhythm that should be played, particularly if there is a [[syncopation|syncopated]] series of "hits" that the arranger wants all of the rhythm section to perform. Otherwise, chord charts either leave the rhythm blank or indicate slashes for each beat.

This is the most common kind of written music used by professional [[session musician]]s playing [[jazz]] or other forms of [[Genres (popular music)|popular music]] and is intended for the [[rhythm section]] (usually containing piano, guitar, bass and drums) to improvise their [[accompaniment]] and for any [[jazz improvisation|improvising]] soloists (e.g., [[saxophone]] players or [[trumpet]] players) to use as a reference point for their extemporized lines.

A [[fake book]] is a collection of [[jazz]] songs and tunes with just the basic elements of the music provided. There are two types of fake books: (1) collections of lead sheets, which include the melody, chords, and lyrics (if present), and (2) collections of songs and tunes with only the chords. Fake books that contain only the chords are used by [[rhythm section]] performers (notably chord-playing musicians such as [[electric guitar]]ists and [[piano]] players and the bassist) to help guide their improvisation of [[accompaniment]] parts for the song. Fake books with only the chords can also be used by "lead instruments" (e.g., [[saxophone]] or [[trumpet]]) as a guide to their improvised solo performances. Since the melody is not included in chord-only fake books, lead instrument players are expected to know the melody.
[[File:Diatonic scale on C tablature clef.png|thumb|A C major scale in regular notation (above) and in [[tabulature]] for [[guitar]] (below).]]
A '''[[tablature]]''' (or '''tab''') is a special type of musical score &amp;ndash; most typically for a solo instrument &amp;ndash; which shows ''where'' to play the pitches on the given instrument rather than ''which'' pitches to produce, with rhythm indicated as well. Tabulature is widely used in the 2000s for guitar and electric bass songs and pieces in popular music genres such as [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music]]. This type of notation was first used in the late [[Middle Ages]], and it has been used for keyboard (e.g., [[pipe organ]]) and for fretted string instruments (lute, guitar).

== History ==

===Precursors to sheet music===
[[Musical notation]] was developed before parchment or paper were used for writing. The earliest form of musical notation can be found in a [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet that was created at [[Nippur]], in [[Sumer]] (today's [[Iraq]]) in about 2,000 BC. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, that the music was composed in harmonies of thirds, and that it was written using a [[diatonic scale]].&lt;ref name="Kilmer1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kilmer |first1=Anne D. |date=1986 |title=Old Babylonian Musical Instructions Relating to Hymnody |jstor=1359953 |journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies |publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research  |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=94–98 |doi=10.2307/1359953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tablet from about 1,250 BC shows a more developed form of notation.&lt;ref name="Kilmer 1965"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kilmer |first=Anne D. |editor1-last=Güterbock |editor1-first=Hans G. |editor2-last=Jacobsen |editor2-first=Thorkild |date=21 April 1965 |title=The Strings of Musical Instruments: their Names, Numbers, and Significance |url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/as16.pdf |journal=Assyriological Studies |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |volume=16 |pages=261–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a [[lyre]], the tuning of which is described in other tablets.&lt;ref name="West 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West |first1=M.L. |author-link1=Martin Litchfield West |date=1994 |title=The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts |jstor=737674  |journal=[[Music &amp; Letters]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=161–179 |doi=10.1093/ml/75.2.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated [[melody|melodies]] found anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="West 1994" /&gt;

[[File:Delphichymn.jpg|thumb|The original stone at Delphi containing the second of the two [[Delphic Hymns]] to [[Apollo]]. The music notation is the line of occasional symbols ''above'' the main, uninterrupted line of Greek lettering.|left]]
[[Music of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BC until approximately the 4th century AD; several complete compositions and fragments of compositions using this notation survive. The notation consists of symbols placed above text syllables. An example of a complete composition is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], which has been variously dated between the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.

In [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]], three hymns by [[Mesomedes]] of [[Crete]] exist in manuscript. One of the oldest known examples of music notation is a papyrus fragment of the Hellenic era play ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'' (408 BC) has been found, which contains musical notation for a choral ode. Ancient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]].

===Western manuscript notation===
Before the 15th century, Western music was written by hand and preserved in [[manuscript]]s, usually bound in large volumes. The best-known examples of Middle Ages music notation are medieval manuscripts of [[Monophony|monophonic]] [[chant]]. Chant notation indicated the notes of the chant melody, but without any indication of the rhythm. In the case of [[Medieval music|Medieval]] [[polyphony]], such as the [[motet]], the parts were written in separate portions of facing pages. This process was aided by the advent of [[mensural notation]], which also indicated the [[rhythm]] and was paralleled by the medieval practice of composing parts of [[polyphony]] sequentially, rather than simultaneously (as in later times). Manuscripts showing parts together in score format were rare and limited mostly to [[organum]], especially that of the [[Notre Dame school]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], if an [[Abbess]] wanted to have a copy of an existing composition, such as a composition owned by an Abbess in another town, she would have to hire a [[copyist]] to do the task by hand, which would be a lengthy process and one that could lead to transcription errors.

Even after the advent of music printing in the mid-1400s, much music continued to exist solely in composers' hand-written manuscripts well into the 18th century.

===Printing===
{{see also|History of music publishing|Music engraving}}

====15th century====
There were several difficulties in translating the new [[printing press]] technology to music. In the first printed book to include music, the ''[[Mainz Psalter]]'' (1457), the music notation (both staff lines and notes) was added in by hand. This is similar to the room left in other [[Incunabulum|incunabulae]] for [[Capital letters|capitals]]. The psalter was printed in [[Mainz]], Germany by [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer]], and one now resides in [[Windsor Castle]] and another at the [[British Library]]. Later, staff lines were printed, but scribes still added in the rest of the music by hand. The greatest difficulty in using [[movable type]] to print music is that all the elements must line up &amp;ndash; the note head must be properly aligned with the staff. In vocal music, text must be aligned with the proper notes (although at this time, even in manuscripts, this was not a high priority).

[[Music engraving]] is the [[art]] of drawing [[music notation]] at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The first machine-printed music appeared around 1473, approximately 20 years after [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] introduced the [[printing press]]. In 1501, [[Ottaviano Petrucci]] published ''[[Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A]]'', which contained 96 pieces of printed music. Petrucci's printing method produced clean, readable, elegant music, but it was a long, difficult process that required three separate passes through the printing press. Petrucci later developed a process which required only two passes through the press. But it was still taxing since each pass required very precise alignment for the result to be legible (i.e., so that the note heads would be correctly lined up with the staff lines). This was the first well-distributed printed polyphonic music. Petrucci also printed the first [[tablature]] with movable type. Single impression printing, in which the staff lines and notes could be printed in one pass, first appeared in London around 1520. [[Pierre Attaingnant]] brought the technique into wide use in 1528, and it remained little changed for 200 years.
[[File:Petrucci2.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece to Petrucci's Odhecaton]]

A common format for issuing multi-part, polyphonic music during the Renaissance was ''[[partbook]]s''. In this format, each voice-part for a collection of five-part [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]], for instance, would be printed separately in its own book, such that all five part-books would be needed to perform the music. The same partbooks could be used by singers or instrumentalists. Scores for multi-part music were rarely printed in the Renaissance, although the use of score format as a means to compose parts simultaneously (rather than successively, as in the late Middle Ages) is credited to [[Josquin des Prez]].

The effect of printed music was similar to the effect of the printed word, in that information spread faster, more efficiently, at a lower cost, and to more people than it could through laboriously hand-copied manuscripts. It had the additional effect of encouraging amateur musicians of sufficient means, who could now afford sheet music, to perform. This in many ways affected the entire [[music industry]]. Composers could now write more music for amateur performers, knowing that it could be distributed and sold to the [[middle class]].

This meant that composers did not have to depend solely on the patronage of wealthy aristocrats. Professional players could have more music at their disposal and they could access music from different countries. It increased the number of amateurs, from whom professional players could then earn money by teaching them. Nevertheless, in the early years, the cost of printed music limited its distribution. Another factor that limited the impact of printed music was that in many places, the right to print music was granted by the monarch, and only those with a special dispensation were allowed to do so, giving them a [[monopoly]]. This was often an honour (and economic boon) granted to favoured court musicians or composers.

====16th century====
Mechanical [[Engraving|plate engraving]] was developed in the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although plate engraving had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. [[Copper]] was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century, [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate engraving was the methodology of choice for music printing until the late nineteenth century, at which point its decline was hastened by the development of photographic technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the technique has survived to the present day and is still occasionally used by select publishers such as [[G. Henle Verlag]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.henle.com/en/the-publishing-house/music-engraving/index.html |title = Music Engraving |date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014 |website = G. Henle Publishers |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As musical composition increased in complexity, so too did the technology required to produce accurate musical scores. Unlike literary printing, which mainly contains printed words, music engraving communicates several different types of information simultaneously. To be clear to musicians, it is imperative that engraving techniques allow absolute precision. Notes of [[Chord (music)|chords]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]], and other notation line up with vertical accuracy. If text is included, each syllable matches vertically with its assigned melody. Horizontally, subdivisions of beats are marked not only by their flags and [[Beam (music)|beams]], but also by the relative space between them on the page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The logistics of creating such precise copies posed several problems for early music engravers, and have resulted in the development of several music engraving technologies.

====19th century====
[[File:Tinpanalley.jpg|thumb|left|Buildings of New York City's [[Tin Pan Alley]] music publishing district in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/insearch/tinpanalley/tinpanalley.php |title=America's Music Publishing Industry — The story of Tin Pan Alley |website=The Parlor Songs Academy }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 19th century, the music industry was dominated by sheet music publishers. In the United States, the sheet music industry rose in tandem with [[blackface minstrelsy]]. The group of New York City-based music publishers, songwriters and composers dominating the industry was known as "[[Tin Pan Alley]]". In the mid-19th century, [[copyright]] control of melodies was not as strict, and publishers would often print their own versions of the songs popular at the time. With stronger copyright protection laws late in the century, songwriters, composers, lyricists, and publishers started working together for their mutual financial benefit.  New York City publishers concentrated on vocal music. The biggest music houses established themselves in New York City, but small local publishers &amp;ndash; often connected with commercial printers or music stores &amp;ndash; continued to flourish throughout the country. An extraordinary number of East European immigrants became the music publishers and songwriters on Tin Pan Alley-the most famous being [[Irving Berlin]]. Songwriters who became established producers of successful songs were hired to be on the staff of the music houses.

The late-19th century saw a massive explosion of [[parlor music]], with ownership of, and skill at playing the [[piano]] becoming ''de rigueur'' for the middle-class family. In the late-19th century, if a middle-class family wanted to hear a popular new song or piece, they would buy the sheet music and then perform the song or piece in an amateur fashion in their home. But in the early 20th century the [[phonograph]] and recorded music grew greatly in importance. This, joined by the growth in popularity of [[radio broadcasting]] from the 1920s on, lessened the importance of the sheet music publishers. The [[record industry]] eventually replaced the sheet music publishers as the music industry's largest force.

===20th century and early 21st century===
[[File:Screenshot general 3 large.png|thumb|The screenshot from a 2000s-era [[scorewriter]] program. While the first scorewriter programs from the 1980s had poor-quality notation, 2016-era scorewriters provide professional-looking music notation.]]
In the late 20th and into the 21st century, significant interest has developed in representing sheet music in a computer-readable format (see [[Scorewriter|music notation software]]), as well as downloadable files. [[Music OCR]], software to "read" scanned sheet music so that the results can be manipulated, has been available since 1991.

In 1998, virtual sheet music evolved further into what was to be termed [[digital sheet music]], which for the first time allowed publishers to make copyright sheet music available for purchase online. Unlike their hard copy counterparts, these files allowed for manipulation such as instrument changes, transposition and [[MIDI]] (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) playback. The popularity of this instant delivery system among musicians appears to be acting as a catalyst of new growth for the industry well into the foreseeable future.

An early computer notation program available for home computers was [[Music Construction Set]], developed in 1984 and released for several different platforms. Introducing concepts largely unknown to the home user of the time, it allowed manipulation of notes and symbols with a pointing device such as a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]; the user would "grab" a note or symbol from a palette and "[[Drag and drop|drop]]" it onto the staff in the correct location. The program allowed playback of the produced music through various early sound cards, and could print the musical score on a graphics printer.

Many software products for modern [[digital audio workstation]] and [[List of scorewriters|scorewriters]] for general personal computers support generation of sheet music from MIDI files, by a performer playing the notes on a MIDI-equipped keyboard or other [[MIDI controller]] or by manual entry using a mouse or other computer device.

In 1999, [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] invented a system and method for coordinating music display among players in an orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|6348648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connick's invention is a device with a computer screen which is used to show the sheet music for the musicians in an orchestra instead of the more commonly used paper. Connick uses this system when touring with his [[big band]], for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macobserver.com/article/2002/03/07.6.shtml |title=Harry Connick Jr. Uses Macs at Heart of New Music Patent |publisher=The Mac Observer |date=2002-03-07 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the classical music world, some [[string quartet]] groups use computer screen-based parts. There are several advantages to computer-based parts. Since the score is on a computer screen, the user can adjust the contrast, brightness and even the size of the notes, to make reading easier. In addition, some systems will do "page turns" using a foot pedal, which means that the performer does not have to miss playing music during a page turn, as often occurs with paper parts.

Of special practical interest for the general public is the [[Mutopia project]], an effort to create a library of [[public domain]] sheet music, comparable to [[Project Gutenberg]]'s library of public domain books. The [[International Music Score Library Project]] (IMSLP) is also attempting to create a virtual library containing all [[public domain]] musical scores, as well as scores from composers who are willing to share their music with the world free of charge.

Some [[scorewriter]] computer programs have a feature that is very useful for composers and arrangers: the ability to "play back" the notated music using [[synthesizer]] sounds or [[virtual instrumentation|virtual instruments]]. Due to the high cost of hiring a full symphony orchestra to play a new composition, before the development of these computer programs, many composers and arrangers were only able to hear their orchestral works by arranging them for piano, organ or string quartet. While a scorewiter program's playback will not contain the nuances of a professional orchestra recording, it still conveys a sense of the tone colors created by the piece and of the interplay of the different parts.

'''Signal integrity''' or '''SI''' is a set of measures of the quality of an [[electrical signal]].  In [[digital electronics]], a stream of binary values is represented by a voltage (or current) waveform.  However, digital signals are fundamentally [[analog signal|analog]] in nature, and all signals are subject to effects such as [[electrical noise|noise]], [[distortion]], and loss. Over short distances and at low bit rates, a simple conductor can transmit this with sufficient fidelity. At high [[bit rates]] and over longer distances or through various mediums, various effects can degrade the electrical signal to the point where errors occur and the system or device fails.  Signal integrity engineering is the task of analyzing and mitigating these effects. It is an important activity at all levels of electronics packaging and assembly, from internal connections of an [[integrated circuit]] (IC),&lt;ref name="Kariat"&gt;{{cite book

Some of the main issues of concern for signal integrity are [[ringing (signal)|ringing]], [[crosstalk]], [[ground bounce]], [[distortion]], signal loss, and [[power supply]] noise.

== History ==
Signal integrity primarily involves the electrical performance of the wires and other packaging structures used to move signals about within an electronic product. Such performance is a matter of basic physics and as such has remained relatively unchanged since the inception of electronic signaling.   The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] suffered from [[Transatlantic telegraph cable#Communication speeds|severe signal integrity problems]], and analysis of the problems yielded many of the mathematical tools still used today to analyze signal integrity problems, such as the [[telegrapher's equations]].  Products as old as the Western Electric [[Crossbar switch#Electromechanical / telephony|crossbar telephone exchange]] (circa 1940), based on the wire-spring relay, suffered almost all the effects seen today - the ringing, crosstalk, ground bounce, and power supply noise that plague modern digital products.

On printed circuit boards, signal integrity became a serious concern when the transition (rise and fall) times of signals started to become comparable to the propagation time across the board.  Very roughly speaking, this typically happens when system speeds exceed a few tens of MHz.  At first, only a few of the most important, or highest speed, signals needed detailed analysis or design.  As speeds increased, a larger and larger fraction of signals needed SI analysis and design practices. In modern (&gt; 100&amp;nbsp;MHz) circuit designs, essentially all signals must be designed with SI in mind.

For ICs, SI analysis became necessary as an effect of reduced design rules.  In the early days of the modern VLSI era, digital chip circuit design and layout were manual processes.  The use of abstraction and the application of [[logic synthesis|automatic synthesis techniques]] have since allowed designers to express their designs using [[Register transfer level|high-level languages]] and apply an [[design flows (EDA)|automated design process]] to create very complex designs, ignoring the electrical characteristics of the underlying circuits to a large degree. However, scaling trends (see [[Moore's law]]) brought electrical effects back to the forefront in recent technology nodes. With scaling of technology below 0.25&amp;nbsp;µm, the wire delays have become comparable or even greater than the gate delays. As a result, the wire delays needed to be considered to achieve [[Timing Closure|timing closure]]. In nanometer technologies at 0.13&amp;nbsp;µm and below, unintended interactions between signals (e.g. crosstalk) became an important consideration for digital design. At these technology nodes, the performance and correctness of a design cannot be assured without considering noise effects.

Most of this article is about SI in relation to modern electronic technology - notably the use [[integrated circuits]] and [[printed circuit]] board technology. Nevertheless, the principles of SI are not exclusive to the signalling technology used. SI existed long before the advent of either technology, and will do so as long as electronic communications persist.

==On-chip signal integrity==
Signal integrity problems in modern integrated circuits (ICs) can have many drastic consequences for digital designs: 
* Products can fail to operate at all, or worse yet, become unreliable in the field.
* The design may work, but only at speeds slower than planned
* Yield may be lowered, sometimes drastically
The cost of these failures is very high, and includes [[photomask]] costs, engineering costs and
[[opportunity cost]] due to delayed product introduction.  Therefore, [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) tools have been developed to analyze, prevent, and correct these problems.&lt;ref name="Kariat"/&gt;
In [[integrated circuit]]s, or ICs, the main cause of signal integrity problems is [[crosstalk]].
In [[CMOS]] technologies, this is primarily due to coupling [[capacitance]], but in general it may be caused by [[Inductance#Mutual inductance|mutual inductance]], [[substrate coupling]], non-ideal gate operation, and other sources. The fixes normally involve changing the sizes of drivers and/or spacing of wires.

In analog circuits, designers are also concerned with noise that arise from physical sources, such as [[Johnson-Nyquist noise|thermal noise]], [[flicker noise]], and [[shot noise]]. These noise sources on the one hand present a lower limit to the smallest signal that can be amplified, and on the other, define an upper limit to the useful amplification.

In digital ICs, noise in a signal of interest arises primarily from coupling effects from switching of other signals. Increasing interconnect density has led to each wire having neighbors that are physically closer together, leading to increased crosstalk between neighboring nets.  As circuits have continued to shrink in accordance with [[Moore's law]], several effects have conspired to make noise problems worse:
* To keep resistance tolerable despite decreased width, modern wire geometries are thicker in proportion to their spacing.  This increases the sidewall capacitance at the expense of capacitance to ground, hence increasing the induced noise voltage (expressed as a fraction of supply voltage).
* Technology scaling has led to lower [[threshold voltage]]s for MOS transistors, and has also reduced the difference between threshold and supply voltages, thereby reducing [[noise margin]]s.
* Logic speeds, and clock speeds in particular, have increased significantly, thus leading to faster transition (rise and fall) times.  These faster transition times are closely linked to higher capacitive crosstalk. Also, at such high speeds the inductive properties of the wires come into play, especially mutual inductance.

These effects have increased the interactions between signals and decreased the noise immunity of
digital CMOS circuits. This has led to noise being a significant problem for digital ICs that must be considered by every digital chip designer prior to [[tape-out]].  There are several concerns that must be mitigated:
* Noise may cause a signal to assume the wrong value.  This is particularly critical when the signal is about to be latched (or sampled), for a wrong value could be loaded into a storage element, causing logic failure.
* Noise may delay the settling of the signal to the correct value.  This is often called ''noise-on-delay''.
* Noise (e.g. ringing) may cause the input voltage of a gate to drop below ground level, or to exceed the supply voltage.  This can reduce the lifetime of the device by stressing components, induce [[latchup]], or cause multiple cycling of signals that should only cycle once in a given period.

===Finding IC signal integrity problems===

Typically, an IC designer would take the following steps for SI verification:
* Perform a [[layout extraction]] to get the [[parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitics]] associated with the layout. Usually worst-case parasitics and best-case parasitics are extracted and used in the simulations.   For ICs, unlike PCBs, physical measurement of the parasitics is almost never done, since in-situ measurements with external equipment are extremely difficult.  Furthermore, any measurement would occur after the chip has been created, which is too late to fix any problems observed.
* Create a list of expected noise events, including different types of noise, such as coupling and [[charge sharing]].
* Create a model for each noise event.  It is critical that the model is as accurate as necessary to model the given noise event.
* For each signal event, decide how to excite the circuit so that the noise event will occur.
* Create a [[SPICE]] (or another circuit simulator) [[netlist]] that represents the desired excitation, to include as many effects (such as parasitic [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]], and various distortion effects) as necessary.
* Run SPICE simulations. Analyze the simulation results and decide whether any re-design is required. It is common to analyze the results with an [[eye pattern]] and by calculating a timing budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title = An Eye is Born
 | first = Hermann
 | last = Ruckerbauer
}} Gives an example video of construction of an [[eye pattern]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern signal integrity tools for IC design perform all these steps automatically, producing reports that give a design a clean bill of health, or a list of problems that must be fixed.  However, such tools generally are not applied across an entire IC, but only selected signals of interest.

===Fixing IC signal integrity problems===
Once a problem is found, it must be fixed.  Typical fixes for IC on-chip problems include:
* Removing impedance discontinuities. Finding places where significant shifts in the impedance exist and adjusting the geometry of the path to shift the impedance to better match the rest of the path.
* Driver optimization.  You can have too much drive, and also not enough.
* Buffer insertion. In this approach, instead of upsizing the victim driver, a buffer is inserted at an appropriate point in the victim net.
* Aggressor downsizing. This works by increasing the transition time of the attacking net by reducing the strength of its driver.
* Add shielding. Add shielding of critical nets or clock nets using GND and VDD shields to reduce the effect of crosstalk (this technique may lead to routing overhead).
* [[Routing (EDA)|Routing]] changes. Routing changes can be very effective in fixing noise problems, mainly by reducing the most troublesome coupling effects via separation.

Each of these fixes may possibly cause other problems.  This type of issue must be addressed as part of [[design flows (EDA)|design flows]] and [[design closure]].  Re-analysis after design changes is a prudent measure.

==On-die termination==
[[On-die termination]] (ODT) or Digitally Controlled Impedance (DCI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp863.pdf | title = Using Digitally Controlled Impedance: Signal Integrity vs. Power Dissipation Considerations, XAPP863 (v1.0) | first = David | last = Banas}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the technology where the termination resistor for [[impedance matching]] in transmission lines is located within a semiconductor chip, instead of a separate, discrete device mounted on a circuit board.
The closeness of the termination from the receiver shorten the stub between the two, thus improving the overall signal integrity.

==Chip-to-chip signal integrity==
[[File:Reflections 100p rise time.png|400px|thumb|right| Reflections occurring as a consequence of termination mismatch. the pulse has a 100 ps rise time. Simulated using [[Quite Universal Circuit Simulator]] (Qucs). See [[Time-domain reflectometry]].]]
For wired connections, it is important to compare the interconnect flight time to the bit period to decide whether an impedance matched or unmatched connection is needed.

The channel flight time (delay) of the interconnect is roughly {{nowrap|1 ns}} per {{nowrap|15 cm}} ({{nowrap|6 in}}) of [[FR-4]] [[stripline]] (the propagation velocity depends on the dielectric and the geometry)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/all-aboard-/4426188/Rule-of-Thumb--3-Signal-speed-on-an-interconnect |title=Rule of Thumb #3 Signal speed on an interconnect|publisher=EDN |accessdate=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Reflections of previous pulses at impedance mismatches die down after a few bounces up and down the line (i.e. on the order of the flight time). At low bit rates, the echoes die down on their own, and by midpulse, they are not a concern. Impedance matching is neither necessary nor desirable. There are many circuit board types other than FR-4, but usually they are more costly to manufacture.

The gentle trend to higher bit rates accelerated dramatically in 2004, with the introduction by [[Intel]] of the [[PCI-Express]] standard. Following this lead, the majority of chip-to-chip connection standards underwent an architectural shift from parallel buses to serializer/deserializer ([[SerDes|SERDES]]) links called "lanes." Such serial links eliminate parallel bus clock skew and reduce the number of traces and resultant coupling effects but these advantages come at the cost of a large increase in bit rate on the lanes, and shorter bit periods.

At multigigabit/s data rates, link designers must consider reflections at impedance changes (e.g. where traces change levels at [[via (electronics)|vias]], see [[Transmission lines]]), noise induced by densely packed neighboring connections ([[crosstalk]]), and high-frequency attenuation caused by the [[skin effect]] in the metal trace and dielectric loss tangent. Examples of mitigation techniques for these impairments are a redesign of the via geometry to ensure an impedance match, use of [[differential signaling]], and [[preemphasis]] filtering, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.keysight.com/upload/cmc_upload/All/GTL11.pdf "Signal Integrity: Problems and Solutions," ''Eric Bogatin, Bogatin Enterprises'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5988-5623EN.pdf "Eight Hints for Debugging and Validating High-Speed Buses," ''Application Note 1382-10,'' Agilent Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

At these new multigigabit/s bit rates, the bit period is shorter than the flight time; echoes of previous pulses can arrive at the receiver on top of the main pulse and corrupt it. In communication engineering this is called intersymbol interference (ISI). In signal integrity engineering it is usually called eye closure (a reference to the clutter in the center of a type of oscilloscope trace called an eye diagram). When the bit period is shorter than the flight time, elimination of reflections using classic microwave techniques like matching the [[electrical impedance]] of the transmitter to the interconnect, the sections of interconnect to each other, and the interconnect to the receiver, is crucial. [[electrical termination|Termination with a source or load]] is a synonym for matching at the two ends. The interconnect impedance that can be selected is constrained by the impedance of free space ({{nowrap|~377 Ω}}), a geometric form factor and by the square root of the relative dielectric constant of the stripline filler (typically FR-4, with a relative dielectric constant of ~4). Together, these properties determine the trace's [[characteristic impedance]].  {{nowrap|50 Ω}} is a convenient choice for single-end lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/why50ohms.cfm |title=Why 50 Ohms? |publisher=Microwaves101 |accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{nowrap|100 ohm}} for differential.

As a consequence of the low impedance required by matching, PCB signal traces carry much more current than their on-chip counterparts. This larger current induces crosstalk primarily in a magnetic or inductive mode as opposed to a capacitive mode. To combat this crosstalk, digital PCB designers must remain acutely aware of not only the intended signal path for every signal, but also the path of returning signal current for every signal. The signal itself and its returning signal current path are equally capable of generating inductive crosstalk. Differential trace pairs help to reduce these effects.

A third difference between on-chip and chip-to-chip connection involves the cross-sectional size of the signal conductor, namely that PCB conductors are much larger (typically {{nowrap|100 µm&lt;!--um or µm?--&gt;}} or more in width). Thus, PCB traces have a small series [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (typically 0.1 Ω/cm) at DC. The high frequency component of the pulse is however attenuated by additional resistance due to the skin effect and dielectric loss tangent associated with the PCB material.

The main challenge often depends on whether the project is a cost-driven consumer application or a performance-driven infrastructure application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to require extensive post-layout verification (using an [[Computational electromagnetics|EM simulator]]) and pre-layout design optimization (using [[SPICE]] and a [[channel simulator]]), respectively.

===Routing topology===
[[File:Tree routing topology.png|300px|thumb|right|Tree topology similar to that of the [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]] Command/Address (CA) bank]]
[[File:Route topologies fly by.png|300px|thumb|right|Fly-by topology similar to that of the [[DDR3]] Command/Address (CA) bank]]

The noise levels on a trace/network is highly dependent on the routing topology selected. In a point-to-point topology, the signal is routed from the transmitter directly to the receiver (this is applied in [[PCIe]], [[RapidIO]], [[GbE]], [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]]/[[DDR3]]/[[DDR4]] DQ/DQS etc.). A point-to-point topology has the least SI-problems since there is no large impedance matches being introduced by line T's (a two-way split of a trace).

For interfaces where multiple pachages are receiving from the same line, (for example with a backplane configuration), the line must be split at some point to service all receivers. Some stubs and impedance missmatches are deemed to occur. Multipackage intefraces include B[[LVDS]], DDR2/DDR3/DDR4 C/A bank, [[RS485]] and [[CAN Bus]]. There are two main multipachage topologies: Tree and fly-by.

=== Finding signal integrity problems ===
* Perform a [[layout extraction]] to get the parasitics associated with the layout. Usually worst-case parasitics and best-case parasitics are extracted and used in the simulations. Because of the distributed nature of many of the impairments, electromagnetic simulation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.keysight.com/main/redirector.jspx?action=ref&amp;cname=COLLECTION&amp;ckey=2716740&amp;cc=US&amp;lc=eng "Hurdle the multigigabit per second barrier"]&lt;/ref&gt; is used for extraction.
* If the PCB or package already exists, the designer can also measure the impairment presented by the connection using high speed instrumentation such as a [[Network analyzer (electrical)|vector network analyzer]]. For example, IEEE P802.3ap Task Force uses measured [[S-parameters]] as test cases&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee802.org/3/ap/public/channel_model/index.html#Interference%20Tolerance%20Test%20Channels IEEE P802.3ap Task Force Channel Models]&lt;/ref&gt; for proposed solutions to the problem of {{nowrap|10 Gbit/s}} [[Ethernet]] over backplanes.
* Accurate noise modeling is a must. Create a list of expected noise events, including different types of noise, such as coupling and [[charge sharing]].  [[Input Output Buffer Information Specification]] (IBIS) or circuit models may be used to represent drivers and receivers.
*For each noise event, decide how to excite the circuit so that the noise event will occur.
*Create a [[SPICE]] (or another circuit simulator) [[netlist]] that represents the desired excitation.
*Run SPICE and record the results.
*Analyze the simulation results and decide whether any re-design is required. To analyze the results quite often a data eye is generated and a timing budget is calculated. An example video for generating a data eye can be found on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my7CI84le5g An Eye is Born].

that help the engineer perform all these steps on each signal in a design, pointing out problems or verifying the design is ready for manufacture. In selecting which tool is best for a particular task, one must consider characteristics of each such as capacity (how many nodes or elements), performance (simulation speed), accuracy (how good are the models), convergence (how good is the solver), capability (non-linear versus linear, frequency dependent versus frequency independent etc.), and ease of use.

===Fixing signal integrity problems===

An IC package or PCB designer removes signal integrity problems through these techniques: 
*Placing a solid [[ground plane|reference plane]] adjacent to the signal traces to control [[crosstalk]]
*Controlling the trace width spacing to the reference plane to create consistent trace [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]
*Using [[electrical termination|terminations]] to control [[ringing (signal)|ringing]]
*Route traces perpendicular on adjacent layers to reduce crosstalk
*Increasing spacing between traces to reduce crosstalk
*Providing sufficient ground (and power) connections to limit [[ground bounce]] (this subdiscipline of signal integrity is sometimes called out separately as [[power integrity]])
*Distributing power with solid plane layers to limit power supply noise
*Adding a preemphasis [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] to the transmitter driving cell&lt;ref name="Stratix"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altera.com/literature/wp/wp_pre-emphasis.pdf |title=Using Pre-Emphasis and Equalization with Stratix GX |publisher=Altera}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adding an [[Equalization (communications)|equalizer]] to the receiving cell&lt;ref name="Stratix"/&gt;
*Improved [[clock recovery|clock and data recovery]] (CDR) circuitry with low jitter/phase noise&lt;ref&gt;[http://literature.cdn.keysight.com/litweb/pdf/5989-5718EN.pdf "Using Clock Jitter Analysis to Reduce BER in Serial Data Applications", ''Application Note, literature number 5989-5718EN, Agilent Technologies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these fixes may possibly cause other problems.  This type of issue must be addressed as part of [[design flows (EDA)|design flows]] and [[design closure]].

===North American trademark dispute===
After the founding of Silva USA in 1946 and Silva Ltd. in Canada two years later, both affiliates were later acquired by Johnson Wax Associates, later Johnson Camping, Inc., and by 1985, Johnson Worldwide Associates (JWA).  From 1980, JWA had imported Swedish-made compasses manufactured by Silva Production AB for sale in North America.  

In 1996, a decision by Silva Production AB to end sole distribution of its Swedish-made ''Silva''-brand compasses by Silva USA led to a court battle the following year between JWA and Silva Production AB (Silva Sweden AB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Compass Makers Embroiled in Suits | work=The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel | date=1997-01-03 | author=Spivak, Cary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, JWA and Silva Production AB of Sweden reached a settlement whereby JWA retained the exclusive right to sell compasses under its ''Silva'' trademark in North America, made by unnamed manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;JOUT, ''Form 10-K SEC Filing, Item 1: Business (Outdoor Equipment)'', filed by Johnson Outdoors, Inc. on 12/15/2004 [http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1228/89706904002137/filing-main Filing]: "Silva field compasses, which are manufactured by third parties, are marketed exclusively in North America."&lt;/ref&gt;  JWA also retained the North American rights to some product names such as ''Ranger'', ''Polaris'', ''1, 2, 3'' and others commonly used and recognized in the U.S. and Canadian markets and made popular during the time Silva Production AB was manufacturing Swedish-made ''Silva'' compasses for JWA in North America.&lt;ref name="Article"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-miscellaneous/4248758-1.html | title=JWA, Silva Settle Dispute | publisher=Outdoor Retailer | date=1998-10-01 | author=Hodgson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; JWA was eventually renamed Johnson Outdoors, Inc.

For its part, Silva Production AB/Silva Group retained the right to manufacture and sell compasses, GPS tools, and other navigational products under its ''Silva'' trademark outside the United States and Canada, as well as market its Swedish-made compasses and GPS tools in North America under the ''Brunton'', ''Elite'', and ''Nexus'' brands.  The Swedish firm also retained the right to state on ''Nexus'' packaging and in the ''Nexus'' catalog that ''Nexus'' compasses were made by Silva Production AB, but did not retain the right to advertise this fact.&lt;ref name="Article"/&gt;

In 2009 Fiskars sold Brunton Inc. to Fenix Outdoor AB of Sweden, and in consequence, Silva Production AB stopped exporting Silva of Sweden compasses to North America under the ''Brunton'' and ''Nexus'' brands, and halted further imports of Brunton products to markets outside North America under the Silva brand.  Currently, Silva of Sweden AB no longer distributes any of its compass products to the USA or Canadian markets.

==Current activity==
In 2006, Silva was acquired by the Finnish [[Fiskars|Fiskars Group]].&lt;ref name="ALL"/&gt;  Silva Sweden AB retained its own corporate identity as an outdoor products manufacturer within Fiskars under its Gerber Legendary Blades Division.&lt;ref name="ALL"/&gt;

In 2009, Fiskars sold Brunton Inc. to a Swedish company, Fenix Outdoor AB.&lt;ref&gt;''Fiskars Sells US Camping Equipment Business to Fenix Outdoor'', Nordic Business Report, 4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;   After divestiture, Brunton closed out its ''Nexus'' and ''Elite'' compass lines and discontinued the ''Brunton 54LU'' compass, all of which were relabeled Silva of Sweden products, and discontinued imports of the ''Silva Multi-Navigator'' GPS sold in North America as the ''Brunton MNS''.  These actions left Silva of Sweden without a North American distributor for its Swedish-made compasses and GPS tools.  As a result, Silva of Sweden compasses and GPS products are no longer available in North America. 

In 2011, Fiskars sold Silva Sweden AB to Karnell AB, a Swedish investment group.

Today, the ''Silva Group'' consists of the parent company, now called Silva Sweden AB, together with its subsidiaries ''Silva Ltd.'' in the United Kingdom, ''Silva France'', ''Silva Deutschland'', and ''Silva Far East''. The core activities of the Silva Group consist of design, development, manufacture of compasses for land and sea and sales of compasses, GPS and outdoor instruments, headlamps, binoculars and other electronic navigation equipment.

===Compasses===
At its production facility in [[Haninge]], Sweden, and in mainland China,&lt;ref name="ALL"/&gt; Silva of Sweden AB manufactures a wide variety of portable compasses for recreational, hiking, scientific, and marine uses.  The company produces a range of models, from simple protractor or baseplate compasses like the ''Field'', ''Expedition 3'' (formerly the ''Ranger 3''),  and ''Expedition 4'' to more sophisticated sighting compasses such as the ''Expedition Model 54'' and the Silva ''SightMaster'' line of surveying compasses.  

Silva's ''Expedition 15T'', ''Expedition TDCL'', and ''Expedition S'' are modernized versions of the popular Type 15 ''Silva Ranger'', itself a development of the ''Model 1939'' that incorporated a liquid-damped capsule with a sighting mirror that doubled as a protective cover.  In keeping with its origins as orienteering compass manufacturers, Silva also offers its Orienteering Series of ''Jet'', ''Spectra'', and ''Race'' models optimized for [[orienteering]] and [[adventure racing]] competition.  

Silva has a long history of supplying variants of their general-use compasses to various military forces of the world, including the defence forces of [[Great Britain]], [[Denmark]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Defence, ''Manual of Map Reading and Land Navigation'', HMSO Army Code 70947 (1988), {{ISBN|0-11-772611-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-11-772611-6}}, ch. 12, sec. 39, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  These include the Silva ''Expedition 3 Military'', ''Expedition 4 Military'', ''Expedition 4B Military'', ''Expedition 15T'', ''Expedition 15TDCL'', and ''Expedition 54 Military'' NATO compasses with dials in both [[Angular mil|mil]]s and [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] and optional [[tritium]] lighting (all standard models have luminous lighting; models with a 'B' (beta) suffix are fitted with self-illuminating tritium capsules.

===GPS===
In 2000, Silva introduced the Silva ''Multi-Navigator'' navigation tool, which combined a GPS receiver with an electronic compass, barometer, and altimeter.  The ''Multi-Navigator'' was sold in North America under the Brunton brand as the ''Brunton MNS''.  The ''Multi-Navigator'' was followed in 2004 by the ''Silva Atlas'' navigation tool which featured a greyscale map display.  Both the ''Multi-Navigator'' and the ''Atlas'' failed to capture a significant portion of the highly competitive GPS market, and were withdrawn from the market in 2009.

===Other instruments===
Besides compasses and GPS tools, Silva manufactures several other types of outdoor gear and navigational equipment, including weather/altimeter/temperature/wind meters, [[Headlamp (outdoor)|headlamp]]s, [[binoculars]], and orienteering accessories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7575">{{short description|Unqualified passenger being talked through landing a plane}}
A '''talk-down landing''' may be attempted in the event of the death or incapacitation of an [[aircraft]] [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]]. It involves a passenger or other unqualified person flying the aircraft to a landing with assistance from radioed instructions either from the ground or a nearby aircraft.

==Recent incidents involving small aircraft==

*In August 2000, the pilot of a single-engine [[Piper Cherokee|Piper Cherokee 6]] collapsed over the controls. A passenger, Henry Anhalt, took over the controls of the plane and managed to land the airplane safely with radio talk-down assistance from an airborne flight instructor. He, his wife, and their three sons landed safely, although the aircraft was damaged on landing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=96248&amp;page=1 Passenger lands plane safely], ABCNews, retrieved 2017-08.17&lt;/ref&gt;
*In an incident in April 2009, a passenger took over control of a twin-engine turboprop [[Beechcraft King Air]] after the pilot lost consciousness, and managed to land the plane safely. The passenger was a pilot but had never flown a Beechcraft King Air before.&lt;ref&gt;[https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-04-13-passenger-lands-plane_N.htm Passenger lands plane], retrieved 17-08-2017&lt;/ref&gt;
*On May 27, 2011, a woman had landed an airplane of unidentified type, with talk-down assistance from another airborne pilot, after her husband had breathing difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aol.co.uk/travel/2011/05/27/passenger-lands-plane-after-pilot-becomes-ill/|title=Passenger lands plane after pilot becomes ill - AOL UK Travel|first=Katy|last=Holland|website=aol.co.uk|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In April 2012, the pilot of a twin-engine [[Cessna 414]] aircraft lost consciousness while flying in [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. His 80-year-old wife Helen Collins, who had only piloted a single-engine aircraft many years earlier, was able to contact [[air traffic control]]. Air traffic controllers and the pilot of a shadow aircraft then provided instruction and she was able to crash-land the plane without serious injury. Her husband did not survive his medical emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wisconsin-wife-80-lands-plane-dying-pilot-husband/story?id=16062534 |title=Wisconsin Wife, 80, Lands Plane for Dying Pilot Husband |work=[[ABC News]] |last=Ng |first=Christina |date=April 3, 2012 |accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In October 2013,  the pilot of a [[Cessna 172]] aircraft became unwell whilst flying from [[Skegness]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]. His 77-year-old passenger, John Wildey, who had served in the air force but not as aircrew, controlled the plane for over an hour and landed it safely at [[Humberside Airport]] under instruction from air traffic controllers, two flying instructors, and the crew of a [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter. The pilot was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2451546/Grandad-John-Wildey-landed-plane-pilot-collapsed-Hero-I-just-held-joystick.html?ico=ushome%5Emostread |title=Hero?

==Large commercial aircraft==
There is no record of a talk-down landing of a large commercial aircraft.  There have, however, been incidents where qualified pilots travelling as passengers or flight attendants on commercial flights have taken the co-pilot's seat to assist the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bucktin |first=Christopher |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/off-duty-pilot-lands-plane-saves-3640802 |title=Off-duty pilot lands plane and saves 160 passengers after captain suffers heart attack - Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=2014-06-03 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional talk-down landings==
In the 1957 film ''[[Zero Hour!]]'', the pilot and co-pilot of an airliner both become seriously ill from food poisoning. A man who has not flown for 10 years and has no familiarity with large aircraft is given instructions from the airport and safely lands the plane. The 1980 comedy film ''[[Airplane!]]'' spoofs the same plot with a passenger on a jet airliner being talked down to a safe landing after both pilots contract food poisoning. ''[[Airport 1975]]'' released in 1974 has a plot where a [[Boeing 747]] has a mid-air collision with a small plane that leaves the crew dead or badly injured and a stewardess is instructed to fly the aircraft to avoid mountains and on other flight actions, but she does not actually land it. In the 1997 film ''[[Turbulence (1997 film)|Turbulence]]'', a stewardess successfully lands a Boeing 747 under instruction by radio after both pilots are killed. In the 1999 film ''[[Airspeed (film)]]'', a 13-year-old girl lands a private jet while given instructions from the airport.
 
In 2010, British [[hypnotist]] and illusionist [[Derren Brown]] presented a  programme on [[Channel 4]] television entitled "Derren Brown: Hero at 30,000 Feet". It showed Brown putting a man through a series of challenges culminating in him traveling on a plane where the pilot had supposedly been incapacitated. The man, who had not been on a plane in ten years, boarded a flight traveling from Leeds to Jersey, where he had been told that a fake game-show presented by Brown was to be filmed. The flight crew, stewards and stewardesses were real, but the rest of the passengers were actors. During the flight, the cabin crew announced that the captain had been taken ill and asked for a volunteer to land the plane. At the last minute, the man volunteered. While walking to the front of the plane he was placed into a trance by Brown. After the plane landed, the man was placed into a cockpit [[flight simulator]] and woken up. He was talked through landing procedures by a person identified to him as an air traffic controller and completed the challenge successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derrenbrown.co.uk/blog/2010/09/hero-answers-questions|title=Hero – Answers to a Few Questions|publisher=Derren Brown|accessdate=10 October 2013|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100914061250/http://derrenbrown.co.uk/blog/2010/09/hero-answers-questions|archivedate =14 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 edition of the science entertainment television program ''[[MythBusters (2007 season)#Episode 94 – "Air Plane Hour"|MythBusters]]'', entitled "Air Plane Hour", aimed to determine whether an untrained civilian could be instructed how to successfully land a plane over the radio with the aid of a [[NASA]] flight simulator. For their first test, the two presenters who had no flight experience attempted to land a plane unaided. One came in at a steep angle and too fast, and the simulated plane flipped over and broke apart; the other stalled and crash-landed in a field. They then repeated the exercise with instructions by radio from a licensed pilot and both were able to land safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/2007-episodes/ |title=MythBusters 2007 Episode Guide |work=[[Discovery Channel]]|accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''utility pole''' is a [[column]] or post used to support [[overhead power line]]s and various other public utilities, such as [[electrical cable]], [[optical fiber|fiber optic cable]], and related equipment such as [[Distribution transformer|transformers]] and [[street light]]s. It can be referred to as a '''transmission pole''', '''telephone pole''', telecommunication pole, '''power pole''', '''hydro pole''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Canadian Oxford dictionary |editor-first=Katherine |editor-last=Barber |place=Toronto; New York  |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-541120-X |page=695 }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''telegraph pole''', or '''telegraph post''', depending on its application.  A [[stobie pole]] is a multi-purpose pole made of two steel joists held apart by a slab of concrete in the middle, generally found in [[South Australia]].

Electrical wires and cables are routed overhead on utility poles as an inexpensive way to keep them insulated from the ground and out of the way of people and vehicles. Utility poles can be made of wood, metal, concrete, or composites like [[fiberglass]].  They are used for two different types of power lines; ''subtransmission lines'' which carry higher voltage power between substations, and ''distribution lines'' which distribute lower voltage power to customers.

The first poles were used in 1816 by the [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]] inventor [[Francis Ronalds|Sir Francis Ronalds]] who set up eight miles of overhead cable in [[Hammersmith]]. Utility poles were first used in the mid-19th century in America with [[telegraph]] systems, starting with [[Samuel Morse]] who attempted to bury a line between [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], but moved it above ground when this system proved faulty.  Today, underground distribution lines are increasingly used as an alternative to utility poles in residential neighborhoods, due to poles' perceived ugliness.

==Use==
Utility poles are commonly used to carry two types of electric [[Electric power transmission|power lines]]:&lt;ref name="Grigsby"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grigsby|first=Leonard L.|title=The Electric Power Engineering Handbook|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|location=USA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiv1tuMDbTEC&amp;pg=PT1346&amp;lpg=PT1346&amp;dq=%22utility+transformer%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=XwZnFMsRK8&amp;sig=68TttGd59rC3_TstnrUd8hvXUHI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPT385,M1|isbn=0-8493-8578-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428033235/https://books.google.com/books?id=wiv1tuMDbTEC&amp;pg=PT1346&amp;lpg=PT1346&amp;dq=%22utility+transformer%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=XwZnFMsRK8&amp;sig=68TttGd59rC3_TstnrUd8hvXUHI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPT385,M1|archivedate=2016-04-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Electric power distribution|distribution lines]]'' (or "feeders") and ''subtransmission lines''. Distribution lines carry power from local [[Electrical substation|substations]] to customers. They generally carry voltages from 4.6 to 33 [[volt|kilovolts]] (kV) for distances up to 30 miles, and include transformers to step the voltage down from the primary voltage to the lower secondary voltage used by the customer. A [[service drop]] carries this lower voltage to the customer's premises.

Subtransmission lines carry higher voltage power from regional substations to local substations. They usually carry 46 kV, 69 kV, or 115 kV for distances up to 60 miles. 230 kV lines are often supported on H-shaped towers made with two or three poles. [[Transmission line]]s carrying voltages of above 230 kV are usually not supported by poles, but by metal [[Transmission tower|pylons]] (known as transmission towers in the US).

For economic or practical reasons, such as to save space in urban areas, a distribution line is often carried on the same poles as a subtransmission line but mounted under the higher voltage lines; a practice called "underbuild". Telecommunication cables are usually carried on the same poles that support power lines; poles shared in this fashion are known as joint-use poles, but may have their own dedicated poles.

==Description==
[[File:Steel Utility pole.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Steel utility pole in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia]]
The standard utility pole in the United States is about {{convert|40|ft|m|0.0|abbr=on}} long and is buried about {{convert|6|ft|m|0.0|abbr=on}} in the ground.&lt;ref name="Florida"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc.state.fl.us/ConsumerAssistance/UtilityPoleDescriptions|title=What's on a utility pole?|last=|first=|date=|year=2008|publisher=Florida Public Service Commission|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225175755/http://www.psc.state.fl.us/ConsumerAssistance/UtilityPoleDescriptions|archive-date=2016-02-25|dead-url=no|work=Consumer Assistance|accessdate=2008-10-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, poles can reach heights of {{convert|120|ft|m|0.0|abbr=on}} or more to satisfy clearance requirements. They are typically spaced about {{convert|125|ft|m|0.0|abbr=on}} apart in urban areas, or about {{convert|300|ft|m|0.0|abbr=on}} in rural areas, but distances vary widely based on terrain. Joint-use poles are usually owned by one utility, which leases space on it for other cables. In the United States, the [[National Electrical Safety Code]], published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) (not to be confused with the [[National Electrical Code]] published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] [NFPA]), sets the standards for construction and maintenance of utility poles and their equipment.

===Pole materials===
Most utility poles are made of wood, pressure-treated with some type of [[Wood preservation|preservative]] for protection against rot, fungi and insects. [[Southern yellow pine]] is the most widely used species in the United States; however, many species of long straight trees are used to make utility poles, including [[Douglas fir]], [[jack pine]], [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]], [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]], and [[Abies amabilis|Pacific silver fir]].

Traditionally, the preservative used was [[creosote]], but due to environmental concerns, alternatives such as [[pentachlorophenol]], copper [[naphthenic acid|naphthenate]] and [[borate]]s are becoming widespread in the United States. In the United States, standards for wood preservative materials and wood preservation processes, along with test criteria, are set by [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]], [[ASTM International|ASTM]], and [[Wood preservation#American Wood Protection Association|American Wood Protection Association]] (AWPA) specifications. Despite the preservatives, wood poles decay and have a life of approximately 25 to 50 years depending on climate and soil conditions, therefore requiring regular inspection and remedial preservative treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/AWPA_poleMaintenance_paper.pdf|title=PMCPOLE.COM|website=www.pmcpole.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715094205/http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/AWPA_poleMaintenance_paper.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/groundlineTreatmentSP.pdf|title=PMCPOLE.COM|website=www.pmcpole.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114191254/http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/groundlineTreatmentSP.pdf|archivedate=2009-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/rus_bulletin_1730B_121.pdf|title=PMCPOLE.COM|website=www.pmcpole.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114191256/http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/rus_bulletin_1730B_121.pdf|archivedate=2009-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Woodpecker]] damage to wood poles is the most significant cause of pole deterioration in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite web

Other common utility pole materials are steel and concrete, with composites (such as [[fiberglass|fibreglass]]) also becoming more prevalent. One particular [[patent]]ed utility pole variant used in Australia is the [[Stobie pole]], made up of two vertical steel posts with a slab of concrete between them.

In southern Switzerland along various lakes, telephone poles are made of [[granite]]. Starting in the early 1900s, these 18-foot (5 m) poles were originally used for telegraph wires and later for telephone wires. Because they are made of granite, the poles last indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-t0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA851&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y4zsT9OSGMriqAGU1PW8BQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Granite Telegraph Poles in Switzerland."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602234939/https://books.google.com/books?id=-t0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA851&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y4zsT9OSGMriqAGU1PW8BQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA |date=2016-06-02 }} ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1911, p. 851.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power distribution wires and equipment===
[[File:US utility pole - labeled.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Typical North American utility pole, showing hardware for a residential 240/120V split-phase [[service drop]]: &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(''A,B,C'')&lt;/span&gt; 3-phase primary distribution wires, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(''D'')&lt;/span&gt; neutral wire, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(''E'')&lt;/span&gt; [[fuse cutout]], &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(''F'')&lt;/span&gt; lightning arrestor, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(''G'')&lt;/span&gt; single phase distribution transformer, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(''H'')&lt;/span&gt; ground wire to transformer case, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(''J'')&lt;/span&gt; "triplex" service drop cable carries secondary current to customer, &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(''K'')&lt;/span&gt; telephone and cable television cables ]]
On poles carrying both electrical and communications wiring, the electric [[overhead power line|power distribution lines]] and associated equipment are mounted at the top of the pole above the communication cables, for safety. The vertical space on the pole reserved for this equipment is called the ''supply space''.&lt;ref name="Florida" /&gt;  The wires themselves are usually uninsulated, and supported by [[insulator (electricity)|insulators]], commonly mounted on a horizontal crossarm. Power is transmitted using the [[three-phase electric power|three-phase]] system, with three wires, or phases, labeled "A", "B", and "C".

Subtransmission lines comprise only these 3 wires, plus sometimes an overhead ground wire (OGW), also called a "static line" or a "neutral", suspended above them. The OGW acts like a lightning rod, providing a low [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] path to ground thus protecting the phase conductors from lightning.

[[File:China utility pole.jpg|thumb|left|A joint-use utility pole in China]]

Distribution lines use two systems, either grounded-wye ("Y" on [[Circuit diagram|electrical schematics]]) or delta (Greek letter [[Delta (letter)|"Δ"]] on electrical schematics). A delta system requires only a conductor for each of the three phases. A grounded-wye system requires a fourth conductor, the [[Ground and neutral|neutral]], whose source is the center of the "Y" and is grounded. However, "spur lines" branching off the main line to provide power to side streets often carry only one or two phase wires, plus the neutral. A wide range of standard distribution voltages are used, from 2,400 V to 34,500 V. On poles near a [[service drop]], there is a pole-mounted step-down [[distribution transformer]] to provide the required [[mains electricity|mains voltage]].   In [[North America]], service drops provide 240/120V [[Split-phase electric power|split-phase]] power for residential and light commercial service, using cylindrical single-phase transformers.  In Europe and most other countries, 230V [[three phase]] (230Y400) service drops are used.   The transformer's primary is connected to the distribution line through protective devices called [[fuse cutout]]s. In the event of an overload, the fuse melts and the device pivots open to provide a visual indication of the problem. They can also be opened manually by [[lineman (technician)|linemen]] using a long insulated rod called a [[hot stick]] to disconnect the transformer from the line.

The pole may be [[ground (electricity)|grounded]] with a heavy bare [[copper]] or [[copper-clad steel]] wire running down the pole, attached to the metal pin supporting each insulator, and at the bottom connected to a metal rod driven into the ground. Some countries ground every pole while others only ground every fifth pole and any pole with a transformer on it. This provides a path for leakage currents across the surface of the insulators to get to ground, preventing the current from flowing through the wooden pole which could cause a fire or shock hazard.&lt;ref name="Grigsby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Florida"/&gt;  It provides similar protection in case of [[flashover]]s and lightning strikes. A [[surge arrester]] (also called a lightning arrester) may also be installed between the line (ahead of the cutout) and the ground wire for lightning protection. The purpose of the device is to conduct extremely high voltages present on the line directly to ground.

If uninsulated conductors touch due to wind or fallen trees, the resultant sparks can start [[wildfire]]s. To reduce this problem, [[Aerial bundled cable|aerial bundled conductors]] are being introduced.

===Communication cables===
The communications cables are attached below the electric power lines, in a vertical space along the pole designated the ''communications space''.&lt;ref name="Florida" /&gt;  The communications space is separated from the lowest electrical conductor by the ''communication worker safety zone'', which provides room for workers to maneuver safely while servicing the communication cables, avoiding contact with the power lines.&lt;ref name="Florida"/&gt;

The most common communication cables found on utility poles are copper or [[fibre optic cable]] (FOC) for [[telephone lines]] and [[coaxial cable]] for [[cable television]] (CATV).  Coaxial or optical fibre cables linking [[computer networks]] are also increasingly found on poles in urban areas. The cable linking the [[telephone exchange]] to local customers is a thick cable lashed to a thin supporting cable, containing hundreds of [[twisted pair]] [[subscriber line]]s. Each twisted pair line provides a single telephone circuit or [[local loop]] to a customer. There may also be fibre optic cables interconnecting telephone exchanges. Like electrical distribution lines, communication cables connect to service drops when used to provide local service to customers.

===Other equipment===
Utility poles may also carry other equipment such as [[street lights]], supports for [[traffic lights]] and overhead [[electric trolley]] wires, and [[cellular network]] antennas. They can also carry fixtures and decorations specific for certain holidays or events specific to the city where they are located.

Solar panels mounted on utility poles may power auxiliary equipment where the expense of a power line connection is unwanted.

Streetlights and holiday fixtures are powered directly from secondary distribution.

==Pole attachment hardware==
[[File:American telephone practice (1905) (14753288101).jpg|thumb|left|Standard arrangement for telephone poles]]
The primary purpose of pole attachment hardware is to secure the cable and associated aerial plant facilities to poles and to help facilitate necessary plant rearrangements. An aerial plant network requires high-quality reliable hardware to
*Structurally support the distribution cable plant
*Provide directional guying to accommodate lateral stresses created on the pole by pole line configurations and pole loading configuration
*Provide the physical support and protection for drop cable plant from the pole to the customer premises
*Transition cable plant from the aerial network to underground and buried plant
*Provide the means for safe and effective grounding, bonding, and isolation connections for the metallic and dielectric components of the network.
Functional performance requirements common to pole line hardware for utility poles made of wood, steel, concrete, or Fiber-Reinforced Composite (FRC) materials are contained in Telcordia GR-3174, ''Generic Requirements for Hardware Attachments for Utility Poles''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-3174&amp; GR-3174, ''Generic Requirements for Hardware Attachments for Utility Poles'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attachment hardware by pole type ===

*'''Wood poles'''
[[File:Palo_SES_Tegna_260513.jpg|thumb|Head of a 400V pole in Switzerland. In Europe, insulators usually were attached directly at the pole.]]
:The traditional wood pole material provides great flexibility during placement of hardware and cable apparatus. Holes are easily drilled to fit the exact hardware needs and requirements. In addition, fasteners such as lags and screws are easily applied to wood structures to support [[outside plant]] (OSP) apparatus.

*'''Non-wood poles'''
:There are three main non-wood pole materials and structures on which the attachment hardware may be mounted: concrete, steel, and fiber-reinforced composite (FRC). Each material has intrinsic characteristics that need to be considered during the design and manufacture of the attachment hardware.

:*'''Concrete poles'''
::The most widespread use of concrete poles is in [[Oceanic climate|marine environments]] and coastal zones where excellent corrosion resistance is required to reduce the impact of sea water, salt fog, and corrosive soil conditions (e.g., marsh). Their heavy weight also helps the concrete poles resist the high winds possible in coastal areas.

::The various designs for concrete poles include tapered structures and round poles made of solid concrete; pre-stressed concrete (spun-cast or statically cast); and a hybrid of concrete and steel.

::The drilling of installed concrete poles is not feasible. Users may wish to have the attachment hardware cast into the concrete during the pole manufacture. As a result of these operational difficulties, banded hardware has become the more popular means to attach cable plant to concrete poles.
::Design criteria and requirements for concrete poles can be derived from various industry documents including, but not limited to, ASCE-111, ACI-318, ASTM C935, and ASTM C1089.

:*'''Steel poles'''
::Steel poles can provide advantages for high-voltage lines, where taller poles are required for enhanced clearances and longer span requirements. Tubular steel poles are typically made from 11-gauge galvanized steel, with thicker 10- or 7-gauge materials used for some taller poles because of their higher strength and rigidity. For tall tower-type structures, 5-gauge materials are used.

::Although steel poles can be drilled on-site with a [[Annular cutter|annular]] drill bit or standard twist drill, it is not a recommended practice. As with concrete poles, bolt holes could be built into the steel pole during manufacture for use as general attachment points or places for steps to be bolted into the pole.

::Welding of attachment hardware or attachment ledges to steel poles may be a feasible alternate approach to help provide reliable attachment points. However, operational and practical hazards of welding in the field may make this process undesirable or uneconomical.

::Steel poles should meet industry specifications such as: TIA/EIA-222-G, ''Structural Standard for Antenna Supporting Structures and Antennas'' (current); TIA/EIA-222; ''Structural Standards for Steel''; and TIA/EIA-RS-222, or an equivalent requirement set to help ensure a robust and good quality pole is being used.

:*'''Fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) poles'''
::FRC poles cover a family of pole materials that combine fiberglass (fiber) strength members with a cross-linked polyester resin and a variety of chemical additives to produce a lightweight, weather-resistant structure. FRC poles are hollow and similar to the tubular steel poles, with a typical wall thickness of 1/4 to 1/2 inch with an outer polyurethane coating that is ~0.002-inch thin.

::As with all the other non-wood poles, FRC poles cannot be mounted with the traditional climbing hardware of hooks and gaffs. FRC poles can be pre-drilled by the manufacturer, or holes can be drilled on site. Attachments using lag bolts, teeth, nails, and staples are unacceptable for FRC poles. Through-bolts are used instead of lag bolts for maximum bonding to the pole and to avoid loosening of hardware.

::The relevant industry documents covering FRC poles include: ASTM D4923, ANSI C136.20, OPCS-03-02, and Telcordia GR-3159, ''Generic Requirements for Fiber-Reinforced Composite (FRC), Concrete, and Steel Utility Poles''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-3159&amp; GR-3159, ''Generic Requirements for Fiber-Reinforced Composite (FRC), Concrete, and Steel Utility Poles'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
[[File:Telephone Pole Orchard? (28776548771).jpg|thumb|Pre-apprentice lineman class climbing telephone poles]]
In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, utility poles have sets of brackets arranged in a standard pattern up the pole to act as hand and foot holds so that maintenance and repair workers can climb the pole to work on the lines. In the United States, such steps have been determined to be a public hazard and are no longer allowed on new poles.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Linemen may use climbing spikes called gaffs to ascend wooden poles without steps on them. In the UK, boots fitted with steel loops that go around the pole (known as "Scandinavian Climbers") are also used for climbing poles. In the US, linemen use [[Cherry picker|bucket trucks]] for the vast majority of poles that are accessible by vehicle.

==Dead-end poles==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
[[File:Dead end riser poles.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Example of dead-end riser poles]]

The poles at the end of a straight section of utility line where the line ends or angles off in another direction are called ''dead-end'' poles in the United States. Elsewhere they may be referred to as anchor or termination poles. These must carry the lateral [[tension (physics)|tension]] of the long straight sections of wire. They are usually made with heavier construction. The power lines are attached to the pole by horizontal strain insulators, either placed on crossarms (which are either doubled, tripled, or replaced with a steel crossarm, to provide more resistance to the tension forces) or attached directly to the pole itself.

Dead-end and other poles that support lateral loads have [[guy-wires]] to support them. The guys always have [[strain insulator]]s inserted in their length to prevent any high voltages caused by electrical faults from reaching the lower portion of the cable that is accessible by the public.  In populated areas, guy wires are often encased in a yellow plastic or wood tube reflector attached to their lower end, so that they can be seen more easily, reducing the chance of people and animals walking into them or vehicles crashing into them.

Another means of providing support for lateral loads is a push brace pole, a second shorter pole that is attached to the side of the first and runs at an angle to the ground. If there is no space for a lateral support, a stronger pole, e.g. a construction of concrete or iron, is used.

==History==
[[File:Hakodate-Concrete-Utility-Pole.jpg|thumb|From 1923, the oldest utility pole in Japan, still in use in the city of Hakodate.]]
In 1844, the United States [[United States Congress|Congress]] granted [[Samuel Morse]] $30,000 to build a 40-mile [[telegraph]] line between [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]  Morse began by having a lead-sheathed cable made. After laying seven miles underground, he tested it. He found so many faults with this system that he dug up his cable, stripped off its sheath, bought poles and strung his wires overhead. On February 7, 1844, Morse inserted the following advertisement in the Washington newspaper:  "Sealed proposals will be received by the undersigned for furnishing 700 straight and sound chestnut posts with the bark on and of the following dimensions to wit: 'Each post must not be less than eight inches in diameter at the butt and tapering to five or six inches at the top. Six hundred and eighty of said posts to be 24 feet in length, and 20 of them 30 feet in length.'"

One of the early [[Bell System]] lines was the Washington DC–Norfolk line which was, for the most part, square-sawn tapered poles of [[List of Pinus species|yellow pine]] probably treated to refusal with [[creosote]]. "Treated to refusal" means that the manufacturer forces preservatives into the wood, until it refuses to accept more, but performance is not guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political pressure for [[undergrounding]] remains powerful in many countries.

In [[Eastern Europe]], Russia, and third world countries, many utility poles still carry bare communication wires mounted on insulators not only along railway lines, but also along roads and sometimes even in urban areas. Errant traffic being uncommon on railways, their poles are usually less tall. In the United States electricity is predominately carried on unshielded [[aluminium|aluminum]] conductors wound around a solid steel core and affixed to rated insulators made from glass, ceramic, or poly. Telephone, CATV, and fibre optic cables are generally attached directly to the pole without insulators.

In the United Kingdom, much of the rural electricity distribution system is carried on wooden poles. These normally carry electricity at 11 or 33 kV (three phases) from 132 kV substations supplied from [[Transmission tower|pylons]] to distribution substations or pole-mounted transformers. Wooden poles have been used for 132kv for a number of years from the early 1980s one is called the trident they are usually used on short sections, though the line from Melbourne, Cambs to near Buntingford, Herts is quite long. The conductors on these are bare metal connected to the posts by insulators. Wood poles can also be used for [[low voltage]] distribution to customers.

[[File:Upoles ottawa.jpg|left|thumb|Poles in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada]]

Today, utility poles may hold much more than the uninsulated copper wire that they originally supported. Thicker cables holding many [[twisted pair]], [[coaxial cable]], or even [[fibre-optic]], may be carried. Simple analogue [[repeater]]s or other [[outside plant]] equipment have long been mounted against poles, and often new digital equipment for [[multiplexing]]/demultiplexing or digital repeaters may now be seen. In many places, as seen in the illustration, providers of electricity, television, telephone, street light, traffic signal and other services share poles, either in joint ownership or by renting space to each other. In the United States, ANSI standard 05.1.2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1997/wolfe97b.pdf Standard specifications for wood poles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224031935/http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1997/wolfe97b.pdf |date=2012-02-24 }} US Department of Agriculture, Forest Products Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; governs wood pole sizes and strength loading. Utilities that fall under the [[Rural Electrification Act]] must also follow the guidelines set forth in RUS Bulletin 1724E-150&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/rus/electric/bulletins.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115194247/http://www.usda.gov/rus/electric/bulletins.htm |archivedate=2009-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (from the US Department of Agriculture) for pole strength and loading.

Steel utility poles are becoming more prevalent in the United States thanks to improvements in engineering and corrosion prevention coupled with lowered production costs. However, premature failure due to corrosion is a concern when compared to wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/CorrosionManagementDocument.pdf|title=PMCPOLE.COM|website=www.pmcpole.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114191250/http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/CorrosionManagementDocument.pdf|archivedate=2009-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.NACE.org The National Association of Corrosion Engineers] or NACE is developing inspection, maintenance, and prevention procedures similar to those used on wood utility poles to identify and prevent decay.

==Markings==

===Pole brandings===
[[File:UK-BT-telegraph-post.png|right|thumb|Markings on a BT post]]

[[British Telecom]] posts are usually marked with the following information:{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}
* 'BT' - to mark it as a [[British Telecom]] UK Pole (This can also be PO (Post Office) or GPO (General Post Office) depending on the age of the pole)
* a horizontal line marking 3 metres from the bottom of the pole
* the pole length and size (e.g. 9L implies a 9 metres long, light pole)
* Other poles in use are 7, 10, 11, 13 and 15 metre, as well as 'M' (Medium) and 'S' (Stout)
* the year of treatment and therefore generally the year of installation (e.g. the pole in the picture was treated in 2003)
* the batch and type of wood used
* A date of the last official inspection
* An alphanumeric designation e.g. DP 242 where DP is an acronym for Distribution Point
* If relevant, a red D plate meaning 'Dangerous' and indicating that the pole was structurally unsafe to climb or due to its proximity to other hazards &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishtelephones.com/gpo/pole.htm|title=GPO / British Telecom Telephone poles|last=|first=|date=2011-10-29|website=www.britishtelephones.com|access-date=2016-11-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424132211/http://www.britishtelephones.com/gpo/pole.htm|archivedate=2017-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The date on the pole is applied by the manufacturer and refers to the date the pole was "preserved" (treated to withstand the elements).
[[Image:Pole Brand Salisbury MD.jpg |left|thumb|Brandings on a pole in [[Salisbury, Maryland]], United States]]

In the United States, utility poles are marked with information concerning the manufacturer, pole height, ANSI strength class, wood species, original preservative, and year manufactured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/AWPAPoleBrands.pdf|title=PMCPOLE.COM|website=www.pmcpole.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114191301/http://www.pmcpole.com/cms/AWPAPoleBrands.pdf|archivedate=2009-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (vintage) in accordance with ANSI standard O5.1.2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansi.org/|title=ANSI-American National Standards Institute|website=www.ansi.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828024250/http://www.ansi.org./|archivedate=2008-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called branding, as it is usually burned into the surface; the resulting mark is sometimes called the "birth mark". Although the position of the brand is determined by ANSI specification, it is essentially just below "eye level" after installation. A rule of thumb for understanding a pole's brand is the manufacturer's name or logo at the top with a two-digit date beneath (sometimes preceded by a month).

Below the date is a two-character wood species abbreviation and one- to three-character preservative. Some wood species may be marked "SP" for southern pine, "WC" for western cedar, or "DF" for Douglas fir. Common preservative abbreviations are "C" for [[creosote]], "P" for [[pentachlorophenol]], and "SK" for [[chromated copper arsenate]] (originally referred to salts type K). The next line of the brand is usually the pole's ANSI class, used to determine maximum load; this number ranges from 10 to H6 with a smaller number meaning higher strength. The pole's height (from butt to top) in 5-foot increments is usually to the right of the class separated by a hyphen, although it is not uncommon for older brands to have the height on a separate line. The pole brand is sometimes an aluminum tag nailed in place.

Before the practice of branding, many utilities would set a 2- to 4-digit date nail into the pole upon installation. The use of date nails went out of favor during World War II due to war shortages but is still used by a few utilities. These nails are considered valuable to collectors, with older dates being more valuable, and unique markings such as the utilities' name also increasing the value. However, regardless of the value to collectors, all attachments on a utility pole are the property of the utility company, and unauthorized removal is a felony.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Coordinates on pole tags===
[[File:Pole Tag Crisfield MD USA.jpg|right|thumb|The tags on a [[Delmarva Power]] subtransmission pole located in [[Crisfield, Maryland]], United States. The faded tag reads "733"]]

A practice in some areas is to place poles on coordinates upon a grid. The pole at right is a [[Delmarva Power]] pole located in a rural area of the state of [[Maryland]] in the United States. The lower two tags are the "X" and "Y" coordinates along said grid. Just as in a [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate plane]] used in geometry, X increases as one travels east and Y increases as one travels north. The upper two tags are specific to the subtransmission section of the pole; the first refers to the route number, the second to the specific pole along the route.

[[File:Newpole2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A utility pole replacement in Saugus, Massachusetts, United States]]
However, not all power lines follow the road. In the British region of [[East Anglia]], [[EDF Energy]] Networks often add the [[Ordnance Survey]] Grid Reference coordinates of the pole or substation to the name sign.

In some areas, utility pole name plates may provide valuable coordinate information: a poor man's [[GPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Taiwan_Power_Company_grid|title=Taiwan Power Company grid - OSGeo|website=wiki.osgeo.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211080807/http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Taiwan_Power_Company_grid|archivedate=2008-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jidanni.org/geo/taipower/index.html|title=Understanding coordinates on utility pole numbers|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230026/http://jidanni.org/geo/taipower/index.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}} A [[Taiwan Power Company]] example; [[:zh:電力座標]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.zoklet.net/totse/en/technology/science_technology/readpole.html|title= How to read those little metal plates on Hydro pol|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130605221139/http://www.zoklet.net/totse/en/technology/science_technology/readpole.html|archivedate= 2013-06-05|df= }} A [[British Columbia]], Canada example;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pole route ==
[[File:Pole Route.jpg |thumb|Telegraph pole with spars, insulators and open wires on a now decommissioned Railway Pole Route, Eccles Road, [[Norfolk]], United Kingdom]]

A '''pole route''' (or '''pole line''' in the US) is a telephone link or electrical power line between two or more locations by way of multiple uninsulated wires suspended between wooden utility poles. This method of link is common especially in rural areas where burying the cables would be expensive. Another situation in which pole routes were extensively used were on the railways to link [[signal boxes]]. Traditionally, prior to around 1965, pole routes were built with open wires along non-electrical operated railways; this necessitated insulation when the wire passed over the pole, thus preventing the signal from becoming attenuated.

At electrical operated railways, pole routes were usually not built as too much jamming from the overhead wire would occur. To accomplish this, cables were separated using spars with insulators spaced along them; in general four insulators were used per spar. Only one such pole route still exists on the UK rail network, in the highlands of Scotland. There was also a long section in place between [[Wymondham]], [[Norfolk]] and [[Brandon, Suffolk|Brandon]] in [[Suffolk]], United Kingdom; however, this was de-wired and removed during March 2009.

==Environmental impact==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
[[File:Cigognes Vladeni Roumanie.jpg|thumb|[[White stork]]s (''Ciconia ciconia'') in their nest on a utility pole in Romania]]
Utility poles are used by birds for nesting and to rest on. Utility poles and related structures are regarded by some to be a form of [[visual pollution]]. Many lines are [[Undergrounding|placed underground]] for this reason, in places of high population density or scenic beauty that justify the expense. Architects design some pylons to be pretty, thus avoiding visual pollution.

Some chemicals used to preserve wood poles including [[creosote]] and [[pentachlorophenol]] are toxic and have been found in the environment.

Historically, pole-mounted transformers were filled with a [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB) liquid. PCBs persist in the environment and have adverse effects on animals.

The '''Valley Preferred Cycling Center''' ('''VPCC'''), also known as the '''Lehigh Valley Velodrome''' or simply '''T-Town''', is a professional cycling center and a [[velodrome]] located in [[Breinigsville, Pennsylvania]]. It serves as the  [[Lehigh Valley]]'s main [[track cycling]] stadium. The velodrome is operated by a non-profit [[501(c)(3)]https://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-velodrome-marty-nothstein-leave-20180530-story.html] organization ''Velodrome Fund., Inc''&lt;ref name="volunteer"/&gt; that promotes competitive cycling, youth fitness, and adult wellness activities for the Lehigh Valley. Over the years, the velodrome hosted various cycling championships. VPCC is the home of the [[World Series of Bicycling]]. The Velodrome annually hosts the [[USA Cycling]] Elite Nationals qualifying event. The center also features a Cycling Hall of Fame. Over the past 40 years, the center introduced tens of thousands of people to cycling, producing over 140 national champions, seven world champions, and three Olympic medalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Lori|title=Velodrome Hosts World Series of Bicycling|url=http://www.lvhomeexpert.com/trexlertown-velodrome-hosts-world-series-of-bicycling|publisher=LVHomeExpert|accessdate=18 March 2014|date=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marty Nothstein]], a three-time world champion in track events and an Olympic gold and silver medalist, is no longer the executive director of Valley Preferred Cycling Center.&lt;https://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-nws-velodrome-marty-nothstein-leave-20180530-story.html&gt;{{cite news |last=Sieger |first=Edward |title=Former Olympian announces candidacy for Lehigh County commissioner |work=[[The Express-Times]] |date=February 10, 2015 |url=http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/lehigh-county/index.ssf/2015/02/fomer_olympian_announces_candi.html |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Cyclists on the valley preferred cycling center track 2.jpg|thumb|left|T-Town Elite [[cyclists]] during routine practice.]]
The velodrome started as an initiative by [[Robert Rodale]], a publisher and an Olympian, in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=velodrome&gt;{{cite web|title=History {{!}} Valley Preferred Cycling Center|url=http://www.thevelodrome.com/about-us/history/|publisher=History {{!}} Valley Preferred Cycling Center|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodale became interested in cycling while competing in the [[Pan-American Games]] in Winnipeg, Canada in [[1967 Pan American Games|1967]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lehigh Valley Velodrome|url=http://www.lehighvalleymarketplace.com/departments/because-you-live-here/trexlertown/|publisher=Lehigh Valley Marketplace|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974 construction broke ground on the plot of land that was owned by Bob Rodale and his wife, Ardath.&lt;ref name=velodrome /&gt; The first race was held on October 12, 1975. The Velodrome was originally called the ''Lehigh County Velodrome'' or simply ''T-town'' (due to its close proximity to [[Trexlertown]]). The center underwent a number of renovations which added rest rooms, seats for the fans, a podium, showers, and changing rooms.

In 1995, the center underwent a major $2.5M renovations in preparation for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] cycling trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wogenrich|first=Mark|title=U.s.

In 2007, Valley Preferred Health Network bought the naming rights to the center, and the velodrome's name became Valley Preferred Cycling Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2007-08-10/news/3752023_1_velodrome-fund-trexlertown-velodrome-races|title=Valley Preferred buys naming rights to velodrome|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the town of [[Breinigsville]] offered land to expand the center to include a hall of fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=County offers land for biking hall of fame|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2008-06-25/news/4122285_1_velodrome-cycling-memorabilia-bicycling-hall|accessdate=8 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Morning Call]]|date=June 25, 2008|author=Darryl R. Isherwood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the center is part of a 103-acre Bob Rodale Cycling and Fitness Park.

== Competitions ==
The center hosted various competitions over the years including the [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] and the [[UCI Juniors Track World Championships]]. It's the home of the [[World Series of Bicycling]] and the annual [[USA Cycling]] Elite Nationals qualifying event. Additionally many other smaller regional, national championships and international competitions also take place. Most recently, the VPCC hosted the 2016 [[USA Cycling]] [[United States National Track Championships|Eilte and Junior National Track Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usacycling.org/2016/elite-juniors-track-nationals|title=Elite &amp; Juniors Track National Championships|last=|first=|date=August 1, 2016|website=|publisher=[[USA Cycling]]|access-date=|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VPCC offers a variety of free or low-cost community cycling programs designed to introduce the public to the sport of track cycling, including Try the Track, the spring and fall Bicycling Racing League, and Air Products Development Program.

== Specifications ==
The velodrome is outdoor and uncovered. The track is 1093.6&amp;nbsp;ft (333.3 m) in length with a concrete surface. The track has 30-degree banked turns and 12.5-degree straightaways.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt; At the bottom of the track is an 8 feet (2.4 m) concrete apron. Time trial lines are painted on the track as well.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt;
