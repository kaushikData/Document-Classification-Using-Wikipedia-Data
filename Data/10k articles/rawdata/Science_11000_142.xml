      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10543">'''Airborne Launch Assist Space Access''', or '''DARPA ALASA''' is a canceled program of the [[Federal government of the United States|US]] defense technology agency [[DARPA]] "designed to produce a rocket capable of launching a 100-pound satellite into low Earth orbit for less than $1 million."&lt;ref name=pa20120702/&gt; The program was conceived, then announced in 2011, and funded [[New product development|development]] work began in 2012.  The project was terminated in late 2015.

==Background==
Traditional launch methods of satellites are too costly to put small payloads into orbit without a larger payload accompanying it to make the launch worth the expense.  Current launches of sub-100-pound satellites are performed as "piggyback payloads" on launches of much larger spacecraft, usually headed for [[geostationary orbit]], and are released at the altitude of the primary payload.  In addition, range costs of operating from ground-based infrastructure have escalated as they have aged, accounting for up to 35 percent of the launch cost.  This restricts the number of light satellite launches to 10-12 per year, which could be increased if small payloads could be launched into space affordably and without ground range constraints.  Air-launching satellites was first seriously considered during the 1950s and 1960s, but small payloads in the 100-pound class at the time did not have effective capabilities, so the method was overlooked.  The first air-launched rocket to put a satellite into orbit was the [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]] [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]], which did it on 13 June 1990; however, it is currently deployed from a heavily modified and expensive [[Lockheed L-1011]] airliner.  The ALASA program's objective is to use an unmodified aircraft platform (except for software) that does not have to be dedicated to the mission to place a 100 lb satellite into orbit that requires only 24 hours notice to integrate and launch the payload, with the ability to re-plan the launch in flight and relocate the aircraft to any civilian airport or military airfield in a crisis situation, while using onboard [[GPS]]/inertial position reporting rather than ground-based radar tracking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/awin/darpa-revisits-air-launch-focus-cost Darpa Revisits Air Launch With Focus On Cost] - Aviationweek.com, 25 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A program solicitation was announced in 2011, and six companies were awarded contracts in July 2012.  The six awardees who signed phase 1 contracts with DARPA included:&lt;ref name=pa20120702&gt;
{{cite news |last=Messier|first=Doug |title=DARPA Awards 6 Small Airborne Launch Vehicle Contracts |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2012/07/02/darpa-awards-6-small-airborne-launch-vehicle-contracts/ |accessdate=2012-11-29 |newspaper=Parabolic Arc |date=2012-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Boeing]]– system concept
* [[Lockheed Martin]] – design utilizes a "tactical aircraft to provide a high energy-state, [[Reusable launch vehicle|reusable]] [[first stage (rocketry)|first stage]], enabling launches from bases worldwide"&lt;ref name=pa20120702/&gt;
* [[Northrop Grumman]]
* [[Space Information Laboratories]] – is "providing three key enabling technologies that could be used in multiple launch systems, including [[GPS]] Metric Track, Autonomous Flight Termination System (AFTS) and Space Based Range to reduce range launch cost."&lt;ref name=pa20120702/&gt;
* [[Ventions]] – [[second stage]] [[launch vehicle]]
* [[Virgin Galactic]] – utilizes its existing [[WhiteKnight2]] carrier aircraft

In the first phase, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Virgin Galactic were funded to explore different ALASA system concepts while Northrop Grumman, Space Information Laboratories and Ventions were contracted to work on enabling technologies that could be used by any or all of the system teams.&lt;ref name=aw20120625&gt;
{{cite news |last=Warwick|first=Graham |title=Darpa Revisits Air Launch With Focus On Cost |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/AW_06_25_2012_p33-469762.xml |accessdate=2012-11-29 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=2012-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, DARPA announced that the ALASA program would provide the [[launch vehicle]] booster for another DARPA [[DARPA SeeMe program|program]] that is intending to release a "[[Satellite constellation|constellation]] of 24 [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|micro-satellites]] (~{{convert|20|kg}} range) each with 1-meter imaging [[Satellite imagery|resolution]]."&lt;ref name=nsw20121219&gt;
{{cite news |last=Lindsey|first=Clark |title=DARPA developing microsat constellation orbited with air-launch system |url=http://www.newspacewatch.com/articles/darpa-developing-microsat-constellation-orbited-with-air-launch-system.html |accessdate=2012-12-22 |newspaper=NewSpace Watch |date=2012-12-19 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, DARPA requested {{US$|40 million}} for a second year of ALASA program funding in spring 2013.&lt;ref name=sn20130517&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferster|first=Warren|title=DARPA Cancels Formation-flying Satellite Demo|url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/military-space/35375darpa-cancels-formation-flying-satellite-demo|accessdate=2013-11-01|newspaper=Space News|date=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Boeing won the large {{USD|32–104 million}} phase 2 ALASA contract from DARPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/military-space/39967darpa-picks-boeing-to-demonstrate-airborne-launcher-concept DARPA Picks Boeing To Demonstrate Airborne Launcher Concept | SpaceNews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing will use their [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E Strike Eagle]] fighter to carry the ALASA rocket up to {{convert|12,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, then release the {{convert|7.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} rocket to ignite and carry itself into orbit.  Using a modified fighter-jet to launch the rocket would increase satellite launch sites from four locations ([[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], Florida; [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], California; [[Wallops Flight Facility]], Virginia; and [[Kodiak Island]], Alaska) to any available runway.  The cost to put a {{convert|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} microsatellite into orbit is targeted at $1 million, a decrease of 66 percent.  A demonstration launch was hoped for in FY 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/military-space/40023boeing-targets-66-percent-launch-cost-reduction-with-alasa Boeing Targets 66 Percent Launch Cost Reduction with ALASA] - Spacenews.com, 28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The F-15E launch vehicle would have required no modifications to launch the ALASA payload, not even software, because the rocket will use the same communications protocols as a typically mounted weapons system.  This enables the aircraft to continue flying other missions as a cost benefit over being specialized.  The rocket will also feature new design technologies to lower complexity and costs.  It will be powered by a monopropellant, a combination of [[nitrous oxide]] and [[acetylene]], and mixed together in one propellant tank slightly below room temperature; the propellant choice is a dramatic simplification of the complexity of the rocket vehicle.  Rocket design is also unconventional, mounting the four engines for the first stage at the front rather than rear.  DARPA plans to develop a second, smaller launch system called the Small Air Launch Vehicle to Orbit (SALVO) to understand operations cost, demonstrate new technologies like battery-powered pumps for the rocket’s engines, and provide overall program before ALASA is launched.  SALVO was planned to launch in spring 2015, six to nine months before the first ALASA flight in late 2015.  12 flights were to be conducted through mid-2016 from [[Eglin Air Force Base]], Florida over the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2543/1 Air launch, big and small] - Thespacereview.com, 30 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 2015, DARPA and the Air Force had reportedly began SALVO flights, potentially having already commenced them to counter Chinese and Russian electronic and infrared surveillance; this could mean ALASA would give the U.S. a "stealth satellite launch" capability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defensesystems.com/Articles/2015/06/19/DARPA-Air-Force-SALVO-cubesat-launch.aspx Airborne 'stealth launch' of CubeSat said to be underway] - Defensesystems.com, 19 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==
The program had a budget of "{{US$|46 million}} for the 18-month first phase through September 2013, when [DARPA] planned another competition to select at least one team to conduct up to 36 launches in 2015 [in order to] to demonstrate [the Alasa system] at a persuasive scale."&lt;ref name=aw20120625/&gt; {{US$|40 million}} has been requested for the second year.&lt;ref name=sn20130517/&gt;

==Competition==
After DARPA announced in December 2012 that the ALASA air-launched [[Microsatellite launch vehicle|microsat launch vehicle]] would be chosen to launch the [[DARPA SeeMe program]] [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|micro-satellites]], some questions arose as to why other [[Private spaceflight|commercial]] options currently in development were not considered, such as the [[Virgin Galactic]] [[LauncherOne]] and the [[XCOR Aerospace]] [[Lynx (spacecraft)#Mark III|Lynx]].&lt;ref name=nsw20121219/&gt;

==Termination==
DARPA terminated the program in late 2015, due to safety concerns with the unique monopropellant, NA-7, which exploded in two ground tests.  It was reported that development of the propellant would continue, as would efforts to apply technologies developed in the program.&lt;ref&gt;

==Overview==
The first popular book about chaos theory, it describes the [[Mandelbrot set]], [[Julia set]]s, and [[Lorenz attractor]]s without using complicated mathematics. It portrays the efforts of dozens of scientists whose separate work contributed to the developing field. The text remains in print and is widely used as an introduction to the topic for the mathematical layperson. An enhanced ebook edition was released by Open Road Media in 2011, adding embedded video and hyperlinked notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maynard|first=Andrew|title=James Gleick’s Chaos – the enhanced edition|url=http://2020science.org/2011/04/09/james-gleicks-chaos-the-enhanced-edition/|work=Review|publisher=2020 Science|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Robert Sapolsky]] said that, "Chaos is the first book since ''[[Baby Beluga]]'' where I've gotten to the last page and immediately started reading it over again from the front."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&amp;t=47m20s&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freeman Dyson]] critiqued the book for omitting the earlier work of Dame [[Mary L. Cartwright]] and [[J. E. Littlewood]], which he credits as forming the foundation of chaos theory, but also praised it as a popular account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frenkel|first1=Karen A.|title=Why Aren't More Women Physicists?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-arent-more-women-phys/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=11 July 2017|pages=90–92|language=en|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0207-90|date=1 February 2007|bibcode = 2007SciAm.296b..90F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chukri System''' is a [[debt bondage in India|debt bondage]] or [[forced labour]] system found in [[Kidderpore]] and other parts of [[West Bengal]]. Under this system a female can be coerced into [[prostitution]] in order to pay off debts.&lt;ref&gt;Page 11,12, Sleightholme &amp; Indrani (1996), ''Guilty Without Trial'', {{ISBN|0-8135-2381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson2005"/&gt; She generally works without pay for one year or longer in order to repay a supposed debt to the [[brothel]] owner for food, clothes, make-up, and living expenses.&lt;ref name="Office2005"/&gt;

The system creates a workforce of people virtually enslaved to their creditors, and constitutes one of the primary causes for women entering the sex trade. The system flourishes primarily in [[West Bengal]] or [[Calcutta]]. The name is used also in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="Davidson2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia O'Connell Davidson|title=Children in the Global Sex Trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89zNs8KgJNoC&amp;pg=PA40|date=11 March 2005|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-2928-5|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Office2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=International Labour Office|title=A Global Alliance Against Forced Labour: Global Report Under the Follow-up to the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QGdea4A1t0C&amp;pg=PA32|year=2005|publisher=International Labour Organization|isbn=978-92-2-115360-3|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 1964, the DeLong star ruby was one of a number of precious gems stolen in a notorious jewelry heist by [[Jack Roland Murphy]] and two accomplices.  Some of the stolen gems (notably, the [[Star of India (gem)|Star of India]] and the Midnight Star) were recovered in a bus depot locker in January 1965; however, the DeLong ruby was not among them.&lt;ref name=Sosin&gt;{{cite news|last=Sosin|first=Milt|title=Star of India Found in Miami Bus Depot|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ebQzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=auoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2470,2260128&amp;hl=en|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=The Miami News|date=January 8, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;   After months of negotiation, the unknown holder of the ruby agreed, through third parties, to ransom it for $25,000.  The ransom was paid by wealthy Florida businessman [[John D.

'''''EPOXI''''' is a compilation of [[NASA]] [[Discovery program]] missions led by the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and [[principal investigator]] [[Michael A'Hearn]], with co-operation from the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp.|Ball Aerospace]]. ''EPOXI'' uses the ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' spacecraft in a campaign consisting two missions: the '''''Deep Impact Extended Investigation''''' (DIXI) and '''''Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization''''' (EPOCh). ''DIXI'' aimed to send the ''Deep Impact'' spacecraft on a flyby of another comet, after its primary mission was completed in July 2005, while ''EPOCh'' saw the spacecraft's photographic instruments as a [[space observatory]], studying [[extrasolar planets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press| url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jul/HQ_07147_Discovery_missions.html| title=NASA Gives Two Successful Spacecraft New Assignments| date=July 3, 2007| publisher=[[NASA]]| accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press| url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/dec/HQ_07279_EPOXI_mission_to_comet_Hartley.html| title=NASA Sends Spacecraft on Mission to Comet Hartley 2| publisher=[[NASA]]| date=Dec 13, 2007| accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsdesk.umd.edu"&gt;{{Cite press| url=http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/scitech/release.cfm?ArticleID=1564| title=Deep Impact Extended Mission Heads for Comet Hartley 2| publisher=[[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]| date=December 13, 2007| accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''DIXI'' successfully sent the ''Deep Impact'' spacecraft on a flyby of comet [[103P/Hartley|Hartley 2]] on November 4, 2010, revealing a "hyperactive, small and feisty" comet, after three [[gravity assist]]s from [[Earth]] in December 2007, December 2008 and June 2010. The ''DIXI'' mission was not without problems, however; the spacecraft had initially been targeted for a December 5, 2008 flyby of comet [[85P/Boethin|Boethin]], though, the comet could not be located, and was later declared a [[lost comet]], prompting mission planners to reorganize a flyby of an alternative target, Hartley 2. After its flyby of Hartley 2, the spacecraft was also set to make a close flyby of the [[Apollo asteroid]] [[(163249) 2002 GT]] in 2020. The mission was suspended altogether, however, after contact with the spacecraft was suddenly lost in August 2013 and attempts to re-establish contact in the month following had failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-21/nasa-calls-off-search-for-deep-impact-comet-probe/4972930 NASA calls off search for lost Deep Impact comet probe] - Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Retrieved September 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Mission scientists theorized that a [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K]]-like problem had plagued the spacecraft's software.

[[File:Hartley2jets2 epoxi big.jpg|thumb|EPOXI mission observation of Hartley 2's jets]]
The ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' mission was finished with the visit to comet [[Tempel 1]]. But the spacecraft still had plenty of maneuvering fuel left, so NASA approved a second mission, called EPOXI (Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact Extended Investigation), which included a visit to a second comet (DIXI component) as well as observations of extrasolar planets (EPOCh component).&lt;ref name="SDaily3"/&gt;

===Comet Boethin lost===
On July 21, 2005, ''Deep Impact'' executed a trajectory correction maneuver that placed the spacecraft on course to fly past Earth on December 31, 2007. The maneuver allowed the spacecraft to use Earth's gravity to begin a new mission in a path towards another comet. In January 2008 ''Deep Impact'' began studying the stars with several known [[extrasolar planet]]s in an attempt to find other such stars nearby. The larger of the spacecraft's two telescopes attempts to find the planets using the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit method|transit method]].&lt;ref name="SDaily3"&gt;{{cite web | title=Science Daily |work=Deep Impact Mission: Aiming For Close-ups Of Extrasolar Planets |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070410120957.htm| accessdate=June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial plan was for a December 5, 2008 flyby of [[Comet Boethin]], with the spacecraft coming within {{convert|435|mi|km}}. The spacecraft did not carry a second impactor to collide with the comet and would observe the comet to compare it to various characteristics found on [[9P/Tempel]]. A'Hearn, the ''Deep Impact'' team leader reflected on the upcoming project at that time: "We propose to direct the spacecraft for a flyby of Comet Boethin to investigate whether the results found at Comet Tempel 1 are unique or are also found on other comets."&lt;ref name="Skymania News"&gt;{{cite web | title=Skymania News |work=Deep Impact will fly to new comet|url=http://skymania.com/wp/2006/11/deep-impact-will-fly-to-new-comet.html| accessdate=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that the mission would provide only about half of the information collected during the collision with Tempel 1 but at a fraction of the cost.&lt;ref name="Skymania News"/&gt; (EPOXI’s low mission cost of $40 million is achieved by reusing the existing Deep Impact spacecraft.) ''Deep Impact'' would use its [[spectrometer]] to study the comet's surface composition and its telescopes for viewing the surface features.&lt;ref name="SDaily3"/&gt;
[[File:EPOXI moon transits Earth.gif|thumb|right|Animation of the Moon [[Astronomical transit|transiting]] the Earth on 28–29 May 2008 by EPOXI.]]
However, as the Earth gravity assist approached, astronomers were unable to locate Comet Boethin, which is too faint to be observed. Consequently, its orbit could not be calculated with sufficient precision to permit a flyby. Instead, the team decided to send ''Deep Impact'' to comet [[103P/Hartley]] requiring an extra two years. NASA approved the additional funding required and retargeted the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epoxi.umd.edu/1mission/status.shtml EPOXI Mission Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115215854/http://epoxi.umd.edu/1mission/status.shtml |date=2010-11-15 }}, NASA/University of Maryland, December 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory began redirecting EPOXI on November 1, 2007. They commanded the spacecraft to perform a three-minute rocket burn that changed the spacecraft's velocity. EPOXI’s new trajectory set the stage for three Earth flybys, the first on December 31, 2007. This placed the spacecraft into an orbital "holding pattern" so that it could encounter comet 103P/Hartley in 2010.

"It's exciting that we can send the ''Deep Impact'' spacecraft on a new mission that combines two totally independent science investigations, both of which can help us better understand how solar systems form and evolve," said in December 2007 ''Deep Impact'' leader and University of Maryland astronomer [[Michael A'Hearn]] who is principal investigator for both the overall EPOXI mission and its DIXI component.&lt;ref name="newsdesk.umd.edu"/&gt;

In June 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://epoxi.umd.edu/2science/hydratedmoon.shtml Deep Impact and Other Spacecraft Find Clear Evidence of Water on Moon: Thin layer of surface 'dew' appears to form, then dissipate each day] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120717034554/http://epoxi.umd.edu/2science/hydratedmoon.shtml |date=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EPOXI's spectrometer scanned the Moon on its way to Hartley, and discovered traces of "water or hydroxyl", confirming a [[Moon Mineralogy Mapper]] observation &amp;mdash; a discovery announced in late September, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/924/1 Science, ''A Whiff of Water Found on the Moon'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EPOCh ===

Before the 2008 flyby to re-orient for the comet 103P/Hartley encounter, the spacecraft used High Resolution Instrument, the larger of its two telescopes, to perform photometric observations of previously discovered transiting [[extrasolar planet]]s from January to August 2008.&lt;ref name="EP"&gt;{{cite web |title=EPOXI Mission Status Reports |url=http://epoxi.umd.edu/1mission/status.shtml |accessdate=2009-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115215854/http://epoxi.umd.edu/1mission/status.shtml |archivedate=2010-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations is to measure the quantity of light, not necessarily resolve an image. An aberration in the primary mirror of the HRI &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beyond Deep Impact: Possible Targets After Fireworks |url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/050629_deep_impact_beyond.html |accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed the HRI to spread the light from observations over more pixels without saturating the CCD, effectively obtaining better data.

The spacecraft used Earth's gravity for the second gravity assist in December 2008 and made two distant flybys of Earth in June and December 2009. On May 30, 2010 it successfully fired its engines for an 11.3 second trajectory correction maneuver, for a velocity change (ΔV) of {{convert|0.1|m/s|mph|sp=us}}, in preparation for the third Earth flyby on June 27. Observations of 103P/Hartley began on September 5 and ended November 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/epoxi20100528.html |title=NASA Spacecraft Burns for Home, Then Comet |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a diagram of the EPOXI solar orbits see [https://web.archive.org/web/20100905134548/http://epoxi.umd.edu/3gallery/DIXI_path_full.shtml here].

The mission's closest approach to 103P/Hartley occurred at 10 am EDT on 4 November 2010, passing to within {{convert|694|km|mi|sp=us}} of this small comet. The flyby speed was 12.3&amp;nbsp;km/s. The spacecraft employed the same suite of three science instruments—two telescopes and an infrared spectrometer—that the Deep Impact spacecraft used during its prime mission to guide an impactor into comet Tempel 1 in July 2005 and observe the results.&lt;ref name="A'Hearn2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = A'Hearn | first1 = M.

Early results of the observations show that the comet is powered by [[dry ice]], not water vapor as was previously thought.The images were clear enough for scientists to link jets of dust and gas with specific surface features.&lt;ref name="A'Hearn2011"/&gt;

"When comet Boethin could not be located, we went to our backup, which is every bit as interesting but about two years farther down the road," said Tom Duxbury, EPOXI project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. "Hartley 2 is scientifically just as interesting as comet Boethin because both have relatively small, active nuclei," said [[Michael A'Hearn]], principal investigator for EPOXI at the University of Maryland, College Park.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Electromagnetic hypersensitivity''' ('''EHS''') is a claimed sensitivity to [[electromagnetic fields]], to which negative symptoms are attributed. EHS has no scientific basis and is not a recognised [[medical diagnosis]]. Claims are characterized by a "variety of non-specific symptoms, which afflicted individuals attribute to exposure to [[electromagnetic field]]s".&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs296/en/ |title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity|publisher= World Health Organisation (WHO) |work= WHO Factsheet 296|date=December 2005|accessdate= 2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--causes--&gt;
Those who are self-described with EHS report adverse reactions to electromagnetic fields at intensities well below the maximum levels permitted by international [[Mobile phone radiation and health#Safety standards and licensing|radiation safety standards]].  The majority of [[Provocation (medical)|provocation trials]] to date have found that such claimants are unable to distinguish between exposure and non-exposure to electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref name="pmid15784787"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roosli2008/&gt; A systematic review in 2005 showed no convincing scientific evidence for symptoms being caused by electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref name="pmid15784787"/&gt; Since then, several [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind experiments]] have shown that people who report electromagnetic hypersensitivity are unable to detect the presence of electromagnetic fields and are as likely to report ill health following a sham exposure as they are following exposure to genuine electromagnetic fields, suggesting the cause in these cases to be the [[nocebo|nocebo effect]].&lt;ref name=regeletal2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=RubinPrim2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilen,16304699&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Wilén J, Johansson A, Kalezic N, Lyskov E, Sandström M |title= Psychophysiological tests and provocation of subjects with mobile phone related symptoms |journal= Bioelectromagnetics. |volume= 27|issue=3 |pages=204–14 |year=2006 |pmid=16304699 |doi= 10.1002/bem.20195|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--management--&gt;
A 2005 review by the UK [[Health Protection Agency]] and a 2006 systematic review each evaluated the evidence for various medical, psychological, behavioral, and alternative treatments for EHS and each found that the evidence-base was limited and not generalizable, but that the best evidence favored [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].&lt;ref name=RubinTreat2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=irvine2005 /&gt;  As of 2005, [[WHO]] recommended that people presenting with claims of EHS be evaluated to determine if they have a medical condition that may be causing the symptoms the person is attributing to EHS, that they have a psychological evaluation, and that the person's environment be evaluated for issues like air or [[noise pollution]] that may be causing problems.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;

&lt;!--Society and culture--&gt;
Some people who feel they are sensitive to electromagnetic fields may seek to reduce their exposure or use [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref name="rooslietal2004"/&gt; Government agencies have enforced false advertising claims against companies selling devices to shield against EM radiation.&lt;ref name=FTCenforce&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fair|first1=Lesley|title=Federal Trade Commission Advertising Enforcement|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/training-materials/enforcement.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|pages=18–19|date=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UKenforce/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
There are no specific symptoms associated with claims of EHS and reported symptoms range widely between individuals.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; They include headache, fatigue, stress, sleep disturbances, skin prickling, burning sensations and rashes, pain and ache in muscles and many other health problems. In severe cases such symptoms can be a real and sometimes disabling problem for the affected person, causing psychological distress.&lt;ref name=rooslietal2004 /&gt; There is no scientific basis to link such symptoms to electromagnetic field exposure.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

The prevalence of some reported symptoms is geographically or culturally dependent and does not imply "a causal relationship between symptoms and attributed exposure".&lt;ref name=irvine2005&gt;[http://www.hpa.org.uk/Publications/Radiation/HPARPDSeriesReports/HpaRpd010/ "Definition, epidemiology and management of electrical sensitivity"], Irvine, N, Report for the Radiation Protection Division of the UK Health Protection Agency, HPA-RPD-010, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sage |first=Cindy |title=Microwave And Radiofrequency Radiation Exposure: A Growing Environmental Health Crisis? |work= |publisher=San Francisco Medical Society web page |url=http://www.sfms.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=1770 |doi= |accessdate=2008-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515232743/http://www.sfms.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=1770 |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many such reported symptoms overlap with other syndromes known as [[Medically unexplained physical symptoms|symptom-based conditions]], [[Somatization disorder|functional somatic syndromes]], and IEI ([[Multiple chemical sensitivity|idiopathic environmental intolerance]]).&lt;ref name=irvine2005 /&gt;

Those reporting electromagnetic hypersensitivity will usually describe different levels of susceptibility to [[electric field]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, and various frequencies of [[electromagnetic waves]]. Devices implicated include fluorescent and low-energy lights, [[mobile phone|mobile]], [[cordless phone|cordless/portable phones]], and [[Wi-Fi]].&lt;ref name=philips2003&gt;Philips, Alasdair and Jean (2003–2011).

==Causes==
Most blinded conscious provocation studies have failed to show a correlation between exposure and symptoms, leading to the suggestion that psychological mechanisms play a role in causing or exacerbating EHS symptoms. In 2010, Rubin et al. published a follow-up to their 2005 review, bringing the totals to 46 double-blind experiments and 1175 individuals with self-diagnosed hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name="pmid15784787"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rubin GJ, Das Munshi J, Wessely S |title=Electromagnetic hypersensitivity: a systematic review of provocation studies |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=224–32 |year=2005 |pmid=15784787 |doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000155664.13300.64 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RubinProvReview2010&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=James Rubin |author2=Rosa Nieto-Hernandez |author3=Simon Wessely | title = Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance Attributed to Electromagnetic Fields | journal = Bioelectromagnetics | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 |date= 2010 | pmid=19681059 | doi = 10.1002/bem.20536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both reviews found no robust evidence to support the hypothesis that electromagnetic exposure causes EHS, as have other studies.&lt;ref name=regeletal2006&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sabine Regel |author2=Sonja Negovetic |author3=Martin Röösli |author4=Veronica Berdiñas |author5=Jürgen Schuderer |author6=Anke Huss |author7=Urs Lott |author8=Niels Kuster |author9=Peter Achermann |title=UMTS Base Station-like Exposure, Well-Being, and Cognitive Performance |journal=Environ Health Perspect |volume=114 |issue=8 |pages=1270–75 |date=August 2006 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/8934/8934.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.8934 |pmid=16882538 |pmc=1552030 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010073038/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2006/8934/8934.html |archivedate=2007-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RubinPrim2006&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=J Rubin |author2=G Hahn |author3=BS Everitt |author4=AJ Clear |author5=Simon Wessely | title = Are some people sensitive to mobile phone signals?

Some other types of studies suggest evidence for symptoms at non-thermal levels of electromagnetic exposure.

==Diagnosis==
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity is not an accepted diagnosis; medically there is no case definition or clinical practice guideline and there is no specific test to identify it, nor is there an agreed-upon definition with which to conduct clinical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baliatsas C, Van Kamp I, Lebret E, Rubin GJ |title=Idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF): a systematic review of identifying criteria |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=12 |issue= |page=643 |year=2012 |pmid=22883305 |pmc=3504528 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-12-643 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints of electromagnetic hypersensitivity may mask organic or psychiatric illness. Diagnosis of those underlying conditions involves investigating and identifying possible known medical causes of any symptoms observed.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; It may require both a thorough medical evaluation to identify and treat any specific conditions that may be responsible for the symptoms, and a psychological evaluation to identify alternative psychiatric/psychological conditions that may be responsible or contribute to the symptoms.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18157992"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rubin GJ, Cleare AJ, Wessely S |title=Psychological factors associated with self-reported sensitivity to mobile phones |journal=J Psychosom Res |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=1–9; discussion 11–2 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18157992 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.05.006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms may also be brought on by imagining that exposure is causing harm, an example of the [[nocebo effect]]. Studies have shown that reports of symptoms are more closely associated with belief that one is being exposed than with any actual exposure.&lt;ref name=regeletal2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=RubinPrim2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilen,16304699/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4072|number=72|title=Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: Real or Imagined?|accessdate=27 December 2016|quote="The ability of a human brain to convince itself of just about anything is not to be underestimated.

A 2006 systematic review and a 2005 review by the UK Health Protection Agency each evaluated the evidence for various medical, psychological, behavioral, and alternative treatments for EHS and each found that the evidence-base was limited and not generalizable.&lt;ref name=RubinTreat2006&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rubin GJ, Das Munshi J, Wessely S |title=A systematic review of treatments for electromagnetic hypersensitivity |journal=Psychother Psychosom |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=12–18 |year=2006 |pmid=16361870 |doi=10.1159/000089222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=irvine2005 /&gt;  The conclusion of the 2006 review stated: "The evidence base concerning treatment options for electromagnetic hypersensitivity is limited and more research is needed before any definitive clinical recommendations can be made. However, the best evidence currently available suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy is effective for patients who report being hypersensitive to weak electromagnetic fields."&lt;ref name=RubinTreat2006/&gt;

As of 2005, WHO recommended that people presenting with claims of EHS be evaluated to determine if they have a medical condition that may be causing the symptoms the person is attributing to EHS, that they have a psychological evaluation, and that the person's environment be evaluated for issues like air or noise pollution that may be causing problems.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;

==Prevalence==
The prevalence of claimed electromagnetic hypersensitivity has been estimated as being between a few cases per million to 5% of the population depending on the location and definition of the condition.

In 2002, a [[questionnaire]] survey of 2,072 people in California found that the prevalence of self-reported electromagnetic hypersensitivity within the sample group was 3% (95% CI 2.8–3.68%), with electromagnetic hypersensitivity being defined as "being allergic or very sensitive to getting near electrical appliances, computers, or power lines" (response rate 58.3%).&lt;ref name=levallois2002&gt;{{Cite journal

A similar questionnaire survey from the same year in Stockholm County (Sweden), found a 1.5% prevalence of self-reported electromagnetic hypersensitivity within the sample group, with electromagnetic hypersensitivity being defined as "hypersensitivity or allergy to electric or magnetic fields" (response rate 73%).&lt;ref name=hillertetal2002 /&gt;

A 2004 survey in Switzerland found a 5% prevalence of claimed electromagnetic hypersensitivity in the sample group of 2,048.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Schreier N, Huss A, Röösli M |title=The prevalence of symptoms attributed to electromagnetic field exposure: a cross-sectional representative survey in Switzerland |journal=Soz Praventivmed |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=202–09 |year=2006 |pmid=17193782 |doi=10.1007/s00038-006-5061-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a UK survey aimed at a randomly selected group of 20,000 people found a prevalence of 4% for symptoms self-attributed to electromagnetic exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Eltiti S, Wallace D, Zougkou K, etal |title=Development and evaluation of the electromagnetic hypersensitivity questionnaire |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=137–51 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17013888 |doi=10.1002/bem.20279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar views have been expressed by other commentators."&lt;ref name=irvine2005 /&gt;

==Society and culture==
In 2010, a cell tower operator in [[South Africa]] revealed at a public meeting that the tower that nearby residents were blaming for their current EHS symptoms had been turned off over six weeks prior to the meeting, thus making it a highly unlikely cause of EHS symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massive revelation in iBurst tower battle|url=https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wireless/11099-massive-revelation-in-iburst-tower-battle.html|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electrosensitives tortured by a radio tower that had been switched off for six weeks|url=http://boingboing.net/2010/01/15/electrosensitives-to.html|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] found that claims of harm from electromagnetic radiation, made in a product advertisement, were unsubstantiated and misleading.&lt;ref name=UKenforce&gt;{{cite web|title=ASA Ruling on The Healthy House Ltd|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2014/2/The-Healthy-House-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_248892.aspx#.WBfvIeErKV4|publisher=UK Advertising Standards Authority|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have filed lawsuits to try to win damages due to harm claimed from electromagnetic radiation. In 2012, a New Mexico judge dismissed a lawsuit in which one person sued his neighbor, claiming to have been harmed by EM radiation from his neighbor's cordless telephones, dimmer switches, chargers, Wi-Fi and other devices. The plaintiff brought the testimony of his doctor, who also believed she had EHS, and a person who represented himself as a neurotoxicologist; the judge found none of their testimony credible.&lt;ref name=QW2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrett|first1=Stephen|title="Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity" Is Not a Valid Diagnosis|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ems.html|publisher=Quackwatch|accessdate=1 November 2016|date=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, parents of a boy at a school in [[Southborough, Massachusetts|Southborough]], [[Massachusetts]] alleged that the school's Wi-Fi was making the boy sick.&lt;ref name=QW2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connell|first1=Scott|title=Wi-Fi lawsuit against Southboro's Fay School is headed to trial |url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20160118/NEWS/160119173 |work=The Telegram |date=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fictional television [[crime drama]] ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', the character [[Chuck McGill|Charles "Chuck" McGill]] is depicted as experiencing the symptoms of EHS. In the episode ''[[Alpine Shepherd Boy]]'', a skeptical doctor surreptitiously operates a switch controlling the electronics in Chuck's hospital bed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10453">An '''exeligmos''' ({{lang-el|ἐξέλιγμος}} — ''turning of the wheel'') is a period of 54 years, 33 days that can be used to predict successive [[eclipse]]s with similar properties and location. For a [[solar eclipse]], after every exeligmos a solar eclipse of similar characteristics will occur in a location close to the eclipse before it. For a [[lunar eclipse]] the same part of the earth will view an eclipse that is very similar to the one that occurred one exeligmos before it (see main text for visual examples). It is an [[eclipse cycle]] that is a triple [[saros (astronomy)|saros]], 3 saroses (or saroi) long, with the advantage that it has nearly an integer number of days so the next eclipse will be visible at locations and times near the eclipse that occurred one exeligmos earlier. In contrast, each saros, an eclipse occurs about 8 hours later in the day or about 120° to the west of the eclipse that occurred one saros earlier.&lt;ref name=Totality&gt;{{cite book|last=Littman|display-authors=etal|first=Mark|title=Totality: eclipses of the sun|year=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-953209-5|pages=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
The Greeks had knowledge of the exeligmos by at latest 100 BC. A Greek astronomical clock called the [[Antikythera mechanism]] used epicyclic gearing to predict the dates of consecutive exeligmoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The exeligmos is 669 [[month#Synodic month|synodic months]] (every eclipse cycle must be an integer number of synodic months), almost exactly 726 [[month#Draconic month|draconic months]] (which ensures the sun and moon are in alignment during the new moon), and also almost exactly 717 [[month#Anomalistic month|anomalistic months]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=tAhZT5jRTwgC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=exeligmos+717+669&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sFcx9lkg0x&amp;sig=RBi98OvhkiwSnAhaMBmI-upYh6M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JgWbUOuNDqmQ0AWtnoGgCw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; (ensuring the moon is at the same point of its elliptic orbit). The first two factors make this a long lasting eclipse series. The latter factor is what makes each eclipse in an exeligmos so similar. The near integer number of anomalistic months ensures that the apparent diameter of the moon will be nearly the same with each successive eclipse. The fact that it is very nearly a whole integer of days ensures each successive eclipse in the series occurs very close to the previous eclipse in the series.
For each successive eclipse in an exeligmos series the longitude and latitude can change significantly because an exeligmos is over a month longer than a calendar year, and the [[Gamma (eclipse)|gamma]] increases/decreases because an exeligmos is about three hours shorter than a draconic month. The sun's apparent diameter also changes significantly in one month, affecting the length and width of a solar eclipse.&lt;ref name=Totality /&gt;

== Solar Exeligmos Animation ==

Here is an animation of an exeligmos series. Note the similar paths of each total eclipse, and how they fall close to the same [[longitude]] of the earth.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse.html NASA Eclipse Website] Fred Espenak&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Exeligmos.gif|300px]]

=== Solar Saros Animation (for comparison) ===
This next animation is from the entire [[Solar saros 136|saros series]] of the exeligmos above. Notice how each eclipse falls on a different side of the earth (120 degrees apart).&lt;ref name="NASA" /&gt;

'''Halley Research Station''' is a research facility in [[Antarctica]]&lt;ref Name="BASwho"&gt;{{cite web| title=Who We Are| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/our_organisation/who_we_are.php| accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Brunt Ice Shelf]] operated by the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS). The base was established in 1956 to study the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Measurements from Halley led to the discovery of the [[ozone hole]] in 1985.&lt;ref Name="HalleyStation"&gt;{{cite web| title=Halley Research Station| publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/halley/index.php| accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current base is the sixth in a line of designs to overcome the challenges of building on a floating ice shelf where they become buried and crushed by snow. Despite moving the buildings 23km "inland", concern over the propagation of an ice crack resulted in the base being left unmanned for the winters of 2017 and 2018.

==History==
'''Halley Bay''' base was founded in 1956, for the [[International Geophysical Year]] of 1957–1958, by an expedition from the [[Royal Society]]. The bay where the expedition decided to set up their base was named after the astronomer [[Edmond Halley]]. Taken over by [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey|FIDS]] (subsequently BAS), it was designated as '''Base Z'''. The name was changed to Halley in 1977 as the original bay had disappeared because of changes in the ice shelf. 

In 2002, BAS realised that a [[ice calving|calving]] event was possible which could destroy '''Halley V''', so a competition was undertaken to design a replacement station. The current base, '''Halley VI''' officially opened in February 2013 after a test winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/halley/halleyvi/| title=12/13 Season – Official Launch &amp; Demolition of Halley V| date=8 January 2013| accessdate=4 May 2015| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223090254/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/halley/halleyvi/| archivedate=23 December 2010| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world's first fully relocatable terrestrial research station, and is distinguishable by its colourful modular structure built upon huge hydraulic skis.&lt;ref name=Economist-HalleyVI-2013&gt;{{cite news| last1=Piotrowski| first1=Jan| last2=Broughton| first2=Hugh| title=Antarctic research: Resorting to skis| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/03/antarctic-research| accessdate=4 February 2016| work=[[The Economist]]| date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2014, the station lost its electrical and heating supply for 19 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2015/01/halley-vi-coming-in-from-the-cold/ | title=Halley VI: coming in from the cold | first=Felicity | last=Aston | date=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the power cut, there were record low temperatures.

==The buildings==
As with the German [[Neumayer-Station III]], the base floats on an [[ice shelf]] in the [[Weddell Sea]] rather than being built on solid land of the continent of Antarctica. This ice shelf is slowly moving towards the open ocean and, if not relocated, each base would eventually [[ice calving|calve]] off into a drifting [[iceberg]].&lt;ref name=Economist-HalleyVI-Video-2013&gt;{{cite news| last1=Piotrowski| first1=Jan| last2=Broughton| first2=Hugh| title=Researching Antarctica: Resorting to skis| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qbXH0RogWw| accessdate=4 February 2016| work=[[The Economist]]| date=13 March 2013| format=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice-Motherboard-HalleyVI-2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferreira|first1=Becky|title=This Antarctic Base Is More Remote Than the International Space Station|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-antarctic-base-is-more-remote-than-the-international-space-station|accessdate=4 February 2016|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Motherboard]]|date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been five previous bases at Halley. Various construction methods have been tried, from unprotected wooden huts to buildings within steel tunnels. The first four all became buried by snow accumulation and crushed until they were uninhabitable.&lt;ref name=BAS-pbah&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/halley/halleyvi/?page_id=11| title=Previous bases at Halley| publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]| accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more recent structures have been designed to remain on the snow surface.

Halley VI is a string of eight modules which, like Halley V, are jacked up on hydraulic legs to keep it above the accumulation of snow. Unlike Halley V, there are retractable giant skis on the bottom of these legs, which allow the building to be relocated periodically.&lt;ref name=Guardian-HaleyVI-ArchReview-2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Rowan|title=Halley VI research station, Antarctica – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/10/halley-vi-base-architecture-antarctica|accessdate=4 February 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk/external/guest/detail/search/10010655/1/20| title=Halley VI from the air. 2010-11| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk/external/guest/detail/search/10010670/1/20| title=Halley VI - Red module on stilts| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk/external/guest/detail/search/10009451/101/20| title=Halley VI space frame newly fitted with its hydraulic legs and skis| publisher=British Antarctic Survey images| accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/images/none/halleyvi_06_sam_burrell.jpg/halleyvi_13.jpg| title=Halley VI from the air| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| accessdate=8 August 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517195958/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/images/none/halleyvi_06_sam_burrell.jpg/halleyvi_13.jpg| archivedate=17 May 2013| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drewry summer accommodation building and the garage from Halley V were dragged to the Halley VI location and continue to be used. The Workshop and Storage Platform (WASP) provides storage for field equipment and a workshop for technical services. There are six external science cabooses which house scientific equipment for each experiment spread across the site and the [https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/halley/clean-air-sector-laboratory-caslab/ Clean Air Sector Laboratory (CASLab)] 1km from the station.

==== Design competition ====
An [[architectural design competition]] was launched by [[RIBA Competitions]] and the [[British Antarctic Survey]] in June 2004 to provide a new design for Halley VI. The competition was entered by a number of architectural and engineering firms. The winning design, by [[Faber Maunsell]] and [[Hugh Broughton (architect)|Hugh Broughton Architects]] was chosen in July 2005.&lt;ref name=Economist-HalleyVI-Video-2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist-HalleyVI-2013 /&gt;

Halley VI was built in Cape Town, South Africa by a South African consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Halley VI| publisher=Petrel Engineering| url=http://www.petrel.co.za/Projects/HalleyVI.aspx| accessdate=7 Jan 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127112958/http://www.petrel.co.za/Projects/HalleyVI.aspx| archivedate=2012-01-27| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/halley/halleyvi/| title=Halley VI| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| accessdate=7 Jan 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223090254/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/halley/halleyvi/| archivedate=2010-12-23| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 26 [[modular accommodation]] pods were added in total, installed in eight modules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk/external/guest/detail/search/10009453/81/20| title=Halley VI pods in module frames - 2010| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides fully serviced accommodation for 32 people. The first sections were shipped to Antarctica in December 2007. It was assembled next to Halley V,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk/external/guest/detail/search/10010657/21/20| title=Aerial view of the construction line of Halley VI Research Station situated next to Halley V| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; then dragged one-by-one 15&amp;nbsp;km and reconnected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/living_and_working/research_stations/halley/halleyvi/?m=201105| title=Halley VI, May 2011| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halley VI Station was officially opened in Antarctica on 5 February 2013. [[Kirk Watson (actor)|Kirk Watson]], a filmmaker from Scotland, recorded the building of the station over a four-year period for a short film. A description of the engineering challenges and the creation of the consortium was provided by [[Adam Rutherford]] to coincide with an exhibition in Glasgow.&lt;ref name=BBCRadio4-InsideScience-2013&gt;{{cite episode|last1=Sella|first1=Andrea|last2=Geim|first2=Andre|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b037706w|title=2D supermaterials; Inside an MRI; Antarctic architecture|work=[[BBC Radio 4]]|series=BBC Inside Science|minutes =17|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Design elements ====
A focus of the new architecture was the desire to improve the living conditions of the scientists and staff on the station. Solutions included consulting a colour psychologist to create a special colour palette to offset the more than 100 days of darkness each year, daylight simulation lamp alarm clocks to address biorhythm issues, the use of special wood veneers to imbue the scent of nature and address the lack of green growth, as well as lighting design and space planning to address social interaction needs and issues of living and working in isolation.&lt;ref name=Economist-HalleyVI-Video-2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist-HalleyVI-2013 /&gt;

Another priority of the structure construction was to have the least environmental impact on the ice as possible.&lt;ref name=Economist-HalleyVI-Video-2013 /&gt;

==== Relocation ====
The British Antarctic Survey announced that it intended to move Halley VI to a new site in summer 2016-2017.&lt;ref Name="BAS Halley VI relocation project"&gt;{{cite web| title=Halley Research Station relocation | publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/moving-halley/| accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large crack had been propagating through the ice and threatened to cut the station off from the main body of the ice shelf, prompting the decision to move.  The planned move would see the station shifted {{convert|23|km|mi}} from its previous site and would be the first time the station had been moved since it became operational in 2012. [[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]], the long-running BBC documentary series, sent film-maker [[Natalie Hewit]] to Antarctica for three months to document the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08tj2zr| title=Antarctica - Ice Station Rescue| date=June 7, 2017| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609121049/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08tj2zr| archivedate=June 9, 2017| work=[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]| publisher=[[BBC Two]]| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the station was being relocated, concerns about a new crack which had been discovered on 31 October 2016 (dubbed the "Halloween Crack") led the BAS to announce that it would withdraw its staff from the base in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ice crack to put UK Antarctic base in shut-down| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38643420| accessdate=16 January 2017| publisher=BBC News| author=Jonathan Amos| date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAS completed the relocation of the base in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38841100| title=UK completes Antarctic Halley base relocation| author=Jonathan Amos| publisher=BBC News| date=3 February 2017| accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff returned after the Antarctic winter, in November 2017 and found the station in very good shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/halley-vi-research-station-ready-for-summer/|title=Halley VI Research Station ready for 2017 summer season| publisher=British Antarctic Survey|date=10 November 2017| accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station was not manned in winter 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/115024/| title=Halley Research Station will not winter in 2018| publisher=British Antarctic Survey| date=31 October 2018| accessdate=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winds are predominantly from the east; strong winds often picking up the dusty surface snow reducing visibility to a few metres.

One of the reasons for the location of Halley is that it is under the auroral oval, making it ideally located for [[Outer space#Geospace|geospace]] research and resulting in frequent displays of the [[Aurora Australis]] overhead. These are easiest to see during the 105 days (29 Apr - 13 Aug) when the Sun does not rise above the horizon.

==Inhabitants==
During the winter months there are usually around 13 overwintering staff.  In a typical winter the team is isolated from when the last aircraft leaves in early March until the first plane arrives in late October.  In the peak summer period, from late December to late February, staff numbers increase to around 70.

Sometimes, none of the wintering team is a scientist. Most are the technical specialists required to keep the station and the scientific experiments running. The 2016 wintering team at Halley included a chef, a doctor, a communications manager, a vehicle mechanic, a generator mechanic, an electrician, a plumber, a field assistant, two electronics engineers, a meteorologist and a data manager.  In addition there is a winter station leader who is sworn in as a [[Magistrates of England and Wales|magistrate]] prior to deployment and whose main role is to oversee the day-to-day management of the station.

1996 saw the first female winterers at Halley. Since 2009 there are usually at least two women who winter each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smitha.demon.co.uk/zfids/2010/index.htm| title=Halley Bay - 2010| publisher=Z-Fids| accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Base life==
Life in Antarctica is dominated by the seasons, with a short, hectic summer and a long winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/|title=Polar Operations | website=The British Antarctic Survey |access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In bases such as Halley that are resupplied by sea, the most significant event of the year is the arrival of the resupply ship (currently {{ship|RRS|Ernest Shackleton}}, before 1999, {{ship|RRS|Bransfield}}) in late December.  This is followed by intense activity to unload all supplies before the ship has to leave again; typically, this is done in less than two weeks.

The Halley summer season runs from as early as mid-October when the first plane lands, until early March when the ship has left and the last aircraft leaves transiting through Halley and on to [[Rothera Research Station]] before heading to South America.

Significant dates in the winter are sundown (last day when the Sun can be seen) on April 29th, midwinter on June 21st and sunrise (first day when the Sun rises after winter) on August 13th.  Traditionally, the oldest person on base lowers the tattered flag on sundown and the youngest raises a new one on sunrise.  Midwinter is a week long holiday, during which a member of the wintering team is chosen to keep the old flag.

'''Heat stabilization''' is an additive-free preservation technology for tissue samples which stops degradation and changes immediately and permanently. Heat stabilization uses rapid conductive heating, under controlled pressure, to generate a fast, homogenous and irreversible thermal denaturation of proteins, resulting in a complete and permanent elimination of all enzymatic activity that would otherwise cause further biological changes to the tissue sample ''ex vivo''. Due to the permanent inactivation of enzymes, heat stabilization overcomes the drawbacks of conventional tissue sample preservation techniques, such as snap-freezing followed by inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2009|year=|title=Heat Stabilization of the Tissue Proteome: A New Technology for Improved Proteomics|url=|journal=J.

Understanding the role of [[proteins]], [[peptides]] and [[small molecules]] in normal and diseased tissue is crucial to defining their potential use as drugs, drug targets or disease [[biomarkers]]. Yet biological changes begin the moment tissue is removed from its native environment. Dramatic alterations at the molecular level occur within seconds e.g. changed metabolism, catabolic fragmentation of large molecules (such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) occurs in order to release energy, leading to disrupted control mechanisms, [[phosphorylation]] states are altered and proteins begin to degrade. As a consequence vital information may be lost or distorted, leading to inter-sample variation, risk of incorrect data interpretation and potentially misleading conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 2013|year=|title=The impact of biosampling procedures on molecular data interpretation|journal=Mol.

The '''history of the polymerase chain reaction''' (PCR) has variously been described as a classic [[Eureka (word)|"Eureka!"]] moment,&lt;ref name=MullisLecture&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1993/mullis-lecture.html Kary Mullis' Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; or as an example of cooperative teamwork between disparate researchers.&lt;ref name=Rabinow&gt;Rabinow P "Making PCR: A Story of Biotechnology" University of Chicago Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-226-70147-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following is a list of events before, during, and after its development:

==Prelude==
* On '''April 25, 1953''' [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] published "a radically different structure" for [[DNA]],&lt;ref&gt;Watson JD, Crick FHC "A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid", Nature vol. 171, pp. 737–738 (1953).  [http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/coldspring/ideas/printit.html]&lt;/ref&gt; thereby founding the field of [[molecular genetics]].  Their [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|structural model]] featured two strands of [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[Base pair|base-paired]] DNA, running in opposite directions as a double helix.  They concluded their report saying that "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material".  For this insight they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in '''1962'''.
* Starting in the '''mid-1950s''', [[Arthur Kornberg]] began to study the mechanism of [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref&gt;(Arthur Kornberg's Discovery of DNA Polymerase I) J. Biol. Chem. vol. 280, p. 46. [http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/280/49/e46]&lt;/ref&gt;  By '''1957''' he has identified the first [[DNA polymerase]].&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, IR, Bessman MJ, Simms ES, Kornberg A "Enzymatic Synthesis of Deoxyribonucleic Acid. I. Preparation of Substrates and Partial Purification of an Enzyme from Escherichia coli" J. Biol. Chem. vol. 233(1) pp. 163–170 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  The enzyme was limited, creating DNA in just one direction and requiring an existing [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] to initiate copying of the template strand.  Overall, the DNA replication process is surprisingly complex, requiring separate proteins to [[DNA helicase|open]] the DNA helix, to [[Single-strand binding protein|keep]] it open, to create [[Primase|primers]], to [[DNA polymerase III holoenzyme|synthesize]] new DNA, to [[DNA polymerase I|remove]] the primers, and to [[DNA ligase|tie]] the pieces all together.  Kornberg was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in '''1959'''.
* In the '''early 1960s''' [[H. Gobind Khorana]] made significant advances in the elucidation of the [[genetic code]].  Afterwards, he initiated a large project to [[Gene synthesis|totally synthesize]] a functional human [[gene]].&lt;ref&gt;Khorana HG et al. "Total synthesis of the structural gene for the precursor of a tyrosine suppressor transfer RNA from Escherichia coli. 1. General introduction" J. Biol. Chem. vol. 251(3) pp. 565–70 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  To achieve this, Khorana pioneered many of the techniques needed to make and use [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthetic]] DNA [[oligonucleotide]]s.  Sequence-specific oligonucleotides were used both as building blocks for the gene, and as primers and templates for DNA polymerase.  In '''1968''' Khorana was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] for his work on the Genetic Code.
* In '''1969''' [[Thomas D. Brock]] reported the isolation of a new species of [[bacterium]] from a [[hot spring]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]].  ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]''&lt;ref&gt;Brock TD, Freeze H "Thermus aquaticus, a Nonsporulating Extreme Thermophile" J. Bacteriol. vol. 98(1) pp. 289–297 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; (Taq), became a standard source of enzymes able to withstand higher temperatures than those from ''[[Escherichia coli|E. Coli]]''.
* In '''1970''' Klenow reported a modified version of DNA Polymerase I from ''E. coli''.&lt;ref&gt;Klenow H and Henningsen I "Selective Elimination of the Exonuclease Activity of the Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase from Escherichia coli B by Limited Proteolysis" Proc Natl Acad Sci vol. 65 pp. 168–75 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  Treatment with a protease removed the 'forward' nuclease activity of this enzyme.  The overall activity of the resulting [[Klenow fragment]] is therefore biased towards the synthesis of DNA, rather than its degradation.
* By '''1971''' researchers in Khorana's project, concerned over their yields of DNA, began looking at "repair synthesis" – an artificial system of primers and templates that allows DNA polymerase to copy segments of the gene they are synthesizing.  Although similar to PCR in using repeated applications of DNA polymerase, the process they usually describe&lt;ref name=Khorana1&gt;Panet A, Khorana HG "Studies on Polynucleotides" J. Biol. Chem. vol. 249(16), pp. 5213–21 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; employs just a single primer-template complex, and therefore would not lead to the exponential amplification seen in PCR.
* Circa '''1971''' [[Kjell Kleppe]], a researcher in Khorana's lab, envisioned a process very similar to PCR.  At the end of a paper on the earlier technique,&lt;ref name=Kleppe&gt;Kleppe K, Ohtsuka E, Kleppe R, Molineux I, Khorana HG "Studies on polynucleotides. XCVI. Repair replications of short synthetic DNA's as catalyzed by DNA polymerases." J. Molec. Biol. vol. 56, pp. 341–61 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; he described how a two-primer system might lead to replication of a specific segment of DNA:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:::''"one would hope to obtain two structures, each containing the full length of the template strand appropriately complexed with the primer. DNA polymerase will be added to complete the process of repair replication. Two molecules of the original duplex should result. The whole cycle could be repeated, there being added every time a fresh dose of the enzyme."'' &lt;ref name=Kleppe/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:No results are shown there, and the mention of unpublished experiments in another paper&lt;ref name=Khorana1/&gt; may (or may not) refer to the two-primer replication system. (These early precursors to PCR were carefully scrutinized in a patent lawsuit, and are discussed in Mullis' chapters in ''The Polymerase Chain Reaction'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB, Ferré F, Gibbs RA "The Polymerase Chain Reaction" Birkhäuser Press (1994) {{ISBN|0-8176-3750-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

* Also in '''1971''', [[Cetus Corporation]] was founded in [[Berkeley, California]] by Ronald Cape, Peter Farley, and Donald Glaser.  Initially the company screened for microorganisms capable of producing components used in the manufacture of food, chemicals, vaccines, or pharmaceuticals. After moving to nearby [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], they began projects involving the new [[Genetic engineering|biotechnology]] industry, primarily the [[Recombinant DNA|cloning]] and [[Gene expression|expression]] of human genes, but also the development of diagnostic tests for genetic mutations.
* In '''1976''' a [[Taq polymerase|DNA polymerase]]&lt;ref name=Chien&gt;Chien A, Edgar DB, Trela JM "Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from the extreme thermophile Thermus aquaticus" J. Bacteriol. vol. 174 pp. 1550–1557 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; was isolated from [[Thermus aquaticus|''T. aquaticus'']]. It was found to retain its activity at temperatures above 75&amp;nbsp;°C.
* In '''1977''' [[Frederick Sanger]] reported a [[Chain termination method|method]] for determining the sequence of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR "DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors" Proc Natl Acad Sci vol. 74(12) pp. 5463–7 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique employed an oligonucleotide [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]], DNA polymerase, and modified [[Dideoxynucleotide|nucleotide precursors]] that block further extension of the primer in sequence-dependent manner.  For this innovation he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize]] in '''1980'''.

By '''1980''' all of the components needed to perform PCR amplification were known to the scientific community.  The use of DNA polymerase to extend oligonucleotide primers was a common procedure in DNA sequencing and the production of [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] for [[Recombinant DNA|cloning]] and [[Gene expression|expression]].  The use of DNA polymerase for [[nick translation]] was the most common method used to label [[Hybridization probe|DNA probes]] for [[Southern blot]]ting.

== Theme ==
* In '''1979''' [[Cetus Corporation]] hired [[Kary Mullis]] to synthesize oligonucleotides for various research and development projects throughout the company.&lt;ref name=Mullis-1&gt;Mullis KB "The Unusual Origins of the Polymerase Chain Reaction" Scientific American, vol. 262, pp. 56–65 (April 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; These oligos were used as probes for screening cloned genes, as primers for DNA sequencing and cDNA synthesis, and as building blocks for gene construction. Originally synthesizing these oligos by hand, Mullis later evaluated early prototypes for automated synthesizers.&lt;ref name=MullisLecture/&gt;
* By '''May 1983''' Mullis synthesized oligonucleotide probes for a project at Cetus to analyze a [[sickle cell anemia]] mutation. Hearing of problems with their work, Mullis proposed an alternative technique based on Sanger's [[Chain termination method|DNA sequencing]] method.&lt;ref name=Mullis-1/&gt; Realizing the difficulty in making the Sanger method specific to a single location in the genome, Mullis then modified the idea to add a second primer on the opposite strand. Repeated applications of polymerase could lead to a chain reaction of replication for a specific segment of the genome – PCR.
* Later in '''1983''' Mullis began to test his idea. His first experiment&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; did not involve thermal cycling – he hoped that the polymerase could perform continued replication on its own. Later experiments that year included repeated thermal cycling, and targeted small segments of a cloned gene. Mullis considered these experiments a success, but could not convince other researchers.
* In '''June 1984''' Cetus held its annual meeting in [[Monterey, California]]. Its scientists and consultants presented their results, and considered future projects. Mullis presented a poster on the production of oligonucleotides by his laboratory, and presented some of the results from his experiments with PCR.&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; Only [[Joshua Lederberg]], a Cetus consultant, showed any interest.&lt;ref name=Mullis-1/&gt; Later at the meeting, Mullis was involved in a physical altercation with another Cetus researcher over a dispute unrelated to PCR.&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; The other scientist left the company, and Mullis was removed as head of the oligo synthesis lab.

==Development==
* In '''September 1984''' Tom White, [[Vice president|VP]] of Research at Cetus (and a close friend), pressured Mullis to take his idea to the group developing the genetic mutation assay.  Together, they spent the following months designing experiments that could convincingly show that PCR is working on genomic DNA.  Unfortunately, the expected amplification product was not visible in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]],&lt;ref name=Scharf&gt;Scharf et al. "Direct Cloning and Sequence Analysis of Enzymatically Amplified Genomic Sequences" Science vol. 233, pp. 1076–78 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; leading to confusion as to whether the reaction had any specificity to the targeted region.
* In '''November 1984'''&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; the amplification products were analyzed by [[Southern blot]]ting, which clearly demonstrating increasing amount of the expected 110 [[base pair|bp]] DNA product.&lt;ref name=Saiki1&gt;Saiki RK et al. "Enzymatic Amplification of β-globin Genomic Sequences and Restriction Site Analysis for Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia" Science vol. 230 pp. 1350–54 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  Having the first visible signal, the researchers began optimizing the process.  Later, the amplified products were cloned and sequenced, showing that only a small fraction of the amplified DNA is the desired target, and that the [[Klenow fragment]] then being used only rarely incorporates incorrect nucleotides during replication.&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt;

==Exposition==
* As per normal industrial practice, the results were first used to apply for [[patent]]s.  Mullis applied &lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB "Process for amplifying nucleic acid sequences." U.S. Patent 4,683,202.&lt;/ref&gt; for a patent covering the basic idea of PCR and many potential applications, and was asked by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|PTO]] to include more results.  On '''March 28, 1985''' the entire development group (including Mullis) filed an application&lt;ref&gt;Mullis, KB et al. "Process for amplifying, detecting, and/or-cloning nucleic acid sequences." U.S. Patent 4,683,195.&lt;/ref&gt; that is more focused on the analysis of the Sickle Cell Anemia mutation via PCR and [[Oligomer restriction]].  After modification, both patents were approved on '''July 28, 1987'''.
* In the '''spring of 1985''' the development group began to apply the PCR technique to other targets.  Primers and probes were designed for a variable segment of the [[Human leukocyte antigen]] [[HLA-DQA1|DQα]] gene.  This reaction was much more specific than that for the β-hemoglobin target – the expected PCR product&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt; is directly visible on [[agarose gel electrophoresis]].  The amplification products from various sources were also cloned and sequenced, the first determination of new  alleles by PCR.&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt;  At this same time the original Oligomer Restriction assay technique was replaced with the more general [[Allele specific oligonucleotide]] method.&lt;ref name=Saiki2&gt;Saiki et al. "Analysis of enzymatically amplified β-globin and HLA DQα DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes." Nature vol. 324 (6093) pp. 163–6 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also '''early in 1985''', the group began using a thermostable DNA polymerase (the [[Klenow fragment|enzyme]] used in the original reaction is destroyed at each heating step).  At the time&lt;ref name=MullisLecture/&gt; only two had been described, from [[Thermus aquaticus|Taq]] and [[Bacillus stearothermophilus|Bst]].  The report on Taq polymerase&lt;ref name=Chien/&gt; was more detailed, so it was chosen for testing.  The Bst polymerase was later found to be unsuitable for PCR{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.  That summer Mullis attempted to isolate the enzyme, and a group outside of Cetus was contracted to make it, all without success.  In the '''Fall of 1985''' Susanne Stoffel and David Gelfand at Cetus succeed in making the polymerase, and it was immediately found by Randy Saiki to support the PCR process.
* With patents submitted, work proceeded to report PCR to the general scientific community.  An abstract for an [[American Society of Human Genetics]] meeting in [[Salt Lake City]] was submitted in '''April 1985''', and the first announcement of PCR was made there by Saiki in '''October'''.&lt;ref&gt;Saiki, R et al. "A Novel Method for the Prenatal Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia" Amer. Soc. Human Genetics, Oct. 9–13, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two publications were planned – an 'idea' paper from Mullis, and an 'application' paper from the entire development group.  Mullis submitted his manuscript to the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], which rejected it for not including results.  The other paper, mainly describing the [[Oligomer restriction|OR]] analysis assay, was submitted to [[Science (journal)|Science]] on '''September 20, 1985''' and was accepted in November.  After the rejection of Mullis' report in December, details on the PCR process were hastily added to the second paper, which appears on '''December 20, 1985'''.&lt;ref name=Saiki1/&gt;
* In '''May 1986''' Mullis presented PCR at the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium,&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB et al. "Specific enzymatic amplification of DNA in vitro: the polymerase chain reaction." Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. vol. 51 pp. 263–73 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; and published a modified version of his original 'idea' manuscript much later.&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB and Faloona FA "Specific Synthesis of DNA in vitro via a Polymerase-Catalyzed Chain Reaction." Methods in Enzymology vol. 155(F) pp. 335–50 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  The first non-Cetus report using PCR was submitted on '''September 5, 1986''',&lt;ref&gt;Verlaan-de Vries M et al. "A dot-blot screening procedure for mutated ras oncogenes using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides." Gene vol. 50(1–3) pp. 313–20 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; indicating how quickly other laboratories began implementing the technique.  The Cetus development group published their detailed sequence analysis of PCR products on '''September 8, 1986''',&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt; and their use of [[Allele specific oligonucleotide|ASO]] probes on '''November 13, 1986'''.&lt;ref name=Saiki2/&gt;
* The use of Taq polymerase in PCR was announced by Henry Erlich at a [[International Congress of Human Genetics|meeting]] in Berlin on '''September 20, 1986''', submitted for publication in '''October 1987''', and was published early the next year'.&lt;ref name=Saiki3&gt;Saiki et al. "Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase." Science vol. 239 pp. 487–91 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  The patent for PCR with Taq polymerase was filed on '''June 17, 1987''', and is issued on '''October 23, 1990'''.&lt;ref&gt;Mullis, KB et al. "Process for amplifying, detecting, and/or cloning nucleic acid sequences using a thermostable enzyme." U.S. Patent 4,965,188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variation==

* In '''December 1985''' a joint venture between Cetus and [[PerkinElmer|Perkin-Elmer]] was established to develop instruments and reagents for PCR.  Complex [[Thermal cycler|Thermal Cyclers]] were constructed to perform the Klenow-based amplifications, but never marketed.  Simpler machines for Taq-based PCR were developed, and on '''November 19, 1987''' a press release announces the commercial availability of the "PCR-1000 Thermal Cycler" and "AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase".
* In the '''Spring of 1985''' John Sninsky at Cetus began to use PCR for the difficult task of measuring the amount of HIV circulating in blood.  A viable test was announced on '''April 11, 1986''', and published in '''May 1987'''.&lt;ref&gt;Kwok S et al. "Identification of HIV sequences by using in vitro enzymatic amplification and oligomer cleavage detection." J. Virol. vol. 61(5) pp. 1690–4 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  Donated blood could then be screened for the virus, and the effect of antiviral drugs directly monitored.
* In '''1985''' Norm Arnheim, also a member of the development team, concluded his sabbatical at Cetus and assumed an academic position at [[University of Southern California|USC]].  He began to investigate the use of PCR to amplifiy samples containing just a single copy of the target sequence.  By '''1989''' his lab developed multiplex-PCR on single sperm to directly analyze the products of meiotic recombination.&lt;ref&gt;Boehnke M et al. "Fine-structure genetic mapping of human chromosomes using the polymerase chain reaction on single sperm." Am J Hum Genet vol. 45(1) pp. 21–32 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  These single-copy amplifications, which had first been run during the characterization of Taq polymerase,&lt;ref name=Saiki3/&gt; became vital to the study of [[ancient DNA]], as well as the genetic typing of preimplanted embryos.
* In '''1986''' Edward Blake, a forensics scientist working in the Cetus building, collaborated with Henry Erlich a researcher at Cetus, to apply PCR to the analysis of criminal evidence.  A panel of DNA samples from old cases was collected and coded, and was analyzed blind by Saiki using the HLA DQα assay.  When the code was broken, all of the evidence and perpetrators matched.  Blake and Erlich's group used the technique almost immediately in "Pennsylvania v. Pestinikas",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forensicdna.com/Timeline020702.pdf Forensic Science Timeline (PDF).]&lt;/ref&gt; the first use of PCR in a criminal case.  This DQα test is developed by Cetus as one of their "Ampli-Type" kits, and became part of early protocols for the testing of forensic evidence, such as in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]].
* By '''1989''' [[Alec Jeffreys]], who had earlier developed and applied the first [[DNA Fingerprinting]] tests, used PCR to increase their sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys A et al. "Amplification of human minisatellites." Nucleic Acids Research vol. 23 pp. 10953-71 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  With further modification, the amplification of highly polymorphic [[Variable number tandem repeat|VNTR]] loci became the standard protocol for [[National DNA Database]]s such as [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]].
* In '''1987''' Russ Higuchi succeeded in amplifying DNA from a human hair.&lt;ref&gt;Higuchi R et al. "DNA typing from single hairs." Nature vol. 332(6164) pp. 543–6 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  This work expanded to develop methods for the amplification of DNA from highly degraded samples, such as from [[Ancient DNA]] and in [[Forensics|forensic]] evidence.

==Coda==
* On '''December 22, 1989''' the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] awarded Taq Polymerase (and PCR) its first "Molecule of the Year".  The 'Taq PCR' paper&lt;ref name=Saiki3/&gt; became for several years the most [[Citation index|cited]] publication in biology.
* After the publication of the first PCR paper,&lt;ref name=Saiki1/&gt; the [[United States Government]] sent a stern letter to Randy Saiki, admonishing him for publishing a report on [[Nuclear chain reaction|"chain reactions"]] without the required prior review and approval by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].  Cetus responded, explaining the differences between PCR and the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* On '''July 23, 1991''' Cetus announced that its sale to the neighboring biotechnology company [[Chiron Corporation|Chiron]].  As part of the sale, rights to the PCR patents were sold for USD $300 million to [[Hoffman-La Roche]] (who in '''1989''' had bought limited rights to PCR).  Many of the Cetus PCR researchers moved to the Roche subsidiary, [[Roche Diagnostics|Roche Molecular Systems]].
* On '''October 13, 1993''' Kary Mullis, who had left Cetus in '''1986''', was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].  On the morning of his acceptance speech,&lt;ref name=MullisLecture/&gt; he was nearly arrested by Swedish authorities for the "inappropriate use of a laser pointer".&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB "Dancing Naked in the Mind Field" Pantheon Books (1998) {{ISBN|0-679-44255-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9624">'''Hubble search for transition comets''' ('''Transition Comets—UV Search for OH Emissions in Asteroids''') was a study involving amateur [[astronomer]]s and the use of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].  This was one of only six studies involving amateur astronomers that was approved by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1992/23/text/ |title=Amateur Astronomers Will Use NASA's Hubble Space Telescope |work=Hubblesite.org |date=September 10, 1992 |id=STScI-1992-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the beginning years of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) project, [[NASA]] and Congress were interested in finding ways for [[amateur astronomers]] to participate in HST research. The director of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), [[Riccardo Giacconi]], decided to allocate some of his "Director's Discretionary" time to amateur observing programs. In December 1985, the leaders of seven national amateur astronomy organizations met at STScI in Baltimore to discuss the participation of amateur astronomers in the HST project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.stsci.edu/~webdocs/STScINewsletter/2002/fall_02.pdf |title=The Birth of the Snapshot Programs |journal=STScI Newsletter |publisher=Institute for Advanced Studies |first=John N. |last=Bahcall |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=22–23 |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and study==
The team used the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] to perform a spectroscopic search for [[Hydroxyl|OH]] emission from five asteroids. OH emission would indicate that the asteroids were once comets. [[944 Hidalgo]] and [[2201 Oljato]] move in elliptical, comet-like orbits. [[182 Elsa]], [[224 Oceana]], and [[899 Jokaste]] are main-belt asteroids. The last three have been observed with [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] (Kresak, 1977). Concurrently with the spectroscopic study, ground-based visual observations were carried out by 80 amateur astronomers in 22 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Astronomical League, 47th National Convention, July 29–31, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists suspect that some [[asteroids]] were once [[comets]]. A [[comet]] loses part of its mass with each passage around the Sun. It would appear that some would eventually use all of their volatiles, or perhaps cover these under a blanket of dust after repeated passages around the Sun. Such an object might then have an asteroid appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Minor planet 1983TB - A dead comet? |journal=Icarus |first1=A. L. |last1=Cochran |first2=E.

The asteroid [[944 Hidalgo]] is most frequently discussed as being in a comet-like orbit.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, 1970; Kresak, 1977, 1979; Schoemaker and Wolfe, 1982; Degewij and Tedesco, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Kresak (1977) identified it as an "extinct comet nucleus". In addition, comets tend to approach [[Jupiter]] closely while asteroids do not. Hidalgo approaches Jupiter at nearly the same distance as 3 comets: [[Comet Encke]], [[Comet Arend-Rigaux]], and [[Comet Neujmin I]], all of which exhibit the low levels of activity expected of comets before they become extinct.&lt;ref&gt;Rickman, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pioneer Venus Orbiter]] detected magnetic field disturbances that are correlated with [[2201 Oljato]]. This could be caused by an outgassing of H at a rate of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; that for an active comet.&lt;ref&gt;Russell et al., 1984; Davies, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Oljato's possible comet-like nature is supported by its unusual UV reflectance. It has been interpreted as [[Rayleigh scattering]] from a cloud of fine particles around it.&lt;ref&gt;McFadden et al., 1984; Rickman, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 1923, the astronomer [[Josep Comas i Solà|Josep Comas Solá]] observed the asteroid [[224 Oceana]] with a [[coma (cometary)|coma]].&lt;ref&gt;Kresak, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The asteroid was photographed with a faint halo 30 arc-seconds across. The asteroid's [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] was determined to be 11.6, and at the asteroid's [[heliocentric]] distance of 167 million miles, this made the coma about 24,000 miles across.

The existence of volatiles on asteroids would be of great significance to future miners of the asteroid belt. Volatiles could supply water, fuel and oxygen for missions.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1993 study involving [[amateur astronomers]] and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], [[944 Hidalgo]] and [[2201 Oljato]] were examined with the Hubble Space telescope's [[Faint Object Spectrograph]] for 3085 A emission of OH. These two asteroids were selected because of the nature of their orbits, their meteor-shower associations, and their other characteristics (see Weissman et al. (1989) for a full discussion of their comet-like features). The amber detector was used in the accumulation mode with spectral element G270H. This element covers wavelengths 2325-3225 A. The aperture was 1 arc-second.

The asteroids [[182 Elsa]], [[224 Oceana]], and [[899 Jokaste]] were also observed with the [[Faint Object Spectrograph]], and with the same spectral element G270H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=A Hubble Space Telescope Search for Water in Asteroids |conference=Rochester Academy of Science 26th Annual Scientific Paper Session. November 6, 1999. Canandaigua, New York. |first1=H. |last1=Schenk |first2=J. |last2=Secosky |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team leaders placed advertisements in amateur astronomy publications for amateur observers who would be willing to observe these objects in the visible spectrum from the ground, while the HST was making studies in the UV. The ground-based observers were asked to check for evidence of a dust coma.

==Results==

The spectra for [[944 Hidalgo]], and [[2201 Oljato]] are essentially identical to the solar spectrum. No OH emission, or other emission lines were apparent.

Ground-based observations of these two objects were limited to several [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] images of the area in which 2201 Oljato was calculated to appear. Both 944 Hidalgo, and 2201 Oljato were near 19th magnitude. This placed them beyond the limit of most amateur telescopes.

None of the other three asteroids showed signs of the [[cometary emission]] that would be expected from a weakly active cometary nucleus. This should not be surprising, since the targets lie in stable main-belt orbits.

Ground-based observations of 182 Elsa, 224 Oceana, and 899 Jokaste were conducted visually, photographically, with VHS, and with CCD equipment. 224 Oceana was at 12th magnitude during the HST observations. 182 Elsa was also at 12th magnitude, and 899 Jokaste appeared at 15th magnitude.

All visual observations showed point images, with no sign of a dust coma. Photographic images gave the same result. A number of observers were able to accumulate CCD images in order to reach fainter magnitudes. Using this method, two observers reported signs of a possible short tail on the asteroid 899 Jokaste. This appeared around 17th magnitude. Studies of nearby stars on the original image suggest that this was due to a small amount of trailing during guiding. There was no further evidence of a coma around any of the three asteroids.

Observations of 944 Hidalgo and 2201 Oljato had to be conducted before the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. As a result, the two asteroids were not in convenient positions to detect OH. Hidalgo was imaged at 5 [[Astronomical Units]] from the Sun, and moving away. This is approximately the same distance as SL-9 was before it impacted on Jupiter. The Hubble Space Telescope, using the same Faint Object Spectrograph and spectral element G270H, also failed to find any evidence of OH from SL-9.

2201 Oljato was near [[aphelion]] when it was observed. From the distance of the asteroid belt, any OH signature may have been hidden by noise in the data of the 19th magnitude asteroid. Ideally, both objects should have been studied shortly after [[perihelion]] passage.

The main-belt asteroids 224 Oceana, 182 Elsa, and 899 Jokaste were observed near [[Opposition (astronomy)|opposition]], but did not show any evidence of OH emission. The last two were observed when the Hubble Space Telescope was having guidance problems, and had to present special orientation to the Sun due to the loss of one solar panel. The reports of previous coma may have been due to impacts.

==The amateur observing team==

The team had over 70 primary observers. Observers were located in 24 states of the U.S., and 22 different countries.

'''Iyoite''' is a very rare [[manganese]] [[copper]] [[chloride]] [[hydroxide]] mineral with the formula MnCuCl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Iyoite is a new member of the [[atacamite]] group, and it an analogue of [[botallackite]] characterized in manganese and copper ordering. Iyoite is [[monoclinic]] ([[space group]] ''P''2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''m''). It is chemically similar to [[misakiite]]. Both minerals come from the Ohku mine in the [[Ehime]] prefecture, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Nishio-Hamane, D., Momma, K., Ohnishi, M., Shimobayashi, N., Miyawaki, R., Tomita, N., and Minakawa, T., 2014.

The '''Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research''' ({{lang-de|Leibniz-Institut für Ostseeforschung Warnemünde}}, abbreviated IOW) is a research institution located in [[Warnemünde]] ([[Rostock]]), [[Germany]].

It is part of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz-Association]], cooperates with the [[University of Rostock]] and was founded in 1992. Employing about 160 people the main focus lies on interdisciplinary study of coastal oceans and marginal seas, especially on [[Baltic Sea]] related [[oceanography]]. The institute is a follow-up of the former Institute of Oceanography ("Institut für Meereskunde") which was part of the [[East Germany|GDR]] Academy of Science.

The institute is divided in four departments: physical oceanography, marine chemistry, biological oceanography, and marine geology. Central task of the institute is fundamental research but also teaching at the universities of [[University of Rostock|Rostock]] and [[University of Greifswald|Greifswald]]. IOW has direct access to the research vessel "[[RV Maria S. Merian|Maria S. Merian]]" and can access by request a variety of other medium-sized vessels for longer trips and interdisciplinary tasks from the German research fleet. The institute's facilities are financed by the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]], and the Ministry of Education of [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1731">[[Image:LevittownPA.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of [[Levittown, Pennsylvania]] circa 1959]]
'''Levittown''' is the name of seven large [[suburb]]an housing developments created in the [[United States]] and [[Puerto Rico]] by [[William Levitt]] and his company [[Levitt &amp; Sons]]. Built after [[World War II]] for returning [[veteran]]s and their new families, the communities offered attractive alternatives to cramped central city locations and apartments. The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] and the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) guaranteed builders that qualified veterans could buy housing for a fraction of rental costs.

Production was modeled on [[assembly line]]s in 27 steps with construction workers trained to perform one step. A house could be built in one day when effectively scheduled. This enabled quick and economical production of similar or identical homes with rapid recovery of costs. Standard Levittown houses included a white picket fence, green [[lawn]]s, and modern appliances. Sales in the original Levittown began in March 1947. 1,400 homes were purchased during the first three hours.

*[[Levittown, Pennsylvania]] - the second Levittown (1952–1958)

This is a '''list of [[Tinamiformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is not comprehensive, as not all Tinamiformes have had their numbers quantified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27964">&lt;!-- Indeed, this article is unreferenced. It is a near orphan, linked only from [Carbon number]. It is a service article to writers when they have to check for the used name for a compound of which the sumformula is known. The only references that should lead to this article would be an article on how to get to that formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34202">{{refimprove|date=May 2017}}This page serves as a partial list of countries by adult mean body weight and incidence of obese and overweight populations as calculated by [[body mass index]] (BMI).  

The data for 2014 was first published by the [[World Health Organization]] in 2015.

==Methodology==
{{Main|Body mass index}}
[[Arithmetic mean|Mean]] [[body mass index]] (BMI) provides a simplified measure of the comparative weight of populations on a country by country basis.  BMI calculates a person's mass (weight) divided by the square of their height. An individual with a BMI of 25 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more is considered overweight.  An individual with a BMI of 30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more is considered obese.

The data highlighted on this page comes from [[World Health Organization]] statistics for adult (18 years old and older) populations. Mean BMI data is shown separately for males and females, as well as a combined figure. Mean data highlights the [[central tendency]] of the population data and is but one method of calculating relative body weight between populations.

==Limitations on the usefulness of comparative BMI data==
{{Main|Body mass index#Limitations}}
There are significant limitations to the usefulness of comparative BMI data cited by both the medical community and statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Samantha|title=BMI Is No Longer A Good Indication Of Healthy Weight; Here Are 6 Better Ways To Measure Your Health|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-mass-index-bmi-calculator-healthy-weight-obesity-372852|website=Medical Daily|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMI data has significant weaknesses in terms of scalability and in accounting for variations in physical characteristics.

This is a list of the summed length of all the [[road]] [[tunnels]] in each [[country]]. As many countries are still adding tunnels at a rapid rate, care should be taken when comparing data from different years. Data from China are the time of end of 2017.

This is a list of [[chemical elements]] and their atomic properties, ordered by Atomic number.

Since valence electrons are not clearly defined for the [[d-block]] and [[f-block]] elements, there not being a clear point at which further ionisation becomes unprofitable, a purely formal definition as number of electrons in the outermost shell has been used.

'''Localization and Urbanization Economies''' are two types of external [[economies of scale]], or agglomeration economies. External economies of scale result from an increase in the productivity of an entire industry, region, or economy due to factors outside of an individual company. There are three sources of external economies of scale: input sharing, [[labour economics|labor market pooling]], and [[knowledge spillover]]s (Marshall, 1920) '&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Alfred|title=Principles of Economics|date=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Localization economies occur when an increase in the size of an industry in a city leads to an increase in productivity of a particular activity.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Strange, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Marshall (1920) introduced the idea that the localization of industry can increase productivity in his book Principles of Economics. The highly concentrated [[high tech]] industry in [[Silicon Valley]] exemplifies industrial localization.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Strange, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cost of labor and land in Silicon Valley is very high, high tech firms continue to locate there because of the added benefit they receive from their proximity to a high-skilled labor pool. The size of the high tech industry, creates positive externalities for each firm located in Silicon Valley.

Urbanization economies arise when the size of the city leads to an increase in productivity. [[Los Angeles]] exemplifies urbanization economies in that it has no single dominant industry, yet continues to grow. Firms which locate in Los Angeles benefit from the common resources and large labor pool found in the city. Common resources such as roads, buildings and power supply benefit firms in cities regardless of their industry. Also, firms have better access to labor by locating in cities. The urban environment creates positive externalities that benefit several different industries. [[Jane Jacobs]] is often credited with the idea that urban diversity and a city’s size leads to agglomeration economies. However, Marshall’s (1920)&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; discussion of urban diversity predates her work.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal and Strange, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4022">A '''maternity den''', in the [[animal|animal kingdom]], is a lair where the mother gives birth and nurtures the young, when they are in a vulnerable [[biological life cycle|life stage]]. While such dens are typically [[subterranea (geography)|subterranean]], they may also be [[snow cave]]s or simply beneath rock ledges. Characteristically there is an entrance, and optionally an exit corridor, in addition to a principal chamber.&lt;ref name="Sillero-Zubiri"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sillero-Zubiri, C., Hoffmann M. and Whyte Macdonald, D.|year=2004|title=Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals, and Dogs: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan|publisher=IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group|pages=430|ISBN=2-8317-0786-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Polar bear ===
The [[polar bear]] (''Ursus maritimus'') creates a maternity den either in an earthen subterranean or in a [[snow cave]]. On the [[Hudson Bay Plain]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], many of these subterranean dens are situated in the [[Wapusk National Park]], from which bears migrate to the [[Hudson Bay]] when the [[Drift ice|ice pack]] forms.&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hogan, C.M. |year=2008 |url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=36084 |title=Polar Bear: Ursus maritimus |publisher=Globaltwitcher.com |editor=Stromberg, N. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205716/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=36084 |archivedate=2008-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The maternity den is the bear's shelter for most of the winter. "When all the other polar bears are heading off to the openness of the ocean, the pregnant female polar bears begin looking for a maternity den.  This maternity den is usually in a snow bank, or along an ice patch of ocean shore.  It is here that the female polar bear will go into a hibernation type state.  Female polar bears dig their own maternity den.  It is important the {{sic|the|expected=that the}} female polar bears have fed enough in the spring and summer before fall, because of the scarcity of food on land when winter comes.  While in the maternity den, the mother polar bear will not eat, drink or defecate. The female polar bear will stay in the maternity den and give birth to her cubs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://endangeredpolarbear.com/female_polar_bears.htm|title=Female Polar Bears|first=Pam|last=Caouette|work=endangeredpolarbear.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2017}}

=== Wild dogs ===
Pack members may guard the maternity den used by the alpha female; such is the case with the [[African wild dog]], ''Lycaon pictus''.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brown hyaena ===
The brown hyaena, [[Brown hyena|''Hyaena brunnea'']], makes use of  maternity dens as a means of nurturing and protecting their cubs. These dens are located in coastal or inland regions, most of them being caverns with narrow entrances. The brown hyaena, also, collects bones and stores them within or around the entrance of these dens.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, J., &amp; Aarde, R. V. (1991). Bone collecting by brown hyaenas Hyaena brunnea in the central Namib Desert, Namibia. Journal of Archaeological Science, 18(5), 513-523. doi:10.1016/0305-4403(91)90051-p&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Red fox ===
The red fox also creates maternity dens. After mating, foxes make a maternity den for raising their offspring. Most often, the mother and father will find and enlarge an old woodchuck burrow. Sometimes, a hollow log, streambank, rockpile, cave, or dense shrub will play the role as a den.The den is usually chosen at a place where there is raised ground so the foxes can see all around. The main entrance will be approximately three feet wide, and the den will have one or two escape holes.The den is lined with grass and dry leaves.

[[Mercury program|Mercury]]-[[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas]] 2 (MA-2) was launched unmanned on February 21, 1961 at 14:10 UTC, from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14|Launch Complex 14]] at [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm |title=This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury - NASA SP-4201 |authors=Loyd S. Swenson Jr., James M. Grimwood, Charles C. Alexander |publisher=NASA Special Publication-4201 in the NASA History Series |chapter=10 |page=4 |year=1966 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823124845/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4201/ch10-7.htm|archivedate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test objectives for this flight were concerned with the ability of the spacecraft to withstand reentry under the temperature-critical abort conditions and with the capability of the Atlas to meet the proper injection conditions. Convair had promised to deliver thicker-skinned Atlas vehicles for subsequent flights, however Missile 67D was the last of the thin-skinned model and so it had to be modified for the Mercury mission, incorporating a stainless steel reinforcing band installed around the vehicle between stations 502 and 510. A thin sheet of asbestos was installed between the reinforcing band and the tank skin. This modification was installed as a precaution against the type of failure which had occurred on the previous MA-1 flight. The booster's flight path was also modified somewhat from Mercury-Atlas 1, being placed on a more shallow trajectory so as to reduce aerodynamic loads.

The Atlas lifted into a clear blue February sky quite different from the cloudy, foggy weather of the MA-1 flight. Everyone in the blockhouse waited nervously for the vehicle to pass through the critical Max Q zone. When it did so successfully, there was "enormous jubilation" from the launch team. MA-2 flew a successful suborbital mission that lasted 17 minutes 56 seconds. Altitude reached was 114 miles (183&amp;nbsp;km), speed, 13,227&amp;nbsp;mph (21,287&amp;nbsp;km/h). All test objectives were fully met, the only problems being a bit of propellant slosh. The capsule was recovered 1,432 miles (2305&amp;nbsp;km) downrange. Peak acceleration was 15.9 ''g'' (156&amp;nbsp;m/s²). Mass 1,154&amp;nbsp;kg.

Mercury spacecraft #6 and Atlas #67-D were used in the Mercury-Atlas 2 mission.  The Mercury capsule is currently displayed at the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]], Houston, TX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.mac.com/jimgerard/AFGAS/pages/mercury/MA-2.html| title=Mercury  spacecraft #6 display page on A Field Guide to American Spacecraft website| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705143917/http://web.mac.com/jimgerard/AFGAS/pages/mercury/MA-2.html| archivedate=2010-07-05| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This function expresses the [[radiance factor]] (RADF) as a function the [[phase angle]] (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;), the [[photometric latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[photometric longitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;).

:&lt;math&gt;
   \text{RADF} = \frac{I}{F} = \pi~A_M~\mu_0^k~\mu^{k-1}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_M&lt;/math&gt; is the Minnaert [[albedo]], &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an empirical parameter, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the scattered [[radiance]] in the direction &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\varphi,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi F&lt;/math&gt; is the incident radiance, and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mu_0 = \cos\varphi~\cos(\alpha-\lambda) ~;~~ \mu = \cos\varphi~\cos\lambda ~.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The phase angle is the angle between the light source and the observer with the object as the center.

The assumptions made are:
* the surface is illuminated by a distant point source.
* the surface is isotropic and flat.

Minnaert's contribution is the introduction of the parameter &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, having a value between 0 and 1,&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1941ApJ....93..403M&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; originally for a better interpretation of observations of the [[Moon]]. In remote sensing the use of this function is referred to as ''Minnaert topographic correction'', a necessity when interpreting images of rough terrain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1173">A '''multiple-conclusion logic''' is one in which [[logical consequence]] is a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]], &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;, between two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] (or [[Proposition (mathematics)|proposition]]s).  &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash \Delta&lt;/math&gt; is typically interpreted as meaning that whenever each element of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is true, some element of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is true; and whenever each element of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is false, some element of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is false.

This form of logic was developed in the 1970s by [[D. J. Shoesmith]] and [[Timothy Smiley]]&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Shoesmith and T. J. Smiley, ''Multiple Conclusion Logic'', Cambridge University Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; but has not been widely adopted.

Some [[logician]]s favor a multiple-conclusion consequence relation over the more traditional single-conclusion relation on the grounds that the latter is [[asymmetry|asymmetric]] (in the informal, non-mathematical sense) and favors truth over falsity (or assertion over denial).

[[Image:NOMAD buoy.jpg|thumb|alt=A yellow 6-m NOMAD anchored in calm ocean waters|A 6-meter NOMAD anchored at sea.]]The '''Navy oceanographic meteorological automatic device (NOMAD)''' is an anchored automated [[weather station]] developed shortly after [[World War II]] and still used today.

==Advantages==
The NOMAD has a boat-shaped hull made from aluminum, and it provides relatively high cost effectiveness and excellent long-term survivability in severe weather. These buoys are highly directional and have a quick rotational response and stability. There have been no known [[capsize|capsizings]] of 6-meter NOMAD hulls. The relatively small size of the NOMAD allows for easy transport across land.&lt;ref name="NDBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/mooredbuoy.shtml|website=National Data Buoy Center|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce|date=February 4, 2008|title=Moored Buoy Program|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The NOMAD hull was developed from the "Roberts buoy", which was a {{convert|6.67|ft||adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|400|lb|adj=on}} boat-shaped buoy developed in the early 1940s, by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]], to measure strong tidal currents. The buoy's performance was satisfactory, but its limited size significantly restricted the buoy's use in other areas.&lt;ref name="TimpeRainnie1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timpe|first1=G.|last2=Rainnie|first2=W.|title=Development of a value-engineered NOMAD buoy|year=1982|pages=605–609|doi=10.1109/OCEANS.1982.1151858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1946, the [[Bureau of Ships]] became involved in a program to develop automatic [[Weather buoy|weather station buoys]]. As a perspective part of this program, they conducted a preliminary investigation into the feasibility of mooring a buoy. The investigation concluded that the buoy's hull size was of insufficient length to be moored in 3600 ft of water. To support such a mooring, a similar shaped hull had to be 20 ft (6 m) long and displace approximately 20,000 lb. This was to become the prototype of the buoy now known as the NOMAD.&lt;ref name="TimpeRainnie1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timpe|first1=G.|last2=Rainnie|first2=W.|title=Development of a value-engineered NOMAD buoy|year=1982|pages=605–609|doi=10.1109/OCEANS.1982.1151858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NOMAD was the first of such stations to be anchored successfully for a substantial period in more than 11,000 feet of water. It was also the first anchored automated station to detect formation of a [[hurricane]] and alert weather observers on land.
The station was developed as part of the ocean test and evaluation program, started in 1957, for the [[Bureau of Naval Weapons]], with the [[National Bureau of Standards]] responsible for technical direction.&lt;ref name="Standards1961"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States. National Bureau of Standards|title=Research Highlights of the National Bureau of Standards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OneKBz6lIQC&amp;pg=PA120|year=1961|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Today, the NOMAD is used for monitoring meteorological, oceanographic and water quality parameters, all over the world. The U.S. [[National Weather Service]] currently has 17 NOMADs in operation.&lt;ref name="USbuoys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/stndesc.shtml|website=National Data Buoy Center|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce|date=October 19, 2010|title= Station Description |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOMADs have also been used by the [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] for over 25 years and there are now 16 NOMADs monitoring Canadian waters.

A '''PLL multibit''' or '''multibit PLL''' is a [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL) which achieves improved performance compared to a [[unibit PLL]] by using more [[bit]]s. Unibit PLLs use only the [[most significant bit]] (MSB) of each counter's output bus to measure the [[Phase (waves)|phase]], while multibit PLLs use more bits.&lt;ref name="Zuta"/&gt; PLLs are an essential component in [[telecommunications]].

Multibit PLLs achieve improved efficiency and performance: better utilization of the [[frequency spectrum]], to serve more users at a higher [[quality of service]] (QoS), reduced RF transmit power, and reduced power consumption in [[cellular phone]]s and other [[wireless]] devices.

==Concepts==
A phase-locked loop is an electronic component or system comprising a [[Feedback|closed loop]] for controlling the phase of an [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] while comparing it with the phase of an input or reference signal. An indirect [[frequency synthesizer]] uses a PLL. In an all-digital PLL, a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] (VCO) is controlled using a [[Digital data|digital]], rather than [[Analog signal|analog]], control signal. The [[phase detector]] gives a signal proportional to the phase difference between two signals; in a PLL, one signal is the reference, and the other is the output of the controlled oscillator (or a divider driven by the oscillator).

In a unibit phase-locked loop, the phase is measured using only one bit of the reference and output counters, the most significant bit (MSB). In a multibit phase-locked loop, the phase is measured using more than one bit of the reference and output counters, usually including the most significant bit.

==Unibit PLL==
In unibit PLLs, the output frequency is defined by the input frequency and the modulo count of the two counters.  In each counter, only the most significant bit (MSB) is used. The other output lines of the counters are ignored; this is wasted information.

===PLL structure and performance===
A PLL includes a phase detector, filter and oscillator connected in a closed loop, so the oscillator frequency follows (equals) the input frequency. Although the average output frequency equals the input frequency, the oscillator's frequency fluctuates or vibrates about that average value. The closed loop operates to correct such frequency deviations; higher performance PLL reduces these fluctuations to lower values, however these deviations can never be stopped. See [[Control theory]]. [[Phase noise]], [[spurious emission]], and [[jitter]] are results of the above phenomena.

===PLL synthesizer characteristics===
* PLL frequency synthesizers are widely used in modern telecommunications. For example, a cellular phone may include three to six PLLs.
* The [[phase noise]] may interfere with other subscribers, to reduce their quality of service. The interference is mutual. If the noise is reduced, faster communications are possible, to increase the [[symbol rate]] using more complex modulation schemes - that is, transmitting more bits per sample.

Frequency [[settling time]] is the time it takes the PLL to hop to another frequency. Frequency hopping is used in [[GSM]], and still more in modern systems.
In [[CDMA]], [[frequency hopping]] achieves better performance than phase coding.

Fine frequency resolution is the capability of a PLL to generate closely spaced frequencies. For example, a [[cellular network]] may require a mobile phone to set its frequency at any of a plurality of values, spaced 30&amp;nbsp;kHz or 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.

The ''performance envelope'' of a PLL defines the interrelation between the above essential criteria of performance - for example improving the frequency resolution will result in a slower PLL and higher phase noise, etc.

The PLL Multibit expands the performance envelope of the PLL - it enables to achieve faster settling time together with fine frequency resolution and with lower phase noise.

===Effects of unibit===
As one progresses from the MSB toward the least significant bit (LSB), the frequency increases. For a binary counter, each next bit is at twice the frequency of the previous one. For modulo counters, the relationship is more complicated.

Only the MSB of the two counters are at the same frequency. The other bits in one counter have different frequencies from those in the other counter.

All the bits at the output of one counter, together, represent a [[digital bus]]. Thus, in a PLL frequency synthesizer there are two buses, one for the reference counter, the other for the output (or VCO) counter. In a uni-bit PLL, of the two digital buses, only one bit (line) of each is used. All the rest of the information is lost.

==Complexity of PLL design==
PLL design is an [[interdisciplinary]] task, difficult even for experts in PLLs. This - for the Unibit PLL, which is simpler than the Multibit PLL. The design should take into account:&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manassewitsch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frerking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Altera"/&gt;

*[Control theory, closed loop system.
* Radio frequency RF design - the oscillator, high frequency components
* Analog circuits - loop filter
* Digital circuits - counters, phase measurement
* RFI/EMI, shielding, grounding
* Statistics of noise and phase noise in electronic components and circuits.

==Multibit PLL==
===Principle of operation===
The above PLL uses more of the bits in the two counters. There is a ''difficult problem'', of comparing signals at different frequencies, in two [[digital bus]]es which count to a different final value.

Improved performance is possible by using the faster bits of the counters, taking into account the additional available information.

The operation of the PLL is further disrupted by ''overflow in the counters''. This effect is only relevant in multibit PLLs; for Unibit PLL, there is only the one-bit signal MSB, therefore no overflow is possible.

===Implementation===
The additional degree of freedom in Multibit PLLs allows to adapt each PLL to specific requirements. This can be effectively implemented with programmable logic devices (PLD), for example those manufactured by Altera Corp.&lt;ref name="Altera"/&gt; Altera provides both digital components and advanced design tools for using and programming the components.

Early multibit PLLs used a [[microprocessor]], a [[microcontroller]] or DSP to close the loop in a smart implementation.&lt;ref name="patent1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patent2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patent3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patent4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patent5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patent6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patent7"/&gt;

===Benefits===
A multibit PLL offers fine frequency resolution and fast frequency hopping, together with lower phase noise and lower power consumption.
It thus enhances the overall performance envelope of the PLL.

The loop bandwidth can be optimized for phase noise performance and/or frequency settling speed; it depends less on the frequency resolution.

Improving the PLL performance can make better use of the [[frequency spectrum]] and reduce transmit power. And indeed, PLL performance is being constantly improved.&lt;ref name="Zuta"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3285">In [[superconductivity]], a '''Pearl vortex''' is a vortex of supercurrent in a thin film of [[type-II superconductor]], first described in 1964 by [[Judea Pearl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearl|first=Judea|title=Current distribution in superconducting films carrying quantized fluxoids|journal=Applied Physics Letters|year=1964|volume=5|issue=4|doi=10.1063/1.1754056|pages=65|bibcode = 1964ApPhL...5...65P }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pearl vortex is similar to [[Abrikosov vortex]] except for its magnetic field profile which, due to the dominant air-metal interface, diverges sharply as 1/&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; at short distances from the center, and decays slowly, like 1/&lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt; at long distances. Abrikosov's vortices, in comparison, have very short range interaction and diverge as &lt;math&gt;\log(1/r)&lt;/math&gt; near the center.

A transport current flowing through a superconducting film may cause these vortices to move with a constant velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; proportional to, and perpendicular to the transport current. Because of their proximity to the surface, and their sharp field divergence at their centers, Pearl's vortices
can actually be seen by a [[scanning SQUID microscope]].&lt;ref name=tafuri-etal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tafuri|first=F. |author2=J.R. Kirtley |author3=P.G. Medaglia |author4=P. Orgiani |author5=G.

The characteristic length governing the distribution of the magnetic field around the vortex center is given by the ratio &lt;math&gt;\Lambda = 2 \lambda^2&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, also known as "Pearl length," where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the film thickness and
&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is [[London penetration depth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clem|first=John R.|title=Josephson junctions in thin and narrow rectangular superconducting strips|journal=Physical Review B|year=2010|volume=81|page=144515|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.81.144515|arxiv=1003.0839|bibcode = 2010PhRvB..81n4515C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because this ratio can reach macroscopic dimensions (~1 mm) by making the film sufficiently thin, it can
be measured relatively easy and used to estimate the density of superconducting electrons.&lt;ref name=bert-etal&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At distances shorter than the Pearl's length, vortices behave like a Coulomb gas (1/&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; repulsive force).

{{Certainty}}
The '''problem of induction''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] question of whether [[inductive reasoning]] leads to [[knowledge]] understood in the [[Justified true belief|classic philosophical sense]],&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, John, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#CanIndJus "Can induction be justified?"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the apparent lack of justification for:

# Generalizing about the properties of a class of objects based on some number of observations of particular instances of that class (e.g., the inference that "all swans we have seen are white, and, therefore, all swans are white", before the discovery of [[black swan]]s) or
# Presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past (e.g., that the [[laws of physics]] will hold as they have always been observed to hold). Hume called this the principle of [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Hume |title=''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9662/pg9662.txt |work=Gutenberg Press }}#9662: Most recently updated in 16 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem calls into question all [[empirical]] claims made in everyday life or through the [[scientific method]], and, for that reason, the philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] said that "induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy." Although the problem arguably dates back to the [[Pyrrhonism]] of [[ancient philosophy]], as well as the [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]] school of [[Indian philosophy]], [[David Hume]] popularized it in the mid-18th century.

== Formulation of the problem ==
[[File:Buck Creek IN - sunrise.jpg|thumb|Usually inferred from repeated observations: ''"The sun always rises in the east"''.]]
[[File:Vainaja kannethaan.jpg|thumb|Usually not inferred from repeated observations: ''"If someone dies, it's never me"''.]]
In [[inductive reasoning]], one makes a series of observations and [[inference|infers]] a new claim based on them. For instance, from a series of observations that a woman walks her dog by the market at 8am on Monday, it seems valid to infer that next Monday she will do the same, or that, in general, the woman walks her dog by the market every Monday. That next Monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations, it does not prove she will walk by the market every Monday. First of all, it is not certain, regardless of the number of observations, that the woman always walks by the market at 8am on Monday. In fact, [[David Hume]] would even argue that we cannot claim it is "more probable", since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future.

Second, the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning, except inductively. [[Bertrand Russell]] illustrated this point in ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'':

{{Cquote
| quote = Domestic animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.
| 2 = 
}}

In several publications it is presented as a story about a turkey, fed every morning without fail, who following the laws of induction concludes this will continue, but then his throat is cut on Thanksgiving Day.&lt;ref&gt;This story is found in Alan Chalmers, ''What is this thing Called Science'', Open University Press, Milton Keynes, 1982, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient and early modern origins===
[[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] skeptic [[Sextus Empiricus]] first questioned the validity of inductive reasoning, positing that a universal rule could not be established from an incomplete set of particular instances. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, since the particulars are infinite and indefinite.}}

The focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from Hume's focus upon the [[circular reasoning]] of induction. However, Weintraub claims in [[The Philosophical Quarterly]]&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, R. (1995). What was Hume's Contribution to the Problem of Induction? The Philosophical Quarterly 45(181):460-470&lt;/ref&gt; that although Sextus's approach to the problem appears different, Hume's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by Sextus:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Against the Logicians'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1935), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Those who claim for themselves to judge the truth are bound to possess a criterion of truth. This criterion, then, either is without a judge's approval or has been approved. But if it is without approval, whence comes it that it is truthworthy? For no matter of dispute is to be trusted without judging. And, if it has been approved, that which approves it, in turn, either has been approved or has not been approved, and so on ''ad infinitum''.}}

Although the [[regress argument|criterion argument]] applies to both deduction and induction, Weintraub believes that Sextus's argument "is precisely the strategy Hume invokes against induction: it cannot be justified, because the purported justification, being inductive, is circular." She concludes that "Hume's most important legacy is the supposition that the justification of induction is not analogous to that of deduction." She ends with a discussion of Hume's implicit sanction of the validity of deduction, which Hume describes as intuitive in a manner analogous to modern [[foundationalism]].

The [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]], a materialist and skeptic school of Indian philosophy, used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge. They held that since inference needed an invariable connection between the middle term and the predicate, and further, that since there was no way to establish this invariable connection, that the efficacy of inference as a means of valid knowledge could never be stated.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy Vol I, pg 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Dasgupta - A history of Indian philosophy, Vol III. pg 533&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th century Indian skeptic, [[Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa|Jayarasi Bhatta]], also made an attack on inference, along with all means of knowledge, and showed by a type of reductio argument that there was no way to conclude universal relations from the observation of particular instances.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Balcerowicz, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jayaraasi/ "Jayarāśi"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli, 1987, Perception, Knowledge and Disbelief: A Study of Jayarāśi's Scepticism&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval writers such as [[al-Ghazali]] and [[William of Ockham]] connected the problem with God's absolute power, asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when God could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, J. (2001), ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 232-3, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duns Scotus]] however argued that inductive inference from a finite number of particulars to a universal generalization was justified by "a proposition reposing in the soul, 'Whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that cause.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;''Duns Scotus: Philosophical Writings'', trans. A. Wolter (Edinburgh:, 1962), 109-10; Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 17th-century [[Jesuits]] argued that although God could create the end of the world at any moment, it was necessarily a rare event and hence our confidence that it would not happen very soon was largely justified.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 223-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Hume &lt;!--'Hume's scepticism about induction' and 'Hume's skepticism about induction' redirect here--&gt;===
Few philosophers are as associated with induction as [[David Hume]]. He described the problem in ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'', §4, based on his [[epistemology|epistemological]] framework. Here, "reason" refers to [[deductive reasoning]] and "induction" refers to [[inductive reasoning]].

First, Hume ponders the discovery of [[causality|causal relations]], which form the basis for what he refers to as "matters of fact". He argues that causal relations are found not by reason, but by induction. This is because for any cause, multiple effects are conceivable, and the actual effect cannot be determined by reasoning about the cause; instead, one must observe occurrences of the causal relation to discover that it holds. For example, when one thinks of "a billiard ball moving in a straight line toward another",&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; one can conceive that the first ball bounces back with the second ball remaining at rest, the first ball stops and the second ball moves, or the first ball jumps over the second, etc. There is no reason to conclude any of these possibilities over the others. Only through previous observation can it be predicted, inductively, what will actually happen with the balls. In general, it is not necessary that causal relation in the future resemble causal relations in the past, as it is always conceivable otherwise; for Hume, this is because the negation of the claim does not lead to a contradiction.

Next, Hume ponders the justification of induction. If all matters of fact are based on causal relations, and all causal relations are found by induction, then induction must be shown to be valid somehow. He uses the fact that induction assumes a valid connection between the proposition "I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect" and the proposition "I foresee that other objects which are in appearance similar will be attended with similar effects".&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.2.&lt;/ref&gt; One connects these two propositions not by reason, but by induction. This claim is supported by the same reasoning as that for causal relations above, and by the observation that even rationally inexperienced people can infer, for example, that touching fire causes pain. Hume challenges other philosophers to come up with a (deductive) reason for the connection. If a deductive justification for induction cannot be provided, then it appears that induction is based on an inductive assumption about the connection, which would be [[begging the question]]. Induction, itself, cannot validly explain the connection.

In this way, the problem of induction is not only concerned with the uncertainty of conclusions derived by induction, but doubts the very principle through which those uncertain conclusions are derived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#JusInd The Problem of Induction]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nelson Goodman's new riddle of induction===
{{main|New riddle of induction}}
[[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' presented a different description of the problem of induction in the chapter entitled "The New Riddle of Induction". Goodman proposed the new [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] "[[Grue and Bleen|grue]]". Something is grue if and only if it has been (or will be, according to a scientific, general hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson. ''Fact, Fiction, and Forecast'' (Fourth Edition). Harvard University Press, 1983, p.74, "will each confirm the general hypothesis that all emeralds are grue"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.mit.edu/~tchow/grue.html Goodman’s original definition of grue]&lt;/ref&gt;) observed to be green before a certain time ''t'', or blue if observed after that time. The "new" problem of induction is, since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue, why do we suppose that after time ''t'' we will find green but not grue emeralds? The problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions. In other words:

– Given the observations of a lot of green emeralds, someone using a common language will inductively infer that all emeralds are green (therefore, he will believe that any emerald he will ever find will be green, even after time ''t'').

– Given the same set of observations of green emeralds, someone using the predicate "grue" will inductively infer that all emeralds, which will be observed after ''t'', will be blue, despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far.

Goodman, however, points out that the predicate "grue" only appears more complex than the predicate "green" because we have defined grue in terms of blue and green. If we had always been brought up to think in terms of "grue" and "bleen" (where bleen is blue before time ''t'', or green thereafter), we would intuitively consider "green" to be a crazy and complicated predicate. Goodman believed that which scientific hypotheses we favour depend on which predicates are "entrenched" in our language.

[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] offers a practical solution to this problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Nicholas Rescher]]|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: Quine (1969), ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'', Ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; by making the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim that only predicates that identify a "[[natural kind]]" (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. [[Roy Bhaskar|R. Bhaskar]] also offers a practical solution to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the  possibility  of  a  reason for the predicate,  located  in  the  enduring  nature  of  something.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Realist Theory of Science|last=Bhaskar|first=Roy|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-45494-0|location=New York|pages=215–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green [[beryl]], made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless.

==Notable interpretations==

===Hume===
{{See also|David Hume#Induction_and_causation|l1=David Hume on the problem of induction}}
Although induction is not made by reason, Hume observes that we nonetheless perform it and improve from it. He proposes a descriptive explanation for the nature of induction in §5 of the ''Enquiry'', titled "Skeptical solution of these doubts". It is by custom or habit that one draws the inductive connection described above, and "without the influence of custom we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses."&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of custom is belief, which is instinctual and much stronger than imagination alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Stove and Donald Williams===
[[David Stove]]'s argument for induction, based on the [[statistical syllogism]], was presented in the ''Rationality of Induction'' and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late [[Donald Cary Williams]] (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book ''The Ground of Induction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Donald Cary Williams | title=The Ground of Induction | location=New York | publisher=Russell and Russell | year=1947 }}, {{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ |title=Donald Cary Williams |date=2015 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2017-03-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stove argued that it is a statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, as long as it is not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset "matches" the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or "representative" ones. So as long as you have no reason to think that your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.&lt;ref&gt;D. Stove, ''The Rationality of Induction'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biting the Bullett: Keith Campbell and Claudio Costa===
An intuitive answer to Hume would be to say that a world inacessible to any inductive procedure would simply not be conceivable. This intuition was taking into account by [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]] by considering that to be built a concept must be reapplied, what demands a certain continuity in its object of application and consequently some openness to induction &lt;ref&gt;"One form of Skepticism about Induction", in Richard Swinburne (ed.) ''The Justification of the Induction''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;. Recently, [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] has noted that a future can only be a future of its own past if it holds some identity with it. Moreover, the nearer a future is to the point of junction with its past, the greater are the similarities tendentially involved. Consequently - ''contra'' Hume - some form of principle of homogeneity (causal or structural) between future and past must be warranted, what would make some inductive procedure always possible.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa: ''Philosophical Semantics: Reintegrating Theoretical Philosophy'', Appendix to Ch.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Popper, the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question: it is asking how to justify theories given they cannot be justified by induction. Popper argued that justification is not needed at all, and seeking justification "begs for an authoritarian answer". Instead, Popper said, what should be done is to look to find and correct errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = [[Conjectures and Refutations]]
| author = [[Karl Popper]]
| year = 1963
| page = 25
| quote = I propose to replace ... the question of the sources of our knowledge by the entirely different question: 'How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?'
| isbn = 0-06-131376-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Popper regarded theories that have survived criticism as better corroborated in proportion to the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, in sharp contrast to the inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2018}}''Logic of Scientific Discovery'', section 43&lt;/ref&gt; Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).

[[Wesley C. Salmon]] criticizes Popper on the grounds that predictions need to be made both for practical purposes and in order to test theories. That means Popperians need to make a selection from the number of unfalsified theories available to them, which is generally more than one. Popperians would wish to choose well-corroborated theories, in their sense of corroboration, but face a dilemma: either they are making the essentially inductive claim that a theory's having survived criticism in the past means it will be a reliable predictor in the future; or Popperian corroboration is no indicator of predictive power at all, so  there is no rational motivation for their preferred selection principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Foundations of Scientific Inference
| author = [[Wesley C. Salmon]]
| year = 1967
| pages = 26
| accessdate = 27 December 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] has criticized this kind of criticism by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=David |title=Critical rationalism: A restatement and defense |date=1994 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power{{according to whom|date=October 2016}} is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a [[justificationism|justification]] for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bullemore, [https://www.academia.edu/4154895/Some_Remarks_on_the_Pragmatic_Problem_of_Induction "Some Remarks on the Pragmatic Problem of Induction"], Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Silence of the Songbirds''''' ({{ISBN|978-0-8027-1609-5}}) is a book by bird lover and scientist [[Bridget Stutchbury]] about the rapid decline and loss of many species of [[songbird]]s. Some major threats covered include [[pesticides]], sun-grown [[coffee]], city lights, [[cowbirds]], and [[global warming]]. The book was published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2007, and has 243 pages.

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' published a review of the book on June 1, 2007, and compared it to ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]].  Stutchbury describes the link between Latin American deforestation and the loss of food for migratory birds, and the impact of large amounts of pesticides. However, deforestation is minimal for [[shade-grown coffee]]. She mentions additional threats to songbirds: [[light pollution]], tall buildings, and [[wind farm]]s.  Despite the diminishing populations of songbirds in recent decades, she provides advice for their survival.

The '''Teushen''' or '''Tehues''' were an indigenous [[hunter-gatherer]] people of [[Patagonia]] in [[Argentina]]. They were considered "foot nomads", whose culture relied on hunting and gathering. &lt;ref&gt;Adelaar and Muysken 550&lt;/ref&gt; Their territory was between the [[Tehuelche people]] to the south and the [[Puelche people]] to their north. 

Before 1850, estimates claimed that there were 500 to 600 Teushen people.&lt;ref name=am555&gt;Adelaar and Muysken 554-5&lt;/ref&gt; They were slaughtered in the Argentinian [[genocide]]s of Patagonia, known as the [[Conquest of the Desert]]. By 1925, only ten to twelve Teushen survived. They are considered extinct as a tribe.&lt;ref name=am555/&gt;

The [[Teushen language]] is almost entirely unknown. Linguists believe, from the limited data available, that it was closest to [[Tehuelche language|Tehuelche]], the language of the people to the south of the Teushen.

:''This article is about a book on [[bioelectromagnetism]]. A book on [[Kirlian photography]] by [[Thelma Moss]] has a similar title.
'''''The Body Electric: Electromagnetism and the Foundation of Life''''' is a book by [[Robert O. Becker]] and Gary Selden in which Becker, an orthopedic surgeon at [[State University of New York Upstate Medical University|SUNY Upstate]] working for the [[Veterans Administration]], described his research into "our bioelectric selves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Howe | first=LM | title=British Cell Phone Safety Alert and An Interview with Robert O. Becker, M. D. | publisher=Council on Wireless Technology Impacts | date=2000-05-15 | url=http://www.wirelessimpacts.org/science/becker.html | accessdate=2012-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The book was first published by [[William Morrow and Company]] in 1985.

==Overview==
{{Fringe theories|section|date=May 2012|reason=This section uncritically paraphrases the beliefs of Becker.}}
The first part of the book discusses [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], primarily in [[salamander]]s and [[frog]]s. Becker studied regeneration after [[lesion]]s such as limb [[amputation]], and  hypothesized that [[electric field]]s played an important role in controlling the regeneration process. He  mapped the [[electric potential]]s at various body parts during the regeneration, showing that the central part of the body normally was positive, and the limbs were negative. When a limb of a salamander or frog was amputated, the voltage at the cut (measured relative to the central part of the body) changed from about -10 mV ([[millivolt]]s) to +20 mV or more the next day—a phenomenon called ''the [[current of injury]]''. In a frog, the voltage would simply change to the normal negative level in four weeks or so, and no limb regeneration would take place. In a salamander, however, the voltage would during the first two weeks change from the +20 mV to -30 mV, and then normalize (to -10 mV) during the next two weeks—and the limb would be regenerated.

Becker then found that regeneration could be improved by applying electricity at the wound  when there was a negative potential outside the amputation stub. He also found  that bone has [[piezoelectric]] properties which would cause an application of force to generate a healing current, which stimulated growth at stress locations in accordance with [[Wolff's law]].

In another part of the book Becker described potentials and [[magnetic field]]s in the nervous system, taking into account external influences like [[Earth's magnetic field|earth magnetism]] and [[solar wind]]s.  He measured the electrical properties along the skin surface, and concluded that at least the major parts of the [[acupuncture]] charts had an objective basis in reality. 

In the last chapters of the book, Becker recounts his experiences as a member of an expert committee evaluating the physiological hazards of various [[electromagnetic pollution]]s.  He presents research data which indicate that the deleterious effects are stronger than officially assumed.  His contention is that the experts choosing the [[pollution limits]] are strongly influenced by the polluting industry.

In 1998 Becker filed a patent for an [[iontopheretic]] system for stimulation of [[tissue healing]] and [[Regeneration in humans|regeneration]] (US 5814094 A).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/patents/US5814094&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book is a reference to the fiction anthology [[I Sing the Body Electric (short story collection)|I Sing the Body Electric]] by [[Ray Bradbury]], itself a reference to the [[I Sing the Body Electric (poem)|poem]] of the same name by [[Walt Whitman]].

==Response==
''[[Library Journal]]'' called it "a highly informative book ... for educated lay readers".&lt;ref&gt;Reiser F, Fletcher J, Fialkoff F, Schwarzer A, Sutton J, Cameron J. The Body Electric (Book). ''Library Journal'' [serial online]. February 15, 1985;110(3):174. Available from: Academic Search Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed May 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However ''Kirkus'' complained that "speculative and heated" conclusions "vitiate much of the interesting, well-documented material".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/breyten-breytenbach-3/the-body-electric-electromagnetism-and-the-foun/ "THE BODY ELECTRIC: Electromagnetism and the Foundation of Life"], ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', 1984&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sciences]]'' found that it was superficially well-told but with basic scientific errors and showing a lack of knowledge about recent biology.&lt;ref name="Adey"&gt;{{cite journal | title=THE ENERGY AROUND US | author={{Interlanguage link multi|W.

These commonly used descriptive terms do not necessarily use the official or current names for features; and often these concepts of places don't have clear, rigid boundaries. For example, sometimes the same name may refer to more than one feature, and sometimes people in a locality use more than one name for the same feature. When people refer to geographical regions in a vernacular form they are commonly referred to as imprecise regions. Regions can include large areas of a country such as the American Midwest, the British Midlands, the Swiss Alps, the south east of England and southern California; or smaller areas such as Silicon Valley in northern California. Commonly used descriptions of areas of cities such as a city's downtown district, New York's Upper East Side, London's square mile or the Latin Quarter of Paris can also be viewed as imprecise regions.

==Vernacular region==
Beyond "vernacular geography," a "vernacular region" is a distinctive area where the inhabitants collectively consider themselves interconnected by a shared history, mutual interests, and a common identity. Such regions are "intellectual inventions" and a form of shorthand to identify things, people, and places. Vernacular regions reflect a "sense of place," but rarely coincide with established jurisdictional borders.&lt;ref name="Scheetz"&gt;[Scheetz, George H.] "Whence Siouxland?" ''Book Remarks'' [Sioux City Public Library], May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of vernacular regions in the United States include Tidewater, also known as [[Hampton Roads]], [[Siouxland]], and the [[Tri-Cities, Illinois|Tri-City area]] of Batavia, Geneva, and St. Charles, Illinois. Another can be the American South, since it can be non-officially considered as the confederate states of the U.S. Civil war, where the climate is warm and has limited snow, or by being below a certain latitude.

==Research==
The [[World Wide Web]] is a major source of geographical information submitted by non-specialists. The British [[Ordnance Survey]] is sponsoring research at the Universities of Cardiff and Sheffield,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the aim of which is to study the use of vernacular geography, and to investigate how information mined from the Web can be used to generate an approximate spatial boundary for an imprecise region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/4512/1/CEUS2006.pdf|title=Geo-tagging for imprecise regions of different sizes|author=Pasley, R.C., Clough, P. and Sanderson, M.|year=2007|work=Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Geographical Information Retrieval. Workshop On Geographic Information Retrieval, November 09, 2007, Lisbon, Portugal.|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The existing technology for accessing geographical data is not well adapted to the unstructured, largely text-based resources of the Web. Spatial information on the Web can be categorized geographically according to the textual content, but a major problem for GIS developers wanting to use this resource is the vague and imprecise nature of place names that are commonly employed within web documents.

In pursuit of delineating vernacular regions, trigger phrases are used by the researchers to capture regular linguistic patterns, which identify relationships between geographic locations. For example, the trigger phrase ''“X is located in Y”'' can be ''"Birmingham is located in *"'' or ''"* is located in Birmingham"''. The completed trigger phrase is then submitted to a search engine. For each search, up to 100 results are retrieved. Duplicate results are then removed based on the URL, and snippet text and the search result is used to find candidate region members.

From these results, geo-references are extracted and assigned spatial coordinates. A bounding box is then applied and the bounding box is used to find coordinates of other regions and points, apparently lying outside the candidate region. Thus it is possible to compute a boundary for the imprecise region using the points inside and outside.

Cardiff University launched a web questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; together with mapping tools to capture people's perception of Vernacular Geography in Great Britain.
