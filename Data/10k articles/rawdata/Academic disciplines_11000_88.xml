      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8869">In [[Thread (computer science)|multithreaded]] [[computer science|computing]], the '''ABA problem''' occurs during synchronization, when a location is read twice, has the same value for both reads, and "value is the same" is used to indicate "nothing has changed".  However, another thread can execute between the two reads and change the value, do other work, then change the value back, thus fooling the first thread into thinking "nothing has changed" even though the second thread did work that violates that assumption.

The ABA problem occurs when multiple [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] (or [[Process (computing)|processes]]) accessing shared data interleave.  Below is the sequence of events that will result in the ABA problem:
* Process &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; reads value A from shared memory,
* &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is [[Preemption (computing)|preempted]], allowing process &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; to run,
* &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; modifies the shared memory value A to value B and back to A before preemption,
* &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; begins execution again, sees that the shared memory value has not changed and continues.

Although &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; can continue executing, it is possible that the behavior will not be correct due to the "hidden" modification in shared memory.

A common case of the ABA problem is encountered when implementing a [[lock-free]] data structure.  If an item is removed from the list, deleted, and then a new item is allocated and added to the list, it is common for the allocated object to be at the same location as the deleted object due to optimization.  A pointer to the new item is thus sometimes equal to a pointer to the old item which is an ABA problem.

== Examples ==

Consider a software example of ABA using a [[lock-free]] [[Stack (data structure)|stack]]:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
  /* Naive lock-free stack which suffers from ABA problem.*/
  class Stack {
    std::atomic&lt;Obj*&gt; top_ptr;
    //
    // Pops the top object and returns a pointer to it.
    //
    Obj* Pop() {
      while(1) {
        Obj* ret_ptr = top_ptr;
        if (!ret_ptr) return nullptr;
        // For simplicity, suppose that we can ensure that this dereference is safe
        // (i.e., that no other thread has popped the stack in the meantime).
        Obj* next_ptr = ret_ptr-&gt;next;
        // If the top node is still ret, then assume no one has changed the stack.
        // (That statement is not always true because of the ABA problem)
        // Atomically replace top with next.
        if (top_ptr.compare_exchange_weak(ret_ptr, next_ptr)) {
          return ret_ptr;
        }
        // The stack has changed, start over.
      }
    }
    //
    // Pushes the object specified by obj_ptr to stack.
    //
    void Push(Obj* obj_ptr) {
      while(1) {
        Obj* next_ptr = top_ptr;
        obj_ptr-&gt;next = next_ptr;
        // If the top node is still next, then assume no one has changed the stack.
        // (That statement is not always true because of the ABA problem)
        // Atomically replace top with obj.
        if (top_ptr.compare_exchange_weak(next_ptr, obj_ptr)) {
          return;
        }
        // The stack has changed, start over.
      }
    }
  };
&lt;/source&gt;

This code can normally prevent problems from concurrent access, but suffers from ABA problems.  Consider the following sequence:

Stack initially contains ''top'' → A → B → C

Thread 1 starts running pop:
  ret = A;
  next = B;
Thread 1 gets interrupted just before the &lt;tt&gt;compare_exchange_weak&lt;/tt&gt;...

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
  { // Thread 2 runs pop:
    ret = A;
    next = B;
    compare_exchange_weak(A, B)  // Success, top = B
    return A;
  } // Now the stack is top → B → C
  { // Thread 2 runs pop again:
    ret = B;
    next = C;
    compare_exchange_weak(B, C)  // Success, top = C
    return B;
  } // Now the stack is top → C
  delete B;
  { // Thread 2 now pushes A back onto the stack:
    A-&gt;next = C;
    compare_exchange_weak(C, A)  // Success, top = A
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now the stack is ''top'' → A → C

When Thread 1 resumes:
  compare_exchange_weak(A, B)

This instruction succeeds because it finds ''top'' == ret (both are A), so it sets top to next (which is B).  As B has been deleted the program will access freed memory when it tries to look at the first element on the stack. In C++, as shown here, accessing freed memory is [[undefined behavior]]: this may result in crashes, data corruption or even just silently appear to work correctly. ABA bugs such as this can be difficult to debug.

== Workarounds ==

=== Tagged state reference ===
A common workaround is to add extra "tag" or "stamp" bits to the quantity being considered. For example, an algorithm using [[compare and swap]] on a pointer might use the low bits of the address to indicate how many times the pointer has been successfully modified. Because of this, the next compare-and-swap will fail, even if the addresses are the same, because the tag bits will not match. This is sometimes called ABAʹ since the second A is made slightly different from the first. Such tagged state references are also used in [[transactional memory]].

If "tag" field wraps around, guarantees against ABA do not stand anymore. However, it has been observed that on currently existing CPUs, and using 60-bit tags, no wraparound is possible as long as the program lifetime (that is, without restarting the program) is limited to 10 years; in addition, it was argued that for practical purposes it is usually sufficient to have 40-48 bits of tag to guarantee against wrapping around. As modern CPUs (in particular, all modern x64 CPUs) tend to support 128-bit CAS operations, in certain use cases it allows to provide firm guarantees against ABA when using tagging. &lt;ref&gt;'No Bugs' Hare, [http://ithare.com/cas-reactor-for-non-blocking-multithreaded-primitives/ CAS (Re)Actor for Non-Blocking Multithreaded Primitives], Overload #142&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate nodes ===
A correct but expensive approach is to use intermediate nodes that are not data elements and thus assure invariants as elements are inserted and removed [Valois].

=== Deferred reclamation ===
Another approach is to defer reclamation of removed data elements.  One way to defer reclamation is to run the algorithm in an environment featuring an [[Garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collector]]; a problem here however is that if the GC is not lock-free, then the overall system is not lock-free, even though the data structure itself is.

Another way to defer reclamation is to use one or more [[hazard pointer]]s, which are pointers to locations that otherwise cannot appear in the list.  Each hazard pointer represents an intermediate state of an in-progress change; the presence of the pointer assures further synchronization [Doug Lea].  Hazard pointers are lock-free, but can only track at most two elements for being in-use.

Yet another way to defer reclamation is to use [[Read-copy-update|read-copy update (RCU)]], which involves enclosing the update in an RCU read-side critical section and then waiting for an RCU grace period before freeing any removed data elements.  Using RCU in this way guarantees that any data element removed cannot reappear until all currently executing operations have completed.  RCU is lock-free, but isn't suitable for all workloads.

Some architectures provide "larger" atomic operations such that, as example, both forward and backward links in a doubly linked list can be updated atomically; while this feature is architecture-dependent, it, in particular, is available for x86/x64 architectures (x86 allows for 64-bit CAS, and all modern x64 CPUs allow for 128-bit CAS) and IBM's [[z/Architecture]] (which allows for up to 128-bit CAS). 

Some architectures provide a [[Load-Link/Store-Conditional|load linked, store conditional]] instruction in which the store is performed only when there are no other stores of the indicated location.  This effectively separates the notion of "storage contains value" from "storage has been changed".  Examples include DEC Alpha, MIPS, PowerPC and ARM (v6 and later).

'''American anthropology''' has [[culture]] as its central and unifying concept. This most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human [[experience]]s [[symbol]]ically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially. American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture:

# [[biological anthropology]]
# [[linguistic anthropology]]
# [[cultural anthropology]]
# [[archaeology]]

Research in these fields has influenced anthropologists working in other countries to different degrees.

== Biological anthropology ==

{{synthesis|date=May 2013}}
Discussion concerning culture among [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] centers around two debates. First, is culture uniquely human or shared by other species (most notably, other primates)? This is an important question, as the theory of [[evolution]] holds that humans are descended from (now extinct) non-human primates. Second, how did culture evolve among human beings?

Gerald Weiss noted that although Tylor's classic definition of culture was restricted to humans, many anthropologists take this for granted and thus elide that important qualification from later definitions, merely equating culture with any learned behavior. This slippage is a problem because during the formative years of modern primatology, some primatologists were trained in anthropology (and understood that culture refers to learned behavior among humans), and others were not. Notable non-anthropologists, like [[Robert Yerkes]] and [[Jane Goodall]] thus argued that since [[chimpanzee]]s have learned behaviors, they have culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Yerkes 1943 ''Chimpanzees: A Laboratory Colony''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]].  51–52, 189, 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Goodall 1963 "My Life Among Wild Chimpanzees" ''National Geographic'' 124: 308&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropological primatologists are divided, several arguing that non-human primates have culture, others arguing that they do not.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Andrew 1963 "Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture" Alan Bryan ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 301–303, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bryan 1963 "The Essential Morphological basis for Human Culture" ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keleman 1963 "Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture" Alan Bryan ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 301–303 p.304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in nonhuman primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 301–328&lt;/ref&gt;

This scientific debate is complicated by ethical concerns. The subjects of primatology are non-human primates, and whatever culture these primates have is threatened by human activity. After reviewing the research on primate culture, W. C. McGrew concluded, "[a] discipline requires subjects, and most species of nonhuman primates are endangered by their human cousins.  Ultimately, whatever its merit, cultural primatology must be committed to cultural survival [i.e. to the survival of primate cultures]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;W. C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in Nonhuman Primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 323&lt;/ref&gt;

McGrew suggests a definition of culture that he finds scientifically useful for studying primate culture. He points out that scientists do not have access to the subjective thoughts or knowledge of non-human primates. Thus, if culture is defined in terms of knowledge, then scientists are severely limited in their attempts to study primate culture. Instead of defining culture as a kind of knowledge, McGrew suggests that we view culture as a process. He lists six steps in the process:&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;
# A new pattern of behavior is invented, or an existing one is modified.
# The innovator transmits this pattern to another.
# The form of the pattern is consistent within and across performers, perhaps even in terms of recognizable stylistic features.
# The one who acquires the pattern retains the ability to perform it long after having acquired it.
# The pattern spreads across social units in a population. These social units may be families, clans, troops, or bands.
# The pattern endures across generations.
McGrew admits that all six criteria may be strict, given the difficulties in observing primate behavior in the wild. But he also insists on the need to be as inclusive as possible, on the need for a definition of culture that "casts the net widely":

{{quote|Culture is considered to be group-specific behavior that is acquired, at least in part, from social influences.  Here, group is considered to be the species-typical unit, whether it be a troop, lineage, subgroup, or so on.  ''Prima facie'' evidence of culture comes from within-species but across-group variation in behavior, as when a pattern is persistent in one community of chimpanzees but is absent from another, or when different communities perform different versions of the same pattern.  The suggestion of culture in action is stronger when the difference across the groups cannot be explained solely by ecological factors ....|&lt;ref&gt;W.C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in Nonhuman Primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 305&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Charles Frederick Voegelin pointed out, if "culture" is reduced to "learned behavior," then all animals have culture.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Voegelin 1951 "Culture, Language and the Human Organism" ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology'' 7: 370&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly all specialists agree that all [[Primate cognition|primate species evidence common cognitive skills]]: knowledge of object-permanence, cognitive mapping, the ability to categorize objects, and creative problem solving.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=511}} Moreover, all primate species show evidence of shared social skills: they recognize members of their social group; they form direct relationships based on degrees of kinship and rank; they recognize third-party social relationships; they predict future behavior; and they cooperate in problem-solving.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=511}}

[[File:Lucy blackbg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cast of the skeleton of Lucy, an ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'']]
[[File:Human evolution chart-en.svg|thumb|left|One current view of the temporal and geographical distribution of [[human|hominid]] populations]]
Nevertheless, the term "culture" applies to non-human animals only if we define culture as any or all learned behavior. Within mainstream physical anthropology, scholars tend to think that a more restrictive definition is necessary. These researchers are concerned with how human beings evolved to be different from other species. A more precise definition of culture, which excludes non-human social behavior, would allow physical anthropologists to study how humans evolved their unique capacity for "culture".

Chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'' and ''Pan paniscus'') are humans' (''Homo sapiens'') closest living relatives; both are descended from a common ancestor which lived around seven million years ago. [[Timeline of human evolution#Hominidae|Human evolution]] has been rapid with modern humans appearing about 340,000 years ago. During this time humanity evolved three distinctive features:
:(a) the creation and use of conventional symbols, including linguistic symbols and their derivatives, such as written language and mathematical symbols and notations; (b) the creation and use of complex tools and other instrumental technologies; and (c) the creation and participation in complex social organization and institutions.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=510}} According to [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Michael Tomasello]], "where these complex and species-unique behavioral practices, and the cognitive skills that underlie them, came from" is a fundamental anthropological question. Given that contemporary humans and chimpanzees are far more different from horses and zebras, or rats and mice, and that the evolution of this great difference occurred in such a short period of time, "our search must be for some small difference that made a big difference&amp;nbsp;– some adaptation, or small set of adaptations, that changed the process of primate cognitive evolution in fundamental ways."  According to Tomasello, the answer to this question must form the basis of a scientific definition of "human culture."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=510}}

In a recent review of the major research on human and primate tool-use, communication, and learning strategies, Tomasello argues that the key human advances over primates (language, complex technologies, and complex social organization) are all the results of humans pooling cognitive resources. This is called "the [[ratchet effect]]:" innovations spread and are shared by a group, and mastered "by youngsters, which enables them to remain in their new and improved form within the group until something better comes along." The key point is that children are born good at a particular kind of social learning; this creates a favored environment for social innovations, making them more likely to be maintained and transmitted to new generations than individual innovations.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=512}} For Tomasello, human social learning—the kind of learning that distinguishes humans from other primates and that played a decisive role in human evolution—is based on two elements: first, what he calls "imitative learning," (as opposed to "[[Emulation (observational learning)|emulative learning]]" characteristic of other primates) and second,  the fact that humans represent their experiences symbolically (rather than iconically, as is characteristic of other primates).  Together, these elements enable humans to be both inventive, and to preserve useful inventions. It is this combination that produces the ratchet effect.

The kind of learning found among other primates is "emulation learning," which "focuses on the environmental events involved&amp;nbsp;– results or changes of state in the environment that the other produced&amp;nbsp;– rather than on the actions that produced those results."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=520}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Michael Tomasello 1990 "Cultural Transmission in the Tool Use and Communicatory Signaling of Chimpanzees?" in ''"Language" and Intelligence in Monkeys and Apes: Comparative Developmental Perspectives'' ed. S. Parker, K. Bibson. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 274–311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello 1996 "Do Apes Ape?" in ''Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture'' ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press, pp. 319–346&lt;/ref&gt;  Tomasello emphasizes that emulation learning is a highly adaptive strategy for apes because it focuses on the effects of an act. In laboratory experiments, chimpanzees were shown two different ways for using a rake-like tool to obtain an out-of-reach-object. Both methods were effective, but one was more efficient than the other. Chimpanzees consistently emulated the more efficient method.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Nagell, K., Olguin, K. and Tomasello, M. 1993 "Processes of social learning in the tool use of chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') and human children (''Homo sapiens'')" in ''Journal of Comparative Psychology'' 107: 174–186&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of emulation learning are well documented among primates.  Notable examples include Japanese [[macaque]] potato washing, chimpanzee tool use, and chimpanzee gestural communication. In 1953, an 18-month-old female macaque monkey was observed taking sandy pieces of sweet potato (given to the monkeys by observers) to a stream (and later, to the ocean) to wash off the sand. After three months, the same behavior was observed in her mother and two playmates, and then the playmates' mothers. Over the next two years seven other young macaques were observed washing their potatoes, and by the end of the third year 40% of the troop had adopted the practice.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kawamura 1959 "The process of subcultural propagation among Japanese macaques" ''Primates'' 2: 43–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;M. Kawai 1965 "Newly acquired pre-cultural behavior of the natural troop of Japanese monkeys on Koshima Islet" ''Primates'' 6: 1–30&lt;/ref&gt; Although this story is popularly represented as a straightforward example of human-like learning, evidence suggests that it is not. Many monkeys naturally brush sand off food; this behavior had been observed in the macaque troop prior to the first observed washing. Moreover, potato washing was observed in four other separate macaque troops, suggesting that at least four other individual monkeys had learned to wash off sand on their own.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other monkey species in captivity quickly learn to wash off their food.&lt;ref&gt;E. Visalberghi and D. M. Fragaszy 1990 "Food washing behavior in tufted Capuchin monkeys, ''Cebusapella'', and crabeating macaques, ''Macaca fasciculais''" ''Animal Behavior'' 40: 829–836&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the spread of learning among the Japanese macaques was fairly slow, and the rate at which new members of the troop learned did not keep pace with the growth of the troop. If the form of learning were imitation, the rate of learning should have been exponential. It is more likely that the monkeys' washing behavior is based on the common behavior of cleaning off food, and that monkeys that spent time by the water independently learned to wash, rather than wipe their food. This explains both why those monkeys that kept company with the original washer, and who thus spent a good deal of time by the water, also figured out how to wash their potatoes. It also explains why the rate at which this behavior spread was slow.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=519}}

Chimpanzees exhibit a variety of population-specific tool use: termite-fishing, ant-fishing, ant-dipping, nut-cracking, and leaf-sponging. Gombe Chimpanzees fish for termites using small, thin sticks, but chimpanzees in Western Africa use large sticks to break holes in mounds and use their hands to scoop up termites.  Some of this variation may be the result of "environmental shaping" (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, and know how to eat insects.  When children see their mothers rolling over logs to eat the insects beneath, they quickly learn to do the same. In other words, this form of learning builds on activities the children already know.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello 1996 "Do Apes Ape?" in ''Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture'' ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press. pp: 319–346&lt;/ref&gt;

The kind of learning characteristic of human children is [[imitative learning]], which "means reproducing an instrumental act understood intentionally."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=512}} Human infants begin to display some evidence of this form of learning between the ages of nine and 12 months, when infants fix their attention not only on an object, but on the gaze of an adult which enables them to use adults as points of reference and thus "act on objects in the way adults are acting on them."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=513}} This dynamic is well documented and has also been termed "joint engagement" or "joint attention."&lt;ref&gt;R. Bakerman and L. Adamson 1984 "Coordinating attention to people and objects in mother-infant and peer-infant interaction" in ''Child Development'' 55: 1278–1289&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Moore and P. Dunham 1995 ''Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to this dynamic is the infant's growing capacity to recognize others as "intentional agents:" people "with the power to control their spontaneous behavior" and who "have goals and make active choices among behavioral means for attaining those goals."&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello 1995 "Joint attention as social cognition" in ''Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development,'' ed. C. Moore and P. Dunham.  Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Press, pp. 103–130&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of skills in joint attention by the end of a human child's first year of life provides the basis for the development of imitative learning in the second year. In one study 14-month-old children imitated an adult's over-complex method of turning on a light, even when they could have used an easier and more natural motion to the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;W. C. Meltzoff 1988 "Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli" in ''Developmental Psychology'' 24: 470–476&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, 16-month-old children interacted with adults who alternated between a complex series of motions that appeared intentional and a comparable set of motions that appeared accidental; they imitated only those motions that appeared intentional.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carpenter, N. Akhtar, M. Tomasello 1998 "Sixteen-month old infants differentially imitate intentional and accidental actions" in ''Infant Behavior &amp; Development'' 21: 315–330&lt;/ref&gt; Another study of 18-month old children revealed that children imitate actions that adults intend, yet in some way fail, to perform.&lt;ref&gt;A. Meltzoff 1995 "Understanding the intentions of others: re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children" in ''Developmental Psychology'' 31: 838–850&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomasello emphasizes that this kind of imitative learning "relies fundamentally on infants' tendency to identify with adults, and on their ability to distinguish in the actions of others the underlying goal and the different means that might be used to achieve it."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=514}} He calls this kind of imitative learning "cultural learning because the child is not just learning about things from other persons, she is also learning things through them&amp;nbsp;— in the sense that she must know something of the adult's perspective on a situation to learn the active use of this same intentional act."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=515}}&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M., Kruger, A. &amp; Ratner, H. 1993 "Cultural learning" ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'' 16, 495–552&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that the key feature of cultural learning is that it occurs only when an individual "understands others as intentional agents, like the self, who have a perspective on the world that can be followed into, directed and shared."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=516}}

Emulation learning and imitative learning are two different adaptations that can only be assessed in their larger environmental and evolutionary contexts. In one experiment, chimpanzees and two-year-old children were separately presented with a rake-like-tool and an out-of-reach object.  Adult humans then demonstrated two different ways to use the tool, one more efficient, one less efficient. Chimpanzees used the same efficient method following both demonstrations, regardless of what was demonstrated. Most of the human children, however, imitated whichever method the adult was demonstrating. If the chimps and humans were to be compared on the basis of these results, one might think that chimpanzees are more intelligent. From an [[evolution]]ary perspective they are equally intelligent, but with different kinds of intelligence adapted to different environments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Chimpanzee learning strategies are well-suited to a stable physical environment that requires little social cooperation (compared to humans). Human learning strategies are well-suited to a more complex social environment in which understanding the intentions of others may be more important than success at a specific task.  Tomasello argues that this strategy has made possible the "ratchet effect" that enabled humans to evolve complex social systems that have enabled humans to adapt to virtually every physical environment on the surface of the earth.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|pp=520–521}}

Tomasello further argues that cultural learning is essential for language-acquisition. Most children in any society, and all children in some, do not learn all words through the direct efforts of adults. "In general, for the vast majority of words in their language, children must find a way to learn in the ongoing flow of social interaction, sometimes from speech not even addressed to them."&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This finding has been confirmed by a variety of experiments in which children learned words even when the referent was not present, multiple referents were possible, and the adult was not directly trying to teach the word to the child.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello and M. Barton 1994 "Learning Words in non-Ostensive Contexts" ''Developmental Psychology'' 30: 639–650&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Akhtar and M. Tomasello 1996 "Twenty-four month old children learn words for absent objects and actions" in ''British Journal of Developmental Psychology'' 14: 79–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello, R. Strosberg, N. Akhtar 1996 "Eighteen-month old children learn words in non-ostensive contexts" in ''Journal of Child Language''; 23: 157–176&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasello concludes that "a linguistic symbol is nothing other than a marker for an intersubjectively shared understanding of a situation."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=516}}

Tomasello's 1999 review of the research contrasting human and non-human primate learning strategies confirms [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Ralph Holloway]]'s 1969 argument that a specific kind of sociality linked to symbolic cognition were the keys to human evolution, and constitute the nature of culture. According to Holloway, the key issue in the evolution of ''H. sapiens'', and the key to understanding "culture," "is how man organizes his experience." Culture is "the ''imposition of arbitrary form upon the environment.''"{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=395}} This fact, Holloway argued, is primary to and explains what is distinctive about human learning strategies, tool-use, and language. Human tool-making and language express "similar, if not identical, cognitive processes" and provide important evidence for how humankind evolved.{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=396}}

In other words, whereas McGrew argues that anthropologists must focus on behaviors like communication and tool-use because they have no access to the mind, Holloway argues that human language and tool-use, including the earliest [[stone tool]]s in the fossil record 2.6 million years ago, are highly suggestive of cognitive differences between humans and non-humans, and that such cognitive differences in turn explain human evolution. For Holloway, the question is not ''whether'' other primates communicate, learn or make tools, but the ''way'' they do these things. "Washing potatoes in the ocean ... stripping branches of leaves to get termites," and other examples of primate tool-use and learning "are iconic, and there is no feedback from the environment to the animal."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=400}} Human tools, however, express an independence from natural form that manifests symbolic thinking. "In the preparation of the stick for termite-eating, the relation between product and raw material is iconic.  In the making of a stone tool, in contrast, there is no necessary relation between the form of the final product and the original material."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=401}}

In Holloway's view, our non-human ancestors, like those of modern chimpanzees and other primates, shared motor and sensory skills, curiosity, memory, and intelligence, with perhaps differences in degree. He adds: "It is when these are integrated with the unique attributes of arbitrary production (symbolization) and imposition that man qua cultural man appears."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=399}}

He also adds:

{{quote|I have suggested above that whatever culture may be, it includes "the imposition of arbitrary forms upon the environment."  This phrase has two components. One is a recognition that the relationship between the coding process and the phenomenon (be it a tool, social network, or abstract principle) is non-iconic. The other is an idea of man as a creature who can make delusional systems work—who imposes his fantasies, his non-iconic constructs (and constructions), upon the environment.  The altered environment shapes his perceptions, and these are again forced back on the environment, are incorporated into the environment, and press for further adaptation.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=395}}}}

This is comparable to the "ratcheting" aspect suggested by Tomasello and others that enabled human evolution to accelerate. Holloway concludes that the first instance of symbolic thought among humans provided a "kick-start" for brain development, tool complexity, social structure, and language to evolve through a constant dynamic of positive feedback. "This interaction between the propensity to structure the environment arbitrarily and the feedback from the environment to the organism is an emergent process, a process different in kind from anything that preceded it."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=399}}

Linguists [[Charles Hockett]] and R. Ascher have identified thirteen design-features of language, some shared by other forms of animal communication. One feature that distinguishes human language is its tremendous productivity; in other words, competent speakers of a language are capable of producing an exponential number of original utterances. This productivity seems to be made possible by a few critical features unique to human language. One is "duality of patterning," meaning that human language consists of the articulation of several distinct processes, each with its own set of rules: combining [[phonemes]] to produce [[morphemes]], combining [[morphemes]] to produce words, and combining words to produce sentences. This means that a person can master a relatively limited number of signals and sets of rules, to create infinite combinations.  Another crucial element is that human language is [[symbol]]ic: the sound of words (or their shape, when written) typically bear no relation to what they represent.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Hockett and R. Ascher 1964 "The Human Revolution" in ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 135–168.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, their meaning is arbitrary. That words have meaning is a matter of convention. Since the meaning of words are arbitrary, any word may have several meanings, and any object may be referred to using a variety of words; the actual word used to describe a particular object depends on the context, the intention of the speaker, and the ability of the listener to judge these appropriately.  As Tomasello notes,

{{quote|An individual language user looks at a tree and, before drawing the attention of her interlocutor to that tree, must decide, based on her assessment of the listener's current knowledge and expectations, whether to say "that tree over there," "it," "the oak," "that hundred-year-oak," "the tree," "the bagswing tree," "that thing in the front yard," "the ornament," "the embarrassment," or any of a number of other expressions.  ... And these decisions are not made on the basis of the speaker's direct goal with respect to the object or activity involved, but rather that they are made on the basis of her goal with respect to the listener's interest and attention to that object or activity. This is why symbolic cognition and communication and imitative learning go hand-in-hand.|{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=517}}}}

Holloway argues that the stone tools associated with genus ''Homo'' have the same features of human language:
{{quote|Returning to matter of syntax, rules, and concatenated activity mentioned above, almost any model which describes a language process can also be used to describe tool-making.  This is hardly surprising.  Both activities are concatenated, both have rigid rules about the serialization of unit activities (the grammar, syntax), both are hierarchical systems of activity (as is any motor activity), and both produce arbitrary configurations which thence become part of the environment, either temporarily or permanently.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=401}}}}

He also adds:

{{quote|Productivity can be seen in the facts that basic types were probably used for multiple purposes, that tool industries tend to expand with time, and that a slight variation on a basic pattern may be made to meet some new functional requisite. ''Elements of a basic "vocabulary" of motor operations—flakes, detachment, rotation, preparation of striking platform, etc.—are used in different combinations to produce dissimilar tools, with different forms, and supposedly, different uses''. . . . Taking each motor event alone, no one action is complete; each action depends on the prior one and requires a further one, and each is dependent on another ax on the original plan. In other words, at each point of the action except the last, the piece is not "satisfactory" in structure. Each unit action is meaningless by itself in the sense of the use of the tool; it is meaningful only in the context of the whole completed set of actions culminating in the final product. This exactly parallels language.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=402}}}}

As Tomasello demonstrates, symbolic thought can operate only in a particular social environment:

{{quote|Arbitrary symbols enforce consensus of perceptions, which not only allows members to communicate about the same objects in terms of space and time (as in hunting) but it also makes it possible for social relationships to be standardized and manipulated through symbols. It means that idiosyncrasies are smoothed out and perceived within classes of behavior. By enforcing perceptual invariance, symbols also enforce social behavioral constancy, and enforcing social behavioral constancy is a prerequisite to differential task-role sectors in a differentiated social group adapting not only to the outside environment but to its own membership.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=406}}}}

[[Biological anthropology|Biological anthropologist]] Terrence Deacon, in a synthesis of over twenty years of research on human evolution, human neurology, and primatology, describes this "ratcheting effect" as a form of "Baldwinian Evolution." Named after [[psychology|psychologist]] [[James Mark Baldwin|James Baldwin]], this describes a situation in which an animal's behavior has evolutionary consequences when it changes the natural environment and thus the selective forces acting on the animal.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=322}}

{{quote|Once some useful behavior spreads within a population and becomes more important for subsistence, it will generate selection pressures on genetic traits that support its propagation ... Stone and symbolic tools, which were initially acquired with the aid of flexible ape-learning abilities, ultimately turned the tables on their users and forced them to adapt to a new niche opened by these technologies.  Rather than being just useful tricks, these behavioral prostheses for obtaining food and organizing social behaviors became indispensable elements in a new adaptive complex.  The origin of "humanness" can be defined as that point in our evolution where these tools became the {{sic|?|principle}} source of selection on our bodies and brains.  It is the diagnostic of ''Homo symbolicus''.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=344}}}}

According to Deacon, this occurred between 2 and 2.5 million years ago, when we have the first fossil evidence of stone tool use and the beginning of a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause—and not the effect—of these trends.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=340}} More specifically, Deacon is suggesting that ''Australopithecines'', like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of ''Australopithecine'' history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that "it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species."{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=347}} This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the "ratchet effect") that led to their evolution to genus ''Homo''.

The question for Deacon is what behavioral-environmental changes could have made the development of symbolic thinking adaptive? Here he emphasizes the importance of distinguishing humans from all other species, not to privilege human intelligence but to problematize it. Given that the evolution of ''H. sapiens'' began with ancestors who did not yet have "culture," what led them to move away from cognitive, learning, communication, and tool-making strategies that were and continued to be adaptive for most other primates (and, some have suggested, most other species of animals)?  Learning symbol systems is more time consuming than other forms of communication, so symbolic thought made possible a different communication strategy, but not a more efficient one than other primates. Nevertheless, it must have offered some selective advantage to ''H. sapiens'' to have evolved. Deacon starts by looking at two key determinants in evolutionary history: foraging behavior, and patterns of sexual relations. As he observes competition for sexual access limits the possibilities for social cooperation in many species; yet, Deacon observes, there are three consistent patterns in human reproduction that distinguish them from other species:
# Both males and females usually contribute effort towards the rearing of their offspring, though often to differing extents and in very different ways.
# In all societies, the great majority of adult males and females are bound by long-term, exclusive sexual access rights and prohibitions to particular individuals of the opposite sex.
# They maintain these exclusive sexual relations while living in modest to large-sized, multi-male, multi-female, cooperative social groups.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=384–385}} 
Moreover, there is one feature common to all known human foraging societies (all humans prior to ten or fifteen thousand years ago), and markedly different from other primates: "the use of meat. . . . The appearance of the first stone tools nearly 2.5 million years ago almost certainly correlates with a radical shift in foraging behavior to gain access to meat."{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=386}} Deacon does not believe that symbolic thought was necessary for hunting or tool-making (although tool-making may be a reliable index of symbolic thought); rather, it was necessary for the success of distinctive social relations.

The key is that while men and women are equally effective foragers, mothers carrying dependent children are not effective hunters. They must thus depend on male hunters. This favors a system in which males have exclusive sexual access to females, and females can predict that their sexual partner will provide food for them and their children. In most mammalian species the result is a system of rank or sexual competition that results in either polygyny, or lifelong pair-bonding between two individuals who live relatively independent of other adults of their species; in both cases male aggression plays an important role in maintaining sexual access to mate(s).

{{quote|Human reliance on resources that are relatively unavailable to females with infants selects not only for cooperation between a child's father and mother but also for the cooperation of other relatives and friends, including elderly individuals and juveniles, who can be relied upon for assistance. The special demands of acquiring meat and caring for infants in our own evolution together contribute to the underlying impetus for the third characteristic feature of human reproductive patterns: cooperative group living.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=386–387}}}}

What is uniquely characteristic about human societies is what required symbolic cognition, which consequently leads to the evolution of culture: "cooperative, mixed-sex social groups, with significant male care and provisioning of offspring, and relatively stable patterns of reproductive exclusion." This combination is relatively rare in other species because it is "highly susceptible to disintegration."  Language and culture provide the glue that holds it together.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=388}}

Chimpanzees also, on occasion, hunt meat; in most cases, however, males consume the meat immediately, and only on occasion share with females who happen to be nearby. Among chimpanzees, hunting for meat increases when other sources of food become scarce, but under these conditions sharing decreases. The first forms of symbolic thinking made stone tools possible, which in turn made hunting for meat a more dependable source of food for our nonhuman ancestors while making possible forms of social communication that make sharing between males and females, but also among males, decreasing sexual competition:

{{quote|So the socio-ecological problem posed by the transition to a meat-supplemented subsistence strategy is that it cannot be utilized without a social structure which guarantees unambiguous and exclusive mating and is sufficiently egalitarian to sustain cooperation via shared or parallel reproductive interests. This problem can be solved symbolically.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=396–397}}}}

Symbols and symbolic thinking thus make possible a central feature of social relations in every human population: reciprocity. Evolutionary scientists have developed [[Inclusive fitness|a model]] to explain [[reciprocal altruism]] among closely related individuals. Symbolic thought makes possible reciprocity between distantly related individuals.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=397–401}}

== Archaeology ==

[[File:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|thumb|Excavated dwellings at [[Skara Brae]], [[Europe]]'s most complete [[Neolithic]] village]]

[[File:Monte Albán archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]
[[File:CatalHoyukSouthArea.JPG|thumb|Excavations at the South Area of [[Çatal Höyük]]]]

In the 19th century [[archaeology]] was often a supplement to [[history]], and the goal of archaeologists was to identify artifacts according to their [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] and [[stratigraphy]], thus marking their location in time and space. [[Franz Boas]] established that archaeology be one of American anthropology's four fields, and debates among archaeologists have often paralleled debates among cultural anthropologists. In the 1920s and 1930s, Australian-British archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]] and American archaeologist [[W. C. McKern]] independently began moving from asking about the date of an artifact, to asking about the people who produced it&amp;nbsp;— when archaeologists work alongside historians, historical materials generally help answer these questions, but when historical materials are unavailable, archaeologists had to develop new methods.  Childe and McKern focused on analyzing the relationships among objects found together; their work established the foundation for a three-tiered model:
# An individual artifact, which has surface, shape, and technological attributes (e.g. an arrowhead)
# A sub-assemblage, consisting of artifacts that are found, and were likely used, together (e.g. an arrowhead, bow and knife)
# An assemblage of sub-assemblages that together constitute the archaeological site (e.g. the arrowhead, bow and knife; a pot and the remains of a hearth; a shelter)
Childe argued that a "constantly recurring assemblage of artifacts" is an "[[archaeological culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;V. Gordon Childe 1929 ''The Danube in Prehistory'' Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By R. Lee Lyman and Michael J. O'Brien, 2003 ''W.C. McKern and the Midwestern Taxonomic Method.''  University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa&lt;/ref&gt;  Childe and others viewed "each archaeological culture ... the manifestation in material terms of a specific ''people''."&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn, 2008 ''Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice'' Fifth edition.  New York: Thames and Hudson. p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, [[Walter Taylor (archaeologist)|Walter Taylor]] systematized the methods and concepts that archaeologists had developed and proposed a general model for the archaeological contribution to knowledge of cultures.  He began with the mainstream understanding of culture as the product of human cognitive activity, and the Boasian emphasis on the subjective meanings of objects as dependent on their cultural context.  He defined culture as "a mental phenomenon, consisting of the contents of minds, not of material objects or observable behavior."{{sfn|Walter Taylor|1948|p= 96}}  He then devised a three-tiered model linking cultural anthropology to archeology, which he called [[conjunctive archaeology]]:
# Culture, which is unobservable (behavior) and nonmaterial
# Behaviors resulting from culture, which are observable and nonmaterial
# Objectifications, such as artifacts and architecture, which are the result of behavior and material
That is, material artifacts were the material residue of culture, but not culture itself.{{sfn|Walter Taylor|1948|p=100}}  Taylor's point was that the archaeological record could contribute to anthropological knowledge, but only if archaeologists reconceived their work not just as digging up artifacts and recording their location in time and space, but as inferring from material remains the behaviors through which they were produced and used, and inferring from these behaviors the mental activities of people.  Although many archaeologists agreed that their research was integral to anthropology, Taylor's program was never fully implemented.  One reason was that his three-tier model of inferences required too much fieldwork and laboratory analysis to be practical.&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) p.685&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, his view that material remains were not themselves cultural, and in fact twice-removed from culture, in fact left archaeology marginal to cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunnel 1986 "Five Decades of American Archaeology" in ''American Archaeology Past and Future: A Celebration of the Society for American Archaeology, 1935–1985''.  D. Meltzer and J. Sabloff, eds.  Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Leslie White's former student [[Lewis Binford]] proposed a new model for anthropological archaeology, called "the New Archaeology" or "[[Processual archaeology|Processual Archaeology]]," based on White's definition of culture as "the extra-somatic means of adaptation for the human organism."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Binford 1962 "Archaeology as Anthropology" in ''American Antiquity'' 28(2):218; see White 1959 ''The Evolution of Culture'' New York: McGraw Hill p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition allowed Binford to establish archaeology as a crucial field for the pursuit of the methodology of Julian Steward's cultural ecology:

{{quote|The comparative study of cultural systems with variable technologies in a similar environmental range or similar technologies in differing environments is a major methodology of what Steward (1955: 36–42) has called "cultural ecology," and certainly is a valuable means of increasing our understanding of cultural processes. Such a methodology is also useful in elucidating the structural relationships between major cultural sub-systems such as the social and ideological sub-systems.|&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Binford 1962 "Archaeology as Anthropology" in ''American Antiquity'' 28(2):218; see Steward 1955 ''Theory of Culture Change''. University of Illinois Press, Urbana.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, Binford proposed an archaeology that would be central to the dominant project of cultural anthropologists at the time (culture as non-genetic adaptations to the environment); the "new archaeology" was the cultural anthropology (in the form of cultural ecology or ecological anthropology) of the past.

In the 1980s, there was a movement in the United Kingdom and Europe against the view of archeology as a field of anthropology, echoing Radcliffe-Brown's earlier rejection of cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) p.684&lt;/ref&gt;  During this same period, then-[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] archaeologist [[Ian Hodder]] developed "[[post-processual archaeology]]" as an alternative.  Like Binford (and unlike Taylor) Hodder views artifacts not as objectifications of culture but ''as'' culture itself.  Unlike Binford, however, Hodder does not view culture as an environmental adaptation.  Instead, he "is committed to a fluid semiotic version of the traditional culture concept in which material items, artifacts, are full participants in the creation, deployment, alteration, and fading away of symbolic complexes."&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) pp. 687–6874&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1982 book, ''Symbols in Action'', evokes the symbolic anthropology of Geertz, Schneider, with their focus on the context dependent meanings of cultural things, as an alternative to White and Steward's materialist view of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hodder 1982 ''Symbols in action: ethnoarchaeological studies of material culture''  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1991 textbook, ''Reading the Past: Current Approaches to Interpretation in Archaeology'' Hodder argued that archaeology is more closely aligned to history than to anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hodder 1986 ''Reading the past: current approaches to interpretation in archaeology'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic anthropology ==

The connection between culture and language has been noted as far back as the classical period and probably long before. The ancient Greeks, for example, distinguished between civilized peoples and [[Barbarian|bárbaroi]] "those who babble", i.e. those who speak unintelligible languages.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, Paul. 2003. "White slaves, African masters." The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 588(1): 90–111. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that different groups speak different, unintelligible languages is often considered more tangible evidence for cultural differences than other less obvious cultural traits.

The German romanticists of the 19th century such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], often saw language not just as one cultural trait among many but rather as the direct expression of a people's national character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/slovaklawsonlanguage/Herder_on_Language.pdf | title = Herder on Language | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such as culture in a kind of condensed form. Herder for example suggests, "''Denn jedes Volk ist Volk; es hat seine National Bildung wie seine Sprache''" (Since every people is a People, it has its own national culture expressed through its own language).&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Anderson, Benedict R.O'G. 1983. ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism.'' London: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Boas, founder of American anthropology, like his German forerunners, maintained that the shared language of a community is the most essential carrier of their common culture. Boas was the first anthropologist who considered it unimaginable to study the culture of a foreign people without also becoming acquainted with their language. For Boas, the fact that the intellectual culture of a people was largely constructed, shared and maintained through the use of language, meant that understanding the language of a cultural group was the key to understanding its culture. At the same time, though, Boas and his students were aware that culture and language are not directly dependent on one another. That is, groups with widely different cultures may share a common language, and speakers of completely unrelated languages may share the same fundamental cultural traits.&lt;ref&gt;Sapir 1921:228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sapir 1995: 59&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other scholars have suggested that the form of language determines specific cultural traits.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Von Humboldt, Wilhelm. 1820. ''Über das vergleichende Sprachstudium in Beziehung auf die verschiedenen Epochen der Sprachentwicklung''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the notion of [[linguistic determinism]], which states that the form of language determines individual thought. While Boas himself rejected a causal link between language and culture, some of his intellectual heirs entertained the idea that habitual patterns of speaking and thinking in a particular language may influence the culture of the linguistic group.{{sfn|Whorf|1941}} Such belief is related to the theory of [[linguistic relativity]]. Boas, like most modern anthropologists, however, was more inclined to relate the interconnectedness between language and culture to the fact that, as [[B.L. Whorf]] put it, "they have grown up together".{{sfn|Whorf|1941|p=293}}&lt;ref&gt;See also e.g. Boas, Franz. 1911. "Introduction." ''Handbook of American Indian Languages''. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the [[origin of language]], understood as the human capacity of complex symbolic communication, and the origin of complex culture is often thought to stem from the same evolutionary process in early man. Evolutionary anthropologist [[Robin I. Dunbar]] has proposed that language evolved as early humans began to live in large communities which required the use of complex communication to maintain social coherence. Language and culture then both emerged as a means of using symbols to construct social identity and maintain coherence within a social group too large to rely exclusively on pre-human ways of building community such as for example [[Social grooming|grooming]]. Since language and culture are both in essence symbolic systems, twentieth century cultural theorists have applied the methods of analyzing language developed in the science of linguistics to also analyze culture. Particularly the [[Structuralism|structural]] theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] which describes symbolic systems as consisting of signs (a pairing of a particular form with a particular meaning) has come to be applied widely in the study of culture. But also post-structuralist theories that nonetheless still rely on the parallel between language and culture as systems of symbolic communication, have been applied in the field of [[semiotics]]. The parallel between language and culture can then be understood as analog to the parallel between a linguistic sign, consisting for example of the sound &lt;nowiki&gt;[kau]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the meaning "cow", and a cultural sign, consisting for example of the cultural form of "wearing a crown" and the cultural meaning of "being king". In this way it can be argued that culture is itself a kind of language. Another parallel between cultural and linguistic systems is that they are both systems of practice, that is, they are a set of special ways of doing things that is constructed and perpetuated through social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;(Duranti 1997: 49)(Mannheim &amp; Tedlock 1995: 2)&lt;/ref&gt; Children, for example, acquire language in the same way as they acquire the basic cultural norms of the society they grow up in&amp;nbsp;– through interaction with older members of their cultural group.

However, languages, now understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speak them. Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group and difference from others. Even among speakers of one language several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. In linguistics such different ways of using the same language are called "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]". For example, the English language is spoken differently in the US, the UK and Australia, and even within English-speaking countries there are hundreds of [[dialect]]s of English that each signals a belonging to a particular region and/or subculture. For example, in the UK the [[cockney]] dialect signals its speakers' belonging to the group of lower class workers of east London. Differences between varieties of the same language often consist in different pronunciations and vocabulary, but also sometimes of different grammatical systems and very often in using different [[Style (sociolinguistics)|styles]] (e.g. cockney [[rhyming slang]] or [[Legalese#Legalese|lawyers' jargon]]). Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]] and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between speech communities.

A community's ways of speaking or signing are a part of the community's culture, just as other shared practices are. Language use is a way of establishing and displaying group identity. Ways of speaking function not only to facilitate communication, but also to identify the social position of the speaker. Linguists call different ways of speaking language [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]], a term that encompasses geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[Style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, Patricia. (1986) "The acquisition of communicative style in Japanese." In B. Schieffelin and E. Ochs (eds) ''Language Socialization across Cultures''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between languages does not consist only in differences in pronunciation, vocabulary or grammar, but also in different "cultures of speaking". Some cultures for example have elaborate systems of "social deixis", systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;Foley 1997 p??&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly though distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, but also in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor" or "Your Honor", but in other languages such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. In several languages of east Asia, for example [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt; Other languages may use different forms of address when speaking to speakers of the opposite gender or in-law relatives and many languages have special [[Baby talk|ways of speaking to infants and children]]. Among other groups, the culture of speaking may entail ''not speaking'' to particular people, for example many indigenous cultures of Australia have a [[taboo]] against talking to one's in-law relatives, and in some cultures speech is not addressed directly to children. Some languages also require different ways of speaking for different social classes of speakers, and often such a system is based on gender differences, as in [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese|Japanese]] and [[Koasati]].&lt;ref&gt;Men's and Women's Speech in Koasati, Mary R. Haas, ''Language'', Vol. 20, No. 3 (Jul.&amp;nbsp;– Sep., 1944), pp. 142–149 (also summarized in Foley 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal versus particular ===

[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Boas]] established modern American anthropology as the study of the sum total of human phenomena. c. 1915]]

The modern anthropological concept of culture has its origins in the 19th century with German anthropologist [[Adolf Bastian]]'s theory of the "psychic unity of mankind," which, influenced by Herder and von Humboldt, challenged the identification of "culture" with the way of life of European elites, and British anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]'s attempt to define culture as inclusively as possible.  Tylor in 1874 described culture in the following way: "Culture or [[civilization]], taken in its wide [[ethnographic]] sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E.B. 1874. ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Tylor was not aiming to propose a general theory of culture (he explained his understanding of culture in the course of a larger argument about the nature of religion), American anthropologists have generally presented their various definitions of culture as refinements of Tylor's.  Franz Boas's student [[Alfred Kroeber]] (1876–1970) identified culture with the "superorganic," that is, a domain with ordering principles and laws that could not be explained by or reduced to biology.&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Kroeber 1917 "The Superorganic" ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 19, No. 2 pp. 163–213.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Gerald Weiss reviewed various definitions of culture and debates as to their parsimony and power, and proposed as the most scientifically useful definition that "culture" be defined "''as our generic term for all human nongenetic, or metabiological, phenomena''" (italics in the original).&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Weiss 1973 "A Scientific Concept of Culture" in ''American Anthropologist'' 75(5): 1382&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ruth Benedict]] was instrumental in establishing the modern conception of distinct cultures being patterned. 1937]]

[[Franz Boas]] founded modern American anthropology with the establishment of the first graduate program in anthropology at Columbia University in 1896.  At the time the dominant model of culture was that of [[cultural evolution]], which posited that human societies progressed through stages of savagery to barbarism to civilization; thus, societies that for example are based on horticulture and [[Iroquois kinship]] terminology are less evolved than societies based on agriculture and [[Eskimo kinship]] terminology.  One of Boas's greatest accomplishments was to demonstrate convincingly that this model is fundamentally flawed, empirically, methodologically, and theoretically. Moreover, he felt that our knowledge of different cultures was so incomplete, and often based on unsystematic or unscientific research, that it was impossible to develop any scientifically valid general model of human cultures. Instead, he established the principle of [[cultural relativism]] and trained students to conduct rigorous [[participant observation]] field research in different societies. Boas understood the capacity for culture to involve symbolic thought and social learning, and considered the evolution of a capacity for culture to coincide with the evolution of other, biological, features defining [[Homo (genus)|genus Homo]].  Nevertheless, he argued that culture could not be reduced to biology or other expressions of symbolic thought, such as language. Boas and his students understood culture inclusively and resisted developing a general definition of culture. Indeed, they resisted identifying "culture" as a thing, instead using culture as an adjective rather than a noun. Boas argued that cultural "types" or "forms" are always in a state of flux.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1940 [1920] "The Methods of Ethnology", in ''Race, Language and Culture'' ed. George Stocking.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press.  253&lt;/ref&gt; His student Alfred Kroeber argued that the "unlimited receptivity and assimilativeness of culture" made it practically impossible to think of cultures as discrete things.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, Alfred L., 1948, ''Anthropology: Race, Language, Culture, Psychology, Prehistory'' revised edition.  New York: Harcourt, Brace, and World, Inc. p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

Boas's students dominated [[cultural anthropology]] through World War II, and continued to have great influence through the 1960s.  They were especially interested in two phenomena: the great variety of forms culture took around the world,&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1907 "Anthropology" in ''A Franz Boas Reader: The Shaping of American Anthropology 1883–1911'' ed. George Stocking Jr. 267–382&lt;/ref&gt; and the many ways individuals were shaped by and acted creatively through their own cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, Franz 1920 "The Methods of Ethnology" in ''Race, Language, and Culture''. ed.

New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948) and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901–1978), produced monographs or comparative studies analyzing the forms of creativity possible to individuals within specific cultural configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Ruth. ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword:  Patterns of Japanese Culture.''  Rutland, VT and Tokyo, Japan:  Charles E. Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mead 1928 ''Coming of Age in Samoa''&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to their research was the concept of "context": culture provided a context that made the behavior of individuals understandable; geography and history provided a context for understanding the differences between cultures.  Thus, although Boasians were committed to the belief in the psychic unity of humankind and the universality of culture, their emphasis on local context and cultural diversity led them away from proposing [[cultural universal]]s or universal theories of culture.

There is a tension in cultural anthropology between the claim that culture is a universal (the fact that all human societies have culture), and that it is also particular (culture takes a tremendous variety of forms around the world). Since Boas, two debates have dominated cultural anthropology. The first has to do with ways of modeling particular cultures. Specifically, anthropologists have argued as to whether "culture" can be thought of as a bounded and integrated thing, or as a quality of a diverse collection of things, the numbers and meanings of which are in constant flux. Boas's student Ruth Benedict suggested that in any given society cultural traits may be more or less "integrated," that is, constituting a pattern of action and thought that gives purpose to people's lives, and provides them with a basis from which to evaluate new actions and thoughts, although she implies that there are various degrees of integration; indeed, she observes that some cultures fail to integrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} pp.46–47&lt;/ref&gt;  Boas, however, argued that complete integration is rare and that a given culture only appears to be integrated because of observer bias.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1940 [1932]  "The Aims of Anthropological Research," in ''Race, Language and Culture'' ed. George Stocking. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 256&lt;/ref&gt; For Boas, the appearance of such patterns—a national culture, for example—was the effect of a particular point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Bashkow, Ira 2004 "A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries" ''American Anthropologist'' 106(3): 446&lt;/ref&gt;

The first debate was effectively suspended in 1934 when Ruth Benedict published ''[[Patterns of Culture]]'', which has continuously been in print.  Although this book is well known for popularizing the Boasian principle of [[cultural relativism]], among anthropologists it constituted both an important summary of the discoveries of Boasians, and a decisive break from Boas's emphasis on the mobility of diverse cultural traits.  "Anthropological work has been overwhelmingly devoted to the analysis of cultural traits," she wrote "rather than to the study of cultures as articulated wholes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by Polish-British social anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]], however, she argued that "The first essential, so it seems today, is to study the living culture, to know its habits of thought and the functions of its institutions" and that "the only way in which we can know the significance of the selected detail of behavior is against the background of the motives and emotions and values that are institutionalized in that culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Influenced by German historians [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Oswald Spengler]], as well as by [[gestalt psychology]], she argued that "the whole determines its parts, not only their relation but their very nature,"&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Benedict 1934 ''Patterns of Culture'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and that "cultures, likewise, are more than the sum of their traits."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; She observed that "Just as each spoken language draws very selectively from an extensive, but finite, set of sounds any human mouth (free from defect) can make, she concluded that in each society people, over time and through both conscious and unconscious processes, selected from an extensive but finite set of cultural traits which then combine to form a unique and distinctive pattern."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Benedict argues

{{quote|The significance of cultural behavior is not exhausted when we have clearly understood that it is local and man-made and hugely variable.  It tends to be integrated.  A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action.  Within each culture there come into being characteristic purposes not necessarily shared by other types of society.  In obedience to their purposes, each people further and further consolidates its experience, and in proportion to the urgency of these drives the heterogeneous items of behavior take more and more congruous shape.  Taken up by a well-integrated culture, the most ill-assorted acts become characteristic of its particular goals, often by the most unlikely metamorphoses.|&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Benedict felt that virtually all cultures are patterned, she argued that these patterns change over time as a consequence of human creativity, and therefore different societies around the world had distinct characters. ''Patterns of Culture'' contrasts [[Zuni people|Zuňi]], [[Dobu]] and [[Kwakiutl]] cultures as a way of highlighting different ways of being human.  Benedict observed that many Westerners felt that this view forced them to abandon their "dreams of permanence and ideality and with the individual's illusions of autonomy" and that for many, this made existence "empty."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.277&lt;/ref&gt;  She argued however that once people accepted the results of scientific research, people would "arrive then at a more realistic social faith, accepting as grounds of hope and as new bases for tolerance the coexisting and equally valid patterns of life which mankind has created for itself from the raw materials of existence."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

This view of culture has had a tremendous impact outside of anthropology, and dominated American anthropology until [[the Cold War]], when anthropologists like [[Sidney Mintz]] and [[Eric Wolf]] rejected the validity and value of approaching "each culture" as "a world in itself" and "relatively stable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.271&lt;/ref&gt; They felt that, too often, this approach ignored the impact of [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]], and the world [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy on the peoples Benedict and her followers studied (and thus re-opened the debate on the relationship between the universal and the particular, in the form of the relationship between the global and the local).  In the meantime, its emphasis on metamorphosing patterns influenced French [[structuralism]] and made American anthropologists receptive to British [[structural-functionalism]].

[[File:Cousin-Kinship-chart.png|thumb|left|300px|Iroqois Kinship Structure]]
The second debate has been over the ability to make universal claims about all cultures.  Although Boas argued that anthropologists had yet to collect enough solid evidence from a diverse sample of societies to make any valid general or universal claims about culture, by the 1940s some felt ready. Whereas Kroeber and Benedict had argued that "culture"—which could refer to local, regional, or trans-regional scales—was in some way "patterned" or "configured," some anthropologists now felt that enough data had been collected to demonstrate that it often took highly structured forms.  The question these anthropologists debated was, were these structures statistical artifacts, or where they expressions of mental models?  This debate emerged full-fledged in 1949, with the publication of [[George Murdock]]'s ''Social Structure'', and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Les Structures Élémentaires de la Parenté''.

Opposing Boas and his students was [[Yale University|Yale]] anthropologist [[George Murdock]], who compiled the [[Human Relations Area Files]].  These files code cultural variables found in different societies, so that anthropologists can use [[statistics|statistical methods]] to study correlations among different variables.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, George, 1949 ''Social Structure'' New York: The Macmillan Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, G. P. 1967. ''Ethnographic Atlas: A Summary''. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, G. P. 1981. ''Atlas of World Cultures''. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ultimate aim of this project is to develop generalizations that apply to increasingly larger numbers of individual cultures.  Later, Murdock and [[Douglas R. White]] developed the [[standard cross-cultural sample]] as a way to refine this method.

French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structuralism|structuralist anthropology]] brought together ideas of Boas (especially Boas's belief in the mutability of cultural forms, and Bastian's belief in the psychic unity of humankind) and French sociologist's [[Émile Durkheim]]'s focus on social structures (institutionalized relationships among persons and groups of persons). Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, Lévi-Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature.  His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing members of the same society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as [[myth]]s and [[ritual]]s) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only ''not'' consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which people ''are'' aware).  He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures.  He argued that just as there are laws through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of things, there were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe.  The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural "table of elements," and once completed, this table of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the very people who produced and lived through these cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude 1955 ''Tristes Tropiques'' Atheneum Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude ''[[Mythologiques I-IV]]'' (trans. John Weightman and Doreen Weightman); ''Le Cru et le cuit'' (1964), ''The Raw and the Cooked'' (1969); ''Du miel aux cendres'' (1966), ''From Honey to Ashes'' (1973); ''L'Origine des manières de table'' (1968) ''The Origin of Table Manners'' (1978); ''L'Homme nu'' (1971), ''The Naked Man'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;  Structuralism came to dominate French anthropology and, in the late 1960s and 1970s, came to have great influence on American and British anthropology.

Murdock's HRAF and Lévi-Strauss's structuralism provide two ambitious ways to seek the universal in the particular, and both approaches continue to appeal to different anthropologists.  However, the differences between them reveal a tension implicit in the heritage of Tylor and Bastian.  Is culture to be found in [[empiricism|empirically]] observed behaviors that may form the basis of generalizations?  Or does it consist of universal mental processes, which must be inferred and abstracted from observed behavior?  This question has driven debates among [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[archeology|archeologists]] as well.

=== Structural functionalism ===

In structural functionalism, as a [[social theory]], society is viewed as "a reality of structural and cultural components or "facts" that can be investigated".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=24gOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=Structural%20functionalism&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Structural-functionalism] in Michael Rosenberg, ''Introduction to Sociology'', Routledge, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the 1940s the Boasian understanding of culture was challenged by that new paradigm for anthropological and social science research.  This paradigm developed independently but in parallel in both the United Kingdom and in the United States (In both cases it is ''sui generis'': it has no direct relationship to "structuralism" except that both French structuralism and Anglo-American Structural-Functionalism were all influenced by Durkheim.  It is also analogous, but unrelated to, other forms of "functionalism").  Whereas the Boasians viewed anthropology as that natural science dedicated to the study of humankind, structural functionalists viewed anthropology as one social science among many, dedicated to the study of one specific facet of humanity.  This led structural-functionalists to redefine and minimize the scope of "culture."{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the United Kingdom, the creation of structural functionalism was anticipated by [[Raymond Firth]]'s (1901–2002) ''We the Tikopia'', published in 1936, and marked by the publication of ''African Political Systems'', edited by [[Meyer Fortes]] (1906–1983) and [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]] (1902–1973) in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Firth 1936 ''We the Tikopia: A Sociological Study of Kinship in Primitive Polynesia'' London Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer Fortes and E.E. Evans Pritchard 1940. ''African Political Systems''. London and New York: International African Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these works these anthropologists forwarded a synthesis of the ideas of their mentor, [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942), and his rival, [[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] (1881–1955).  Both Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown viewed anthropology—what they call "[[social anthropology]]"—as that branch of sociology that studied so-called primitive societies.  According to Malinowski's theory of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]], all human beings have certain biological needs, such as the need for food and shelter, and humankind has the biological need to reproduce.  Every society develops its own institutions, which function to fulfill these needs.  In order for these institutions to function, individuals take on particular social roles that regulate how they act and interact.  Although members of any given society may not understand the ultimate functions of their roles and institutions, an ethnographer can develop a model of these functions through the careful observation of social life.&lt;ref&gt;Bronisław Malinowski 1944 ''The Scientific Theory of Culture''&lt;/ref&gt;  Radcliffe-Brown rejected Malinowski's notion of function, and believed that a general theory of primitive social life could only be built up through the careful comparison of different societies.  Influenced by the work of French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who argued that primitive and modern societies are distinguished by distinct social structures, Radcliffe-Brown argued that anthropologists first had to map out the social structure of any given society before comparing the structures of different societies.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1952 ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society''&lt;/ref&gt;  Firth, Fortes, and Evans-Pritchard found it easy to combine Malinowski's attention to social roles and institutions with Radcliffe-Brown's concern with social structures.  They distinguished between "social organization" (observable social interactions) and "social structure" (rule-governed patterns of social interaction), and shifted their attention from biological functions to social functions. For example, how different institutions are functionally integrated, and the extent to, and ways in, which institutions function to promote social solidarity and stability.  In short, instead of culture (understood as all human non-genetic or extra-somatic phenomena) they made "sociality" (interactions and relationships among persons and groups of people) their object of study.  (Indeed, Radcliffe-Brown once wrote "I should like to invoke a taboo on the word ''culture''.")&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1957 ''A Natural Science of Society'' Glencoe: The Free Press p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, in 1946 [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979) founded the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Department of Social Relations]] at [[Harvard University]].  Influenced by such European sociologists as [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber]], Parsons developed a theory of social action that was closer to British [[social anthropology]] than to Boas's American anthropology, and which he also called "structural functionalism."  Parson's intention was to develop a total theory of social action (why people act as they do), and to develop at Harvard an inter-disciplinary program that would direct research according to this theory.  His model explained human action as the result of four systems:
# the "behavioral system" of biological needs
# the "personality system" of an individual's characteristics affecting their functioning in the social world
# the "social system" of patterns of units of social interaction, especially social status and role
# the "cultural system" of norms and values that regulate social action symbolically

According to this theory, the second system was the proper object of study for psychologists; the third system for sociologists, and the fourth system for cultural anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons 1937, ''The Structure of Social Action''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons
1951, ''The Social System''&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Boasians considered all of these systems to be objects of study by anthropologists, and "personality" and "status and role" to be as much a part of "culture" as "norms and values," Parsons envisioned a much narrower role for anthropology and a much narrower definition of culture.

Although Boasian cultural anthropologists were interested in norms and values, among many other things, it was only with the rise of structural functionalism that people came to identify "culture" with "norms and values." Many American anthropologists rejected this view of culture (and by implication, anthropology). In 1980, anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] wrote,

{{quote|As the social sciences transformed themselves into "behavioral" science, explanations for behavior were no longer traced to culture: behavior was to be understood in terms of psychological encounters, strategies of economic choice, strivings for payoffs in games of power.  Culture, once extended to all acts and ideas employed in social life, was now relegated to the margins as "world view" or "values".|&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf 1980 "They Divide and Subdivide and Call it Anthropology."  ''The New York Times'' November 30:E9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, several of Talcott Parsons' students emerged as leading American anthropologists.  At the same time, many American anthropologists had a high regard for the research produced by social anthropologists in the 1940s and 1950s, and found structural-functionalism to provide a very useful model for conducting ethnographic research.

The combination of American cultural anthropology theory with British social anthropology methods has led to some confusion between the concepts of "society" and "culture." For most anthropologists, these are distinct concepts. Society refers to a group of people; culture refers to a pan-human capacity and the totality of non-genetic human phenomena.  Societies are often clearly bounded; cultural traits are often mobile, and cultural boundaries, such as they are, can be typically porous, permeable, and plural.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Bashkow, 2004 "A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries," ''American Anthropologist'' 106(3):445–446&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1950s, and 1960s anthropologists often worked in places where social and cultural boundaries coincided, thus obscuring the distinction.  When disjunctures between these boundaries become highly salient, for example during the period of European de-colonization of Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, or during the [[Bretton Woods system|post-Bretton Woods]] realignment of [[globalization]], however, the difference often becomes central to anthropological debates.&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai, Arjun 1986 ''The Social Life of Things''.

Parsons' students [[Clifford Geertz]] and [[David M. Schneider]], and Schneider's student [[Roy Wagner]], went on to important careers as cultural anthropologists and developed a school within American cultural anthropology called "symbolic anthropology," the study of the social construction and social effects of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz 1973 ''The Interpretation of Cultures'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Schneider 1968 ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Wagner 1980 ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Dolgin, David Kemnitzer, and David Schneider, eds. ''Symbolic Anthropology: a Reader in the Study of Symbols and Meanings''&lt;/ref&gt;  Since symbolic anthropology easily complemented social anthropologists' studies of social life and social structure, many British structural-functionalists (who rejected or were uninterested in Boasian cultural anthropology) accepted the Parsonian definition of "culture" and "cultural anthropology."  British anthropologist [[Victor Turner]] (who eventually left the United Kingdom to teach in the United States) was an important bridge between American and British symbolic anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Turner 1967 ''The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention to symbols, the meaning of which depended almost entirely on their historical and social context, appealed to many Boasians. [[Leslie White]] asked of cultural things, "What sort of objects are they? Are they physical objects? Mental objects? Both? Metaphors? Symbols? Reifications?" In ''Science of Culture'' (1949), he concluded that they are objects "''[[sui generis]]''"; that is, of their own kind. In trying to define that kind, he hit upon a previously unrealized aspect of symbolization, which he called "the symbolate"—an object created by the act of symbolization. He thus defined culture as "symbolates understood in an extra-somatic context."&lt;ref&gt;White, L. 1949. ''The Science of Culture: A study of man and civilization.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, by the 1930s White began turning away from the Boasian approach.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Barrett 1989, "The Paradoxical Anthropology of Leslie White,"
''American Anthropologist'' Vol. 91, No. 4 (Dec., 1989), pp. 986–999&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote,

{{quote|In order to live man, like all other species, must come to terms with the external world.... Man employs his sense organs, nerves, glands, and muscles in adjusting himself to the external world. But in addition to this he has another means of adjustment and control.... This mechanism is ''culture''.|&lt;ref&gt;Leslie White, 1949 "Ethnological Theory." In ''Philosophy for the Future: The Quest of Modern Materialism''. R. W. Sellars, V.J. McGill, and M. Farber, eds. Pp. 357–384. New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although this view echoes that of Malinowski, the key concept for White was not "function" but "adaptation."  Whereas the Boasians were interested in the history of specific traits, White was interested in the cultural history of the human species, which he felt should be studied from an evolutionary perspective.  Thus, the task of anthropology is to study "not only how culture evolves, but why as well.... In the case of man ... the power to invent and to discover, the ability to select and use the better of two tools or ways of doing something— these are the factors of cultural evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie White, 1943 "Energy and the Evolution of Culture." ''American Anthropologist'' 45: 339&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike 19th century evolutionists, who were concerned with how civilized societies rose above primitive societies, White was interested in documenting how, over time, humankind as a whole has through cultural means discovered more and more ways for capturing and harnessing energy from the environment, in the process transforming culture.

At the same time that White was developing his theory of [[cultural evolution]], Kroeber's student [[Julian Steward]] was developing his theory of [[cultural ecology]].  In 1938, he published ''Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Socio-Political Groups'' in which he argued that diverse societies—for example the indigenous [[Shoshone]] or White farmers on the Great Plains—were not less or more evolved; rather, they had adapted to different environments in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward 1938 ''Basin Plateau Aboriginal Socio-political Groups'' (Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin, No 20)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Leslie White was interested in culture understood holistically as a property of the human species, Julian Steward was interested in culture as the property of distinct societies.  Like White he viewed culture as a means of adapting to the environment, but he criticized Whites "unilineal" (one direction) theory of cultural evolution and instead proposed a model of "multilineal" evolution in which (in the Boasian tradition) each society has its own cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward 1955 ''Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution'' University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

When Julian Steward left a teaching position at the University of Michigan to work in Utah in 1930, Leslie White took his place; in 1946 Julian Steward was made Chair of the Columbia University Anthropology Department.  In the 1940s and 1950s their students, most notably [[Marvin Harris]], [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert Murphy]], [[Roy Rappaport]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Elman Service]], [[Andrew P. Vayda]] and [[Eric Wolf]] dominated American anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1979 ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture'' New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1977 ''Cannibals and Kings: Origins of Cultures'' New York: Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1974 ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture'' New York: Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy A. Rappaport 1967 ''Pigs for the Ancestors: Ritual in the Ecology of a New Guinea People''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward, ed. 1966 ''The people of Puerto Rico: a study in social anthropology''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press (includes doctoral dissertations of Mintz and Wolf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Murphy 1960 ''Headhunter's Heritage; Social and Economic Change Among the Mundurucu Indians''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Sahlins and Elman Service, ''''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elman R. Service 1962 ''Primitive social organization: an evolutionary perspective'' New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Peter Vayda, ed. 1969 ''Environment and cultural behavior: ecological studies in cultural anthropology'' Garden City: Natural History Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Most promoted materialist understandings of culture in opposition to the symbolic approaches of Geertz and Schneider.  Harris, Rappaport, and Vayda were especially important for their contributions to [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]] and [[ecological anthropology]], both of which argued that "culture" constituted an extra-somatic (or non-biological) means through which human beings could adapt to life in drastically differing physical environments.

The debate between symbolic and materialist approaches to culture dominated American anthropologists in the 1960s and 1970s.  The [[Vietnam War]] and the publication of [[Dell Hymes]]' ''Reinventing Anthropology'', however, marked a growing dissatisfaction with the then dominant approaches to culture.  Hymes argued that fundamental elements of the Boasian project such as holism and an interest in diversity were still worth pursuing: "interest in other peoples and their ways of life, and concern to explain them within a frame of reference that includes ourselves."{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=11}}  Moreover, he argued that cultural anthropologists are singularly well-equipped to lead this study (with an indirect rebuke to sociologists like Parsons who sought to subsume anthropology to their own project):

{{quote|In the practice there is a traditional place for openness to phenomena in ways not predefined by theory or design&amp;nbsp;– attentiveness to complex phenomena, to phenomena of interest, perhaps aesthetic, for their own sake, to the sensory as well as intellectual, aspects of the subject.  These comparative and practical perspectives, though not unique to formal anthropology, are specially husbanded there, and might well be impaired, if the study of man were to be united under the guidance of others who lose touch with experience in concern for methodology, who forget the ends of social knowledge in elaborating its means, or who are unwittingly or unconcernedly culture-bound.|{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=42}}}}

It is these elements, Hymes argued, that justify a "general study of man," that is, "anthropology".{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=43}}

During this time notable anthropologists such as Mintz, Murphy, Sahlins, and Wolf eventually broke away; experimenting with [[Structuralism|structuralist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] approaches to culture, they continued to promote cultural anthropology against structural functionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Mintz 1985 ''Sweetness and Power'' New York: Viking Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Murphy 1971 ''The Dialectics of Social Life'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Sahlins 1976 ''Culture and Practical Reason''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf 1971 ''Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf, 1982 ''Europe and the People Without History'' Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local versus global ===

[[File:Taiwanese aborigines.JPG|thumb|[[Taiwanese aborigines]] dancing]]

Boas and Malinowski established ethnographic research as a highly localized method for studying culture.  Yet Boas emphasized that culture is dynamic, moving from one group of people to another, and that specific cultural forms have to be analyzed in a larger context.  This has led anthropologists to explore different ways of understanding the global dimensions of culture.

In the 1940s and 1950s, several key studies focused on how trade between indigenous peoples and the Europeans who had conquered and colonized the Americas influenced indigenous culture, either through change in the organization of labor, or change in critical technologies. [[Bernard Mishkin]] studied the effect of the introduction of horses on [[Kiowa]] political organization and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Mishkin, Bernard 1940 ''Rank and Warfare in Plains Indian Culture.''  Monographs of the American Ethnological Society no. 3.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Lewis]] explored the influence of the fur trade on [[Blackfoot Indians|Blackfoot]] culture (relying heavily on historical sources).&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Oscar 1942  ''The Effects of White Contact upon Blackfoot Culture, with Special Reference to the Role of the Fur Trade.''  Monographs of the American Ethnological Society no. 6.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Jablow]] documented how [[Cheyenne]] social organization and subsistence strategy between 1795 and 1840 were determined by their position in trade networks linking Whites and other Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Jablow, Joseph 1951 ''The Cheyenne in Plains Indian Trade Relations, 1795–1972.''  American Ethnological Society Monograph 19.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Secoy]] argued that [[Great Plains]] Indians' social organization and military tactics changed as horses, introduced by the Spanish in the south, diffused north, and guns, introduced by the British and French in the east, diffused west.&lt;ref&gt;Secoy, Frank 1953  ''Changing Military Patterns on the Great Plains (17th Century through Early 19th Century).'' American Ethnological Society Monograph 21, New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Robert Redfield]] and students of [[Julian Steward]] pioneered "community studies," namely, the study of distinct communities (whether identified by race, ethnicity, or economic class) in Western or "Westernized" societies, especially cities.  They thus encountered the antagonisms 19th century critics described using the terms "high culture" and "low culture."  These 20th-century anthropologists struggled to describe people who were politically and economically inferior but not, they believed, culturally inferior. [[Oscar Lewis]] proposed the concept of a "culture of poverty" to describe the cultural mechanisms through which people adapted to a life of economic poverty.  Other anthropologists and sociologists began using the term "sub-culture" to describe culturally distinct communities that were part of larger societies.

One important kind of subculture is that formed by an immigrant community.  In dealing with immigrant groups and their cultures, there are various approaches:
* [[Leitkultur]] (core culture): A model developed in Germany by [[Bassam Tibi]]. The idea is that minorities can have an identity of their own, but they should at least support the core concepts of the culture on which the society is based.
* [[Melting pot]]: In the [[United States]], the traditional view has been one of a melting pot where all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.
* [[Monoculturalism]]: In some European states, culture is very closely linked to [[nationalism]], thus government policy is to assimilate immigrants, although recent increases in migration have led many European states to experiment with forms of multiculturalism.
* [[Multiculturalism]]: A policy that immigrants and others should preserve their cultures with the different cultures interacting peacefully within one nation.

The way nation states treat immigrant cultures rarely falls neatly into one or another of the above approaches.  The degree of difference with the host culture (i.e., "foreignness"), the number of immigrants, attitudes of the resident population, the type of government policies that are enacted, and the effectiveness of those policies all make it difficult to generalize about the effects. Similarly with other subcultures within a society, attitudes of the mainstream population and communications between various cultural groups play a major role in determining outcomes.  The study of cultures within a society is complex and research must take into account a myriad of variables.

{{Ancient Egyptian culture}}
'''Ancient Egyptian architecture''' is the architecture of one of the most influential civilizations throughout history, which developed a vast array of diverse structures and great architectural monuments along the [[Nile]], including [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] and [[Egyptian temple|temples]].

==Characteristics==
Due to the scarcity of wood,&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Blakemore, ''History of Interior Design and Furniture: From Ancient Egypt to Nineteenth-Century Europe'', John Wiley and Sons 1996, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; the two predominant building materials used in ancient Egypt were sun-baked [[mud brick]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]], mainly limestone, but also sandstone and granite in considerable quantities.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, 1996, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Old Kingdom]] onward, stone was generally reserved for [[tomb]]s and [[Egyptian temple|temples]], while bricks were used even for royal palaces, fortresses, the walls of temple precincts and towns, and for subsidiary buildings in temple complexes. The core of the [[pyramid]]s consisted of locally quarried stone, mudbricks, sand or gravel. For the casing stones were used that had to be transported from farther away, predominantly white limestone from Tura and red granite from upper Egypt.

[[File:Lepsius-Projekt tw 1-2-108.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Drawings of the types of the architectural [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] specific for the Ancient Egyptian civilization.]]

Ancient Egyptian houses were made out of mud collected from the damp banks of the Nile river. It was placed in moulds and left to dry in the hot sun to harden for use in construction. If the bricks were intended to be used in a royal tomb like a  pyramid, the exterior bricks would also be finely chiselled and polished.

Many Egyptian towns have disappeared because they were situated near the cultivated area of the Nile Valley and were flooded as the river bed slowly rose during the millennia, or the mud bricks of which they were built were used by peasants as fertilizer. Others are inaccessible, new buildings having been erected on ancient ones. However, the dry, hot climate of Egypt preserved some mud brick structures. Examples include the village [[Deir al-Madinah]], the Middle Kingdom town at [[El-Lahun|Kahun]],&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Flinders Petrie, ''Kahun, Gurob, and Hawara'', Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, and Co., London 1890&lt;/ref&gt; and the fortresses at [[Buhen]]&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gates, ''Ancient Cities: The Archaeology of Urban Life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome'', Routledge 2003, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mirgissa]]. Also, many temples and tombs have survived because they were built on high ground unaffected by the Nile flood and were constructed of stone.

Thus, our understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on religious monuments,&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Byron Esely Shafer ''Temples of Ancient Egypt'', I.B.Tauris, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; massive structures characterized by thick, sloping walls with few openings, possibly echoing a method of construction used to obtain stability in mud walls. In a similar manner, the incised and flatly modeled surface adornment of the stone buildings may have derived from mud wall ornamentation. Although the use of the [[arch]] was developed during the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|fourth dynasty]], all monumental buildings are [[post and lintel]] constructions, with flat roofs constructed of huge stone blocks supported by the external walls and the closely spaced columns.

Exterior and interior walls, as well as the [[column]]s and [[pier (architecture)|piers]], were covered with [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] and pictorial frescoes and carvings painted in brilliant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, 1996, pp.107ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many motifs of Egyptian ornamentation are [[symbol]]ic, such as the [[Dung beetle#Scarab in ancient Egypt|scarab]], or sacred beetle, the [[solar disk]], and the [[vulture]]. Other common motifs include [[palm tree|palm]] leaves, the [[papyrus]] plant, and the buds and flowers of the [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, 2005, pp.204ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyphs]] were inscribed for decorative purposes as well as to record historic events or spells. In addition, these pictorial frescoes and carvings allow us to understand how the Ancient Egyptians lived, statuses, wars that were fought and their beliefs. This was especially true when exploring the tombs of Ancient Egyptian officials in recent years.

Ancient Egyptian temples were aligned with astronomically significant events, such as [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es, requiring precise measurements at the moment of the particular event. Measurements at the most significant temples may have been ceremonially undertaken by the [[Pharaoh]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Temples aligned with the stars", ''New Scientist'' 2724 (5 Sep. 2009), p. 7; see also J. Belmonte &amp; M. Shaltout, "Keeping Ma’at: an astronomical approach to the orientation of the temples in ancient Egypt", ''Advances in Space Research'' (August 2009) {{doi|10.1016/j.asr.2009.03.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Giza pyramid complex==
{{Main|Giza pyramid complex}}
The Giza Necropolis stands on the [[Giza Plateau]], on the outskirts of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. This complex of ancient monuments is located some 8 kilometers (5&amp;nbsp;mi) inland into the desert from the old town of [[Giza]] on the Nile, some 20 kilometers (12&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Cairo city center. This [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[necropolis]] consists of the [[Pyramid of Khufu]] (also known as the ''[[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]'' and the ''Pyramid of Cheops''), the somewhat smaller [[Pyramid of Khafre]] (or Kephren/Chefren), and the relatively modest-sized [[Pyramid of Menkaure]] (or Mykerinus/Mycerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as "queens" pyramids, the [[Great Sphinx]] as well as a few hundred mastabas, and chapels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winston|first=Alan|title=An overview of the Giza Plateau in Egypt|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/giza.htm|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|300px|The Pyramids of Giza]]
The pyramids, which were built in the Fourth Dynasty, testify to the power of the pharaonic religion and state. They were built to serve both as grave sites and also as a way to make their names last forever.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reich|first=Lawrence S.

Popular culture leads people to believe that Pyramids are highly confusing, with many tunnels within the pyramid to create confusion for grave robbers. This is not true. The shafts of pyramids are quite simple, mostly leading directly to the tomb. The immense size of the pyramids attracted robbers to the wealth that lay inside which caused the tombs to be robbed relatively soon after the tomb was sealed in some cases.&lt;ref name="Reich 2010"/&gt; There are sometimes additional tunnels, but these were used for the builders to understand how far they could dig the tomb into the crust of the Earth. Also, it is popularly thought that due to grave robbers, future Kings were buried in the Valley of the Kings to help keep them hidden. This is also false, as the Pyramid construction continued for many Dynasties, just on a smaller scale. Finally, the pyramid construction was stopped due to economic factors, not theft.

Evidence suggests that they were built by paid laborers and craftsmen that were well cared for and not by slaves.

==New Kingdom Temples==

=== Luxor Temple ===
{{Main|Luxor Temple}}
The Luxor Temple is a huge ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the [[Nile|River Nile]] in the city today known as [[Luxor]] (ancient [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]). Construction work on the temple began during the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] in the 14th century BC. [[Horemheb]] and [[Tutankhamun]] added columns, statues, and friezes&amp;nbsp;– and [[Akhenaten]] had earlier obliterated his father's [[cartouche]]s and installed a shrine to the [[Aten]]&amp;nbsp;– but the only major expansion effort took place under [[Ramesses II]] some 100 years after the first stones were put in place. Luxor is thus unique among the main Egyptian temple complexes in having only two pharaohs leave their mark on its architectural structure.

The temple proper begins with the {{convert|24|m|abbr=on}} high First [[Pylon (architecture)|Pylon]], built by Ramesses II. The pylon was decorated with scenes of Ramesses's military triumphs (particularly the [[Battle of Qadesh]]); later pharaohs, particularly those of the [[Nubia]]n and [[Ethiopia]]n dynasties, also recorded their victories there. This main entrance to the temple complex was originally flanked by six colossal statues of Ramesses&amp;nbsp;– four seated, and two standing&amp;nbsp;– but only two (both seated) have survived. Modern visitors can also see a {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} tall pink granite [[obelisk]]: this one of a matching pair until 1835, when the other one was taken to [[Paris]] where it now stands in the centre of the [[Place de la Concorde]].

Through the pylon gateway leads into a [[peristyle]] courtyard, also built by Ramesses II. This area, and the pylon, were built at an oblique angle to the rest of the temple, presumably to accommodate the three pre-existing barque shrines located in the northwest corner. After the peristyle courtyard comes the processional colonnade built by Amenhotep III&amp;nbsp;– a {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} corridor lined by 14 [[papyrus]]-[[capital (architecture)|capital]] columns. Friezes on the wall describe the stages in the Opet Festival, from sacrifices at Karnak at the top left, through [[Amun]]'s arrival at Luxor at the end of that wall, and concluding with his return on the opposite side. The decorations were put in place by Tutankhamun: the boy pharaoh is depicted, but his names have been replaced with those of Horemheb.

Beyond the colonnade is a peristyle courtyard, which also dates back to Amenhotep's original construction. The best preserved columns are on the eastern side, where some traces of original color can be seen. The southern side of this courtyard is made up of a 36-column [[hypostyle]] court (i.e., a roofed space supported by columns) that leads into the dark inner rooms of the temple.

=== Temple of Karnak ===
{{Main|Karnak}}
[[File:KarnakVisitorCenterModel.jpg|thumb|A recreation of the temple complex at Karnak visiting center.]]
The temple complex of Karnak is located on the banks of the Nile River some 2.5 kilometers (1.5&amp;nbsp;mi) north of [[Luxor]]. It consists of four main parts, the [[Precinct of Amon-Re]], the [[Precinct of Montu]], the [[Precinct of Mut]] and the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV]] (dismantled), as well as a few smaller temples and sanctuaries located outside the enclosing walls of the four main parts, and several avenues of ram-headed sphinxes connecting the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Amon-Re and Luxor Temple. This temple complex is particularly significant, for many rulers have added to it. However, notably every ruler of the New Kingdom added to it. The site covers over 200 acres and consists of a series of pylons, leading into courtyards, halls, chapels, obelisks, and smaller temples. The key difference between Karnak and most of the other temples and sites in Egypt is the length of time over which it was developed and used. Construction work began in the 16th century BC, and was originally quite modest in size. But eventually, in the main precinct alone, as many as twenty temples and chapels would be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt|last=Wilkinson|first=R.|publisher=New York, Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 30 pharaohs contributed to the buildings, enabling it to reach a size, complexity and diversity not seen elsewhere. Few of the individual features of Karnak are unique, but the size and number of those features is overwhelming.[[File:Luxor Karnak-Tempel 2016-03-21 Große Säulenhalle 04.jpg|thumb|Example of the inscriptions present throughout the complex. As visible from this image, the upper regions are painted, suggesting (in cannon with other such temples) that the remain  columns and ceilings would have been brightly painted. The temple roof representing the heavens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architecture, Astronomy and Sacred Landscape in Ancient Egypt|last=Gulio|first=Magli|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; would often display images of stars and birds, whereas the columns often boast images of palm plants, lotus and people.]]One of the greatest temples in Egyptian history is that of Amun-Ra at Karnak. As with many other temples in Egypt, this one details the feats of the past (including thousands of years of history detailed via inscriptions on many of the walls and columns found on site, often modified or completely erased and redone by following rulers), and honors the gods. The temple of Amun-Re was constructed in three sections, the third being constructed by the later New Kingdom pharaohs. In cannon with the traditional style of Egyptian architecture, many of the architectural features, such as the inner sanctum of the complex, were aligned with the sunset of the summer solstice.

One of the architectural features present at the site is the 5,000 sq m (50,000 sq ft) hypostyle hall built during the Ramesside period. The hall is supported by approximately 139 sandstone and mud brick columns, with 12 central columns (~69 feet tall) that would have all been brightly painted.

=== Temple Ramesseum ===
[[File:Egypt.Ramesseum.02.jpg|thumb|The design of Ramesses's mortuary temple adheres to the standard style of New Kingdom temple architecture. Oriented northwest and southeast, the temple entrance consists of a number of stone figures, one located horizontally to the next. In the center area of the complex was a covered 48-column hypostyle hall, surrounding the inner sanctuary.]]
Ramses II, a 19th Dynasty pharaoh ruled Egypt from around 1279 to 1213 BCE. Among Ramses II many accomplishments, such as the expanding of the Egyptian borders, he constructed a massive temple called the Ramesseum. The temple is located near the city of Thebes, which at the time was the capital for the New kingdom pharaoh. The Ramesseum was a magnificent temple, completed with monument status to guard its entrance; the most impressive of which was a 62 foot tall statue of Ramses himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The encyclopaedia of ancient Egyptian architecture|last=Dieter|first=Arnold|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-465-1|location=|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only fragments of this structure remain, particularly its base and torso are all that remain of the this impressive statue of the enthroned pharaoh, and thus the dimensions and weight (approximately 1000 pounds) are based on estimates. The temple was also accompanied with impressive reliefs many of which detail a number of Rames' military victories, such as the [[Battle of Kadesh]] (ca. 1274 BC) and the pillaging of the city "Shalem".

=== Temple of Malkata ===
Under the tenure of Amenhotep III workers constructed over 250 buildings and monuments. One of the most impressive building projects was the temple complex of Malkata, known among the ancient Egyptians as the “house of rejoicing”, was constructed to serve his royal residence on the west bank of Thebes, just south of the Theban necropolis. The site is approximately 226,000 square meters (or 2,432,643 square feet).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koltsida|first=Aikaterini|date=2007|title=A Dark Spot in Ancient Egyptian Architecture: The Temple of Malkata|url=|journal=Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt|volume=43|pages=43–57|via=Jstor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the immense size of the site, along with its many buildings, courts, parade grounds, and housing, it is considered to have served not just as a temple and dwelling of the Pharaoh but a town.

The central area of the complex consisted in the Pharaoh's apartments that were made up of a number of rooms and courts, all of which were oriented around a columned banquet hall. Accompanying the apartments, that presumably housed the royal cohort and foreign guests, was a large throne room connected to smaller chambers, for storage, waiting, and smaller audiences. The greater elements of this area of the complex are what have been come to be called the West Villas (just west of the King's Palace), the North Palace and Village, and Temple.
[[File:Reconstruction of Wall Decoration from the Temple of Amun at Malqata MET 17.10.1a.jpg|thumb|The faience (glazed ceramic earthenware) tile (above) is a reconstruction of wall decoration fragments found at the Temple of Malkata in stacks at the southwest corner.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551605|title=Reconstruction of Geometric Decoration|last=|first=|date=|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gold spirals here were painted with gold paint, whereas the originals would have probably been covered by gold foil. Notably, similar patterns are found in the Pharaoh's Palace.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"/&gt;]]
The temple's external dimensions are approximately 183.5 by 110.5 m, and consists of two parts: the large forecourt and the temple proper.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The large front court is 131.5 by 105.5 m, oriented on the east-west axis, and occupies the east part of the temple complex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The western part of the court is on a higher level and is divided from the rest of the court by a low retaining wall. The lower court is almost square, whereas the upper terrace was rectangular in shape. The upper section of the court was paved with mud bricks and has a 4 m wide entrance to it from the lower part of the fore-court, connecting the base to the upper landing was a ramp enclosed by walls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This ramp and entrance were both at the center of the temple, with the same orientation as the front court entrance and the temple proper.

The temple proper might be seen as divided in to three distinct parts: central, north, and south. The central part is indicated by a small rectangular anteroom (6.5 by 3.5 m), many of the door jambs including those of the antechamber include inscriptions, such as 'given life like Ra forever'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 12.5 by 14.5 m hall follows the anteroom from which is entered via a 3.5 m wide door in the center of the front wall of the hall. There is evidence the ceiling of this chamber was decorated with yellow stars on blue background, whereas the walls today show only the appearance of a white stucco over mud plaster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Notwithstanding, we might speculate given the numerous decorative plaster fragments found within the room's deposit that these too were ornately decorated with various images and patterns. Supporting the ceiling are six columns arranged in two rows with east-west axis. Only small fragments of the column bases have survived, though they suggest the diameter of these columns to have been about 2.25 m.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The columns are placed 2.5 m away from the walls and in each row the columns are approximately 1.4 m away from the next, while the space between the two rows is 3 m.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A second hall (12.5 by 10 m&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) is accessed by a 3 m door at the center of the back wall of the first. The second hall is similar to the first, first its ceiling seems to have been decorated with similar if not identical patterns and images as the first. Second, in the same way the ceiling is supported by columns, four to be precise, ordered in two rows on the same axis as those of the first hall, with a 3 m wide space between them. In hall two, at-least one of the rooms appears to have been dedicated to the cult of Maat, which suggests the other three in this area might have likewise served such a religious purpose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The southern part of the temple may be divided into two sections: western and southern. The western section consists of 6 rooms, whereas the southern area given its size (19.5 by 17.2 m) suggests it might have served as another open court. In many of these rooms were found blue ceramic tiles inlaid with gold around their edge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Northern part of the temple proper consists of ten rooms, similar in style to those of the southern.

The temple itself seems to have been dedicated to the Egyptian deity Amun, given the number of bricks stamped with various inscriptions, such as "the temple of Amun in the house of Rejoicing" or "Nebmaarta in the Temple of Amun in the house of Rejoicing". Overall the temple of Malakata shares many with other cult temples of the New Kingdom, with magnificent halls and religiously oriented rooms with many others more closely resemble store rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lansing|first=Ambrose|date=1918|title=Excavations at the Palace of Amenhotep III at Thebes|url=|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=13|pages=|via=Jstor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Egyptian Fortresses ==
Fortifications within Ancient Egypt were built in times of conflict between rival principalities.&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;Lawrence, A. (1965). Ancient Egyptian Fortifications. ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology,51''(1), 69-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all fortresses analyzed within this time frame, most (if not all) were built of the same materials. The only exception to the rule were some fortresses from the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] as fortresses such as the fort of [[Buhen]] utilized stone with the creation of its walls. The main walls were mainly built with mud brick but were reinforced with other materials such as timber. Rocks were also utilized to not only preserve them from erosion as well as paving.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;  Secondary walls would be built outside of fortresses main walls and were relatively close to one another. As a result, this would prove to be a challenge to invaders were as they forced to destroy this fortification before they could reach the main walls of the fort.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Clarke, S. (1916). ANCIENT EGYPTIAN FRONTIER FORTRESSES. ''Journal of Egyptian Archaeology,'' ''3'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Another strategy was utilized if the enemy managed to break through the first barrier. Upon making it to the main wall, a ditch would be constructed that would be positioned between the secondary and first walls. The purpose of this was to place the enemy in a position that would leave them exposed to the enemy, making the invaders susceptible to arrow fire.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The position of this ditch Walls within the interior of fortresses would become demilitarized during times of unity; leading to them being demolished. The parts that were used to construct said walls could then be reused, making the overall design extremely beneficial.

Fortresses within Ancient Egypt held multiple functions. During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] Period, the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] would establish means of control throughout the Nubian Riverside by creating fortified stations.  The location of Egyptian fortresses were not exclusive to just the riverside. Sites within both Egypt and Nubia would be placed on terrain that was either rocky or sandy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The purpose behind this method was to spread its influence throughout the region as well as discourage rival groups from raiding the sites.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; Inspections of these forts in Nubia have led to the discovery of copper smelting materials which suggest a relationship between miners in the region &lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; The occupation of these Nubian forts suggests a trade relationship between the two parties. Miners would collect the materials and would transfer them to these forts in exchange for food and water. Up until the Thirteenth dynasty, Egypt would hold control of Nubia through the use of these fortresses.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

=== Pelusium Fortress ===

The Pelusium fortress served as means of protection from invaders coming towards the Nile Delta.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Stanley, Jean-Daniel, et al. “Pelusium, an Ancient Port Fortress on Egypt's Nile Delta Coast: Its Evolving Environmental Setting from Foundation to Demise.” ''Journal of Coastal Research'', vol. 24, no. 2, 2008, pp. 451–462. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/30137849.&lt;/ref&gt; While the site served this role for more than a millennium, Pelusium was also known for being a center of trade (both land and Maritime). Trade was primarily conducted between Egypt and the Levant.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; While information is not concrete in terms of the fortresses establishment, it is suggested that Pelusium was erected during either the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] period or during the Saite and Persian periods from the 16th and 18th century.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Pelusium is also seen as an integral part of the Nile as other ruins were found outside its borders, indicating that the area was large in occupation. Architecturally, structures of Pelusium (such as it's gates and towers) appear to be built from limestone. A metallurgy industry is also indicated to have taken place at this site due to the discovery of copper-ore.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Excavations of the site have also discovered older materials that date back some of the early dynasties. The found materials include Basalt, Granite, Diorite, Marble, and Quartzite.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; How these materials were utilized during the operation of is unclear as they may have been placed at the location more recently.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Seeing as the fortress was placed in close proximity to the [[Nile|Nile River]], the fort was largely surrounded by both dunes and coastal lines.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

There are multiple reasons that caused the decline of the Pelusium fortress. During its existence, events such as the Bubonic Plague appeared in the Mediterranean for the first time and multiple fires within the fortress occurred&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;  Conquest from the Persians as well as a decrease in trade could also be attributed to the increase also may have lead to an increase in abandonment. Officially, natural reasons are what led to Pelusium falling apart such as tectonic motions.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;  The official desertion of the site is attributed to the time of the crusades.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

=== Fortress of Jaffa ===
Jaffa Fortress was prominent during the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] period of Egypt. It served as both a fortress and a port on the Mediterranean coast. To this day, Jaffa serves as a primary Egyptian port.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Aaron A. Burke, et al. “Excavations of the New Kingdom Fortress in Jaffa, 2011–2014: Traces of Resistance to Egyptian Rule in Canaan.” ''American Journal of Archaeology'', vol. 121, no. 1, 2017, pp. 85–133. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/10.3764/aja.121.1.0085.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally under the control of the Canaanites, the site fell under the control of the Egyptian Empire. Because of a lack of evidence, it is unclear as to what exactly caused the succession from Canaanite to Egyptian occupation.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; During the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]], the site was successfully in holding campaigns from Pharaohs of the 18th dynasty.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In terms of its functions, the site held multiple roles. It is suggested that Jaffa's primary function was to serve as a granary for the Egyptian Army.

Rameses gate, which is dated to the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]], serves as a connection to the fortress. Ramparts were also discovered with the fortress Upon excavation, the site hosted multiple items such as bowls, imported jars, pot stands, and beer and bread which further emphasizes the importance of these items to the area.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The discovery of these objects show a close connection between the storing of food and the creation of ceramic items.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Mastaba ==
Mastabas are burial tombs that hold royal significance. As chosen by Egyptian rulers, many of the tombs found throughout time were located along the Nile river.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;L. E. R. “Two Mastaba Chambers.” ''Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin'', vol. 8, no. 45, 1910, pp. 19–20. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4423469.&lt;/ref&gt; The structural exterior regarding Mastabas varies throughout history but there is a noticeable evolution of the course of Egyptian dynasties. The Mastabas of the First Egyptian Dynasty would be created through the use of stepped bricks.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;Badawy, Alexander. “The Ideology of the Superstructure of the Mastaba-Tomb in Egypt.” ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', vol. 15, no. 3, 1956, pp. 180–183. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/542310.&lt;/ref&gt; The design would then evolve by the time of the Fourth Dynasty as the structural exterior change from brick to stone.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The reasoning behind the stepped designs of Mastabas is connected to the idea of "accession".&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Lateral penetration was a concern in when constructing tombs. In order to prevent damage to the structure, brickwork layers were placed around the base of structure.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Mastabas from the old empire, took upon a pyramid design structure.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This design was largely reserved for rulers, such as the king, and his family as a means for burial.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Other design characteristics regarding Mastabas from the old empire include having rectangular outlines, walls that were slanted which were made of stone and brick materials, and having the axis of a building run both North and South.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Multiple elements make up the interior of Mastabas such as an offering chamber, statues for the dead, and a vault beneath which held sarcophagi.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; By the end of the old Empire, the usage of these tombs were abandoned.[[File:Pyramid_of_Ahmose,_Abydos,_1998.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pyramid_of_Ahmose,_Abydos,_1998.png|thumb|The Pyramid of Ahmose illustrates the decrease in structural design quality of New Kingdom Egypt.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14068">The '''Architectural Technologist''', also known as a '''Building Technologist''', provides technical [[building design]] services  and solutions and is trained in [[architectural technology]], building technical design and [[construction]]. Architectural Technologists apply the science of [[architecture]] and typically concentrate on the technology of building, design technology and construction. They can or may negotiate the [[construction project]], and manage the process from conception through to completion, typically focusing on the technical aspects of a building project. The training of an architectural technologist concentrates on the ever-increasingly complex technical aspects in a building project, but matters of aesthetics, space, light and circulation are also involved within the technical design, leading the professional to assume decisions which are also non-technical.&lt;ref&gt; Breakfast with Arup: Tuesday 11 December 2012, Paul Nuttall, Director, Building Engineering London, Arup In this talk, Paul Nuttall shares his insights on designing buildings in the 21st Century. The presentation explains how the work of the architect, engineer and technologist are related / similar with a different optic and a different approach / philosophy of the project.  The video is widely available on youtube and other websites. &lt;/ref&gt;
    
Most architectural technologists are employed in architectural and engineering firms, or with municipal authorities; but many provide independent professional services directly to clients,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workingincanada.gc.ca/report-eng.do?noc=2251&amp;action=search_occupation_confirm Architectural Technologists and Technicians], Working in Canada, Government information website&lt;/ref&gt; although restricted by law in some countries. Others work in product development or sales with manufacturers.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Hong-Kong]] (Chartered Architectural Technologist), [[Canada]] (Architectural Technologist or Applied Science Technologist), [[Argentina]] (M.M.O Maestro Mayor de Obras / Chartered Architecture &amp; Building Science Technologist) and other nations, they have many abilities which are extremely useful in a technological sense to work alongside architects, engineers and other professionals - the training of a technologist  provides skills in building and architectural technology. It is an important role in the current building climate. Architectural technologists may be directors or shareholders of an architectural firm (where permitted by the jurisdiction and legal structure). To become an architectural technologist, a four-year degree (or equivalent) in Architectural Technology is required, which can be followed by a Master's Degree, with structured professional and occupational experience.

==By country==

===Canada===
Most [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] in Canada have an association representing architectural technologists and technicians. On behalf of the public, the [[provincial government]]s have granted the provincial architect's associations with the privilege to regulate the profession.

In the province of [[Ontario]], there were protracted efforts by the Association of Architectural Technologists of Ontario (AATO) to persuade the provincial government and the Ontario Association of Architects (OAA) that the public may be served by having technicians and technologists also design small buildings. In 2003, OAA's efforts to work with AATO failed and, instead, OAA established a relationship with the Ontario Associated of Certified Engineering Technicians and Technologists (OACETT). This joint effort resulted in the creation of a new association called the Ontario Association for Applied Architectural Sciences (OAAAS). Through OAAAS, a qualified technologist can be licensed by the OAA as a Licensed Technologist OAA, with authority to design small buildings. In 2011, OACETT withdrew and OAA embraced OAAAS as its Technology Program.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland [[Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland|RIAI]] declares being the leading professional body for Architectural Technologists in Ireland. The RIAI recognises the professional Architectural Technologist as a technical designer, skilled in the application and integration of construction technologies in the building design process. RIAI Architectural Technologists are recognised as professional partners to Architects in the delivery of exemplary buildings in the Republic of Ireland and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riai.ie/uploads/files/RIAI_Standard_Knowledge_Skill_Competence_Architectural_Technologist_2010.pdf RIAI Standard of Knowledge, Skill and Competence for Practice as an Architectural Technologist (2010)], as published on RIAI website&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland has always prevented its technician members to provide a full architectural service. Many qualified architectural technologists believe that a conflict of interest exists, that the RIAI represents architects and cannot adequately defend the interests of architectural technologists: "The RIAI acts as the Registration Body and Competent Authority for "Architects" in Ireland and only provides support services for Irish AT'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Irish-register-Architectural-Technologists-3788787.S.116501217 "An Irish Register for Architectural Technologists" Linkedin conversation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another representative body is the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists [[Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists|(CIAT)]]. The technical membership of the RIAI (RIAI tech) is equivalent to the technician membership of CIAT (TCIAT). Chartered members of CIAT (MCIAT) are qualified and recognised to lead a project from inception through to completion. The RIAI and the CIAT were represented within the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB) which advised the Minister for the Environment on matters relating to the Building Regulations. BRAB is no longer active.&lt;ref&gt;Refer to BRAB (Building Regulations Advisory Body) as per the [http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/BuildingStandards/BRAB/ Irish Minister for the Environment website]&lt;/ref&gt;  CIAT is now challenging the Building Control Regulations 2014, which are depriving its members from providing full architectural services in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2014/en.si.2014.0009.pdf Building Control Regulations 2014] as published by the Irish Government&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish Government appears to have no valid reason to prevent CIAT members from practising in the Republic of Ireland. The restrictions imposed on members of the CIAT are viewed as anti-competitive and in breach of European Law for free movement of services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2014-000236+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=en Parliamentary question from MEP Mairead McGuinness as published on the European Commission website: "On 1 March 2014 national legislation, the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013, will come into force in Ireland. The new legislation precludes chartered architectural technologists(1) from providing their current professional services within the building environment. In anticipation of the implementation of the regulations, chartered architectural technologists are reporting a number of difficulties, such as restrictions reducing the number of members of the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) who can bid for projects due to commence after March 2014. They say that this results in a loss of potential clients as well as economic loss. Does the Commission interpret the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2013 as a breach of EC law, specifically legislation relating to competition and the free market? Does the Commission feel that the new legislation prevents chartered architectural technologists from earning a living in their field of training and expertise(2)?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The CIAT is awaiting for an opinion from the European Commission on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140321022820/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2014-000236&amp;language=EN Answer to parliamentary question] given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission as published on the European Commission website: "The Commission is aware of the introduction of a register for architects and building surveyors by the Building Control Act of 2007. On 1 March 2014 this regulation will be amended to circumscribe the profile of professionals who can design, inspect and certify for compliance all buildings greater than 40 square meters. Such regulatory protection, for a profession with not only significant safety but also environmental and urban impacts, is common across many Members States and as such Ireland is not a minority in seeking to reassure that standards are made, met and maintained.
The Commission has received a number of complaints raising concerns that the actions of the Irish government and the impact of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulation 2013 pose a breach of EC law in areas on the recognition of professional qualifications, freedom of movement and, with specific regard to its impact on Architectural Technologists.
Commission services are currently examining the issues raised to determine any possible contraventions of EC law and if any actions may be necessary in such cases."&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]] the profession is by the South African Institute of Architectural Technologists SAIAT.&lt;ref&gt;Website of the South African Institute of Architectural Technologists [http://www.saiat.org.za/ SAIAT]&lt;/ref&gt; Senior architectural technologists (10 years or more in practice) enjoy the same statute than architects. The [[South African Institute of Architects]] (SAIA) explains that: "Architecture can be practiced in one of four categories of registered person, namely professional architect, professional senior architectural technologist, professional technologist or professional draughtsperson. The possibility of progression from one category to the next has been provided for in the Regulations."&lt;ref&gt;refer to the website of the South African Institute of Architects [http://saia.org.za/education_careers.php SAIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210063530/http://saia.org.za/education_careers.php |date=December 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, chartered architectural technologists enjoy the same status as architects. They deliver similar services with a different orientation. The Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists [[Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists|CIAT]] regulates the profession. CIAT defines chartered architectural technologists as follow: Chartered Architectural Technologists provide architectural design services and solutions. They are specialists in the science of architecture, building design and construction and form the link between concept and construction. They negotiate the construction project and manage the process from conception through to completion. Chartered Architectural Technologists, MCIAT, may practise on their own account or with fellow Chartered Architectural Technologists, architects, engineers, surveyors and other professionals within the construction industry. As professionals adhering to a Code of Conduct, they are required to obtain and maintain mandatory Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) if providing services directly to clients.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Lancashire County Council website: "[http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/consumer-advice/consumer-advice-information/details.aspx?doc_id=292603&amp;cat_id=12 Consumer Advice]"&lt;/ref&gt; They specify products with reference to the ''[[RIBA Product Selector]]'', ''Architects Standard Catalogue'', ''Barbour Index''&lt;ref name="Yeomans2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David T Yeomans|author2=Stephen Emmitt|title=Specifying Buildings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ota1ylQwWjwC&amp;pg=PT207|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=23 April 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-36538-6|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; and trade literature.

'''Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar''' (14 April 1891&amp;nbsp;– 6 December 1956), popularly known as '''Babasaheb Ambedkar''', was an Indian [[jurist]], [[economist]], [[politician]] and [[Social Reformer|social reformer]] who inspired the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]] and campaigned against social [[discrimination]] towards the [[Untouchability|untouchables]] (''[[Dalit]]s''), while also supporting the rights of women and [[Labour movement|labour]].&lt;ref name="firstpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|title=Rescuing Ambedkar from pure Dalitism: He would've been India's best Prime Minister|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106214027/http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|archivedate=6 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"&gt;Bryant, Edwin.

Ambedkar was a prolific student earning [[doctorate]]s in economics from both [[Columbia University]] and the [[London School of Economics]] and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics, and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|title=Archives released by LSE reveal BR Ambedkar's time as a scholar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050301/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer.

Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school [[peon]], and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water".&lt;ref name = "Waiting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|others= Frances Pritchett, translator |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html |title=Waiting for a Visa|first= B.

Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to [[Satara district|Satara]] two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons&amp;nbsp;– Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao&amp;nbsp;– and two daughters&amp;nbsp;– Manjula and Tulasa&amp;nbsp;– of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was ''Sakpal'' but his father registered his name as ''Ambadawekar'' in school, meaning he comes from his native village '[[Ambadawe]]' in Ratnagiri district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/  Daily Loksatta News Paper dated -14/04/2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020000741/http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/ |date=20 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/  Daily Loksatta Dated-14/04/2016] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020000741/http://www.loksatta.com/pune-news/about-name-of-ambadve-village-1227278/ |date=20 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loksatta.com/kgtocollege-news/international-standard-educational-complex-at-original-village-of-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-446635/lite/   Daily Loksatta Dated 18/04/2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020002119/http://www.loksatta.com/kgtocollege-news/international-standard-educational-complex-at-original-village-of-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-446635/lite/ |date=20 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-MUM-ambedkars-teacher-family-saving-memories-of-ambedkar-5489831-NOR.html|title=आंबेडकर गुरुजींचं कुटुंब जपतंय सामाजिक वसा, कुटुंबानं सांभाळल्या 'त्या' आठवणी|author=|date=26 December 2016|website=bhaskar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Ambavadekar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263871 |title=Bhim, Eklavya |publisher=outlookindia.com |accessdate=17 July 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811223316/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263871| archivedate= 11 August 2010 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Devrukhe]] [[Brahmin]] teacher, Krishna Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from "Ambadawekar" to his own surname "Ambedkar" in school records.&lt;ref name="m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com"/&gt;

==Education==
===Post-secondary education===
In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at [[Elphinstone High School]]. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, his marriage to a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai, was [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged]].&lt;ref name="Columbia2"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| title = In the 1900s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106043617/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| archivedate = 6 January 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate studies at the University of Bombay===
[[File:Young Ambedkar.gif|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a student]]
In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered [[Elphinstone College]], which was affiliated to the [[University of Bombay]], becoming the first untouchable to do so. In his book, ''The Buddha and his Dhamma'', that when he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.&lt;ref name="Columbia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/00_pref_unpub.html unpublished preface of "The Buddha and his Dhamma"], cite 5th para&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.&lt;ref name="Columbia3"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| title = In the 1910s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123170145/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| archivedate = 23 November 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postgraduate studies at Columbia University===
In 1913, Ambedkar moved to the United States at the age of 22. He had been awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] ([[Gaekwad]] of [[Princely State of Baroda|Baroda]]) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at [[Wallach Hall|Livingston Hall]] with Naval Bhathena, a [[Parsi]] who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in Economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, ''Ancient Indian Commerce''. Ambedkar was influenced by [[John Dewey]] and his work on democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|title=Ambedkar teacher|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403032535/http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|archivedate=3 April 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 he completed his second thesis, ''National Dividend of India&amp;nbsp;– A Historic and Analytical Study'', for another M.A., and finally he received his PhD in Economics in 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|title=Bhimrao Ambedkar|work=columbia.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210115211/http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|archivedate=10 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his third thesis, after he left for London. On 9 May, he presented the paper ''[[Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development]]'' before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]].

===Postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics===

In October 1916, he enrolled for the [[Bar examination|Bar course]] at [[Gray's Inn]], and at the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine.&lt;ref name="Columbia3" /&gt; He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution".&lt;ref name="firstpost.com"/&gt; In 1922, he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn and In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics. His third and fourth Doctorates (LL.D, Columbia, 1952 and D.Litt., Osmania, 1953) were conferred ''honoris causa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wx218EFVU8MC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=ambedkar%20D'Litt#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20D'Litt|title=Dalit Movement in India and Its Leaders, 1857-1956|first=Rāmacandra|last=Kshīrasāgara|date=1 January 1994|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.

==Opposition to untouchability==
[[File:Ambedkar Barrister.jpg|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a barrister in 1922]]
As Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. He described the incident in his autobiography, ''[[Waiting for a Visa]]''.&lt;ref name="Rewriting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambedkar|first1=Dr. B.R.|title=Waiting for a Visa|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|website=columbia.edu|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=15 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624202609/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|archivedate=24 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keer |first1=Dhananjay |title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission |year=1971 |origyear=1954 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location=Mumbai |isbn=978-8171542376 |oclc=123913369 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he became Professor of Political Economy in the [[Sydenham College|Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics]] in Mumbai. Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first= Ian |editor-last= Harris |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0rwiLKm3LGUC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ambedkar+discriminated+at+Sydenham+College+of+Comme#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20discriminated%20at%20Sydenham%20College%20of%20Comme |title=Buddhism and politics in twentieth-century Asia |publisher=Continuum International Group |isbn= 9780826451781 |date= 2001-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the [[Southborough Committee]], which was preparing the [[Government of India Act 1919]]. At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating separate [[electoral district|electorates]] and [[reservation in India|reservations]] for untouchables and other religious communities.&lt;ref name=Tejani&gt;{{cite book|last=Tejani|first=Shabnum|title=Indian secularism : a social and intellectual history, 1890-1950|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-0253220448|pages=205–210|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xtrPKa59j4C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22ambedkar%22+%22+Southborough+Committee%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ambedkar%22%20%22%20Southborough%20Committee%22|accessdate=17 July 2013|chapter=From Untouchable to Hindu Gandhi, Ambedkar and Depressed class question 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he began the publication of the weekly ''Mooknayak'' (''Leader of the Silent'') in Mumbai with the help of [[Shahu of Kolhapur]] i.e. Shahu IV (1874–1922).&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. [[Dhananjay Keer]] notes that "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the Doctor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=B-2d6jzRmBQC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission|last=Keer|first=Dhananjay|date=1995|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=9788171542376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5u9hDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;lpg=PT30&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=7 Reformers who Change the World|last=Mookherji|first=Kalyani|date=101-01-01|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them. His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution [[Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha]], intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "[[Dalit|outcastes]]", at the time referred to as depressed classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |title=Dr. Ambedkar |accessdate=12 January 2012 |publisher=National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008195805/http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |archivedate=8 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the defence of Dalit rights, he started five periodicals - ''Mooknayak'' (the leader of the dumb, 1920), ''Bahishkrit Bharat'' (Ostracized India, 1924), ''Samta'' (Equality, 1928), ''Janata'' (The People, 1930), and ''Prabuddha Bharat'' (Enlightened India, 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2017/07/ambedkars-journalism-and-its-significance-today/|title=Ambedkar’s journalism and its significance today|date=2017-07-05|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|title=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|website=velivada.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://marathivishwakosh.maharashtra.gov.in/khandas/khand17/index.php/23-2015-01-15-05-42-45/9964-2012-06-14-09-33-10?showall=&amp;start=12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prahaar.in/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC/|title=पत्रकार डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर {{!}}|website=prahaar.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mahamtb.com/Encyc/2017/12/6/Article-on-journalist-babasaheb-Ambedkar-by-ravindra-gole.html|title=पत्रकार आंबेडकर|website=mahamtb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S|first=Kamble, Rajeev|date=2002-12-31|title=Dr Ambedkar as a journalist a study|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/104917|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beedlive.com/newsdetail?cat=Madhyam&amp;id=2046&amp;news=%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89.%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE.html|title=डॉ.बाबासाहेब आंबेडकरांची आदर्श पत्रकारिता|website=beedlive.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mahanews.gov.in/Home/FrontMantralayDetails.aspx?str=utYf/MWKOh8=|title=डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर एक बहुआयामी व्यक्तीमत्त्व - डॉ. गंगाधर पानतावणे|website=mahanews.gov.in|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Joseph|title=B.

By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against [[untouchability]]. He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources.

In 1930, Ambedkar launched Kalaram Temple movement after three months of preparation. About 15,000 volunteers assembled at [[Kalaram Temple]] satygraha making one of the greatest processions of [[Nashik]]. The procession was headed by a military band, a batch of scouts, women and men walked in discipline, order and determination to see the god for the first time.

In 1932, British announced the formation of a separate electorate for "Depressed Classes" in the [[Communal Award]]. [[Gandhi]] fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poona Pact – 1932|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|website=Britannica.com|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''|accessdate=29 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073354/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambekar vs Gandhi: A Part That Parted|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Outlook|date=20 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427033738/http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum to showcase Poona Pact|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=25 September 2007|quote=Read 8th Paragraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017053453/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the [[Yerwada Central Jail]] of [[Poona]].

Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the [[Communal Award]] earlier proposed by British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]].

In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the [[Government Law College, Bombay]], a position he held for two years. He also served as the chairman of Governing body of [[Ramjas College]], University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath.&lt;ref&gt;http://thecampusconnect.com/7-interesting-historical-facts-about-ramjas-college-university-of-delhi/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books.&lt;ref name="Columbia5"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| title = In the 1930s| format = PHP| accessdate = 2 August 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906055230/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| archivedate= 6 September 2006 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]], but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Columbia5"/&gt; He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.

In 1936, Ambedkar founded the [[Independent Labour Party (India)|Independent Labour Party]], which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

After the [[Lahore resolution]] (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled ''Thoughts on Pakistan'', which analysed the concept of "Pakistan" in all its aspects. Ambedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to the Muslims. He proposed that the provincial boundaries of Punjab and Bengal should be redrawn to separate the Muslim and non-Muslim majority parts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite "understand the nature of their own demand". Scholar Venkat Dhulipala states that ''Thoughts on Pakistan'' "rocked Indian politics for a decade". It determined the course of dialogue between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for the [[Partition of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sialkoti |first=Zulfiqar Ali |title=An Analytical Study of the Punjab Boundary Line Issue during the Last Two Decades of the British Raj until the Declaration of 3 June 1947 |journal=Pakistan Journal of History and Culture |volume=XXXV |number=2 |year=2014 |url=http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |p=73–76 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402094202/http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dhulipala |first=Venkat |title=Creating a New Medina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z6TBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2 |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-05212-3 |ref={{sfnref|Dhulipala, Creating a New Medina|2015}} |pp=124,&amp;nbsp;134,&amp;nbsp;142–144,&amp;nbsp;149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]'', Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual hierarchy of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], as separate from Untouchables. Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the [[Scheduled Castes Federation]], although it performed poorly in the 1946 elections for [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. Later he was elected into the constituent assembly of [[Bengal]] where [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was in power.&lt;ref name="Firstpost 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Attention BJP: When the Muslim League rescued Ambedkar from the 'dustbin of history' | website=Firstpost | date=15 April 2015 |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | accessdate=5 September 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920032027/http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | archivedate=20 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a member of Rajya Sabha, probably an appointed member. He tried to enter Lok Sabha again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died.

Ambedkar also criticised Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the [[Partition of India]], he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No words can adequately express the great and many evils of polygamy and concubinage, and especially as a source of misery to a Muslim woman. Take the caste system. Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. [...] [While slavery existed], much of its support was derived from Islam and Islamic countries. While the prescriptions by the Prophet regarding the just and humane treatment of slaves contained in the Koran are praiseworthy, there is nothing whatever in Islam that lends support to the abolition of this curse. But if slavery has gone, caste among Musalmans [Muslims] has remained.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambedkar|first=Bhimrao Ramji|title=Pakistan or the Partition of India|year=1946|publisher=Thackers Publishers|location=Bombay|chapter=Chapter X: Social Stagnation|chapterurl=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|pages=215–219|accessdate=8 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912185829/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|archivedate=12 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opposition to Aryan invasion theory==
Ambedkar viewed the [[Shudras]] as Aryan and adamantly rejected the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryan invasion theory]], describing it as "so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago" in his 1946 book ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]''.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"/&gt;

Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally being "part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society", but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on [[Brahmins]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin. ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. pp. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arvind Sharma]], Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge ''anās''  in [[Rig Veda]] 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the [[Human nose|nose]].&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 849.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:

{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"/&gt;}}

Ambedkar disputed various hypotheses of the Aryan homeland being [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|outside India]], and concluded the Aryan homeland was India itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 851.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ambedkar, the Rig Veda says Aryans, Dāsa and Dasyus were competing religious groups, not different peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 854-5, 863.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting India's Constitution==

Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new Congress-led government invited Ambedkar to serve as the nation's first Law Minister, which he accepted. On 29 August, he was appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and was appointed by the Assembly to write India's new Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Facts of Constituent Assembly |work=Parliament of India |publisher=National Informatics Centre |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/facts.htm |quote=On 29 August 1947, the Constituent Assembly set up an Drafting Committee under the Chairmanship of B.

[[Granville Austin]] described the [[Indian Constitution]] drafted by Ambedkar as 'first and foremost a social document'. 'The majority of India's constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Oxford University Press |title = The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation |first= Granville |last= Austin |year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text prepared by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections for a wide range of [[civil liberties]] for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of [[reservation in India|reservations]] of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled castes]] and [[scheduled tribe]]s and [[Other Backward Class]], a system akin to [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Constituent Assembly Debates Clause wise Discussion on the Draft Constitution 15th November 1948 to 8th January 1949|url=http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|accessdate= 12 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524143208/http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|archivedate= 24 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures.&lt;ref name=Sheth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheth|first=D.

===Opposition to Article 370===
Ambedkar opposed [[Article 370]] of the Constitution of India, which granted a special status to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and which was included against his wishes. [[Balraj Madhok]] reportedly said, Ambedkar had clearly told the Kashmiri leader, [[Sheikh Abdullah]]: "You wish India should protect your borders, she should build roads in your area, she should supply you food grains, and Kashmir should get equal status as India. But Government of India should have only limited powers and Indian people should have no rights in Kashmir. To give consent to this proposal, would be a treacherous thing against the interests of India and I, as the Law Minister of India, will never do it." Then Sk. Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to Gopal Swami Ayyangar, who in turn approached Sardar Patel, saying Nehru had promised Sk. Abdullah the special status. Patel got the Article passed while Nehru was on a foreign tour. On the day the article came up for discussion, Ambedkar did not reply to questions on it but did participate on other articles. All arguments were done by Krishna Swami Ayyangar.&lt;ref name=Jamanadas&gt;{{cite web |last=amanadas |first=Dr. K. |title=Kashmir Problem From Ambedkarite Perspective |url=http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |publisher=ambedkar.org |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225153/http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Narender|title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes|year=1994|publisher=Utpal Publications|location=Delhi|url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|accessdate=17 September 2013|chapter=Chapter 26: Article 370|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905070936/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilak |title=Why Ambedkar refused to draft Article 370 |url=http://india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207095529/http://www.india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 February 2004 |publisher=Indymedia India |accessdate=17 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing the draft of India's constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had [[neuropathic pain]] in his legs, and was taking [[insulin]] and homoeopathic medicines.

A memorial for Ambedkar was established in his [[Delhi]] house at 26 Alipur Road. His birthdate is celebrated as a public holiday known as [[Ambedkar Jayanti]] or [[Bhim Jayanti]].

Ambedkar's political philosophy has given rise to a large number of political parties, publications and workers' unions that remain active across India, especially in [[Maharashtra]].

'''''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation''''', a [[style guide]], prescribes the most widely used [[legal citation]] system in the United States. ''The Bluebook'' is compiled by the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' Association, the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. Currently, it is in its 20th edition. It is so named because its cover is blue.

''The Bluebook'' is taught and used at a majority of [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]], and is also used in a majority of [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal courts]]. Alternative legal citation style guides exist, including the ''[[Maroonbook]]'' and the ''[[ALWD Citation Manual]]''. There are also several "house" citation styles used by legal publishers in their works.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] uses its own unique citation style in its opinions, even though most of the justices and their [[law clerk]]s obtained their [[Legal education in the United States|legal education]] at law schools that use ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref name="Salmon1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Susie|title=Shedding the Uniform: Beyond 'A Uniform System of Citation' to a More Efficient Fit|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=2016|volume=99|page=792|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5289&amp;context=mulr|accessdate=28 April 2017|publisher=Marquette University|location=Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many [[state court (United States)|state courts]] have their own citation rules that take precedence over ''The Bluebook'' for documents filed with those courts. Some of the local rules are simple modifications to ''The Bluebook'' system, such as [[Maryland]]'s requirement that citations to Maryland cases include a reference to the official Maryland reporter. [[Delaware]]'s [[Supreme Court of Delaware|Supreme Court]] has promulgated rules of citation for unreported cases markedly different from ''The Bluebook'' standards, and custom in that state as to the citation format of the [[Delaware Code]] also differs from ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 Rule 14(g)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190900/http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 |date=2016-03-03 }}, Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware.&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, notably [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], and [[Michigan]], the local rules are different from ''The Bluebook'' in that they use their own style guides. Attorneys in those states who practice both in federal court and state court must be able to switch seamlessly between citation styles depending upon whether their work product is intended for a federal or state court.

== History ==

According to Harvard, the origin of ''The Bluebook'' was a pamphlet for proper citation forms for articles in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' written by its editor, [[Erwin Griswold]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hurt, ''The Bluebook at Eighteen: Reflecting and Ratifying Current Trends in Legal Scholarship'', 82 {{smallcaps|Ind. L.J.}} 49, 51-52 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a recent study by two [[Yale]] librarians,&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro &amp; Julie Graves Krishnaswami, ''The Secret History of the Bluebook'', [http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ShapiroKrishnaswami_ONLINEPDF.pdf 100 {{smallcaps|Minn. L. Rev.}} 1563] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard's claim is incorrect. They trace the origin of ''The Bluebook'' to a 1920 publication by [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] at Yale on how to write law journal materials for the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Karl N. Llewellyn, The Writing of a Case Note}} (1920). This booklet had a blue cover, which Shapiro and Krishnaswami point out is "appropriate for its University," whose official color is blue.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors point out that some of the material in the 1926 first edition of ''The Bluebook'' (as well as that in a 1922 Harvard precursor to it published as ''Instructions for Editorial Work'') duplicate material in the 1920 Llewellen booklet and its 1921 successor, a blue pamphlet that the ''Yale Law Journal'' published as ''Abbreviations and Form of Citation''.&lt;ref&gt;According to Shapiro and Krishnaswami:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bluebook'' 1 (1926) has approximately 30 sentences in common with ''Yale Law Journal'' ’s ''Abbreviations and Form of Citation'' (1921), as well as many of the sample citations, all of the proofreading signs, and virtually all of the items in the long list of abbreviations. They both begin with the same sentence: “This pamphlet does not pretend to include a complete list of abbreviations or all the necessary data as to form.” The subtitle of the ''Bluebook'' is “Abbreviations and Form of Citation.” The ''Jones v. Smith'' Connecticut citation that is the basic case citation example used by the Yale precursors back to Llewellyn-Field is the basic case example used in Bluebook 1. The Haines ''Yale Law Journal'' citation that is the basic periodical citation example used by the Yale precursors back to Llewellyn-Field is the basic periodical example used in ''Bluebook'' 1. Most of the section on treatises is identical between 1921 and 1926.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years before the first edition of ''The Bluebook'' appeared, Yale, Columbia, and several other law journals "worked out a tentative citation plan," but Harvard initially opposed it "because of skepticism as to the results to be attained and in part because of a desire not to deviate from our forms especially at the solicitation of other Reviews." Eventually, Harvard "reversed course" and joined the coalition by 1926. According to Judge [[Henry J. Friendly]], "Attorney General [Herbert] Brownell, whom I had known ever since law school—he was Editor-in-Chief of the ''Yale Law Journal'' the year I was at the ''Harvard Law Review'' and he and I and two others [from Columbia and Pennsylvania] were the authors of the first edition of the ''Bluebook''."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Dorsen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9ctStY3580C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Henry Friendly, Greatest Judge of His Era}}] 71 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the 1926 ''A Uniform System of Citation'' was green. The color was "brown from the second (1928) edition through the fifth (1936) edition. It was only with the sixth (1939) edition that it became blue."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Shapiro and Krishnaswami.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the cover of the book was changed from brown to a "more patriotic blue" allegedly to avoid comparison with a color associated with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Darby Dickerson, ''An Un-Uniform System of Citation: Surviving with the New Bluebook'', 26 {{smallcaps|Stetson L. Rev.}} 53, 58-60 (1996). According to Shapiro and Krishnaswami, however, "The abandonment of brown is often attributed to the association of that color with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, but that idea appears to trace to a joke by Alan Strasser," in [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hcrcl12&amp;id=515&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;terms=Alan%20Strasser&amp;termtype=phrase&amp;set_as_cursor=10 ''Technical Due Process: ?''], 12 {{smallcaps|Harv. C.R.-C.L. Rev.}} 507, 508 (1977). Strasser states, referring to the eleventh edition's change of cover color to white with a blue border promising a "new life," that "the 1939 ''Blue Book'' had electrified the nation by parading patriotic blue covers instead of the Germanic brown ones that had disgraced the 1936 edition." ''Id''. (footnote omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; The eleventh edition, published in 1967, was actually white with a blue border.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160302144344/http://blawg.law.sc.edu/2015/07/13/all-the-fun-facts-about-the-bluebook/ ''All the Fun Facts about the Bluebook''].&lt;/ref&gt; The cover color returned to blue in the twelfth edition of 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Strasser, at 508. Strasser states that the first printing was a "timid" blue-gray but later printings were a "more self-assured" navy blue. ''Id''. n.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full text of the first (1926) through the fifteenth (1991) editions are available on the official website.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716192512/https://www.legalbluebook.com/public/introduction.aspx Introduction]'', {{smallcaps|Bluebook.com}}, (2010), (archived from the [https://www.legalbluebook.com/public/introduction.aspx original] June 24, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bluebook'' uses two different styles.  The first is used by practitioners in preparing court documents and memoranda, while the second is used primarily in academic settings, such as [[law reviews]] and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Deborah E. Bouchoux}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=cite+checker+bouchoux&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yd6_SArt3B&amp;sig=uWjCbuvyeYJSxn0kLnnTwy7kz-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9ppr1vPDKAhVKOSYKHdmVC4cQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=cite%20checker%20bouchoux&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Cite-Checker: A Hands-on Guide to Learning Citation Form}}] 9 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter uses specific formatting to identify types of references, such as the use of [[small caps]] for books, newspapers, and law reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A rule of thumb used by many is to see if the formatting can be reproduced on a [[typewriter]]—if so, it is used by practitioners, if it requires typesetting, it is used for academic articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, ''The Bluebook'' was "the main guide and source of authority" on legal references for the past 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|William H. Putman}}, {{smallcaps|Legal Research, Analysis, and Writing}} 468 (4th ed. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is recognized as the "gold standard" for legal references in the United States, even though it originally was designed only to help teach law students how to cite cases and other legal material.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although other citation systems exist, they have limited acceptance, and in general, ''The Bluebook'' is followed in legal citation as the most widely accepted citation style.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Putman}}, at 468; {{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 2; Kroski, at 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states have adopted ''The Bluebook'' in full, while others have partially adopted ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Putman}}, at 468-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  States such as Texas have supplements, such as the "Greenbook", that merely address citation issues unique to Texas and otherwise follow ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Brandon D. Quarles &amp; Matthew C. Cordon}}, {{smallcaps|Legal Research for the Texas Practitioner}} 16 (2003); {{smallcaps|The Greenbook: Texas Rules of Form}} iv (12th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==

=== Federal ===
The [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] issues a style guide that is designed to supplement ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Solicitor General's Style Guide}} 1 (Jack Metzler ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  This guide focuses on citation for practitioners, so as an example, only two type faces are used for law reviews, normal and italics.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other changes are also minor, such as moving ''supra'' from before the page referenced to after the page number.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The guide does state that unless explicitly specified otherwise, ''The Bluebook'' rule takes precedence in the event of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State ===
California used to require use of the ''California Style Manual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Edward W. Jessen}}, {{smallcaps|California Style Manual}} 1 (4th ed. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [[California Supreme Court]] issued a rule giving an option of using either the ''California Style Manual'' or ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Calif. R. of Ct. 1.200; {{smallcaps|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation}} 30 (Mary Miles Prince ed., 19th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The two styles are significantly different in citing cases, in use of ''Ibid'' or ''Id.'' (for ''{{lang|la|Idem}}''), and in citing books and journals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://libguides.law.ucla.edu/loader.php?type=d&amp;id=92912 Legal Research and Writing Manual]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', {{smallcaps|UCLA School of Law}} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  Michigan uses a separate official citation system, issued as an administrative order of the Michigan Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;Elan S. Nichols, ''Checklists for Drafting, Formatting, and Submitting Litigation and Other Documents: Instructive Material for Law Students Practicing in Law School Clinics, and Reminders for the Practicing Attorney and Her Staff'', 15 {{smallcaps|T.M. Cooley J. Prac. &amp; Clinical L.}} 57, 58 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary difference is that the Michigan system "omits all periods in citations, uses italics somewhat differently, and does not use 'small caps.'"&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, at 58 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted, Texas merely supplements ''The Bluebook'' with items that are unique to Texas courts, such as citing to cases when Texas was an independent republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 101.&lt;/ref&gt; petition and writ history,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 20-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas Attorney General|Attorney General]] Opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt; and similar issues.

== Reception ==

=== Criticism of ''Bluebook''{{'}}s prolixity ===

At over 500 pages for the 19th edition, ''The Bluebook'' is significantly more complicated than the citation systems used by most other fields. Legal scholars have called for its replacement with a simpler system.&lt;ref name=yale&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/review/the-bluebook-blues The Bluebook Blues]'', 120 {{smallcaps|Yale L.J.}} 850-861 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Chicago]] uses the simplified "[[Maroonbook]]",&lt;ref&gt;80 {{smallcaps|[http://lawreview.uchicago.edu/page/maroonbook The University of Chicago Manual of Legal Citation]}} 1 (Bradley G. Hubbard, Taylor A.R. Meehan, &amp; Kenneth A. Young eds. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; and even simpler systems are in use by other parties.

Judge [[Richard Posner]] is "one of the founding fathers of ''Bluebook'' abolitionism, having advocated it for almost twenty-five years, ever since his 1986 ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''[http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2797&amp;context=journal_articles Goodbye to the Bluebook]'', 53 {{smallcaps|Chi. L. Rev.}} 1343 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject." In a 2011 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' article, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation'' exemplifies hypertrophy in the anthropological sense. It is a monstrous growth, remote from the functional need for legal citation forms, that serves obscure needs of the legal culture and its student subculture.&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He wrote that a cursory look at the Nineteenth Edition "put [him] in mind of Mr. [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]]’s dying words in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''—'The horror! The horror!' "&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Post called it "the most boring piece of intellectual property imaginable." Adam Liptak described it as "a comically elaborate thicket of random and counterintuitive rules about how to cite judicial decisions, law review articles and the like [that] is both grotesque and indispensable." [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/09/the-new-and-much-improved-bluebook-caught-in-the-copyright-cross-hairs/ ''The new (and much improved) ‘Bluebook’ caught in the copyright cross-hairs''], {{smallcaps|Washington Post}}, ''The Volokh Conspiracy'' (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner personally uses a far simpler citation system based largely on the First Edition of the ''Bluebook''. This system, which he includes in a manual he provides for his law clerks, was reprinted in the aforementioned ''Yale Law Journal'' article. At the time of the article, his citation system was 885 ''words'' long, or about two printed pages—far shorter than the 511 pages of the Nineteenth Edition, the 640 pages of the then-current ''ALWD Citation Manual'', or the over 1,000 pages of the ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Manual of Style]]''.&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;

=== ''BabyBlue'' copyright controversy ===
[[File:Cover of Baby Blue's Manual of Legal Citation.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''[[BabyBlue]]'']]
[[File:The Indigo Book cover.png|thumb|''[[Indigo Book]]'' cover]]

Another dispute is over the copyright status of ''The Bluebook''.  Open-source advocates claim that ''The Bluebook'' is not protected under copyright because it is a critical piece of legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;In addition, according to NYU Professor Christopher Sprigman, "the copyright for the 10th edition of the tome, published in 1958, was never renewed, and .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that means it is in the public domain." See [http://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/yale-law-students-support-the-end-of-the-bluebook/?rf=1 ''Yale Law Students Support The End Of The Bluebook''], {{smallcaps|Above the Law}} (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers who represent the Bluebook publishing consortium claim that the "carefully curated examples, explanations and other textual materials" are protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[American Bar Association]] | title=Legal minds differ on whether The Bluebook is subject to copyright protection | date=February 1, 2015 | author=Leslie A. Gordon | url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/legal_minds_differ_on_whether_the_bluebook_is_subject_to_copyright_protecti | access-date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group led by Professor Christopher J. Sprigman at NYU Law School has been preparing a "public-domain implementation of the ''Bluebook''{{’}}s Uniform System of Citation." which his group calls ''BabyBlue''. However, a law firm (Ropes &amp; Gray) representing the Harvard Law Review Association (HLRA) sent him a letter stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e believe that ''[[BabyBlue]]'' may include content identical or substantially similar to content or other aspects of ''The Bluebook'' that constitute original works of authorship protected by copyright, and which are covered by various United States copyright registrations.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

[M]y client has been and remains concerned that the publication and promotion of such a work may infringe the Reviews’ copyright rights in ''The Bluebook'' and ''The Bluebook'' Online, and may cause substantial, irreparable harm to the Reviews and their rights and interests in those works.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

[I]t is our client’s position that the title ''BabyBlue'', or any title consisting of or comprising the word “Blue,” when used on or in connection with your work, would so resemble the ''BLUEBOOK'' Marks as to be likely, to cause confusion, mistake, and/or deception…Accordingly, and to avoid any risk of consumer confusion, my client respectfully demands that you agree (i) not to use the title or name ''BabyBlue'', or any other title or name including the word “blue,” for your work.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter quoted in Jacob Gershman, [https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/12/28/bluebook-critics-incite-copyright-clash/?mod=WSJBlog ''Bluebook Critics Incite Copyright Clash''], {{smallcaps|Wall Street Journal Law Blog}} (Dec. 28, 2015), and in Mike Masnick, ''Harvard Law Review Freaks Out, Sends Christmas Eve Threat Over Public Domain Citation Guide''], in {{smallcaps|Techdirt}} (Dec. 28, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the HLRA letter to Sprigman, over 150 students, faculty, staff and alumni of Harvard Law School signed a petition in support of ''BabyBlue''. Yale and NYU students added their separate petitions supporting ''BabyBlue''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hlrecord.org/2016/02/harvard-law-review-should-welcome-free-citation-manual-not-threaten-lawsuits/ ''Harvard Law Review Should Welcome Free Citation Manual, Not Threaten Lawsuits''], {{smallcaps|Harvard Law Record}} (Feb. 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; A posting in the ''Harvard Law Record'' commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intellectual property claims that the HLR Association made may or may not be spurious. But independent of that, the tactics employed by the HLR Association’s counsel in dealing with Mr. Malamud and Prof. Sprigman are deplorable. The Harvard Law Review claims to be an organization that promotes knowledge and access to legal scholarship. It is a venerated part of the traditions of Harvard Law School. But these actions by the Harvard Law Review speak of competition and not of justice.&lt;ref name="''id''."&gt;''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The posting also suggested that HLRA should "redirect the money it spends on legal fees ($185,664 in 2013)" to a more worthy purpose.&lt;ref name="''id''."/&gt;

David Post commented: "It’s copyright nonsense, and Harvard should be ashamed of itself for loosing its legal hounds to dispense it in order to protect its (apparently fairly lucrative) publication monopoly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/09/the-new-and-much-improved-bluebook-caught-in-the-copyright-cross-hairs/ ''The new (and much improved) ‘Bluebook’ caught in the copyright cross-hairs''], {{smallcaps|Washington Post}}, ''The Volokh Conspiracy'' (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2016, it was announced that the project had changed its name to the ''[[Indigo Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Michael|title=Response|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2806393/Harvard-Response-20160331.pdf|publisher=public.resource.org|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial controversy ==

Revenues from the sale of the ''Bluebook'' are estimated "in the millions of dollars."&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro and Julie Graves Krishnaswami, [http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=308111088105096097087001004108109007054027040080070045096086028073001068126123008002126026116029049096000076016091095116108107016036036048035081098124089024081068068022023075002115125103105125088011113029091090012067007071118120093113072117092124096115&amp;EXT=pdf ''The Secret History of the Bluebook''].&lt;/ref&gt; For the first 50 years, the Harvard Law Review kept 100 percent of the revenues.&lt;ref name="''id''."/&gt; In 1974, the editors of the ''[[Columbia Law Review|Columbia]]'' and ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]s'' and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' apparently discovered this, due to an indiscretion.&lt;ref&gt;According to Joan G. Wexler, Dean and then President of [[Brooklyn Law School]], some members of the ''Harvard Law Review'' disclosed to her at a lunch one day in [[San Francisco]] where they were all summer associates "[w]hat a cash cow" the ''Bluebook'' was for their review. She consulted Professor [[Ralph S. Brown]] at Yale Law School, who taught copyright, and he said "sue them!" See Shapiro and Krishnaswami.&lt;/ref&gt; They complained that Harvard was illegally keeping all profits from the first eleven editions, estimated to total $20,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;W. Duane Benton, ''Developments in the Law – Legal Citation'', 86 {{smallcaps|Yale}} L.J. 197, 202 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; After they threatened to sue, and considerable wrangling, Harvard agreed with them to split the revenue: 40 percent for Harvard, 20 percent each for Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Yale; Harvard would continue to provide the production and distribution services.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Legal technology and future ==

The ''Bluebook'' has also been affected by the disruptions to the legal industry due to [[legal technology]].&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[startup company]] LegalEase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LegalEase official website|url=https://www.legaleasecite.com/bluebook-citation-generator}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched a [[legal citation]] generator that enables its users to create citations in the ''Bluebook'' format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyberg|first1=Cheryl|title=Bluebook 101 Online Citation Generators|url=http://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=375743&amp;p=2550183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phaenopharos khaoyaiensis threaten female.JPG|thumb|[[Aposematism|Aposematic]] display of flightless [[phasmatodea|stick insect]] with brachypterous wings]]
'''Brachyptery''' is an anatomical condition in which an [[animal]] has very reduced [[wing]]s. Such animals or their wings may be described  as "brachypterous".
Brachypterous wings generally are not functional as organs of flight and often seem to be totally functionless and [[vestigiality|vestigial]]. In some species however, wings that are vestigial in the sense of not retaining any function related to flight, may have other functions, such as organs of [[aposematism|aposematic]] display in some [[Orthoptera]] and [[Phasmatodea]]. Brachyptery occurs commonly among insects. An insect species might evolve towards brachyptery in reducing its flight muscles with their associated energy demands, or in avoiding the hazards of flight in windy conditions on oceanic islands, in which flying insects are prone to drowning. Brachyptery also is common in ectoparasitic insects that have no use for wings, and [[inquiline]] insects with [[parasitism|socially parasitic]] life strategies that do not require functional wings.

In some species of [[insect]]s, brachyptery occurs in some members (say in only one [[sex]], or only some [[eusociality|castes]]), whereas fully functional wings occur in [[macropterous]] individuals. Other forms of brachyptery may depend on the temperature at which the insect grew and developed. In winter for example, some species grow reduced wings, whereas in summer they grow fully developed wings that are adequate for migration.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The extreme form of brachyptery, in which no wings grow at all, such as in [[flea]]s or worker [[ant]]s is called [[aptery]].

The '''Technical Research Centre for Dependency Care and Autonomous Living''' (CETpD) is an applied research and technology transfer centre created for the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia|Universitat Politèncica de Catalunya]] and the ''Fundació Hospital Comarcal Sant Antoni Abat'' on behalf of the ''Consorci de Servei a les Persones'' de Vilanova i la Geltrú, with the aim of covering the demand for research and development in the field of [[Gerontechnology]], [[Ambient intelligence|Ambient Intelligence]], Assistive [[Robotics]] and [[usability|User Experience Technologies]].

The CETpD carried out important applied research work and innovation on socially relevant developments, especially on technologies and systems designed to enhance independent living of elderly and disabled people.

== Areas ==

=== Ambient Intelligence ===
[[Ambient intelligence|Ambient Intelligence]] (AmI) implies an environment of distributed computing systems, unobstrusive and often invisible, with user friendly interfaces capable of learning and adapting to the particular needs of the users.
CETpD AmI projects are included in the [[assistive technology|assistance]] field mainly for housing and health application. We are looking for technological solutions that have the potential to include everyone, that are affordable and build trust and confidence directed to improve the quality of life of any person specially elders and disabled.

=== Assistive Robotics ===
The priority lines of work are three:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To develop new architectures of control and forms of signal processing which the robots allow to capture knowledge and being cognitive through the [[human-machine interaction]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To research in the more suitable forms of [[interaction]], so they are motivating and satisfying for the [[user (computing)|user]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* To develop in an effective way [[robotic]] systems that are capable of supplying with personalised individual [[assistive technology|assistance]] to people with dependence (permanent, rehabilitation or convalescence). Therefore, the research implies areas like HRI, control and systems of [[machine learning|computational learning]] in complex, changing and uncertain environments, integrating processes of [[perception]], representation and [[interaction]] with people.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Usability ===
The purpose of the user experience field, [[usability]], is to provide relevant information about users expectations, capabilities and preferences, in order to ensure that products and services would meet end users -and other stakeholders- functional and affective needs. All the CETpD projects incorporates user's experience feedback in the process of contextual product and services development.

=== Balance, Gaits and Falls ===
Gait alterations, balance alterations and falls are major causes of [[disability]] in the elderly population. Such pathologies seriously impair elders' quality of life; furthermore, their consequences have high economic and social impact. Therefore, clinical and epedimiological studies on these pathologies are conducted at the CETpD in order to gain insight into their causes and to find novel therapeutics.

=== Gerontechnology ===
A major objective in geriatrics is to maintain elderly persons' independence to carry out their daily life activities and to interact with their environment. In this regard, [[technology]] may be an essential tool to facilitate elderly persons' [[autonomy]]. At the CETpD, they develop [[technology]] aimed to their environment, as well as remote diagnosis devices designed for early detection of health alterations in frail persons or persons living alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8694">In [[computer processor]]s the '''carry flag''' (usually indicated as the '''C''' flag) is a single [[bit]] in a system [[Status register|status (flag) register]] used to indicate when an [[arithmetic]] [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry]] or borrow has been generated out of the [[Most significant bit|most significant]] [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] bit position. The carry flag enables numbers larger than a single ALU width to be added/subtracted by carrying (adding) a binary digit from a partial addition/subtraction to the [[least significant bit]] position of a more significant word. It is also used to extend [[bit shift]]s and rotates in a similar manner on many processors (sometimes done via a dedicated '''X''' flag). For subtractive operations, two (opposite) conventions are employed as most machines set the carry flag on borrow while some machines (such as the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] and the [[PIC microcontroller|PIC]]) instead reset the carry flag on borrow (and vice versa).

== Uses ==
The carry flag is affected by the result of most arithmetic (and typically several bit wise) instructions and is also used as an input to many of them. Several of these instructions have two forms which either read or ignore the carry. In [[assembly language]]s these instructions are represented by [[Assembly language#Opcode mnemonics and extended mnemonics|mnemonics]] such as ADD/SUB, ADC/SBC (ADD/SUB including carry), SHL/SHR ([[bit shift]]s), ROL/ROR (bit rotates), RCR/RCL (rotate through carry), and so on.&lt;ref name = "intel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.intel.com/design/PentiumII/manuals/24319102.PDF|format = PDF| title=Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2: Instruction Set Reference Manual|accessdate=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the carry flag in this manner enables multi-[[Word (data type)|word]] add, subtract, shift, and rotate operations.

An example is what happens if one were to add 255 and 255 using [[8-bit]] registers. The result should be 510 which is 1_1111_1110 in binary, requiring 9 bits. The 8 least significant bits always stored in the register would be 1111_1110 binary (254 decimal) but since there is carry out of bit 7 (the eight bit), the carry is set, indicating that the result needs 9 bits. The valid 9-bit result is the concatenation of the carry flag with the result.

For x86 ALU size of 8 bits, an 8-bit two's complement interpretation, the addition operation 1111_1111 + 1111_1111 results in 1_1111_1110, Carry_Flag set, Sign_Flag set, and Overflow_Flag clear.

If 1111_1111 represents two's complement signed integer -1 (ADD al,-1), then the interpertation of the result is 1111_1110 because Overflow_Flag is clear, and Carry_Flag is ignored. The sign of the result is negative, because Sign_Flag is set. 1111_1110 is the two's complement form of signed integer -2.

If 1111_1111 represents unsigned integer binary number 255 (ADD al,255), then the interpertation of the result that the Carry_Flag cannot be ignored. The Overflow_Flag and the Sign_Flag are ignored.

Another example may be an 8-bit [[Processor register|register]] with the bit pattern 0101_0101 and the carry flag set; if we execute a ''rotate left through carry'' instruction, the result would be 1010_1011 with the carry flag cleared because the most significant bit (bit 7) was rotated into the carry while the carry was rotated into the least significant bit (bit 0).

The early microprocessors [[Intel 4004]] and [[Intel 8008]] had specific instructions to set as well as reset the carry flag explicitly. However, the later [[Intel 8080]] (and [[Z80]]) did not include an explicit reset carry opcode as this could be done equally fast via one of the bitwise AND, OR or XOR instructions (which do not use the carry flag).

The carry flag is also often used following comparison instructions, which are typically implemented by subtractive operations,  to allow a decision to be made about which of the two compared values is lower than (or greater or equal to) the other.  Branch instructions which examine the carry flag are often represented by [[Assembly language#Opcode mnemonics and extended mnemonics|mnemonics]] such as BCC and BCS to branch if the carry is clear, or branch if the carry is set respectively. When used in this way the carry flag provides a mechanism for comparing the values as unsigned integers. This is in contrast to the [[overflow flag]] which provides a mechanism for comparing the values as signed integer values.

== Carry flag vs. borrow flag ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015|talk=How to improve references in "Carry flag vs. borrow flag"}}
While the carry flag is well-defined for addition, there are two ways in common use to use the carry flag for subtraction operations.

The first uses the bit as a borrow flag, setting it if ''a''&amp;lt;''b'' when computing ''a''−''b'', and a borrow must be performed.  If ''a''≥''b'', the bit is cleared.  A '''subtract with borrow''' (SBB) instruction will compute ''a''−''b''−''C'' = ''a''−(''b''+''C''), while a subtract without borrow (SUB) acts as if the borrow bit were clear.  The [[8080]], [[Z80]], [[Intel MCS-51|8051]], [[x86]]&lt;ref name=intel/&gt; and [[68k]] families (among others) use a borrow bit.

The second takes advantage of the identity that −''x'' = [[Bitwise NOT|not]](''x'')+1 and computes ''a''−''b'' as ''a''+not(''b'')+1.  The carry flag is set according to this addition, and '''subtract with carry''' computes ''a''+not(''b'')+''C'', while subtract without carry acts as if the carry bit were set.  The result is that the carry bit is set if ''a''≥''b'', and clear if ''a''&amp;lt;''b''.  The [[System/360]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=IBM System/360 Principles of Operation |url=http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/360/princOps/A22-6821-0_360PrincOps.pdf |page=28 |id=IBM Form A22-6821-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], [[MSP430]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]] and [[PowerPC]] processors use this convention.  The 6502 is a particularly well-known example because it does not have a subtract ''without'' carry operation, so programmers must ensure that the carry flag is set before every subtract operation where a borrow is not required.

|}

Most commonly, the first alternative is referred to as a "subtract with borrow", while the second is called a "subtract with carry".  However, there are exceptions in both directions; the [[VAX]], [[NS320xx]], and [[Atmel AVR]] architectures use the borrow bit convention, but call their ''a''−''b''−''C'' operation "subtract with carry" (&lt;code&gt;SBWC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SUBC&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SBC&lt;/code&gt;).  The [[PA-RISC]] and [[PICmicro]] architectures use the carry bit convention, but call their ''a''+not(''b'')+''C'' operation "subtract with borrow" (&lt;code&gt;SUBB&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SUBWFB&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;!-- SPARC also uses a borrow bit, and although the opcode is SUBX ("subtract extended"), the text calls it "subtract with carry".--&gt;

The [[ST6/ST7]] 8-bit microcontrollers are perhaps the most confusing of all.  Although they do not have any sort of "subtract with carry" instruction, they do have a carry bit which is set by a subtract instruction, and the convention depends on the processor model.  The ST60 processor uses the "carry" convention, while the ST62 and ST63 processors use the "borrow" convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ST6 Family Programming Manual |version=Revision 2.0 |date=October 2004 |publisher=[[STMicroelectronics]] |url=http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/programming_manual/4d/05/d1/a5/a0/9e/40/8b/CD00004606.pdf/files/CD00004606.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00004606.pdf#page=42 |page=42 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musicians use [[Chord (music)#Notation|various kinds]] of '''chord names and symbols''' in different contexts, to represent [[Chord (music)|musical chords]]. In most [[List of popular music genres|genres]] of [[popular music]], including [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[rock music|rock]], a chord name and the corresponding symbol are typically composed of one or more of the following parts:
# The [[root (chord)|root note]] (e.g., C).
# The [[#Chord quality|chord quality]] (e.g., [[Minor chord|minor]] or lowercase m, or the symbols ° or + for diminished and augmented chords; quality is usually omitted for major chords). 
# The [[Interval (music)#Number|number]] of an [[Interval (music)|interval]] (e.g., seventh, or 7), or less often, its full [[Interval (music)#Interval number and quality|name or symbol]] (e.g., [[major seventh]], maj7, or M7).
# The [[#Altered fifths|altered fifth]] (e.g., [[augmented fifth|sharp five]], or {{Music|#}}5).
# An additional interval number (e.g., add 2 or add2), in [[added tone chord]]s. For instance, the name [[augmented seventh chord|C augmented seventh]], and the corresponding symbol Caug&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, or C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, are both composed of parts 1, 2, and 3.
# Often, a bass note other than the root is indicated after a forward slash, following or slightly under the rest of the chord notation--for example, "GM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/B" would indicate a G major seventh chord, with B, not G, as the bass or bottom note.
Except for the root, these parts do not refer to the notes that form the chord, but to the intervals they form with respect to the root note. For instance, Caug&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; indicates a chord formed by the notes C–E–G{{Music|#}}–B{{Music|b}}. The three parts of the symbol (C, aug, and 7) refer to the root C, the [[Augmented fifth|augmented (fifth)]] interval from C to G{{Music|#}}, and the [[Minor seventh|(minor) seventh]] interval from C to B{{Music|b}}. A set of [[#Rules to decode chord names and symbols|decoding rules]] is applied to deduce the missing information.

Although they are used occasionally in [[classical music]], typically in an educational setting for [[harmonic analysis]], these names and symbols are "universally used in jazz and popular music",&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', p.&amp;nbsp;78.
Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[lead sheet]]s, [[fake books]], and [[chord chart]]s, to specify the [[chord (music)|chords]] that make up the [[chord progression]] of a [[song]] or other piece of music. A typical sequence of a jazz or rock song in the key of C major might indicate a chord progression such as "C – Am – Dm – G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;". This chord progression instructs the performer to play, in sequence, a "C Major" chord, an "A minor" chord, a "D minor" chord, and a "G dominant seventh" chord. In a jazz context, players have the freedom to add sevenths, ninths and higher extensions to the chord. In some pop, rock and folk genres, triads are generally performed unless specified in the chord chart (e.g., C Major 7).

==Roles==
These chord symbols are used by musicians for a number of purposes. Chord-playing instrumentalists in the [[rhythm section]] of a [[jazz quartet]], [[band (rock and pop)|rock or pop band]] or [[big band]], such as a [[piano]] player, [[Hammond organ]]ist or [[electric guitar]]ist use these symbols to guide their [[music improvisation|improvised]] performance of [[Voicing (music)|chord "voicings"]] and [[Fill (music)|"fills"]]. A rock or pop guitarist or keyboardist might literally play the chords just as indicated (e.g., the C major chord would be played by playing the notes C, E and G at the same time). In jazz, particularly for music from the 1940s [[Bebop]] era or later, a guitarist or keyboardist typically has latitude to add in the sixth, seventh, and/or ninth, according to "ear" and judgement. Jazz chord voicings often omit the root (leaving it to the bass player) and fifth. As such, a jazz guitarist might "voice" the C major chord with the notes E, A and D—which are the third, sixth, and ninth of the chord. The bassist ([[bass guitar|electric bass]] or [[double bass]]) uses the chord symbols to help improvise a [[bass line]] that outlines the chords, often by emphasizing the root and other key scale tones (third, fifth, and in a jazz context, the seventh).

The "lead instruments" in a jazz band or rock group, such as a [[saxophone]] player or [[lead guitar]]ist use the chord chart to guide their improvised solos. The instrumentalist improvising a solo may use [[scale (music)|scales]] that work well with certain chords or chord progressions. For example, in rock and blues soloing, the [[pentatonic scale]] built on the root note is widely used to solo over straightforward chord progressions that use I, IV and V chords (in the key of C major, these would be the chords C, F and G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;).

Other [[Chord (music)#Notation|notation systems for chords]] include:&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', p.&amp;nbsp;77. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; plain [[Staff (music)|staff notation]], used in classical music, [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]], commonly used in [[Harmony|harmonic analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Schoenberg, Arnold (1983). ''Structural Functions of Harmony'', p.1–2. Faber and Faber. 0393004783&lt;/ref&gt; [[figured bass]], much used in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], and [[Macro analysis|macro symbols]], sometimes used in modern [[musicology]].

== Advantages and limitations ==
Any chord can be denoted using [[staff (music)|staff notation]], showing not only its harmonic characteristics but also its exact [[voicing (music)|voicing]]. However, this notation, frequently used in classical music, may provide too much information, making [[musical improvisation|improvisation]] difficult. In fact, although voicings can and do have a significant effect on the subjective musical qualities of a [[Musical composition|composition]], generally these interpretations retain the central characteristics of the chord. This provides an opportunity for improvisation within a defined structure and is important to improvised music such as [[jazz]]. Other problems are that voicings for one instrument are not necessarily physically playable on another (for example, the [[thirteenth chord]], played on [[piano]] with up to seven notes, is usually played on [[guitar]] as a 4- or 5-note voicing that is impossible to play on piano with one hand).

As a result of these limitations, popular music and jazz use a shorthand that describes the harmonic characteristics of chords. The first part of a symbol for a chord defines the root of the chord. The root of the chord is always played by one of the instruments in the ensemble (usually by a bass instrument). Failure to include the root means that the indicated chord may be hard to hear for some listeners. By convention, the root alone indicates a simple major triad, i.e., the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. After this, various additional symbols are added to modify this chord. There is unfortunately no universal standard for these symbols. The most common ones are below.

This notation does not easily provide for ways of describing all chords. Some chords can be very difficult to notate, and others that exist theoretically are rarely encountered. For example, there are six possible [[permutation]]s of triads (chords with three notes) involving minor or major thirds and perfect, augmented, or diminished fifths. However, conventionally only four are used (major, minor, augmented and diminished). There is nothing to stop a composer using the other two, but the question of what to call them is interesting. A minor third with an augmented fifth might be denoted, for example, by Am&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which would strike most musicians as odd. In fact, this turns out to be the same as F/A bass (see slash chords below). A major third with a diminished fifth might be shown as A&lt;sup&gt;{{music|b}}5&lt;/sup&gt;.

Usually, when composers require a chord that is not easily described using this notation, they indicate the required chord in a footnote or in the header of the music. Alternatively, chords can be specified with more detailed numbers. For example, for a C9 chord with no seventh, the composer can write C9 (no 7th), because the normal rule in jazz is that in a ninth chord, the seventh is assumed.

== Chord quality ==
Chord qualities are related with the [[Interval (music)#Quality|qualities]] of the component [[Interval (music)|intervals]] that define the chord (see below). The main chord qualities are:
:* [[Major chord|Major]], and [[Minor chord|minor]].
:* [[Augmented chord|Augmented]], [[Diminished seventh chord|diminished]], and [[half-diminished seventh chord|half-diminished]].
:* [[dominant chord|Dominant]].

Some of the symbols used for chord quality are similar to those used for [[Interval (music)#Shorthand notation|interval quality]]:
:* No symbol, or sometimes '''M''' or '''Maj''' (see rule 2 [[#Rules to decode chord names and symbols|below]]) for major,
:* '''m''', or '''min''' for minor,
:* '''aug''' for augmented,
:* '''dim''' for diminished.

In addition, however,

:*'''{{music|delta}}''' is sometimes used for major,{{efn

Chord qualities are sometimes omitted (see [[#Rules to decode chord names and symbols|below]]). When specified, they appear immediately after the root note or, if the root is omitted, at the beginning of the chord name or symbol. For instance, in the symbol Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (C [[minor seventh chord]]) C is the root and m is the chord quality. When the terms minor, major, augmented, diminished, or the corresponding symbols do not appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the name or symbol, they should be considered [[Interval (music)#Quality|interval qualities]], rather than chord qualities. For instance, in Cm&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; ([[minor major seventh chord]]), m is the chord quality and M refers to the M7 interval.

=== Major, minor, augmented, and diminished chords ===
Three-note chords are called [[Triad (music)|triads]]. There are four ''basic triads'' ([[Major triad|major]], [[Minor triad|minor]], [[Augmented triad|augmented]], [[Diminished triad|diminished]]). They are all [[Chord (music)#Secundal, tertian, and quartal chords|tertian]]—which means defined by the root, a third, and a [[fifth (interval)|fifth]]. Since most other chords are made by adding one or more notes to these triads, the name and symbol of a chord is often built by just adding an [[Interval (music)#Number|interval number]] to the name and symbol of a triad. For instance, a C [[augmented seventh chord]] is a C [[augmented triad]] with an extra note defined by a [[minor seventh]] interval:
:{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; || = || C+ || + || m7
|-
| &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;chord&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;triad&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;minor&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt;
|}
In this case, the [[Interval (music)#Quality|quality]] of the additional interval is omitted. Less often, the full name or symbol of the additional interval (minor, in the example) is provided. For instance, a C [[augmented major seventh chord]] is a C augmented triad with an extra note defined by a [[major seventh]] interval:
:{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| C+&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; || = || C+ || + || M7
|-
| &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;chord&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;triad&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;major&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt;
|}

In both cases, ''the quality of the chord is the same as the quality of the basic triad it contains''. This is not true for all chord qualities, as the chord qualities "half-diminished", and "dominant" refer not only to the quality of the basic triad, but also to the quality of the additional intervals.

=== Altered fifths ===
A more complex approach is sometimes used to name and denote augmented and diminished chords. An augmented triad can be viewed as a major triad in which the [[perfect fifth]] interval (spanning 7 [[semitone]]s) has been substituted with an [[augmented fifth]] (8 semitones), and a diminished triad as a minor triad in which the perfect fifth has been substituted with a [[diminished fifth]] (6 semitones). In this case, the augmented triad can be named ''major triad sharp five'', or ''major triad augmented fifth'' (M&lt;sup&gt;{{Music|#}}5&lt;/sup&gt;, M&lt;sup&gt;+5&lt;/sup&gt;, maj&lt;sup&gt;aug5&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, the diminished triad can be named ''minor triad flat five'', or ''minor triad diminished fifth'' (m&lt;sup&gt;{{Music|b}}5&lt;/sup&gt;, m&lt;sup&gt;°5&lt;/sup&gt;, min&lt;sup&gt;dim5&lt;/sup&gt;).

Again, the terminology and notation used for triads affects the terminology and notation used for larger chords, formed by four or more notes. For instance, the above-mentioned C augmented major seventh chord, is sometimes called ''C major seventh sharp five'', or ''C major seventh augmented fifth''. The corresponding symbol is CM&lt;sup&gt;7+5&lt;/sup&gt;, CM&lt;sup&gt;7{{Music|#}}5&lt;/sup&gt;, or Cmaj&lt;sup&gt;7aug5&lt;/sup&gt;:
:{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| CM&lt;sup&gt;7+5&lt;/sup&gt; || = || C || + || M3 || + || A5 || + || M7
|-
| &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;chord&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;chord&lt;br&gt;root&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;major&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;'''augmented'''&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt; || || &lt;small&gt;major&lt;br&gt;interval&lt;/small&gt;
|}
:(In chord symbols, [[Interval (music)#Shorthand notation|the symbol A]], used for augmented intervals, is typically replaced by + or {{Music|#}})
In this case, the chord is viewed as a C [[major seventh chord]] (CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) in which the third note is an augmented fifth from root (G{{Music|#}}), rather than a perfect fifth from root (G). All chord names and symbols including altered fifths, i.e., augmented ({{Music|#}}5, +5, aug5) or diminished ({{Music|b}}5, °5, dim5) fifths can be interpreted in a similar way.

== Rules to decode chord names and symbols ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The amount of information provided in a chord name or symbol lean toward the minimum, to increase efficiency. However, it is often necessary to deduce from a chord name or symbol the component intervals that define the chord. The missing information is implied and must be deduced according to some conventional rules:

# '''General rule to interpret existing information about chord quality'''
#: For triads, [[Major third|major]] or [[Minor third|minor]] always refer to the third interval, while [[Augmented fifth|augmented]] and [[Diminished fifth|diminished]] always refer to the fifth (an augmented fifth above the root and a diminished fifth above the root, respectively). The same is true for the corresponding symbols (e.g., Cm means C&lt;sup&gt;m3&lt;/sup&gt;, and C+ means C&lt;sup&gt;+5&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, the terms third and [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] and the corresponding symbols 3 and 5 are typically omitted. It is assumed that the chord-playing musician plays the 3rd and 5th above the root, so this is not explicitly stated.
#: This rule can be generalized to all kinds of chords,{{efn
| name=rule1
| General rule 1 achieves consistency in the interpretation of symbols such as CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, and C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Some musicians legitimately prefer to think that, in CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, M refers to the seventh, rather than to the third. This alternative approach is legitimate, as both the third and seventh are major, yet it is inconsistent, as a similar interpretation is impossible for Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (in Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, m cannot possibly refer to the sixth, which is major by definition, and in C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, + cannot refer to the seventh, which is minor). Both approaches reveal only one of the intervals (M3 or M7), and require other rules to complete the task. Whatever is the decoding method, the result is the same (e.g., CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; is always conventionally decoded as C–E–G–B, implying M3, P5, M7). The advantage of rule 1 is that it has no exceptions, which makes it the simplest possible approach to decode chord quality.&lt;br&gt;
According to the two approaches, some may format the minor seventh as CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; (general rule 1: M refers to M3), and others as C&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; (alternative approach: M refers to M7). Fortunately, even C&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; becomes compatible with rule 1 if it is considered an abbreviation of CM&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt;, in which the first M is omitted. The omitted M is the quality of the third, and is deduced according to rule 2 (see above), consistently with the interpretation of the plain symbol C, which by the same rule stands for CM and also in other variants.
}} provided the above-mentioned qualities appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the chord name or symbol. For instance, in the chord symbols Cm and Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, m refers to the interval m3, and 3 is omitted. When these qualities do not appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the name or symbol, they should be considered [[Interval (music)#Quality|interval qualities]], rather than chord qualities. For instance, in Cm/M7 ([[minor-major seventh chord]]), m is the chord quality and refers to the m3 interval, while M refers to the M7 interval. When the [[Interval (music)#Number|number]] of an extra interval is specified immediately after chord quality, the quality of that interval may coincide with chord quality (e.g., CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = CM&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt;). However, this is not always true (e.g., Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = Cm&lt;sup&gt;M6&lt;/sup&gt;, C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = C+&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;, CM&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; = CM&lt;sup&gt;P11&lt;/sup&gt;).{{efn|name=rule1}} See specific rules below for further details.
# '''General rule to deduce missing information about chord quality'''
#: Without contrary information, a [[major third]] interval and a [[perfect fifth]] interval ([[major triad]]) are implied. For instance, a C chord is a C major triad, and the name C minor seventh (Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) implies a minor 3rd by rule 1, a perfect 5th by this rule, and a [[Minor seventh|minor 7th]] by definition (see below). This rule has one exception (see the first specific rule below). The chord built on the fifth scale degree, the [[dominant chord]], is often interpreted as a [[dominant seventh]] chord, even if the chord chart does not specifically indicate this. For example, for a song in the key of C Major, if a G chord is indicated, many chord-playing musicians instinctively play a G7 chord. In [[blues]], if a song indicates "C, F, and G" as the chords, many blues guitarists and blues pianists play "C7, F7, and G7", as using dominant seventh chords in place of major chords is an idiomatic part of the blues sound.
#'''Specific rules'''
#: When the fifth interval is [[Diminished fifth|diminished]], the third must be minor.{{efn
| All triads are [[Chord (music)#Secundal, tertian, and quartal chords|tertian]] chords (chords defined by sequences of thirds), and a major third would produce in this case a non-tertian chord. Namely, the diminished fifth spans 6 semitones from root, thus it may be decomposed into a sequence of two [[minor third]]s, each spanning 3 semitones (m3 + m3), compatible with the definition of tertian chord. If a major third were used (4 semitones), this would entail a sequence containing a major second (M3 + M2 {{=}} 4 + 2 semitones {{=}} 6 semitones), which would not meet the definition of tertian chord.
}} This rule overrides rule 2. For instance, Cdim&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; implies a diminished 5th by rule 1, a minor 3rd by this rule, and a diminished 7th by definition (see below).
#:Names and symbols with only a plain [[Interval (music)#Number|interval number]] (e.g., “Seventh chord”) or the chord root and a number (e.g., “C seventh”, or C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) are interpreted as follows:
#::*If the number is 2, 4, 6, etc., the chord is a major [[added tone chord]] (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = CM&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = C&lt;sup&gt;add6&lt;/sup&gt;) and contains, together with the implied major triad, an extra [[Major second|major 2nd]], [[Perfect fourth|perfect 4th]], or [[Major sixth|major 6th]] (see [[#Added tone chords|below]]). Note that 2 and 4 are sometimes also used to abbreviate [[suspended chord]]s (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = C&lt;sup&gt;sus2&lt;/sup&gt;).
#::*If the number is 7, 9, 11, 13, etc., the chord is [[Dominant chord|dominant]] (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = Cdom&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) and contains, together with the implied major triad, one or more of the following extra intervals: minor 7th, major 9th, perfect 11th, and major 13th (see [[#Seventh chords|Seventh chords]] and [[#Extended chords|Extended chords]] below).
#::*If the number is 5, the chord (technically not a chord in the traditional sense, but a [[dyad (music)|dyad]]) is a [[power chord]]. Only the root, a perfect fifth and usually an octave are played.
#: For [[sixth chord]] names or symbols composed only of root, [[Interval (music)#Number|quality]] and [[Interval (music)#Number|number]] (such as "C major sixth", or "CM&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;"):
#::* M, maj, or major stands for ''major-major'' (e.g., CM&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; means CM&lt;sup&gt;M6&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* m, min, or minor stands for ''minor-major'' (e.g., Cm6 means Cm&lt;sup&gt;M6&lt;/sup&gt;).
#: For [[seventh chord]] names or symbols composed only of root, quality and number (such as "C major seventh", or "CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;"):
#::* dom, or dominant stands for ''major-minor'' (e.g., Cdom&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means CM&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;), COMMON FAULT, THIS IS NOT THE C Dominant seventh chord  (ref** ref 8)        C-E-G-Bb is FDom7, CDom7 = G-B-D-F refer to Grove, Oxford, Collins etc
#::* M, maj, or major stands for ''major-major'' (e.g., CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means CM&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* m, min, or minor stands for ''minor-minor'' (e.g., Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means Cm&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* +, aug, or augmented stands for ''augmented-minor'' (e.g., C+&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means C+&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* {{music|dim}}, dim, or diminished stands for ''diminished-diminished'' (e.g., C{{music|dim}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means C{{music|dim}}&lt;sup&gt;{{music|dim}}7&lt;/sup&gt;),
#::* {{music|halfdim}}, or half-diminished stands for ''diminished-minor'' (e.g., C{{music|halfdim}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; means C{{music|dim}}&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;).
#:Other specific rules for [[Extended chord|extended]] and [[Added tone chord|added tone]] chords are given below.

=== Examples ===
The table shows the application of these generic and specific rules to interpret some of the main chord symbols. The same rules apply for the analysis of chord names. A limited amount of information is explicitly provided in the chord symbol ('''[[boldface]]''' font in the column labeled "Component intervals"), and can be interpreted with rule 1. The rest is implied (plain font), and can be deduced by applying the other rules. The "Analysis of symbol parts" is performed by applying rule 1.

For each symbol, several formatting options are available. Except for the root, all the other parts of the symbols may be either [[superscript]]ed or [[subscript]]ed. Sometimes, parts of the symbol may be separated by a [[Slash notation|slash]], or written within [[parentheses]]. 
For instance:
* CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; may be written CM&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, C&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt;, CM&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, or C&lt;sub&gt;M7&lt;/sub&gt;.
* Cm&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; may be written as Cm&lt;sub&gt;M7&lt;/sub&gt;, Cm/M7, Cm(M7), or simply CmM7.

Short and long symbols for chord quality (such as ''m'' for minor and ''maj'' for major, respectively) are sometimes both used in the same chord symbol. For instance:
* Cm&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; may be also written Cm&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Intervals ==
{{Main|Interval (music)}}
A chord consists of two or more notes played simultaneously that are certain intervals apart with respect to the chord root.

== Triads ==
{{Main|Triad (music)}}
As earlier suggested, the root written alone indicates a simple [[major chord|major triad]]. It consists of the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. [[Minor chord|Minor triads]] are the same as major triads, but with the third lowered by a [[semitone|half step]]. [[Augmented triad]]s are the same as a major triad, but with an [[augmented fifth]] instead of a [[perfect fifth]]. [[Diminished triad]]s are similar to minor triads, but with a [[diminished fifth]] instead of a perfect fifth (the minor third is retained).

The table below shows names, symbols and definition for the four kinds of triads (using C as root).

== Seventh chords ==
{{Main|Seventh chord}}
A [[seventh chord]] is a triad with an added note, which is either a [[major seventh]] above the root, a [[minor seventh]] above the root (flatted 7th), or a [[diminished seventh]] above the root (double flatted 7th). Note that the diminished seventh note is [[enharmonically equivalent]] to the [[major sixth]] above the root of the chord. When not otherwise specified, the name "seventh chord" may more specifically refer to a [[major triad]] with an added minor seventh (a [[seventh chord]]).

The table below shows names, symbols, and definitions for the various kinds of seventh chords (using C as root).

For each symbol, several formatting options are available. See [[#Examples|Examples]] above for further details.

Some 7th chords can be considered as triad chords with [[alternate bass]]. For instance,
* Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = C–E{{music|b}}–G–B{{music|b}} = E{{music|b}}/C
* Cmaj&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = C–E–G–B = Em/C

== Extended chords ==
{{Main|Extended chord}}
[[Extended chords]] add further notes onto 7th chords. Of the 7 notes in the major scale, a seventh chord uses only four (root, a third above the root, a fifth above the root and a seventh above the root). The other three notes (the second above the root, the fourth above the root and the sixth above the root) can be added in any combination; however, just as with the triads and seventh chords, notes are most commonly stacked&amp;nbsp;– a seventh implies that there is a fifth and a third and a root. In practice, especially in jazz, certain notes can be omitted without changing the quality of the chord. In a jazz ensemble with a bass player, the chord-playing instrumentalists (guitar, organ, piano, etc.) can omit the root, as the bass player typically incorporates this into the [[bassline]]. 

The 9th, 11th and 13th chords are known as extended [[Chord (music)#Secundal, tertian, and quartal chords|tertian]] chords. As the scale repeats for every seven notes in the scale, these notes are [[enharmonically equivalent]] to the 2nd, 4th, and 6th&amp;nbsp;– except they are more than an octave above the root. However, this does not mean that they must be played in the higher octave. Although changing the octave of certain notes in a chord (within reason) does change the way the chord sounds, it does not change the essential characteristics or tendency of it. Accordingly, using 9th, 11th and 13th in chord notation implies that the chord is an extended tertian chord rather than an added chord (see Added Chords below).

The convention is that using an odd number (7 or 9 or 11 or 13) implies that all the other lower odd numbers are also included. Thus C13 implies that 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 are also there. Using an even number such as 6, implies that only that one extra note has been added to the base triad e.g. 1, 3, 5, 6. Remember that this is theory, so in practice they do not have to be played in that ascending order e.g. 5, 1, 6, 3. Also,to resolve the clash between 3 and 11(AKA 4) one of them may be deleted or separated by an octave and/or, distributed to different colour(timbre) instruments. Another way to resolve might be to covert the chord to minor by flattening the 3rd, which generates a clash between the flat 3rd and the 9th(AKA 2). 

=== 9ths ===
9th chords are built by adding a 9th from the root to a seventh chord. A 9th chord includes the 7th. Without the 7th, the chord is not an extended chord, but becomes an [[added tone chord]]—in this case, an add 9. 9ths can be added to any chord, but are most commonly seen with major, dominant, and minor sevenths. The most commonly omitted note for a voicing is the perfect 5th.

NOTE

=== 11ths ===
These are theoretically 9th chords with the 11th (4th) note in the scale added. However, it is common to leave certain notes out. The major 3rd is often omitted because of a strong dissonance with the 11th (4th), therefore called an [[avoid note]]. Omission of the 3rd reduces an 11th chord to the corresponding 9sus4 ([[Suspended chord|suspended]] 9th chord; [[#Reference-idAiken2004|Aikin 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;104). Similarly, omission of the 3rd as well as 5th in C&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; results in a major chord with alternate base B{{music|b}}/C, which is characteristic in soul and gospel music. For instance:

*C&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; without 3rd = C–(E)–G–B{{music|b}}–D–F ≈ C–F–G–B{{music|b}}–D = C&lt;sup&gt;9sus4&lt;/sup&gt;
*C&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; without 3rd and 5th = C–(E)–(G)-B{{music|b}}–D–F ≈ C–F–B{{music|b}}–D = B{{music|b}}/C

If the 9th is omitted, the chord is no longer an extended chord, but an [[added tone chord]] (see below). Without the 3rd, this added tone chord becomes a 7sus4 (suspended 7th chord). For instance:

*C&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; without 9th = C&lt;sup&gt;7add11&lt;/sup&gt; = C–E–G–B{{music|b}}–(D)–F 
*C&lt;sup&gt;7add11&lt;/sup&gt; without 3rd = C–(E)–G–B{{music|b}}–(D)-F ≈ C–F–G–B{{music|b}} = C&lt;sup&gt;7sus4&lt;/sup&gt; NB - to properly use the term "sus4", the 4 (in this example the "F"), must have been played in the previous chord so that it can be suspended as a dissonant note into the new chord

|}

Alterations from the natural diatonic chords can be specified as C&lt;sup&gt;9{{music|#}}11&lt;/sup&gt; ... etc. Omission of the 5th in a '''sharpened''' 11th chord reduces its sound to a flat-fifth chord. ([[#Reference-idAiken2004|Aiken 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;94):

C&lt;sup&gt;9{{music|#}}11&lt;/sup&gt; = C–E–(G)–B{{music|b}}–D–F{{music|#}} ≈ C–E–G{{Music|b}}–B{{music|b}}–D = C&lt;sup&gt;9{{music|b}}5&lt;/sup&gt;

=== 13ths ===
These are theoretically 11th chords with the 13th (or 6th) note in the scale added. In other words, theoretically they are formed by all the seven notes of a diatonic scale at once. Again, it is common to leave certain notes out. After the 5th, the most commonly omitted note is the troublesome 11th (4th). The 9th (2nd) can also be omitted. A very common voicing on guitar for a 13th chord is just the root, 3rd, 7th and 13th (or 6th). For example:
C–E–(G)-B{{music|b}}–(D)–(F)-A, or C–E–(G)–A–B{{music|b}}–(D)–(F). On the piano, this is usually voiced C–B{{music|flat}}–E–A.

== Added tone chords ==
{{Main|Added tone chord}}
An important characteristic of jazz and blues is the extensive use of [[Seventh chord]]s. In jazz, any chord indicated in a chord chart or fakebook may be interpreted with an added seventh, according to the discretion and musical instincts of the chord-playing musicians. For example, for a jazz song in the key of C, if the opening chord indicates "C" or "C Major", a jazz guitarist accompanying the singer may add the major seventh. For jazz-style blues progressions, any major chords may be played as dominant seventh chords. For example, a jazz musician who sees the turnaround I VI/ii V written as C A/d min G in a fakebook typically interprets this as C7 A7/d min7 G7. This interpretation means that a composer who wants a jazz comping musician to play a simple triad (for artistic reasons or effect) usually must be explicit in the lead sheet or part. For example, if a song in the key of C has a chord labelled "G", a composer who wants a simple triad  (the notes G, B, and D) may write G (triad only) or G (no 7).

The combination of 9th (2nd), 11th (4th) and 13th (6th) notes with 7ths in a chord give jazz chord voicings their distinctive sound. However the use of these notes is not exclusive to the jazz genre; in fact they are very commonly used in folk, classical and popular music generally. Without the 7th, these chords lose their jazzy feel, but can still be very complex. These chords are called [[added tone chords]] because they are basic triads with notes added. They can be described as having a more open sound than extended chords.

In blues, when chords are written without additional notation requesting sevenths, the chords are often played as dominant seventh chords. For example, in the progression C/F/C/C/F/F/C/C/G/F/C/G, a simple version of the 12 bar blues, chord-playing musicians often play all of these chords as dominant seventh chords (e.g., using the chords C7, F7, and G7).

Notation must provide some way of showing that a chord is an added tone chord as opposed to extended. There are two ways this is shown generally, and it is very common to see both methods on the same score. One way is to simply use the word 'add', for example:
* C&lt;sup&gt;add9&lt;/sup&gt;

The second way is to use 2 instead of 9, implying that it is not a 7th chord for instance:
* C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Note that in this way we potentially get other ways of showing a 9th chord:
* C&lt;sup&gt;7add9&lt;/sup&gt;
* C&lt;sup&gt;7add2&lt;/sup&gt;
* C&lt;sup&gt;7/9&lt;/sup&gt;

Generally however the above is shown as simply C&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies a 7th in the chord. Added tone chord notation is useful with 7th chords to indicate partial extended chords. For example:
* C&lt;sup&gt;7add13&lt;/sup&gt;

This would indicate that the 13th is added to the 7th, but without the 9th and 11th.

The use of 2, 4 and 6 as opposed to 9, 11 and 13 indicates that the chord does not include a 7th unless specifically specified. However, it does not mean that these notes must be played within an octave of the root, nor the extended notes in 7th chords should be played outside of the octave, although it is commonly the case. 6 is particularly common in a [[minor sixth chord]] (also known as minor/major sixth chord, as the 6 refers to a [[major sixth]] interval).

It is possible to have added tone chords with more than one added note. The most commonly encountered of these are [[6/9 chord]]s, which are basic triads with the 6th and 2nd notes of the scale added. These can be confusing because of the use of 9, yet the chord does not include the 7th. A good rule of thumb is that if any added note is less than 7, then no 7th is implied, even if there are some notes shown as greater than 7.

Similarly, even numbers such as 8, 10 and 12 can be added. However, these double the main triad, and as such are fairly rare. 10 tends to be the most common; it can be used both in suspended chords and (with an accidental) in major or minor chords to produce a [[blue note|major–minor clash]] (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;7{{music|b}}10&lt;/sup&gt; indicating the [[Hendrix chord]] of C–E–G–B{{music|b}}–E{{music|b}}). However, because of [[enharmonic]]s, such chords can more easily, and perhaps more intuitively, be represented by {{music|#}}2 (or {{music|#}}9) for a minor over a major or {{music|b}}4 for a major over a minor. In any other case, an 8, 10 or 12 simply indicates the respective note from the triad doubled up one octave.

== Suspended chords ==
{{Main|Suspended chord}}
A [[suspended chord]] is a triad where a note that does not belong to that chord (and is therefore a dissonant note) was being played in the previous chord and is continued to be played in the new chord. Thus it is said to be "suspended" as a dissonant note in the new chord. The most common example is V7 to I. So in "C", it is G,B,D,F moving to C, E, G but, the F is being suspended from the previous chord thus we have V7 to Isus4. In practice the 3rd (E) is replaced by the 4th (F). This chord, because of its dissonant sound,"desires" to resolve into a normal triad, i.e the F then resolves to the E. Thus we have the progression V7 to Isus4 to I. 

There are many variations to suspensions e.g. suspend the 2nd instead of the fourth or even suspend both (called a double suspension). If the progression starts on a 9th chord, the 6th may also be suspended. Three points to note: Firstly, the number given to the suspended note is as it appears in the new chord, not the previous chord. Thus in C, V7 to Isus4, the suspended note 4 is F, which was 7 in the previous chord. Secondly, if the dissonant note does not appear in the previous chord then there is no note being suspended and that note is simply an added note. Thus in our example if the progress is from V with no 7, and the F appears in I it is not a suspension. It is just V to C4 eg G,B,D to C, F, G.  Thirdly, in our example, the G appears in both chords but as it is consonant (not dissonant) in the new chord, it is not labeled as a suspension.

Suspended chords are notated with the symbols "sus4" or "sus2". Where "sus" is found on its own, the suspended fourth chord is implied. The resolution to a regular triad may not be indicated in the chord notation, but the chord-playing instrumentalists may do the resolution even if it is not notated. 

The resolution is especially appropriate if the written melody resolves from a fourth to a third above the root (e.g., if the chord G sus 4, in the key of C Major, lasts a bar in 4,4, and the melody note resolves from the note "C" for two beats and then the note "B" for two beats, this 4-3 resolution in the melody is often mirrored by chord-playing musicians shifting from G sus 4 to G Major. A composer or songwriter who wants to leave the tension unresolved in the backing band may write "N.C" (no chord) after the G sus 4 chord is sounded for the first two beats. This tells chord-playing musicians not to play any chord. 

The "sus" indication can be combined with any other notation. So for example:

* C&lt;sup&gt;9sus4&lt;/sup&gt;

This chord is an extended 9th chord with the 3rd replaced by the 4th (C-F–G–B{{music|b}}–D). However, the major third can be added ''as a tension'' above the 4th to "colorize" the chord (C-F–G–B{{music|b}}–D–E). A sus4 chord with the added major third (sometimes called a major 10th) can also be [[quartal and quintal harmony|quartally]] voiced as C–F–B{{music|b}}–E.

Sus chords are used extensively in jazz, where entire song sections may be based on sus chords. Sus chords of short duration (half a bar) are common in rock, pop and folk.

== Power "chords" ==
{{Main|Power chord}}
Though [[power chord]]s are not true chords ''per se'', as the term "chord" is generally defined as three or more different notes (pitch classes) sounded simultaneously, and a power chord contains only two pitch classes (the root, the fifth, and often a doubling of the root at the octave), power chords are still expressed using a version of chord notation. Most commonly, power chords (e.g., C–G–C) are expressed using a "5" (e.g., C&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;). Power chords are also referred to as ''fifth chords'', ''indeterminate chords'' or ''neutral chords'' (though the term "neutral chord," when expressed with an n (e.g., Cn), is also used to describe a pair of stacked [[neutral third]]s, e.g., C–E{{music|d}}–G, which requires a [[quarter tone]] or similarly sized microtone; or the mixed third chord), since they are inherently neither major nor minor; generally, a power chord refers to a specific doubled-root, three-note voicing of a fifth chord. 

Power chords played on a heavily [[distortion (music)|distorted]] and loudly amplified [[electric guitar]] are a foundational part of the sound and impact of [[heavy metal music]] and [[hardcore punk]]. Power chords are also used, though less commonly, on other instruments, such as [[Hammond organ]] in a traditional heavy metal genre (e.g., [[Deep Purple]]) or electric bass in heavy metal or [[grunge]]. In hard rock and heavy metal, in some cases where there are rapid chord changes in a lead sheet, these are interpreted as power chords, even if they are not notated in "C5"-style notation. For example, in the following chord progression, "C ///|F///|G///|C B B{{music|b}} A", if a fast tempo was played, many hard rock or heavy metal guitarists would play the "C B Bb A" measure as power chords. In other cases, a rock guitarist may decide to interpret a several bar reiteration of what appears notated on the lead sheet as a major or minor chord (e.g., C Maj or C min) as C5, for the raw, stark effect that a power chord provides.

To represent an extended neutral chord, e.g., a seventh (C–G–B{{music|b}}), the chord is expressed as its corresponding extended chord notation with the addition of the words "no3rd," "no3" or the like. The aforementioned chord, for instance, would be indicated C&lt;sup&gt;7no3&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Chords containing quarter tones ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
While not a common practice, the methods for naming chord names and symbols can be adapted to naming chords that contain [[quarter tones]].

=== Neutral chords ===
Neutral chords are chords built entirely by stacking neutral thirds (the interval between a major and minor third). While the neutral triad can sound like major or minor depending on context, it can also be thought of as a chord quality in its own right. An example of the neutral triad would be C–E{{music|d}}–G where the E{{music|d}} exists halfway between E{{music|b}} and E{{music|natural}}. The neutral triad is quite rare and is more commonly seen as the neutral seventh chord such as C–E{{music|d}}–G–B{{music|d}}. These chords are composed of two fifths being a neutral third apart. The chord symbol can be written with a lowercase "n" or "neut" following the root such as Cn&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.  Neutral chords can also be extended to higher degrees such as ninths and elevenths. While there is no universally accepted series of notes for larger neutral chords, it makes sense to consider that higher extensions to the chord would be built in the same manner that the seventh chord is, by a series of neutral thirds.

=== Supermajor and subminor ===
Supermajor chords are major triads that have the third raised a quarter tone higher than normal. Such a triad is arguably either an altered version of a suspended chord or a unique triad in its own right. Subminor chords are minor triads that have the third lowered by a quarter tone. An example of a supermajor triad would be C–E{{music|t}}–G, in which E{{music|t}} exists halfway between E and F. An example of a subminor triad would be C–E{{music|db}}–G in which E{{music|db}} exists halfway between D and E{{music|b}}. Supermajor triads can be written with "sup" or a capital "S" following the root while subminor can be written with "sub", "s" or (by extrapolating and adapting [[metric prefix]]es) the micro symbol (µ, not to be confused with the [[Mu chord|Mu major chord]]). The previous examples would therefore be Csup/CS, and Csub/Cs/Cµ. Because triads such as these rarely appear in musical context, they are considered theoretical.

In addition, sevenths can be theoretically created as well based on keeping the relationship of a chord having two perfect fifths the same. While a C major seventh chord would have a major third and major seventh, Csup&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; would contain a supermajor third (E{{music|t}}) and a supermajor seventh (B{{music|t}}). Csub&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; would contain a subminor third (E{{music|db}}) and a subminor seventh (B{{music|db}}). Arguably, higher extensions could be used as well, producing chord names such as Csup&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; or Csub&lt;sup&gt;13{{music|b}}9&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Half-diminished chords without seventh ===
By extension, standard chord notation allows for the expression of a chord built upon an interval of a minor third and a neutral third; i.e. C–E{{music|b}}–G{{music|d}}. Whereas a [[half-diminished seventh chord]] is achieved by diminishing only one of the two intervals needed to transform a minor seventh chord into a [[diminished seventh chord]], a half-diminished chord without a seventh is thus achieved by only diminishing the fifth note halfway between a minor chord and a diminished chord. It would thus be noted as C{{music|halfdim}}, or more explicitly C{{music|halfdim}}no&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; to avoid confusion with a half-diminished seventh chord.

== Inversions ==
{{Main|Inversion (music)#Chords}}
In addition to all of the ways of ''building'' chords (listed above), a chord may be [[Inverted chord|inverted]]. Inverting a chord refers to playing a chord, but with a note other than the root as the lowest note of the chord. Take, for example, the C major and the C dominant seventh chords. Refer to the tables below for a list of inversions.

{| class="wikitable"

|-
! Short notation
| C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;
| C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/B{{music|b}}
|}

The notation C/E bass indicates a C major chord, but with an E in the bass. Likewise the notation C/G bass indicates that a C major chord is played with a G in the bass. In a jazz quartet with a bass player, the bass player plays the indicated bass note.

See [[figured bass]] for alternate method of notating specific notes in the bass.

== Hybrid chords ==

=== Upper structures ===
{{Main|Upper structure}}
Those are notated in a similar manner to inversions, except that the bass note is not necessarily a chord tone. Examples:
* C/A{{music|b}} bass (A{{music|b}}–C–E–G), equivalent to A{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;M7{{music|#}}5&lt;/sup&gt;;
* C{{music|#}}/E bass (E–G{{music|#}}–C{{music|#}}–E{{music|#}});
* Am/D bass (D–A–C–E). 

Chord notation in jazz usually leaves a certain amount of freedom to the player as for voicing chords, also adding tensions  (e.g., 9th, 11th, 13th, etc.) at the player's discretion. Therefore, upper structures are most useful when the composer wants musicians to play a specific tension array. Example:

If a composer was starting with the following, simpler chord progression:

:{{music|time|4|4}} E&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; | Am&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; | E{{music|b}}m&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; | D{{music|b}} G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; | C ||

and wished to add "colour" to, chord substitution and reharmonization could be done using slash chords. By using [[tritone substitution]] and tonic substitute chords (e.g., substituting iii or VI of a tonic chord), the following chord progression could be created:

:{{music|time|4|4}} C{{music|#}}/E bass | C/A bass E{{music|b}}/A bass | D{{music|b}}/E{{music|b}} bass G{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;M7{{music|#}}5&lt;/sup&gt;/A{{music|b}} bass | E{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;add2&lt;/sup&gt;/D{{music|b}} bass D{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;7{{music|#}}9&lt;/sup&gt;/G bass| Am&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/C bass ||

These are also commonly referred as "[[slash chord]]s". A slash chord is simply a chord placed on top of a different bass note; for example:
* D/F{{music|#}} bass is a D chord with F{{music|#}} in the bass;
* A/C{{music|#}} bass is an A chord with C{{music|#}} in the bass.
Slash chords generally do not indicate a simple inversion (which is usually left to the chord player's discretion anyway), especially considering that the specified bass note may not be part of the chord to play on top. The bass note may be played instead of or in addition to the chord's usual root note, though the root note, when played, is likely to be played only in a higher octave to avoid "colliding" with the new bass note.

=== Polychords ===
{{Main|Polychord}}
Polychords, as the name suggests, are combinations of two or more chords. The most commonly found form of a polychord is a '''bichord''' (two chords played simultaneously) and is written as follows: {{sfrac|upper chord|lower chord}}, for example: {{sfrac|B|C}} (C–E–G—B–D{{music|#}}–F{{music|#}}). In case a very specific voicing is needed, the individual chords can be written in their desired inversions, for example: {{sfrac|E{{music|b}}m/G{{music|b}}|Cdrop2}} (C–G–E—G{{music|b}}–B{{Music|b}}–E{{music|b}}).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010|reason=chord symbols should be devoid of voicing information in common practice.}}

== Other symbols ==

The [[Slash (punctuation)|right slash]] '''/''' or diagonal line written above the staff where chord symbols occur is used to indicate a [[Beat (music)|beat]] during which the most recent chord symbol is understood to continue. It is used to help make uneven harmonic rhythms more readable. For example, if written above a measure of standard time, "C / F G" would mean that the C chord symbol lasts two beats while F and G last one beat each. The slash is separated from the surrounding chord symbols so as not to be confused with the chord-over-a-bass-note notation that also uses a slash. Another example is "C///|F///|G///||A G F G"; in this example, the C Major chord is played for one measure, the F Major chord for one measure, the G Major chord for one measure, and then in the last bar, there is one chord per beat "A G F G". Some fake books extend this slash rhythm notation further by indicating chords that are held as a whole note with a diamond, and indicating unison rhythm section rhythmic figures with the appropriate note heads and stems.

For chord abbreviations, the right slash indicates the bass note if other than the root. It is usually written with the complete chord name, and, after the slash symbol, the desired bass note. For example, the symbol C/G would mean that the chord to play is a C major triad with a G as the bass note, leading to the following notes: G–C–E (commonly known as the 2nd inversion C major triad). Some arrangers use C/G bass, adding the word bass to make the intention clear. With just C/G, a musician might misinterpret this as a [[polychord]] (two chords played simultaneously). In this example, if C/G was intended to be read as a polychord, a pianist would play a C Major chord (the notes C, E and G) and a G Major chord (the notes G, B and D) simultaneously.

[[File:Music-simile.svg|thumb|text-top|frameless|upright=0.7|Alt=Examples of a simile and double simile marks|Simile marks]]A simile mark in the middle of an otherwise empty measure tells the musician to repeat the chord or chords of the preceding measure. When seen with two slashes instead of one it indicates that the previous measure's chords should be repeated for two further measures, called a double simile, and is placed on the measure line between the two empty bars. It simplifies the job of both the music reader (who can quickly scan ahead to the next chord change) and the copyist (who doesn't need to repeat every chord symbol).

The chord notation '''N.C.''' indicates the musician should play no chord. The duration of this symbol follows the same rules as a regular chord symbol. This is used by composers and songwriters to indicate that the chord playing musicians (guitar, keyboard, etc.) and the bass player should stop accompanying for the length covered by the "No Chord" symbol. Often the "No Chord" symbol is used to enable a solo singer or solo instrumentalist to play a pickup to a new section or an interlude without accompaniment. 

The stopping of the accompaniment creates a contrast for the listener. It can also enable the songwriter to do a modulation to a new key during the "No Chord" period, as the lack of chords and bassline can free the composer to shift to a different key. If the composer did not write "No Chord", the chord-playing instrumentalists and the bassist might think that the last indicated chord should be continued, as one of the conventions of lead sheet writing is that if the same chord (often the tonic or "I" chord) is repeated for a number of measures, the arranger does not have to keep writing "C Major" in every bar.

An even more stringent indication for the band to tacet (stop playing) is the marking ''solo break''. In jazz and popular music, this indicates that the entire band, including the drummer and percussionist, should stop playing to allow a solo instrumentalist to play a short [[cadenza]], often one or two bars long. This rhythm section tacet creates a change of texture and gives the soloist great rhythmic freedom to speed up, slow down, or play with a varied tempo.

{{Anarchism sidebar}}
'''Collectivist anarchism''' (also known as '''anarcho-collectivism''') is a [[revolutionary]]&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. ''Marx in Context''. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarchism|anarchist]] doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]] as it instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.

For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations of voluntary membership based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"&gt;Bakunin Mikail. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[anarcho-communism]] where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each according to his need". Thus notwithstanding the title, [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s "collectivist anarchism" is seen as a blend of [[individualism]] and [[collectivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Morriss, Brian. Bakukunin: ''The Philosophy of Freedom''. Black Rose Books Ltd., 1993. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Bakunin, the [[anti-authoritarian]] sections of the [[First International]] and the early [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist movement]].

== The First International ==
[[File:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|left|Collectivist anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]]]]
{{Libertarian socialism|Philosophies}}
[[Giuseppe Fanelli]] met Bakunin at [[Ischia]] in 1866.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} In October 1868, Bakunin sponsored Fanelli to travel to [[Barcelona]] to share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the [[International Workingmen's Association]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=12–15}} Fanelli's trip and the meeting he organised during his travels provided the catalyst for the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|Spanish exiles]], the largest workers' and peasants' movement in modern Spain and the largest Anarchist movement in modern Europe.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli's tour took him first to Barcelona, where he met and stayed with Elie Recluse.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Recluse and Fanelli were at odds over Recluse's friendships with Spanish republicans and Fanelli soon left Barcelona for Madrid.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=12}} Fanelli stayed in Madrid until the end of January 1869, conducting meetings to introduce Spanish workers, including [[Anselmo Lorenzo]], to the First National.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=13}} In February 1869, Fanelli left Madrid, journeying home via Barcelona.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} While in Barcelona again, he met with painter [[Josep Lluís Pellicer]] and his cousin [[Rafael Farga i Pellicer|Rafael Farga Pellicer]] along with others who were to play an important role establishing the International in Barcelona{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=14}} as well as the [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy|Alliance]] section.

In 1870, Bakunin led a failed uprising in [[Lyon]] on the principles later exemplified by the [[Paris Commune]], calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his ''Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis'', he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry, advocated a system of militias with elected officers as part of a system of self-governing communes and workplaces and argued the time was ripe for revolutionary action: {{quote|[W]e must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis], Mikhail Bakunin, 1870&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

These ideas and corresponded strikingly closely with the program of the Paris Commune of 1871, much of which was developed by followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as [[Marxism|Marxists]] were almost entirely absent from the Commune. Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Commune, which was brutally suppressed by the French government. He saw the Commune as above all a "rebellion against the State" and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the state, but also revolutionary dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1871/paris-commune.htm The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State], Mikhail Bakunin, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International against the Italian nationalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism. The collectivist anarchists at first used the term "collectivism" to distinguish themselves from the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] of the followers of Proudhon and the state socialists associated with [[Karl Marx]]. Bakunin wrote that "we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism", which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian ("Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism", 1867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/various/reasons-of-state.htm|title=Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism by Michael Bakunin|first=Mikhail|last=Bakunin|website=marxists.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin's disagreements with Marx, which led to the attempt by the Marx party to expel him at the Hague Congress (see below), illustrated the growing divergence between the anti-authoritarian sections of the International, which advocated the direct revolutionary action and organization of the workers and peasants in order to abolish the state and capitalism; and the sections allied with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the working class. Bakunin was "Marx’s flamboyant chief opponent" and "presciently warned against the emergence of a communist authoritarianism that would take power over working people".&lt;ref&gt;Verslius, Arthur (2005-06-20) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/jun/20/00023/ Death of the Left?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-authoritarian majority, which included most sections of the International, created their own First International at the [[Saint-Imier|St. Imier]] [[Anarchist St. Imier International|Congress]], adopted a revolutionary anarchist program and repudiated the Hague resolutions, rescinding Bakunin's alleged expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]] Volume One: From Anarchy to Anarchism (300CE to 1939)'', [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]], Black Rose Books, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bakunin accepted elements of Marx’s [[class analysis]] and theories regarding capitalism, acknowledging "Marx’s genius", he thought Marx's analysis was one-sided and that Marx's methods would compromise the social revolution. More importantly, Bakunin criticized "[[authoritarian socialism]]" (which he associated with Marxism) and the concept of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] which he adamantly refused.

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that "the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government", in which each worker will have the "right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting". This revolutionary transformation could "only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"&gt;[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm No profile created for this contactAnarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One |]. Black Rose Books. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar position was adopted by the Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region in 1882 as articulated by an anarchist veteran of the First International, Jose Llunas Pujols, in his essay "Collectivism".&lt;ref name="blackrosebooks.net"/&gt;

By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarchist communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the "collectivist" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full [[communism]]. The anarchist communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] attacked this position in his essay "The Collectivist Wages System", which was reprinted in his book ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' in 1892.

== Theory ==
[[File:Bakunin speaking.png|thumb|Bakunin speaking to members of the [[International Workingmen's Association|IWA]] at the [[Basel Congress (1869)|Basel Congress]] in 1869]]
Bakunin's socialism was known as "collectivist anarchism", where "socially: it seeks the confirmation of political equality by economic equality. This is not the removal of natural individual differences, but equality in the social rights of every individual from birth; in particular, equal means of subsistence, support, education and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity and equal resources, and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor".&lt;ref name="Revolutionary Catechism"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1866/catechism.htm ''Revolutionary Catechism''], Mikhail Bakunin, 1866&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism advocates the abolition of both the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the [[collectivization]] of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with [[labour voucher|labour notes]] and [[worker]]s' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.&lt;ref name="Bakunin Mikail 1980. p. 369"/&gt;

=== Critique of Marxism ===
The dispute between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx highlighted the differences between [[anarchism]] and [[Marxism]]. Bakunin argued—against certain ideas of a number of Marxists—that not all revolutions need to be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", a concept that vanguardist socialism including Marxist–Leninism would use to justify one-party rule from above by a party representing the proletariat.&lt;ref name=GW158&gt;Woodcock, George (1962, 1975). ''Anarchism'', p. 158. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-020622-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any "enlightened elite" must only exert influence by remaining "[[invisible dictatorship|invisible]]...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance".&lt;ref name="Struggle.ws"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://struggle.ws/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/bakunindictator.html |title=Was Bakunin a secret authoritarian? |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression.&lt;ref name=GW158/&gt; Libertarian Marxists argue Marx used the phrase to mean the worker control at the point of production, not a party, would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles.

{{quote|They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship—their dictatorship, of course—can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.|Mikhail Bakunin, ''Statism and Anarchism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm |title=Anarchist Theory FAQ Version 5.2 |publisher=Gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
While both social anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, [[egalitarian]] society [[Classless society|without social classes]] and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the [[direct action]] of the masses, culminating in [[social revolution]]; and refuse any intermediate stage such as the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists "anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Mikhail Bakunin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm |title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1873 |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bakunin also wrote of meeting Marx in 1844: {{quote|As far as learning was concerned, Marx was, and still is, incomparably more advanced than I. I knew nothing at that time of political economy, I had not yet rid myself of my metaphysical observations... He called me a sentimental idealist and he was right; I called him a vain man, perfidious and crafty, and I also was right.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bakunin found Marx's economic analysis very useful and began the job of translating ''[[Das Kapital]]'' into Russian. In turn, Marx wrote of the rebels in the Dresden insurrection of 1848 that "[i]n the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin they found a capable and cool headed leader".&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily Tribune (October 2, 1852) on 'Revolution and Counter Revolution in Germany'&lt;/ref&gt; Marx wrote to [[Friedrich Engels]] of meeting Bakunin in 1864 after his escape to Siberia, saying: "On the whole he is one of the few people whom I find not to have retrogressed after 16 years, but to have developed further".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brian Morris, Bakunin: The Philosophy of Freedom, 1993, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the "[[new class]]", meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat—but in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the "[s]tate has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls—or, if you will, rises—to the position of a machine".

Bakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the [[lumpenproletariat]] and the [[proletariat]]. As such, "[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the [[peasants]] and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workerscompass.org/pubs/marxism_anarchism_roberston.pdf|title="Marxism and Anarchism: The Philosophical Roots of the Marx-Bakunin Conflict – Part Two" by Ann Robertson.|website=workerscompass.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin "considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form—the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/library/deleuze-marx-politics-nicholas-thoburn-3 Nicholas Thoburn.

=== Comparison with anarcho-communism ===
The difference between collectivist anarchism and [[anarcho-communism]] is that under the former a wage system is retained based on the amount of labor performed. Anarchist communism, like collectivist anarchism, also advocates for the socialization of production, but the distribution of goods as well. Instead of "to each according to his labor", in anarcho-communism the community would supply the subsistence requirements to each member free of charge according to the maxim "to each according to his needs".&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph sourced by Shatz, Marshall; Guess, Raymond; Skinner, Quentin. The Conquest of Bread and Other Writings. Cambridge University Press. p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectivist anarchism stresses collective ownership of productive, subsistence and distributary property while communist anarchism negates the concept of ownership in favor of usage or possession with productive means being a possession not owned by any individual or particular group. Anarcho-communists believe that subsistence, productive and distributive property should be common or social possessions while personal property should be private possessions. Collectivist anarchists agree with this, but disagree on the subject of remuneration as some collectivist anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin, believe in the remuneration of labor while anarcho-communists, such as [[Peter Kropotkin]], believe that such remuneration would lead to the recreation of currency and that this would need a state. It could thus be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could thus be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism.

Collectivist anarchists are not necessarily opposed to the use of currency, but some while opposing the retaining of money—propose the adoption of [[labour voucher]]s or "personal credit" (such as [[Participatory economics|participatory economists]]). Most collectivist anarchists see their philosophy as a carryover to anarcho-communist, but some see the system and the use of a labour voucher system as permanent rather than a transition. Collectivist anarchist James Guillaume argued that such a society would "guarantee the mutual use of the tools of production which are the property of each of these groups and which will by a reciprocal contract become the collective property of the whole [...] federation. In this way, the federation of groups will be able to [...] regulate the rate of production to meet the fluctuating needs of society".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue for [[workplace autonomy]] and self-management "the workers in the various factories have not the slightest intention of handing over their hard-won control of the tools of production to a superior power calling itself the 'corporation'".&lt;ref&gt;James Guillaume. ''Bakunin on Anarchism''. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' compares and contrasts collectivist anarchism with anarcho-communism this way: {{quote|The major difference between collectivists and communists is over the question of "money" after a revolution. Anarcho-communists consider the abolition of money to be essential, while anarcho-collectivists consider the end of private ownership of the means of production to be the key. As Kropotkin noted, "[collectivist anarchism] express[es] a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes, while the ways of retribution [i.e. distribution] of labour, communist or otherwise, would be settled by each group for itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Anarchism''. p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while communism and collectivism both organise production in common via producers' associations, they differ in how the goods produced will be distributed. Communism is based on free consumption of all while collectivism is more likely to be based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed. However, most anarcho-collectivists think that, over time, as productivity increases and the sense of community becomes stronger, money will disappear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secA3.html%23seca32&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:42:45 A.3 What types of anarchism are there?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The collectives eliminated most of the parasitic elements from rural life, and would have wiped them out altogether if they were not protected by corrupt officials and by the political parties. Non-collectivised areas benefited indirectly from the lower prices as well as from free services often rendered by the collectives (laundries, cinemas, schools, barber and beauty parlours, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Anarchist Collectives]]'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tom Wetzel describes another collectivization: {{quote|Another industry that was totally re-organized was hair-cutting. Before July 19th, there had been 1,100 hairdressing parlors in Barcelona, most of them extremely marginal. The 5,000 assistant hairdressers were among the lowest-paid workers in Barcelona. The Generalitat had decreed a 40-hour week and 15 percent wage increase after July 19th—one of the Esquerra’s attempts to woo worker support. This spelled ruin for many hairdressing shops. A general assembly was held and it was agreed to shut down all the unprofitable shops. The 1,100 shops were replaced by a network of 235 neighborhood haircutting centers, with better equipment and lighting than the old shops. Due to the efficiencies gained, it was possible to raise wages by 40 percent. The entire network was run through assemblies of the CNT barber’s union. The former owners became members of the union.&lt;ref name="libcom.org"/&gt;}}

The '''cosmic distance ladder''' (also known as the '''extragalactic distance scale''') is the succession of methods by which [[astronomy|astronomers]] determine the [[distance]]s to celestial objects. A real ''direct'' distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are "close enough" (within about a thousand [[parsec]]s) to Earth. The techniques for determining distances to more distant objects are all based on various measured correlations between methods that work at close distances and methods that work at larger distances. Several methods rely on a '''standard candle''', which is an astronomical object that has a known [[luminosity]].

The ladder analogy arises because no single technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method can be used to measure nearby distances, a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung.

== Direct measurement ==

[[File:The Astonomer.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Statue of an astronomer and the concept of the cosmic distance ladder by the parallax method, made from the azimuth ring and other parts of the Yale–Columbia Refractor (telescope) (c 1925) wrecked by the [[2003 Canberra bushfires]] which burned out the [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]]; at [[Questacon]], [[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]].]]

At the base of the ladder are ''fundamental'' distance measurements, in which distances are determined directly, with no physical assumptions about the nature of the object in question. The precise measurement of stellar positions is part of the discipline of [[astrometry]].

=== Astronomical unit ===
{{main article|Astronomical unit}}

Direct distance measurements are based upon the [[astronomical unit]] (AU), which is the distance between the [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]].
[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]] provide precise [[ratio]]s of the sizes of the orbits of objects orbiting the Sun, but provides no measurement of the overall scale of the orbit system. [[Radar]] is used to measure the distance between the orbits of the Earth and of a second body. From that measurement and the ratio of the two orbit sizes, the size of Earth's orbit is calculated. The Earth's orbit is known with an absolute precision of a few meters and a relative precision of a few {{val|1|e=-11}}.

Historically, observations of [[Transit of Venus#Scientific interest in transits|transits of Venus]] were crucial in determining the AU; in the first half of the 20th century, observations of [[asteroids]] were also important. Presently the orbit of Earth is determined with high precision using [[radar]] measurements of distances to [[Venus]] and other nearby planets and asteroids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ash |first1=M. E. |last2=Shapiro |first2=I. I. |last3=Smith |first3=W.

=== Parallax ===
{{main article|Parallax}}
{{see also|Stellar Parallax|Parsec}}

[[File:ParallaxeV2.png|thumb|right|Stellar parallax motion from annual parallax. Half the apex angle is the parallax angle.]]

The most important fundamental distance measurements come from trigonometric [[parallax]]. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the position of nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant background. These shifts are angles in an isosceles [[triangle]], with 2 [[astronomical unit|AU]] (the distance between the extreme positions of Earth's orbit around the Sun) making the base leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long equal length legs. The amount of shift is quite small, measuring 1 [[Minute and second of arc|arcsecond]] for an object at 1&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]'s distance (3.26 [[light-year]]s) of the nearest stars, and thereafter decreasing in angular amount as the distance increases. Astronomers usually express distances in units of parsecs (parallax arcseconds); light-years are used in popular media.

Because parallax becomes smaller for a greater stellar distance, useful distances can be measured only for stars which are near enough to have a parallax larger than a few times the [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] of the measurement. Parallax measurements typically have an accuracy measured in milliarcseconds.&lt;ref&gt;

Stars have a velocity relative to the Sun that causes [[proper motion]] (transverse across the sky) and [[radial velocity]] (motion toward or away from the Sun). The former is determined by plotting the changing position of the stars over many years, while the latter comes from measuring the [[Doppler shift]] of the star's spectrum caused by motion along the line of sight. For a group of stars with the same spectral class and a similar magnitude range, a mean parallax can be derived from [[statistical analysis]] of the proper motions relative to their radial velocities. This [[statistical parallax]] method is useful for measuring the distances of bright stars beyond 50&amp;nbsp;parsecs and giant [[variable star]]s, including [[Cepheid variable|Cepheids]] and the [[RR Lyrae variable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

The motion of the Sun through space provides a longer baseline that will increase the accuracy of parallax measurements, known as [[Stellar parallax|secular parallax]]. For stars in the Milky Way disk, this corresponds to a mean baseline of 4 [[astronomical unit|AU]] per year, while for halo stars the baseline is 40 AU per year. After several decades, the baseline can be orders of magnitude greater than the Earth–Sun baseline used for traditional parallax. However, secular parallax introduces a higher level of uncertainty because the relative velocity of observed stars is an additional unknown. When applied to samples of multiple stars, the uncertainty can be reduced; the uncertainty is inversely proportional to the [[square root]] of the sample size.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Parallax#Dynamic or moving-cluster parallax|Moving cluster parallax]] is a technique where the motions of individual stars in a nearby star cluster can be used to find the distance to the cluster. Only [[open cluster]]s are near enough for this technique to be useful. In particular the distance obtained for the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] has historically been an important step in the distance ladder.

Other individual objects can have fundamental distance estimates made for them under special circumstances. If the expansion of a gas cloud, like a [[supernova remnant]] or [[planetary nebula]], can be observed over time, then an ''expansion parallax'' distance to that cloud can be estimated. Those measurements however suffer from uncertainties in the deviation of the object from sphericity. [[Binary star]]s which are both [[Binary star#Visual binaries|visual]] and [[Binary star#Spectroscopic binaries|spectroscopic]] binaries also can have their distance estimated by similar means, and don't suffer from the above geometric uncertainty. The common characteristic to these methods is that a measurement of angular motion is combined with a measurement of the absolute [[velocity]] (usually obtained via the [[Doppler effect#Astronomy|Doppler effect]]). The distance estimate comes from computing how far the object must be to make its observed absolute velocity appear with the observed angular motion.

Expansion parallaxes in particular can give fundamental distance estimates for objects that are very far, because supernova ejecta have large expansion velocities and large sizes (compared to stars). Further, they can be observed with radio [[Interferometry|interferometers]] which can measure very small angular motions. These combine to provide fundamental distance estimates to supernovae in other galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;

== Standard candles&lt;!--'Standard candle' and 'Standard candles' redirects here--&gt; ==
Almost all astronomical objects used as physical distance indicators belong to a class that has a known brightness. By comparing this known [[luminosity]] to an object's observed brightness, the distance to the object can be computed using the [[inverse-square law]]. These objects of known brightness are termed '''standard candles'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

The brightness of an object can be expressed in terms of its [[absolute magnitude]]. This quantity is derived from the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s. The [[apparent magnitude]], the magnitude as seen by the observer (an instrument called a [[bolometer]] is used), can be measured and used with the absolute magnitude to calculate the distance ''D'' to the object in kiloparsecs (where 1&amp;nbsp;kpc equals 1000&amp;nbsp;parsecs) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;5 \cdot \log_{10} D = m - M - 10,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; D = 10^{(m -M -10)/5}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the apparent magnitude and ''M'' the absolute magnitude. For this to be accurate, both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction.

Some means of correcting for interstellar [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], which also makes objects appear fainter and more red, is needed, especially if the object lies within a dusty or gaseous region.&lt;ref name=ctypeia&gt;

 |publisher=[[Caglow]]
 |accessdate=30 January 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between an object's absolute and apparent magnitudes is called its [[distance modulus]], and astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones, are sometimes tabulated in this way.

=== Problems ===
Two problems exist for any class of standard candle. The principal one is [[calibration]], that is the determination of exactly what the absolute magnitude of the candle is. This includes defining the class well enough that members can be recognized, and finding enough members of that class with well-known distances to allow their true absolute magnitude to be determined with enough accuracy. The second problem lies in recognizing members of the class, and not mistakenly using a standard candle calibration on an object which does not belong to the class. At extreme distances, which is where one most wishes to use a distance indicator, this recognition problem can be quite serious.

A significant issue with standard candles is the recurring question of how standard they are. For example, all observations seem to indicate that [[Type Ia supernova]]e that are of known distance have the same brightness (corrected by the shape of the light curve). The basis for this closeness in brightness is discussed below; however, the possibility exists that the distant Type Ia supernovae have different properties than nearby Type Ia supernovae. The use of Type Ia supernovae is crucial in determining the correct [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]]. If indeed the properties of Type Ia supernovae are different at large distances, i.e. if the extrapolation of their calibration to arbitrary distances is not valid, ignoring this variation can dangerously bias the reconstruction of the cosmological parameters, in particular the reconstruction of the matter [[Friedmann equations|density parameter]].&lt;ref name="Lindenetal2009"&gt;

That this is not merely a philosophical issue can be seen from the history of distance measurements using [[Cepheid variable]]s. In the 1950s, [[Walter Baade]] discovered that the nearby Cepheid variables used to calibrate the standard candle were of a different type than the ones used to measure distances to nearby galaxies. The nearby Cepheid variables were [[Stellar population|population I]] stars with much higher [[metallicity|metal]] content than the distant [[Stellar population|population II]] stars. As a result, the population II stars were actually much brighter than believed, and when corrected, this had the effect of doubling the distances to the globular clusters, the nearby galaxies, and the diameter of the [[Milky Way]].

== Standard siren ==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}

[[Gravitational wave]]s originating from the [[Orbital decay|inspiral phase]] of compact binary systems, such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s, have the useful property that both the amplitude and shape of the emitted gravitational radiation depend strongly on the [[chirp mass]] of the system. By observing the waveform, the chirp mass can be computed, and thus the amplitude. Further, gravitational waves are not subject to [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] due to an absorbing intervening medium. (They ''are'' subject to [[gravitational lens]]ing, however.)

The ratio of the source and received amplitudes allows the distance to be computed. Therefore, a standard siren can be used as a distance indicator on a cosmic scale. When the collision can be observed optically as well (in the case of a [[kilonova]] such as [[GW170817]]), the Doppler shift can be measured and the Hubble constant computed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Standard ruler ==

Another class of physical distance indicator is the [[standard ruler]]. In 2008, galaxy diameters have been proposed as a possible standard ruler for cosmological parameter determination.&lt;ref name="Marinonietal2009"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the physical scale imprinted by [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) in the early universe has been used. 
In the early universe (before [[Recombination_(cosmology)|recombination]]) the baryons and photons scatter off each other, and form a tightly-coupled fluid that can support sound waves. The waves are sourced by primordial density perturbations, and travel at speed that can be predicted from the baryon density and other cosmological parameters. The total distance that these sound waves can travel before recombination determines a fixed scale, which simply expands with the universe after recombination. BAO therefore provide a standard ruler that can be measured in galaxy surveys from the effect of baryons on the clustering of galaxies. The method requires an extensive galaxy survey in order to make this scale visible, but has been measured with percent-level precision (see [[baryon acoustic oscillations]]). The scale does depend on cosmological parameters like the baryon and matter densities, and the number of neutrinos, so distances based on BAO are more dependent on cosmological model than those based on local measurements.

[[Light echo]]s can be also used as standard rulers,&lt;ref&gt;

== Galactic distance indicators ==
{{see also|distance measures (cosmology)}}

With few exceptions, distances based on direct measurements are available only out to about a thousand parsecs, which is a modest portion of our own Galaxy. For distances beyond that, measures depend upon physical assumptions, that is, the assertion that one recognizes the object in question, and the class of objects is homogeneous enough that its members can be used for meaningful estimation of distance.

Physical distance indicators, used on progressively larger distance scales, include:
* [[Dynamical parallax]], uses orbital parameters of [[visual binary|visual binaries]] to measure the mass of the system, and hence use the [[Mass–luminosity relation#In astronomy|mass–luminosity relation]] to determine the luminosity
**[[Binary star|Eclipsing binaries]] — In the last decade, measurement of eclipsing binaries' fundamental parameters has become possible with 8-meter class telescopes. This makes it feasible to use them as indicators of distance. Recently, they have been used to give direct distance estimates to the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC), [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (SMC), [[Andromeda Galaxy]] and [[Triangulum Galaxy]]. Eclipsing binaries offer a direct method to gauge the distance to galaxies to a new improved 5% level of accuracy which is feasible with current technology to a distance of around 3 Mpc (3 million parsecs).&lt;ref name="Bonanos2006"&gt;

Observations of X-ray burst sometimes show X-ray spectra indicating radius expansion.

This method allows distance determination of some low-mass [[X-ray binary|X-ray binaries]].

=== Main sequence fitting ===

When the absolute magnitude for a group of stars is plotted against the [[Stellar classification|spectral classification]] of the star, in a [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], evolutionary patterns are found that relate to the mass, age and composition of the star. In particular, during their hydrogen burning period, stars lie along a curve in the diagram called the [[main sequence]]. By measuring these properties from a star's spectrum, the position of a main sequence star on the H–R diagram can be determined, and thereby the star's absolute magnitude estimated. A comparison of this value with the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined, after correcting for interstellar [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] of the luminosity because of gas and dust.

In a gravitationally-bound [[star cluster]] such as the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], the stars formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance. This allows relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination.

The extragalactic distance scale is a series of techniques used today by astronomers to determine the distance of cosmological bodies beyond our own galaxy, which are not easily obtained with traditional methods. Some procedures utilize properties of these objects, such as [[star]]s, [[globular cluster]]s, [[nebula]]e, and galaxies as a whole. Other methods are based more on the statistics and probabilities of things such as entire [[galaxy cluster]]s.

=== Wilson–Bappu effect ===
{{main article|Wilson–Bappu effect}}
Discovered in 1956 by [[Olin Chaddock Wilson|Olin Wilson]] and [[Vainu Bappu|M.K. Vainu Bappu]], the [[Wilson–Bappu effect]] utilizes the effect known as [[spectroscopic parallax]]. Many stars have features in their [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectra]], such as the [[Fraunhofer lines|calcium K-line]], that indicate their [[absolute magnitude]]. The distance to the star can then be calculated from its [[apparent magnitude]] using the [[distance modulus]].

There are major limitations to this method for finding stellar distances. The calibration of the spectral line strengths has limited accuracy and it requires a correction for [[interstellar extinction]]. Though in theory this method has the ability to provide reliable distance calculations to stars up to 7 megaparsecs (Mpc), it is generally only used for stars at hundreds of kiloparsecs (kpc).

=== Classical Cepheids ===

Beyond the reach of the [[Wilson–Bappu effect]], the next method relies on the period-luminosity relation of classical [[Cepheid variable]] stars. The following relation can be used to calculate the distance to Galactic and extragalactic classical Cepheids:

: &lt;math&gt; 5\log_{10}{d}=V+ (3.34) \log_{10}{P} - (2.45) (V-I) + 7.52 \,. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=benedict2007&gt;Benedict, G. Fritz et al.

: &lt;math&gt; 5\log_{10}{d}=V+ (3.37) \log_{10}{P} - (2.55) (V-I) + 7.48 \,. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=majaess2011&gt;Majaess, Daniel; Turner, David; Moni Bidin, Christian; Mauro, Francesco; Geisler, Douglas; Gieren, Wolfgang; Minniti, Dante; Chené, André-Nicolas; Lucas, Philip; Borissova, Jura; Kurtev, Radostn; Dékány, Istvan; Saito, Roberto K.

L2 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several problems complicate the use of Cepheids as standard candles and are actively debated, chief among them are: the nature and linearity of the period-luminosity relation in various passbands and the impact of metallicity on both the zero-point and slope of those relations, and the effects of photometric contamination (blending) and a changing (typically unknown) extinction law on Cepheid distances.&lt;ref name="stanekudalski1999"&gt;

Cepheid variable stars were the key instrument in Edwin Hubble's 1923 conclusion that [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]] (Andromeda) was an external galaxy, as opposed to a smaller nebula within the [[Milky Way]]. He was able to calculate the distance of M31 to 285 Kpc, today's value being 770 Kpc.

As detected thus far, NGC 3370, a spiral galaxy in the constellation Leo, contains the farthest Cepheids yet found at a distance of 29 Mpc. Cepheid variable stars are in no way perfect distance markers: at nearby galaxies they have an error of about 7% and up to a 15% error for the most distant.

=== Supernovae ===
[[File:SN1994D.jpg|thumb|[[SN 1994D]] (bright spot on the lower left) in the [[NGC 4526]] galaxy. Image by [[NASA]], [[ESA]], The Hubble Key Project Team, and The High-Z Supernova Search Team]]

There are several different methods for which [[supernova]]e can be used to measure extragalactic distances.

==== Measuring a supernova's photosphere ====
We can assume that a supernova expands in a spherically symmetric manner. If the supernova is close enough such that we can measure the angular extent, ''θ''(''t''), of its [[photosphere]], we can use the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is angular velocity, ''θ'' is angular extent. In order to get an accurate measurement, it is necessary to make two observations separated by time Δ''t''. Subsequently, we can use

:&lt;math&gt;\ d = \frac{V_{ej}}{\omega} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where d is the distance to the supernova, ''V&lt;sub&gt;ej&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the supernova's ejecta's radial velocity (it can be assumed that ''V&lt;sub&gt;ej&lt;/sub&gt;'' equals ''V&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;'' if spherically symmetric).

This method works only if the supernova is close enough to be able to measure accurately the photosphere. Similarly, the expanding shell of gas is in fact not perfectly spherical nor a perfect blackbody. Also interstellar extinction can hinder the accurate measurements of the photosphere. This problem is further exacerbated by core-collapse supernova. All of these factors contribute to the distance error of up to 25%.

==== Type Ia light curves ====

[[Type Ia supernovae]] are some of the best ways to determine extragalactic distances. Ia's occur when a binary white dwarf star begins to accrete matter from its companion star. As the white dwarf gains matter, eventually it reaches its [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of &lt;math&gt; 1.4 M_{\odot} &lt;/math&gt;.

Once reached, the star becomes unstable and undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction. Because all Type Ia supernovae explode at about the same mass, their absolute magnitudes are all the same. This makes them very useful as standard candles. All Type Ia supernovae have a standard blue and visual magnitude of

:&lt;math&gt;\ M_B \approx M_V \approx -19.3 \pm 0.3 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, when observing a Type Ia supernova, if it is possible to determine what its peak magnitude was, then its distance can be calculated. It is not intrinsically necessary to capture the supernova directly at its peak magnitude; using the '''multicolor light curve shape''' method ('''MLCS'''), the shape of the light curve (taken at any reasonable time after the initial explosion) is compared to a family of parameterized curves that will determine the absolute magnitude at the maximum brightness. This method also takes into effect interstellar extinction/dimming from dust and gas.

Similarly, the '''stretch method''' fits the particular supernovae magnitude light curves to a template light curve. This template, as opposed to being several light curves at different wavelengths (MLCS) is just a single light curve that has been stretched (or compressed) in time. By using this ''Stretch Factor'', the peak magnitude can be determined.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Using Type Ia supernovae is one of the most accurate methods, particularly since supernova explosions can be visible at great distances (their luminosities rival that of the galaxy in which they are situated), much farther than Cepheid Variables (500 times farther). Much time has been devoted to the refining of this method. The current uncertainty approaches a mere 5%, corresponding to an uncertainty of just 0.1 magnitudes.

==== Novae in distance determinations ====

[[Nova]]e can be used in much the same way as supernovae to derive extragalactic distances. There is a direct relation between a nova's max magnitude and the time for its visible light to decline by two magnitudes. This relation is shown to be:

:&lt;math&gt;\ M^\max_V = -9.96 - 2.31 \log_{10} \dot{x} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the time derivative of the nova's mag, describing the average rate of decline over the first 2 magnitudes.

After novae fade, they are about as bright as the most luminous Cepheid variable stars, therefore both these techniques have about the same max distance: ~ 20 Mpc. The error in this method produces an uncertainty in magnitude of about&amp;nbsp;±0.4

=== Globular cluster luminosity function ===

Based on the method of comparing the luminosities of globular clusters (located in galactic halos) from distant galaxies to that of the [[Virgo Cluster]], the [[globular cluster luminosity function]] carries an uncertainty of distance of about 20% (or&amp;nbsp;0.4 magnitudes).

US astronomer William Alvin Baum first attempted to use globular clusters to measure distant elliptical galaxies. He compared the brightest globular clusters in Virgo A galaxy with those in Andromeda, assuming the luminosities of the clusters were the same in both. Knowing the distance to Andromeda, Baum has assumed a direct correlation and estimated Virgo A's distance.

Baum used just a single globular cluster, but individual formations are often poor standard candles. Canadian astronomer [[René Racine]] assumed the use of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) would lead to a better approximation. The number of globular clusters as a function of magnitude is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \Phi (m) = A e^{(m-m_0)^2/2\sigma^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the turnover magnitude, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnitude of the Virgo cluster, and sigma is the dispersion&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;1.4 mag.

It is important to remember that it is assumed that globular clusters all have roughly the same luminosities within the [[universe]]. There is no universal globular cluster luminosity function that applies to all galaxies.

=== Planetary nebula luminosity function ===
Like the GCLF method, a similar numerical analysis can be used for [[planetary nebula]]e (note the use of more than one!) within far off galaxies. The [[planetary nebula luminosity function]] (PNLF) was first proposed in the late 1970s by Holland Cole and David Jenner. They suggested that all planetary nebulae might all have similar maximum intrinsic brightness, now calculated to be M = −4.53. This would therefore make them potential standard candles for determining extragalactic distances.

Astronomer George Howard Jacoby and his colleagues later proposed that the PNLF function equaled:

:&lt;math&gt;\ N (M) \propto e^{0.307 M} (1 - e^{3(M^{*} - M)} ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where N(M) is number of planetary nebula, having absolute magnitude M. M* is equal to the nebula with the brightest magnitude.

=== Surface brightness fluctuation method ===
[[File:Galaxy cluster Abell 2218 gravitaitonal lens.jpg|thumb|right|Galaxy cluster]]

The following method deals with the overall inherent properties of galaxies. These methods, though with varying error percentages, have the ability to make distance estimates beyond 100 Mpc, though it is usually applied more locally.

The [[surface brightness fluctuation]] (SBF) method takes advantage of the use of [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras on telescopes. Because of spatial fluctuations in a galaxy's surface brightness, some pixels on these cameras will pick up more stars than others. However, as distance increases the picture will become increasingly smoother. Analysis of this describes a magnitude of the pixel-to-pixel variation, which is directly related to a galaxy's distance.

=== D–σ relation ===

The [[Sigma-D relation|D–σ relation]], used in [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]], relates the angular diameter (D) of the galaxy to its [[velocity dispersion]]. It is important to describe exactly what D represents, in order to understand this method. It is, more precisely, the galaxy's angular diameter out to the [[surface brightness]] level of 20.75 B-mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. This surface brightness is independent of the galaxy's actual distance from us. Instead, D is inversely proportional to the galaxy's distance, represented as d. Thus, this relation does not employ standard candles. Rather, D provides a [[standard ruler]]. This relation between D and σ is

:&lt;math&gt; \log (D) = 1.333 \log (\sigma) + C \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where C is a constant which depends on the distance to the galaxy clusters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

This method has the potential to become one of the strongest methods of galactic distance calculators, perhaps exceeding the range of even the Tully–Fisher method. As of today, however, elliptical galaxies aren't bright enough to provide a calibration for this method through the use of techniques such as Cepheids. Instead, calibration is done using more crude methods.

== Overlap and scaling ==
A succession of distance indicators, which is the distance ladder, is needed for determining distances to other galaxies. The reason is that objects bright enough to be recognized and measured at such distances are so rare that few or none are present nearby, so there are too few examples close enough with reliable trigonometric parallax to calibrate the indicator. For example, Cepheid variables, one of the best indicators for nearby [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], cannot yet be satisfactorily calibrated by parallax alone, though the Gaia space mission is expected to solve that specific problem. The situation is further complicated by the fact that different stellar populations generally do not have all types of stars in them. Cepheids in particular are massive stars, with short lifetimes, so they will only be found in places where stars have very recently been formed. Consequently, because [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] usually have long ceased to have large-scale star formation, they will not have Cepheids. Instead, distance indicators whose origins are in an older stellar population (like novae and RR Lyrae variables) must be used. However, RR Lyrae variables are less luminous than Cepheids, and novae are unpredictable and an intensive monitoring program—and luck during that program—is needed to gather enough novae in the target galaxy for a good distance estimate.

Because the more distant steps of the cosmic distance ladder depend upon the nearer ones, the more distant steps include the effects of [[error]]s in the nearer steps, both systematic and statistical ones. The result of these [[propagation of uncertainty|propagating errors]] means that distances in astronomy are rarely known to the same level of precision as measurements in the other sciences, and that the precision necessarily is poorer for more distant types of object.

Another concern, especially for the very brightest standard candles, is their "standardness": how homogeneous the objects are in their true absolute magnitude. For some of these different standard candles, the homogeneity is based on theories about the [[star formation|formation]] and [[stellar evolution|evolution]] of stars and galaxies, and is thus also subject to uncertainties in those aspects. For the most luminous of distance indicators, the Type Ia supernovae, this homogeneity is known to be poor&lt;ref name="Gilfanov2010"&gt;{{cite journal

The observational result of Hubble's Law, the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] relationship between distance and the speed with which a galaxy is moving away from us (usually referred to as [[redshift]]) is a product of the cosmic distance ladder. [[Edwin Hubble]] observed that fainter galaxies are more redshifted. Finding the value of the Hubble constant was the result of decades of work by many astronomers, both in amassing the measurements of galaxy redshifts and in calibrating the steps of the distance ladder. Hubble's Law is the primary means we have for estimating the distances of [[quasar]]s and distant galaxies in which individual distance indicators cannot be seen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34449">'''Darwinian literary studies''' (also known as '''literary Darwinism''') is a branch of [[literary criticism]] that studies [[literature]] in the context of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]], including [[gene-culture coevolution]].  It represents an emerging trend of [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] thought in intellectual disciplines beyond those traditionally considered as [[evolutionary biology]]: [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[evolutionary developmental psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[affective neuroscience]], [[behavioural genetics]], [[evolutionary epistemology]], and other such disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of evolutionary research in the human sciences, see [http://www.hbes.com/ Human Behavior and Evolution Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and scope==

Interest in the relationship between Darwinism and the study of literature began in the nineteenth century, for example, among Italian literary critics.&lt;ref name="Canadelli 2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elena Canadelli|author2=Paolo Coccia|author3=Telmo Pievani|editor1-last=Glick|editor1-first=Thomas F.|editor2-last=Shaffer|editor2-first=Elinor|title=The Literary and Cultural Reception of Charles Darwin in Europe|date=2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781780937120|pages=483–509|chapter=Darwin and Literature in Italy: A Profitable Relationship}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ugo Angelo Canello]] argued that literature was the history of the human psyche, and as such, played a part in the struggle for natural selection, while [[Francesco de Sanctis]] argued that [[Emile Zola]] "brought the concepts of natural selection, struggle for existence, adaptation and environment to bear in his novels".&lt;ref name="Canadelli 2014" /&gt;

Modern Darwinian literary studies arose in part as a result of its proponents' dissatisfaction with the [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] and [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] philosophies that had come to dominate literary study during the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, the Darwinists took issue with the argument that [[discourse]] constructs reality. The Darwinists argue that biologically grounded dispositions constrain and inform discourse. This argument runs counter to what evolutionary psychologists assert is the central idea in the "[[Standard Social Science Model]]": that [[culture]] wholly constitutes human values and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;On the conceptual character of poststructuralism, see [[Terry Eagleton]], "Post-structuralism" in ''Literary Theory: An Introduction'', (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983); [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20027411 M. H. Abrams, "The Transformation of English Studies: 1930-1995"], ''Daedalus''; and [[Jonathan Culler]], ''Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1997). For Darwinist critiques of "cultural constructivism," see [http://www.theamericanscholar.org/getting-it-all-wrong/ Brian Boyd, "Getting It All Wrong"]; and [http://www.umsl.edu/~carrolljc/Documents%20linked%20to%20indiex/IN_LIT_DAR/poststructuralism_cultural_criticism_and.pdf Joseph Carroll, "Pluralism, Poststructuralism, and Evolutionary Theory,"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary Darwinists use concepts from evolutionary biology and the evolutionary human sciences to formulate principles of literary theory and interpret literary texts. They investigate interactions between [[human nature]] and the forms of cultural imagination, including literature and its oral antecedents. By "human nature", they mean a pan-human, genetically transmitted set of dispositions: motives, emotions, features of personality, and forms of cognition. Because the Darwinists concentrate on relations between genetically transmitted dispositions and specific cultural configurations, they often describe their work as "biocultural critique".&lt;ref&gt;For introductory commentaries on evolutionary studies in the humanities, see [http://hfromm.net/professional/DarwinBoth.html Harold Fromm, "The New Darwinism in the Humanities"], ''Hudson Review''; [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/magazine/the-literary-darwinists.html?pagewanted=2 D. T. Max, "The Literary Darwinists"], ''The New York Times''; [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7075/full/439388a.html John Whitfield, "Literary Darwinism: Textual Selection"], ''Nature''; [http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2008.09-the-other-darwin-mark-czarnecki-creationism-origin-of-the-species-evolution/ Mark Czarnecki, "The Other Darwin"], ''Walrus Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many literary Darwinists aim not just at creating another "approach" or "movement" in literary theory; they aim at fundamentally altering the paradigm within which literary study is now conducted. They want to establish a new alignment among the disciplines and ultimately to encompass all other possible approaches to literary study. They rally to Edward O. Wilson's cry for "consilience" among all the branches of learning. Like Wilson, they envision nature as an integrated set of elements and forces extending in an unbroken chain of material causation from the lowest level of subatomic particles to the highest levels of cultural imagination. And like Wilson, they regard evolutionary biology as the pivotal discipline uniting the hard sciences with the social sciences and the humanities. They believe that humans have evolved in an adaptive relation to their environment. They argue that for humans, as for all other species, evolution has shaped the anatomical, physiological, and neurological characteristics of the species, and they think that human behavior, feeling, and thought are fundamentally shaped by those characteristics. They make it their business to consult evolutionary biology and evolutionary social science in order to determine what those characteristics are, and they bring that information to bear on their understanding of the products of the human imagination.&lt;ref&gt;For general statements about the aims of scholars in this field, see [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v029/29.1boyd.html Brian Boyd, "Literature and Evolution: A Bio-Cultural Approach"]; [http://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/what-is-literary-darwinism-an-interview-with-joseph-carroll/ Interview with Joseph Carroll, "What Is Literary Darwinism?"]; [http://www.muse.uq.edu.au/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v027/27.2gottschall.html Jonathan Gottschall, "The Tree of Knowledge and Darwinian Literary Study"]; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tx00yV_qNQ Maya Lessov, A Filmed Interview with Joseph Carroll, Brian Boyd, and Jonathan Gottschall]; and [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v026/26.2nordlund.html Marcus Nordlund, "Consilient Literary Interpretation"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary literary criticism of a minimalist kind consists in identifying basic, common human needs—survival, sex, and status, for instance—and using those categories to describe the behavior of characters depicted in literary texts. Others pose for themselves a form of criticism involving an overarching interpretive challenge: to construct continuous explanatory sequences linking the highest level of causal evolutionary explanation to the most particular effects in individual works of literature. Within evolutionary biology, the highest level of causal explanation involves adaptation by means of natural selection. Starting from the premise that the human mind has evolved in an adaptive relation to its environment, literary Darwinists undertake to characterize the phenomenal qualities of a literary work (tone, style, theme, and formal organization), locate the work in a cultural context, explain that cultural context as a particular organization of the elements of human nature within a specific set of environmental conditions (including cultural traditions), identify an implied author and an implied reader, examine the responses of actual readers (for instance, other literary critics), describe the socio-cultural, political, and psychological functions the work fulfills, locate those functions in relation to the evolved needs of human nature, and link the work comparatively with other artistic works, using a taxonomy of themes, formal elements, affective elements, and functions derived from a comprehensive model of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of the topics and approaches in this field, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=usZR5aXFmiUC&amp;pg=PA637&amp;lpg=PA637&amp;dq=joseph+carroll+evolutionary+approaches+to+literature+and+drama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=StMHaB_3yO&amp;sig=KJxvcQcepCmXJYqvd9cJQA4jIEw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LbWqS7X1M5OYsgOq0_HMBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20carroll%20evolutionary%20approaches%20to%20literature%20and%20drama&amp;f=false Joseph Carroll, "Evolutionary Approaches to Literature and Drama"].

Contributors to evolutionary studies in literature have included humanists, biologists, and social scientists. Some of the biologists and social scientists have adopted primarily discursive methods for discussing literary subjects, and some of the humanists have adopted the empirical, quantitative methods typical of research in the sciences.  Literary scholars and scientists have also collaborated in research that combines the methods typical of work in the humanities with methods typical of work in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of evolutionary criticism making use of empirical, quantitative methodology, see [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v033/33.1.carroll.html Carroll, Gottschall, Johnson, and Kruger, "Agonistic Structure in Nineteenth-Century British Novels: Doing the Math"]; [http://www.washjeff.edu/users/jgottschall/Papers,%20etc/greater%20emphasis%20on%20female%20attract.pdf Jonathan Gottschall, "Greater Emphasis on Female Attractiveness in ''Homo sapiens'': A Revised Solution to an Old Evolutionary Riddle"]; [http://www.washjeff.edu/users/jgottschall/Papers,%20etc/proofs_manifesto_feminist.pdf Jonathan Gottschall, "A Modest Manifesto and Testing the Hypotheses of Feminist Fairy Tale Studies"]; [http://www.muse.uq.edu.au/journals/marvels_and_tales/v023/23.2.gottschall.html Jonathan Gottschall, "Response to Kathleen Ragan's 'What Happened to the Heroines in Folktales?'"]; [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v030/30.2gottschall.html Jonathan Gottschall and Marcus Nordlund, "Romantic Love: A Literary Universal?"]; [http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep06715738.pdf Johnson, Carroll, Gottschall, and Kruger, "Hierarchy in the Library: Egalitarian Dynamics in Victorian Novels]; and [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/shakespeare.pdf Stiller, Nettle, and Dunbar, "The Small World of Shakespeare's Plays"].

==Adaptive function of literature and the arts==

The most hotly debated issue in evolutionary literary study concerns the adaptive functions of literature and other arts—whether there are any adaptive functions, and if so, what they might be.   Proposed functions include transmitting information, including about kin relations, and by providing the audience with a model and rehearsal for how to behave in similar situations that may arise in the future.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 44 Evolutionary approaches of literature and drama by Joseph Carrol&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Pinker (''How the Mind Works'', 1997) suggests that aesthetic responsiveness is merely a side effect of cognitive powers that evolved to fulfill more practical functions,  but Pinker also suggests that narratives can provide information for adaptively relevant problems. Geoffrey Miller (''The Mating Mind'', 2000) argues that artistic productions in the ancestral environment served as forms of sexual display in order to demonstrate fitness and attract mates, similarly to the function of the [[peacock]]'s tail. Brian Boyd (''On the Origin of Stories'', 2009) argues that the arts are forms of cognitive "play" that enhance pattern recognition. In company with Ellen Dissanayake (''Art and Intimacy'', 2000), Boyd also argues that the arts provide means of creating shared social identity and help create and maintain [[human bonding]]. Dissanayake, [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]] (''Literary Darwinism'' 2004), and [[Denis Dutton]] (''The Art Instinct'', 2009) all argue that the arts help organize the human mind by giving emotionally and aesthetically modulated models of reality. By participating in the simulated life of other people one gains a greater understanding of the motivations of oneself and other people. The idea that the arts function as means of psychological organization subsumes the ideas that the arts provide adaptively relevant information, enable us to consider alternative behavioral scenarios, enhance pattern recognition, and serve as means for creating shared social identity. And of course, the arts can be used for sexual display. In that respect, the arts are like most other human products—clothing, jewelry, shelter, means of transportation, etc. The hypothesis that the arts help organize the mind is not incompatible with the hypothesis of sexual display, but it subordinates sexual display to a more primary adaptive function.&lt;ref&gt;For commentaries on the adaptive (or non-adaptive) functions of the arts, see [http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/staff/files/bboy001/boyd_ev_theories_of_art.pdf Brian Boyd, "Evolutionary Theories of Art,"] in ''The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', ed.

==Hypotheses about formal literary features==

Some Darwinists have proposed explanations for formal literary features, including genres. [[Meter (poetry)|Poetic meter]] has been attributed to a biologically based three-second metric. Gender preferences for [[pornography]] and [[romance novel]]s have been explained by [[sexual selection]]. Different genres have been conjectured to correspond to different [[basic emotions]]: [[tragedy]] corresponding to sadness, fear, and anger; comedy to joy and surprise; and satire to anger, disgust, and contempt. Tragedy has also been associated with status conflict and comedy with mate selection. The satiric [[dystopian]] novel has been explained by contrasting universal human needs and oppressive state organization.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

==Distinguishing literary Darwinism==

''Cosmic evolutionism and evolutionary analogism:'' Literary Theorists who would call themselves "literary Darwinists" or claim some close alignment with the literary Darwinists share one central idea: that the adapted mind produces literature and that literature reflects the structure and character of the adapted mind. There are at least two other ways of integrating evolution into literary theory: cosmic evolutionism and evolutionary analogism. Cosmic evolutionists identify some universal process of development or progress and identify literary structures as microcosmic versions of that process. Proponents of cosmic evolution include [[Frederick Turner (poet)|Frederick Turner]], Alex Argyros, and Richard Cureton. Evolutionary analogists take the process of Darwinian evolution—blind variation and selective retention—as a widely applicable model for all development. The psychologist Donald Campbell advances the idea that all intellectual creativity can be conceived as a form of random variation and selective retention. Rabkin and Simon offer an instance in literary study. They argue that cultural creations "evolve in the same way as do biological organisms, that is, as complex adaptive systems that succeed or fail according to their fitness to their environment."&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Rabkin, and C. P. Simon, "Age, Sex, and Evolution in the Science Fiction Marketplace." ''Interdisciplinary Literary Studies'', 2 (2001): 45-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics or theorists who have some affiliation with evolutionary biology but who would not identify themselves as literary Darwinists include William Benzon (''Beethoven's Anvil'') and William Flesch (''Comeuppance'').

''Cognitive rhetoric:'' Practitioners of "cognitive rhetoric" or [[cognitive poetics]] affiliate themselves with certain language-centered areas of cognitive psychology. The chief theorists in this school argue that language is based in metaphors, and they claim that metaphors are themselves rooted in biology or the body, but they do not argue that human nature consists in a highly structured set of motivational and cognitive dispositions that have evolved through an adaptive process regulated by natural selection. Cognitive rhetoricians are generally more anxious than literary Darwinists to associate themselves with postmodern theories of "discourse," but some cognitive rhetoricians make gestures toward evolutionary psychology, and some critics closely affiliated with evolutionary psychology have found common ground with the cognitive rhetoricians.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v023/23.2boyd.html Brian Boyd, "Literature and Discovery," ''Philosophy and Literature'', 23 (1999): 313-33]; [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v025/25.3sacks.html Nancy Easterlin, "Romanticism's Gray Matter," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 26 (2002): 443-55.]&lt;/ref&gt; The seminal authorities in cognitive rhetoric are the language philosophers [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]] and [[George Lakoff]]. The most prominent literary theorist in the field is [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]]. Other literary scholars associated with cognitive rhetoric include Mary Thomas Crane, F. Elizabeth Hart, Tony Jackson, Alan Richardson, Ellen Spolsky, [[Francis Steen]], and [[Lisa Zunshine]].&lt;ref&gt;On the relations between cognitive rhetoric and literary Darwinism, see [http://www.style.niu.edu/ Joseph Carroll, "An Evolutionary Paradigm for Literary Study," ''Style'' 42 (2008): 105-108]; [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v025/25.2hart.html F.

==Critical commentaries==
Some of the commentaries included in the [http://www.style.niu.edu/ special double issue of ''Style''] are critical of literary Darwinism. Other critical commentaries include those of [http://www.entelechyjournal.com/billbenzon.html William Benzon, "Signposts for a Naturalist Criticism,"] (''Entelechy: Mind &amp; Culture,'' Fall 2005/Winter 2006); [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090608/deresiewicz William Deresiewicz, "Adaptation: On Literary Darwinism,"] ''The Nation'' June 8, 2009: 26-31; [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0674032284/ William Flesch, ''Comeuppance: Costly Signaling, Altruistic Punishment, and Other Biological Components of Fiction'',] (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2008); [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1412811473/ Eugene Goodheart, ''Darwinian Misadventures in the Humanities'',] (New Brunswick: NJ: Transaction, 2007); Jonathan Kramnick, "Against Literary Darwinism," in ''Critical Inquiry'', Winter 2011; "Debating Literary Darwinism," a set of responses to Jonathan Kramnick's essay, along with Kramnick's rejoinder, in ''Critical Inquiry'', Winter 2012; Alan Richardson, "Studies in Literature and Cognition: A Field Map," in [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0754638499/ ''The Work of Fiction: Cognition, Culture, and Complexity''], ed. Alan Richardson and Ellen Spolsky (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004 1-29); and Lisa Zunshine, "What is Cognitive Cultural Studies?," in ''Introduction to Cognitive Cultural Studies'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 2010 1-33). Goodheart and Deresiewicz, adopting a traditional humanist perspective, reject efforts to ground literary study in biology. Richardson disavows the Darwinists' tendency to attack poststructuralism. Richardson and Benzon both align themselves with cognitive science and distinguish that alignment from an alignment with evolutionary psychology. Flesch makes use of evolutionary research on game theory, costly signaling, and altruistic punishment but, like [[Stephen Jay Gould]], professes himself hostile to evolutionary psychology. For a commentary that is sympathetic to evolutionary psychology but skeptical about the possibilities of using it for literary study, see [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v031/31.1pinker.html Steven Pinker, "Toward a Consilient Study of Literature,"] a review of ''The Literary Animal'', ''Philosophy and Literature'' 31 (2007): 162-178.[[David Fishelov]] has argued that the attempt to link Darwinism to literary studies has failed "to produce compelling evidence to support some of its basic assumptions (notably that literature is an [[adaptation]])" and has called on literary scholars to be more conceptually rigorous when they pursue "empirical research into different aspects of literary evolution." &lt;ref&gt; David Fishelov, "Evolution and Literary Studies: Time to Evolve," ''Philosophy and Literature, Vol. 41, No. 2 (October 2017): 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid dynamics]], '''disk loading''' or '''disc loading''' is the average [[pressure]] change across an [[actuator disk]], such as an airscrew. Airscrews with a relatively low disk loading are typically called rotors, including [[helicopter]] [[Helicopter rotor|main rotor]]s and [[tail rotor]]s; [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s typically have a higher disk loading.&lt;ref name="isbn0-486-64647-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Keys, C.

The [[V-22 Osprey]] [[tiltrotor]] aircraft has a high disk loading relative to a helicopter in the hover mode, but a relatively low disk loading in [[fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] mode compared to a [[turboprop]] aircraft.&lt;ref name=VDTR&gt;{{cite conference|title=A Variable Diameter Short Haul Civil Tiltrotor |citeseerx = 10.1.1.45.612 |author1=Wang, James M. |author2=Jones, Christopher T. |author3=Nixon, Mark W. |conference= 55th Annual Forum of the American Helicopter Society| location=[[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada| date=1999-05-27|quote=The variable diameter tiltrotor (VDTR) is a Sikorsky concept aimed at improving tiltrotor hover and cruise performance currently limited by disk loading that is much higher in hover than conventional helicopter, and much lower in cruise than turbo-prop systems.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rotors==
Disc loading of a [[hover (helicopter)|hover]]ing helicopter 
is the ratio of its weight to the
total main rotor disc area. It is determined by dividing
the total helicopter weight by the rotor disc area,
which is the area swept by the blades of a rotor. Disc
area can be found by using the span of one rotor blade
as the radius of a circle and then determining the area
the blades encompass during a complete rotation. When a helicopter is being maneuvered, its disc loading changes.
The higher the loading, the more power needed to
maintain rotor speed.&lt;ref name=FAA&gt;{{cite book

Increasing the weight of a helicopter increases disk loading. For a given weight, a helicopter with shorter rotors will have higher disk loading, and will require more engine power to hover. A low disk loading improves [[Autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]] performance in [[rotorcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Noor, Ahmed Khairy |title=Future Aeronautical and Space Systems (Progress in Astronautics and Aeronautics) |publisher=AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics) |location= |year=1996 |pages= 66|isbn=1-56347-188-4 |quote=Reduced disk loading in the vertical mode also results in lower downwash and improved capability for autorotation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leishGyro&gt;Leishman, J.

&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, an [[autogyro]] (or gyroplane) has a lower rotor disc loading than a helicopter, which provides a slower rate of descent in autorotation.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;

==Propellers==
In reciprocating and propeller engines, disk loading can be defined as the ratio between propeller-induced velocity and freestream velocity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Lower disk loading will increase efficiency, so it is generally desirable to have larger propellers from an efficiency standpoint. Maximum efficiency is reduced as disk loading is increased due to the rotating slipstream; using [[contra-rotating propellers]] can alleviate this problem allowing high maximum efficiency even at relatively high disc loadings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Birdsall | first = David | title = Aircraft Performance | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-521-56836-6 | pages=99 |quote=contra-rotating propellers this rotational loss can be eliminated and maximum efficiencies approaching 0.9 can be obtained even with high disc loading }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disc loading of the propellers is significantly higher than realised on former tactical transport aircraft like C130H or Transall C160.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The ''momentum theory'' or ''disk actuator theory'' describes a [[mathematical model]] of an ideal actuator disk, developed by [[William John Macquorn Rankine|W.J.M. Rankine]] (1865), [[Alfred George Greenhill]] (1888) and [[R.E. Froude]] (1889). The [[helicopter]] [[helicopter rotor|rotor]] is modeled as an infinitely thin disc with an infinite number of blades that induce a constant pressure jump over the disk area and along the axis of rotation. For a helicopter that is [[hover (helicopter)|hover]]ing, the aerodynamic force is vertical and exactly balances the helicopter weight, with no lateral force.

The upward action on the helicopter results in a downward reaction on the air flowing through the rotor. The downward reaction produces a downward velocity on the air, increasing its [[kinetic energy]]. This energy transfer from the rotor to the air is the induced power loss of the rotary wing, which is analogous to the [[lift-induced drag]] of a fixed-wing aircraft.

[[Conservation of linear momentum]] relates the induced velocity downstream in the far wake field to the rotor thrust per unit of [[mass flow]]. [[Conservation of energy]] considers these parameters as well as the induced velocity at the rotor disk. [[Conservation of mass]] relates the mass flow to the induced velocity. The momentum theory applied to a helicopter gives the relationship between induced power loss and rotor thrust, which can be used to analyze the performance of the aircraft. [[Viscosity]] and [[compressibility]] of the air, [[friction]]al losses, and rotation of the slipstream in the wake are not considered.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

===Momentum theory===
For an actuator disk of area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, with uniform induced velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; at the rotor disk, and with &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; as the [[density of air]], the [[mass flow rate]] &lt;math&gt;^\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt; through the disk area is:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot m = \rho \, A \, v.&lt;/math&gt;

By conservation of mass, the mass flow rate is constant across the [[slipstream]] both upstream and downstream of the disk (regardless of velocity). Since the flow far upstream of a helicopter in a level hover is at rest, the starting velocity, momentum, and energy are zero. If the homogeneous [[slipstream]] far downstream of the disk has velocity &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, by conservation of momentum the total thrust &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; developed over the disk is equal to the rate of change of momentum, which assuming zero starting velocity is:

:&lt;math&gt; T= \dot m\, w.&lt;/math&gt;

By conservation of energy, the work done by the rotor must equal the energy change in the slipstream:

:&lt;math&gt; T\, v= \tfrac12\, \dot m\, {w^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and eliminating terms, we get:

:&lt;math&gt; v= \tfrac12\, w.&lt;/math&gt;

So the velocity of the wake far downstream is twice the velocity at the disk, which is the same result for an elliptically loaded fixed wing predicted by [[lifting-line theory]].&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book |author=Johnson, Wayne |title=Helicopter theory |chapter=2|publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |year=1994 |pages= 28–34|isbn=0-486-68230-7|quote=In the momentum theory analysis the rotor is modeled as an actuator disk, which is a circular surface of zero thickness that can support a pressure difference and thus accelerate the air through the disk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bernoulli's principle===

To compute the disk loading using [[Bernoulli's principle]], we assume the pressure in the slipstream far downstream is equal to the starting pressure &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;, which is equal to the [[atmospheric pressure]]. From the starting point to the disk we have:

:&lt;math&gt; p_0 =\, p_1 +\ \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Between the disk and the distant wake, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; p_2 +\ \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^2 =\, p_0 +\ \tfrac12\, \rho\, w^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining equations, the disk loading &lt;math&gt;T /\, A&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {T}{A} = p_2 -\, p_1 = \tfrac12\, \rho\, w^2&lt;/math&gt;

The total pressure in the distant wake is:

:&lt;math&gt; p_0 + \tfrac12\, \rho\, w^2 =\, p_0 + \frac {T}{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

So the pressure change across the disk is equal to the disk loading. Above the disk the pressure change is:

:&lt;math&gt; p_0 - \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^2 =\, p_0 -\, \tfrac14 \frac {T}{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

Below the disk, the pressure change is:

:&lt;math&gt; p_0 + \tfrac32\, \rho\, v^2 =\, p_0 +\, \tfrac34 \frac {T}{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

The pressure along the slipstream is always falling downstream, except for the positive pressure jump across the disk.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

===Power required===
From the momentum theory, thrust is:
:&lt;math&gt; T = \dot m\, w = \dot m\, (2  v) = 2 \rho\, A\, v^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The induced velocity is:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{A} \cdot \frac{1}{2 \rho}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;T/A&lt;/math&gt; is the disk loading as before, and the power &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; required in hover (in the ideal case) is:

:&lt;math&gt;P = T v = T \sqrt{\frac{T}{A} \cdot \frac{1}{2 \rho}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the induced velocity can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{P}{T} = \left [ \frac{T}{P} \right ] ^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Electrochemical engineering''' is the branch of chemical engineering dealing with the technological applications of electrochemical phenomena, such as electrosynthesis of chemicals, [[electrowinning]] and refining of metals,  flow batteries and [[fuel cells]], surface modification by electrodeposition, electrochemical separations and corrosion. This discipline is an overlap between [[electrochemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]].

According with the [[IUPAC]], the term ''electrochemical engineering'' is reserved for electricity intensive processes for industrial or energy storage applications, and should not be confused with ''applied electrochemistry'', which comprises small batteries, amperometric sensors, microfluidic devices, microelectrodes, solid-state devices, voltammetry at disc electrodes, etc. 

More than 6% of the electricity is consumed by large-scale electrochemical operations in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bebelis|first1=S.|last2=Bouzek|first2=K.|last3=Cornell|first3=A.|last4=Ferreira|first4=M.G.S.|last5=Kelsall|first5=G.H.|last6=Lapicque|first6=F.|last7=Ponce de León|first7=C.|last8=Rodrigo|first8=M.A.|last9=Walsh|first9=F.C.|title=Highlights during the development of electrochemical engineering|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=October 2013|volume=91|issue=10|pages=1998–2020|doi=10.1016/j.cherd.2013.08.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
[[File:Electrochemical engineering (corrected).jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|This diagram shows the relationship between electrochemical engineering and other disciplines.]]

Electrochemical engineering combines the study of heterogeneous charge transfer at electrode/electrolyte interphases with the development of practical materials and processes. Fundamental  considerations include electrode materials and the kinetics of redox species. The development of the technology involves the study of the electrochemical reactors, their potential and current distribution, mass transport conditions, hydrodynamics, geometry and components as well as the quantification of its overall performance in terms of reaction yield, conversion efficiency, and energy efficiency. Industrial developments require further reactor and process design, fabrication methods, testing and product development.

Electrochemical engineering considers current distribution, fluid flow, mass transfer, and the kinetics of the electro reactions in order to design efficient electrochemical reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=John|title=Engineering design of electrochemical systems|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry|date=1968|volume=60|issue=4|pages=12–27|doi=10.1021/ie50700a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most electrochemical operations are performed in filter-press reactors with parallel plate electrodes or, less often, in stirred tanks with rotating cylinder electrodes. Fuel cell and flow battery stacks are types of filter-press reactors. Most of them are continuous operations.

==History==
[[File:Cell room of a chlorine-caustic soda plant.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Cell room of a chlor-alkali plant ca. 1920]]

This branch of engineering emerged gradually from chemical engineering as electrical power sources became available in the mid 19th century. [[Michael Faraday]] described his laws of electrolysis in 1833, relating for the first time the amount of electrical charge and converted mass. In 1886 [[Charles Martin Hall]] developed a cheap electrochemical process for the extraction of aluminium from its ore in molten salts, constituting the first true large-scale electrochemical industry. Later, [[Hamilton Castner]] improved the process aluminium manufacturing and devised the electrolysis of brine in large mercury cells for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, effectively founding the chlor-alkali industry with Karl Kellner in 1892. The next year, Paul L. Hulin patented filter-press type electrochemical cells in France. [[Charles Frederick Burgess]] developed the electrolytic refining of iron ca. 1904 and later ran a successful battery company. Burgess published one of the first texts on the field in 1920. During the first three decades of the 20th century, industrial electrochemistry followed an empirical approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Electrochemistry Books Published Before 1950|url=http://knowledge.electrochem.org/estir/old-books.htm|publisher=The Electrochemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Second World War, interest focused towards the fundaments of electrochemical reactions. Among other developments, the [[potentiostat]] (1937) enabled such studies. A critical advance was provided by the work of [[Carl Wagner]] and [[Veniamin Levich]] in 1962 who linked the hydrodynamics of a flowing electrolyte towards a rotating disc electrode with the mass transport control of the electrochemical reaction through a rigorous mathematical treatment. The same year, Wagner described for the first time "The Scope of Electrochemical Engineering" as a separated discipline from a physicochemical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=C.|title=The scope of electrochemical engineering|journal=Advances in Electrochemistry and Electrochemical Engineering|volume=2|year=1962|pages=1-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 60s and 70s Charles W. Tobias, who is regarded as the "father of electrochemical engineering" by the [[Electrochemical Society]], was concerned with ionic transport by diffusion, migration, and convection, exact solutions of potential and current distribution problems, conductance in heterogeneous media, quantitative description of processes in porous electrodes. Also in the 60s, [[John Newman (scientist)|John Newman]] pioneered the study of many of the physicochemical laws that govern electrochemical systems, demonstrating how complex electrochemical processes could be analysed mathematically to correctly formulate and solve problems associated with batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers and related technologies. In Switzerland, Norbert Ibl contributed with experimental and theoretical studies of mass transfer and potential distribution in electrolyses, especially at porous electrodes. Fumio Hine carried out equivalent developments in Japan. Several individuals, including Kuhn, Kreysa, Rousar, Fleischmann, Alkire, Coeuret, Pletcher and Walsh established many other training centers and, with their colleagues, developed important experimental and theoretical methods of study. Currently, the main tasks of electrochemical engineering consist in the development of efficient, safe and sustainable technologies for the production of chemicals, metal recovery, remediation and decontamination technologies as well as the design of fuel cells, flow batteries and industrial electrochemical reactors.

The history of electrochemical engineering has been summarised by Wendt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wendt|first1=H.|last2=Kreysa|first2=G.|title=The Scope and History of Electrochemical Engineering|journal=Electrochemical Engineering|pages=1-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03851-2_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lapicque,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lapicque|first1=F.|title=Electrochemical Engineering: An Overview of its Contributions and Promising Features|journal=Chemical Engineering Research and Design|date=2004|volume=82|issue=12|pages=1571–1574|doi=10.1205/cerd.82.12.1571.58046}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stankovic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stankovic|first1=V.|title=Electrochemical Engineering - its appearance, evolution and present status.

==Applications==

Electrochemical engineering is applied in industrial [[water electrolysis]], [[electrolysis]], electrosynthesis, electroplating, [[fuel cells]], [[flow batteries]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arenas|first1=L.F.|last2=Ponce de León|first2=C.|last3=Walsh|first3=F.C.|title=Engineering aspects of the design, construction and performance of modular redox flow batteries for energy storage|journal=Journal of Energy Storage|date=June 2017|volume=11|pages=119–153|doi=10.1016/j.est.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; decontamination of industrial effluents, electrorefining, electrowinning, etc. The main example of an electrolysis based process is the [[Chloralkali process]] for production of caustic soda and chlorine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6873">'''Evolutionary rescue''' is a theoretical situation in which a population recovers from environmental pressure through advantageous genetic change rather than increased gene flow, migration, dispersal or other demographic rescue techniques. While the term was first used in 1995 in Richard Gomulkiewicz and Robert Holt's essay in the journal ''Evolution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomulkiewicz|first1=Richard|last2=Holt|first2=Robert|title=When does natural selection save a population from extinction?|journal=Evolution|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory has since academically matured through review and modeling. The most commonly used meaning of the term was established in Gonzalez et al. (2012), which states that evolutionary rescue "occurs when genetic adaptation allows a population to recover from demographic effects initiated by environmental change that would otherwise cause extirpation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Andrew|title=Evolutionary rescue; an emerging focus at the intersection between ecology and evolution|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical framework ==
Due to rapid losses of [[biodiversity]], [[climate change]], and rapid spread of [[non-native species]] due to [[globalization]], natural environments are changing faster now than in any other time point in human history. Given that traditional framework of [[evolution]] emphasizes that ecologically relevant evolution occurs slowly for the plant and animal kingdoms, the 20th century and 21st century shift in the rate of environmental change naturally raises questions of contemporary evolution. The central question in the framework of evolutionary rescue remains, "If contemporary evolution, also referred to as rapid evolution, occurs, can it be fast enough to foster population persistence in extremely small time-scales?". Proponents of the evolutionary rescue hypothesis argue that evolutionary rescue is a unique phenomenon, separate from two commonly studied escapes from ecological pressures, demographic and genetic rescues. While [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] is a key aspect to all three population survival strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=G|title=Evolutionary rescue and the limits of adaptation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; evolutionary rescue is the only one driven by adaptive evolution mechanistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzales|first1=A.|title=Evolutionary rescue: an emerging focus at the intersection between ecology and evolution|journal= Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci.|date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographic rescue is simply a dynamic driven by source-sink immigration dynamics, whereas genetic rescue is primarily driven by hybridization in combination with immigration. Given the reliance on immigration, it can be difficult to disentangle demographic rescue from genetic rescue. The distinction between these three rescue strategies may be difficult to prove, if it exists, although rescue from negative population growth may be a hallmark.

[[File:Theoretical Depiction of Evolutionary Rescue.png|thumb|left|alt=a theoretical depiction of evolutionary rescue.|The theoretical characterization of evolutionary rescue may be a U-shaped curve.]]

It may be easier to find quantifiable evidence for evolutionary rescue in rapidly shifting environments versus gradually shifting environments (climate change, ocean acidification, etc.). High localization and source-sink biogeographic demographic dynamics may also increase the likelihood of evolutionary rescue. Evolutionary rescue may also be highly characterized by a U-shaped curve, in which the population declines sharply until it passes a stochastic threshold, at which the adaptive allele frequency rapidly increases, with the population rebounding at a slower rate as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomulkiewicz|first1=R.|title=When does evolution by natural selection prevent extinction? |journal=Evolution|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most vulnerable part of the evolutionary rescue process, theoretically, should be the time point during which the population is beyond the stochastic threshold, which exposes the population to random outcomes not determined by genetic or evolutionary mechanisms.

== Empirical evidence ==

While there is empirical evidence for evolutionary rescue, it is important to note that missing temporal, demographic or allelic data makes the majority of these examples suggestive of evolutionary rescue at best. For example, the demographic shifts in ''Gasterosteus aculeatus'' from weakly armored to heavily armored variants following [[bioremediation]] of water clarity in Lake Washington, USA, suggest that increased the predatory efficiency of ''Oncorhynchus clarkii'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitano|first1=J|title=Reverse evolution of armor plates in the threespine stickleback|journal=Current Biology|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although inclusion versus exclusion treatments at controlled densities would provide stronger mechanistic support. Another possible example of evolutionary rescue in nature is the selective response of redbellied black snakes (''Pseudechis porphyriacus'') to cane toads (''Rhinella marina'') in [[Australia]], in which ''P. porphyriacus'' exposed to ''R. marina'' for long periods of time demonstrated rapid adaptive shifts in resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=B.L|last2=Shine|first2=R|title=An invasive species induces rapid adaptive change in a native predator: cane toads and black snakes in Australia|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unresolved questions ==
At the point in time, more substantial theoretical, modeling and empirical work is needed to distinguish evolutionary rescue from traditionally adaptation discourse in the evolutionary biology field.  Currently, one of the key arguments separating evolutionary rescue from adaptation is the reliance on absolutely fitness versus relative fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kliman|first1=Richard|title= AN Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Biology|publisher= Academic Press|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the theory of evolutionary rescue may help inform future [[Conservation biology|conservation]] efforts, more work is needed to explain the role of the interplay between dispersal and negative density dependence on an organism's short-term and long-term capacity for adaptation and evolutionary rescue. Furthermore, more in-depth work on the role of [[stochastic]] fluctuations, particularly in the determination of stochastic thresholds, is needed to establish evolutionary rescue as a viable explanation for trends in evolutionary biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19959">'''Failure rate''' is the [[frequency]] with which an [[systems engineering|engineered system]] or component fails, expressed in failures per unit of time.  It is often denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[λ]] (lambda) and is highly used in [[reliability engineering]].

The failure rate of a system usually depends on time, with the rate varying over the life cycle of the system.  For example, an automobile's failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service.  One does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe, overhaul the brakes, or have major [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] problems in a new vehicle.

In practice, the [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF, 1/λ) is often reported instead of the failure rate. This is valid and useful if the failure rate may be assumed constant – often used for complex units / systems, electronics – and is a general agreement in some reliability standards (Military and Aerospace). It does in this case ''only'' relate to the flat region of the [[bathtub curve]], which is also called the "useful life period". Because of this, it is incorrect to extrapolate MTBF to give an estimate of the service lifetime of a component, which will typically be much less than suggested by the MTBF due to the much higher failure rates in the "end-of-life wearout" part of the "bathtub curve".

The reason for the preferred use for MTBF numbers is that the use of large positive numbers (such as 2000 hours) is more intuitive and easier to remember than very small numbers (such as 0.0005 per hour).

The MTBF is an important system parameter in systems where failure rate needs to be managed, in particular for safety systems. The MTBF appears frequently in the [[engineering]] design requirements, and governs frequency of required system maintenance and inspections.  In special processes called [[renewal process]]es, where the time to recover from failure can be neglected and the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time, the failure rate is simply the multiplicative inverse of the MTBF (1/λ).

A similar ratio used in the [[transport industry|transport industries]], especially in [[railway]]s and [[Truck driver|trucking]] is "mean distance between failures", a variation which attempts to [[Correlation|correlate]] actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices.

Failure rates are important factors in the insurance, finance, commerce and regulatory industries and fundamental to the design of safe systems in a wide variety of applications.

The failure rate can be defined as the following:

:The total number of failures within an item [[statistical population|population]], divided by the total time expended by that population, during a particular measurement interval under stated conditions. (MacDiarmid, ''et al.'')

Although the failure rate, &lt;math&gt;\lambda (t)&lt;/math&gt;, is often thought of as the [[probability]] that a failure occurs in a specified interval given no failure before time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, it is not actually a probability because it can exceed 1. Erroneous expression of the failure rate in % could result in incorrect perception of the measure, especially if it would be measured from repairable systems and multiple systems with non-constant failure rates or different operation times. It can be defined with the aid of the [[reliability function]], also called the survival function, &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of no failure before time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the time to (first) failure distribution (i.e. the failure density function) and &lt;math&gt;R(t)=1-F(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{R(t_1)-R(t_2)}{(t_2-t_1) \cdot R(t_1)}
 = \frac{R(t)-R(t+\Delta t)}{\Delta t \cdot R(t)} \!&lt;/math&gt;

over a time interval &lt;math&gt;(t_2-t_1)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) to &lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;(t_2-t_1)&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this is a [[conditional probability]], where the condition is that the failure has not occurred at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the &lt;math&gt;R(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator.

Hazard rate and ROCOF (rate of occurrence of failures) are often incorrectly seen as the same and equal to the failure rate. {{clarify|date=April 2015}} To clarify; the more promptly items are repaired, the sooner they will break again, so the higher the ROCOF. The hazard rate is however independent of the time to repair and of the logistic delay time.

==Failure rate in the continuous sense==
{{merge from|Unobserved heterogeneity in duration models|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Loglogistichaz.svg|thumb|right|300px|Hazard function &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; plotted for a selection of [[log-logistic distribution]]s.]]
Calculating the failure rate for ever smaller intervals of time, results in the '''{{visible anchor|hazard function}}''' (also called '''hazard rate'''), &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;. This becomes the ''instantaneous'' failure rate as &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt;/math&gt; tends to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{R(t)-R(t+\Delta t)}{\Delta t \cdot R(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

A continuous failure rate depends on the existence of a '''failure distribution''', &lt;math&gt;F(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[cumulative distribution function]] that describes the probability of failure (at least) up to and including time ''t'',

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Pr}(T\le t)=F(t)=1-R(t),\quad t\ge 0. \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the failure time.
The failure distribution function is the integral of the failure [[probability density function|''density'' function]], ''f''(''t''),

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} f(\tau)\, d\tau. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The hazard function can be defined now as

:&lt;math&gt;h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=\frac{f(t)}{R(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Exponential pdf.svg|thumb|right|300px|Exponential failure density functions. Each of these has a (different) constant hazard function (see text).]]
Many probability distributions can be used to model the failure distribution (''see [[List of probability distributions|List of important probability distributions]]''). A common model is the '''exponential failure distribution''',

:&lt;math&gt;F(t)=\int_{0}^{t} \lambda e^{-\lambda \tau}\, d\tau = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

which is based on the [[exponential distribution|exponential density function]]. The hazard rate function for this is:

:&lt;math&gt;h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{R(t)} = \frac{\lambda e^{-\lambda t}}{e^{-\lambda t}} = \lambda .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for an exponential failure distribution, the hazard rate is a constant with respect to time (that is, the distribution is "[[memorylessness|memory-less]]").  For other distributions, such as a [[Weibull distribution]] or a [[log-normal distribution]], the hazard function may not be constant with respect to time. For some such as the [[deterministic distribution]] it is [[monotonic]] increasing (analogous to [[Wear and tear|"wearing out"]]), for others such as the [[Pareto distribution]] it is monotonic decreasing (analogous to [[Burn-in|"burning in"]]), while for many it is not monotonic.

==Decreasing failure rate==
A decreasing failure rate (DFR) describes a phenomenon where the probability of an event in a fixed time interval in the future decreases over time. A decreasing failure rate can describe a period of "infant mortality" where earlier failures are eliminated or corrected&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-1-84800-986-8_1 | chapter = Introduction | first = Maxim | last = Finkelstein| title = Failure Rate Modelling for Reliability and Risk | series = Springer Series in Reliability Engineering | pages = 1–84 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84800-985-1 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and corresponds to the situation where λ(''t'') is a [[decreasing function]].

Mixtures of DFR variables are DFR.&lt;ref name="brown1980"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = M. | title = Bounds, Inequalities, and Monotonicity Properties for Some Specialized Renewal Processes | doi = 10.1214/aop/1176994773 | journal = The Annals of Probability | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 227 | jstor = 2243267| year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixtures of [[exponential distribution|exponentially distributed]] random variables are [[Hyperexponential distribution|hyperexponentially distributed]].

===Renewal processes===

For a [[renewal process]] with DFR renewal function, inter-renewal times are concave.&lt;ref name="brown1980" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shanthikumar"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shanthikumar | first1 = J.

===Applications===

Increasing failure rate is an intuitive concept caused by components wearing out. Decreasing failure rate describes a system which improves with age.&lt;ref name="proschan" /&gt;
Decreasing failure rates have been found in the lifetimes of spacecraft, Baker and Baker commenting that "those spacecraft that last, last on and on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Baker | first2 = G. A. S. . | doi = 10.2514/3.28040 | title = Impact of the space environment on spacecraft lifetimes | journal = Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 479 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1980JSpRo..17..479B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1002/9781119994077.ch1 | chapter = On Time, Reliability, and Spacecraft | first1 = Joseph Homer | last1 = Saleh | first2 =Jean-François | last2 =Castet| title = Spacecraft Reliability and Multi-State Failures | pages = 1 | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781119994077 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of aircraft air conditioning systems were individually found to have an [[exponential distribution]], and thus in the pooled population a DFR.&lt;ref name="proschan"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Proschan | first1 = F. | title = Theoretical Explanation of Observed Decreasing Failure Rate | doi = 10.1080/00401706.1963.10490105 | journal = Technometrics | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 375–383 | jstor = 1266340| year = 1963 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coefficient of variation===

When the failure rate is decreasing the [[coefficient of variation]] is ⩾&amp;nbsp;1, and when the failure rate is increasing the coefficient of variation is ⩽&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wierman | first1 = A. | authorlink1 = Adam Wierman| last2 = Bansal | first2 = N. | last3 = Harchol-Balter | first3 = M.|author3-link=Mor Harchol-Balter | title = A note on comparing response times in the M/GI/1/FB and M/GI/1/PS queues | doi = 10.1016/S0167-6377(03)00061-0 | journal = Operations Research Letters | volume = 32 | pages = 73 | url = http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/papers/fbnote.pdf| year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that this result only holds when the failure rate is defined for all t&amp;nbsp;⩾&amp;nbsp;0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Analysis of Queues: Methods and Applications | first = Natarajan | last =Gautam | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2012 | page = 703 | isbn = 1439806586}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the converse result (coefficient of variation determining nature of failure rate) does not hold.

==Failure rate data==
Failure rate [[data]] can be obtained in several ways. The most common means are:
;Historical data about the device or system under consideration: Many organizations maintain internal databases of failure information on the devices or systems that they produce, which can be used to calculate failure rates for those devices or systems. For new devices or systems, the historical data for similar devices or systems can serve as a useful estimate.
;Government and commercial failure rate data: Handbooks of failure rate data for various components are available from government and commercial sources. [[#Online|MIL-HDBK-217F]], ''Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment'', is a [[United States Military Standard|military standard]] that provides failure rate data for many military electronic components. Several failure rate data sources are available commercially that focus on commercial components, including some non-electronic components.
;Testing: The most accurate source of data is to test samples of the actual devices or systems in order to generate failure data. This is often prohibitively expensive or impractical, so that the previous data sources are often used instead.

===Units===
Failure rates can be expressed using any measure of time, but '''hours''' is the most common unit in practice. Other units, such as miles, revolutions, etc., can also be used in place of "time" units.

Failure rates are often expressed in [[engineering notation]] as failures per million, or 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, especially for individual components, since their failure rates are often very low.

The '''Failures In Time''' ('''FIT''') rate of a device is the number of failures that can be expected in one [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) device-hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;

2010.
p. 6.
&lt;/ref&gt;
(E.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, or some other combination.) This term is used particularly by the [[semiconductor]] industry.

The relationship of FIT to MTBF may be expressed as: MTBF = 1,000,000,000 x 1/FIT.

===Additivity===
Under certain [[engineering]] assumptions (e.g. besides the above assumptions for a constant failure rate, the assumption that the considered system has no relevant [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancies]]), the failure rate for a complex [[system]] is simply the sum of the individual failure rates of its components, as long as the units are consistent, e.g. failures per million hours. This permits testing of individual components or [[subsystem]]s, whose failure rates are then added to obtain the total system failure rate.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding "redundant" components to eliminate a [[single point of failure]] improves the mission failure rate, but makes the series failure rate (also called the logistics failure rate) worse—the extra components improve the mean time between critical failures (MTBCF), even though the mean time before something fails is worse.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.quanterion.com/mission-reliability-and-logistics-reliability-a-design-paradox/ "Mission Reliability and Logistics Reliability: A Design Paradox"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
Suppose it is desired to estimate the failure rate of a certain component. A test can be performed to estimate its failure rate. Ten identical components are each tested until they either fail or reach 1000 hours, at which time the test is terminated for that component. (The level of statistical [[confidence interval|confidence]] is not considered in this example.) The results are as follows:

Estimated failure rate is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{6\text{ failures}}{7502\text{ hours}} = 0.0007998\, \frac{\text{failures}}{\text{hour}} = 799.8 \times 10^{-6}\, \frac{\text{failures}}{\text{hour}}, &lt;/math&gt;

or 799.8 failures for every million hours of operation.

==Estimation==
The [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] can be used to estimate the cumulative hazard rate function.

'''Galling''' is a form of wear caused by adhesion between sliding surfaces. When a material galls, some of it is pulled with the contacting surface, especially if there is a large amount of force compressing the surfaces together. Galling is caused by a combination of [[friction]] and [[adhesion]] between the surfaces, followed by slipping and tearing of [[crystal structure]] beneath the surface. This will generally leave some material stuck or even [[friction welding|friction welded]] to the adjacent surface, whereas the galled material may appear gouged with balled-up or torn lumps of material stuck to its surface.

Galling is most commonly found in [[metal]] surfaces that are in sliding contact with each other. It is especially common where there is inadequate [[lubrication]] between the surfaces. However, certain metals will generally be more prone to galling, due to the atomic structure of their crystals. For example, [[aluminium]] is a metal that will gall very easily, whereas annealed (softened) [[steel]] is slightly more resistant to galling. Steel that is fully hardened is very resistant to galling.

Galling is a common problem in most applications where metals slide while in contact with other metals. This can happen regardless of whether the metals are the same or of different kinds. [[Alloy]]s such as [[brass]] and [[bronze]] are often chosen for [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], [[bushing (bearing)|bushings]], and other sliding applications because of their resistance to galling, as well as other forms of [[Abrasion (mechanical)|mechanical abrasion]].

==Introduction==
Galling is adhesive [[wear]] that is caused by microscopic transfer of material between metallic surfaces, during transverse motion (sliding). It occurs frequently whenever metal surfaces are in contact, sliding against each other, especially with poor lubrication. It often occurs in high load, low speed applications, but also in high-speed applications with very little load. Galling is a common problem in [[sheet metal forming]], bearings and pistons in [[engine]]s, [[hydraulic cylinder]]s, [[air motor]]s, and many other industrial operations. Galling is distinct from gouging or scratching in that it involves the visible transfer of material as it is adhesively pulled ([[spalling|mechanically spalled]]) from one surface, leaving it stuck to the other in the form of a raised lump (gall). Unlike other forms of wear, galling is usually not a gradual process, but occurs quickly and spreads rapidly as the raised lumps induce more galling.
It can often occur in screws and bolts, causing the threads to seize and tear free from either the fastener or the hole. In extreme cases, the bolt may lock up to the point where all turning force is used by the friction, which can lead to breakage of the fastener or the tool turning it. [[Threaded insert]]s of hardened steel are often used in metals like aluminium or [[stainless steel]] that can gall easily.&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanical Fastening Joining Assembly'' By James A. Speck -- Marcell Dekker 1997 Page 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Galling requires two properties common to most metals, cohesion through [[metallic bonding|metallic-bonding]] attractions and [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] (the ability to deform without breaking). The tendency of a material to gall is affected by the [[ductility]] of the material. Typically, [[hardness|hardened]] materials are more resistant to galling whereas softer materials of the same type will gall more readily. The propensity of a material to gall is also affected by the specific arrangement of the atoms, because crystals arranged in a [[face-centered cubic]] (FCC) lattice will usually allow material-transfer to a greater degree than a [[body-centered cubic]] (BCC). This is because a face-centered cubic has a greater tendency to produce [[dislocation]]s in the crystal lattice, which are defects that allow the lattice to shift, or "cross-slip," making the metal more prone to galling. However, if the metal has a high number of stacking faults (a difference in stacking sequence between atomic planes) it will be less apt to cross-slip at the dislocations. Therefore, a material's resistance to galling is usually determined by its [[stacking-fault energy]]. A material with high stacking-fault energy, such as aluminium or [[titanium]], will be far more susceptible to galling than materials with low stacking-fault energy, like [[copper]], [[bronze]], or [[gold]]. Conversely, materials with a [[hexagonal close packed]] (HCP) structure and a high ''c/a'' ratio, such as [[cobalt]]-based [[alloy]]s, are extremely resistant to galling.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lt7WBiILHpYC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=%22hexagonal+close+packed+(hcp)+structure+with+a+high+c/a+ratio%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pfQkdEKl8z&amp;sig=X3N3S0aerIXKhEQDwtRXoB5QtGk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjHmsD6r-veAhXPUt8KHfS7BekQ6AEwCHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hexagonal%20close%20packed%20(hcp)%20structure%20with%20a%20high%20c%2Fa%20ratio%22&amp;f=false Surface Engineering for Corrosion and Wear Resistance]'' By J. R. Davis -- ASM International 2001 Page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Galling occurs initially with material transfer from individual grains, on a microscopic scale, which become stuck or even diffusion welded to the adjacent surface. This transfer can be enhanced if one or both metals form a thin layer of hard oxides with high [[coefficient of friction|coefficients of friction]], such as those found on aluminum or stainless-steel. As the lump grows it pushes against the adjacent material and begins forcing them apart, concentrating a majority of the friction heat-energy into a very small area. This in turn causes more adhesion and material build-up. The localized heat increases the plasticity of the galled surface, deforming the metal, until the lump breaks through the surface and begins plowing up large amounts of material from the galled surface. Methods of preventing galling include the use of [[lubricant]]s like [[grease (lubricant)|grease]] and [[oil]], low-friction coatings and thin-film deposits like [[molybdenum disulfide]] or [[titanium nitride]], and increasing the surface hardness of the metals using processes such as [[case hardening]] and [[induction hardening]].

==Mechanism==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
In engineering science and in other technical aspects, the term galling is widespread. The influence of acceleration in the contact zone between materials has been mathematically described and correlated to the exhibited friction mechanism found in the tracks during empiric observations of the galling phenomenon. Due to problems with previous incompatible definitions and test methods, better means of measurements in coordination with greater understanding of the involved frictional mechanisms have led to the attempt to standardize or redefine the term galling to enable a more generalized use.
[[ASTM International]] has formulated and established a common definition for the technical aspect of the galling phenomenon in the ASTM G40 standard: "Galling is a form of surface damage arising between sliding solids, distinguished by microscopic, usually localized, roughening and creation of protrusions (e.g.: lumps) above the original surface".&lt;ref&gt;ASTM standard G40 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

When two metallic surfaces are pressed against each other, the initial interaction and the mating points are the [[Asperity (material science)|asperities]], or high points, found on each surface. An asperity may penetrate the opposing surface if there is a converging contact and relative movement. The contact between the surfaces initiates [[friction]] or [[plastic deformation]] and induces pressure and energy in a small area called the contact zone.

The elevation in pressure increases the [[energy density]] and heat level within the deformed area. This leads to greater [[adhesion]] between the surfaces which initiate material transfer, galling build-up, lump growth, and creation of protrusions above the original surface.

If the lump (or protrusion of transferred material to one surface) grows to a height of several [[micrometers]], it may penetrate the opposing [[passivation (chemistry)|surface oxide-layer]] and cause damage to the underlying material. Damage in the bulk material is a prerequisite for plastic flow that is found in the deformed volume which surrounds the lump. The geometry and speed of the lump defines how the flowing material will be transported, accelerated, and decelerated around the lump. This material flow is critical when defining the contact pressure, energy density, and developed temperature during sliding. The mathematical function describing acceleration and deceleration of flowing material is thereby defined by the geometrical constraints, deduced or given by the lump's surface contour.

If the right conditions are met, such as geometric constraints of the lump, an accumulation of energy can cause a clear change in the materials contact and plastic behaviour; generally this increases adhesion and the friction force needed for further movement.

In sliding friction, increased [[compressive stress]] is proportionally equal to a rise in [[potential energy]] and temperature within the contact zone. The reasons for accumulation of energy during sliding can be a reduction of energy loss away from the contact zone, due to a small surface area on the surface boundary thus low heat conductivity. Another reason is the energy that is continuously forced into the metals, which is a product of acceleration and pressure. In cooperation, these mechanisms allow a constant accumulation of energy causing increased energy density and temperature in the contact zone during sliding.

The process and contact can be compared to [[cold welding]] or [[friction welding]], because cold welding is not truly cold and the fusing points exhibit an increase in temperature and energy density derived from applied pressure and plastic deformation in the contact zone.

==Incidence and location==
Galling is often found between metallic surfaces where direct contact and relative motion have occurred. [[Sheet metal]] forming, thread manufacturing and other industrial operations may include moving parts or contact surfaces made of stainless steel, aluminium, titanium, and other metals whose natural development of an external oxide layer through [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] increases their corrosion resistance but renders them particularly susceptible to galling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.estainlesssteel.com/gallingofstainless.html |title=Stainless Steel Galling / Locking Up / Freezing Up |publisher=Estainlesssteel.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In metalworking that involves cutting (primarily turning and milling), galling is often used to describe a wear phenomenon which occurs when cutting soft metal. The work material is transferred to the cutter and develops a "lump". The developed lump changes the contact behavior between the two surfaces, which usually increases adhesion, resistance to further cutting, and, due to created vibrations, can be heard as a distinct sound.

Galling often occurs with aluminium compounds and is a common cause of tool breakdown. Aluminium is a ductile metal, which means it possesses the ability for plastic flow with relative ease, which presupposes a relatively consistent and large plastic zone.

High ductility and flowing material can be considered a general prerequisite for excessive material transfer and galling because frictional heating is closely linked to the structure of plastic zones around penetrating objects.

Galling can occur even at relatively low loads and velocities, because it is the real energy-density in the system that induces a phase transition, which often leads to an increase in material transfer and higher friction.

==Prevention==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
[[File:External Thread Galling.png|thumb|Galled threads on a NPT fitting]]
Generally there are two major frictional systems which affect adhesive wear or galling. In terms of prevention, they work in dissimilar ways and set different demands on the surface structure, alloys and crystal matrix used in the materials:

* Solid surface contact 
* Lubricated contact

''In solid surface contact'' or unlubricated conditions, the initial contact is characterised by interaction between asperities and the exhibition of two different sorts of attraction: [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesive]] surface-energy or the molecules connect and adhere the two surfaces together, notably even if they are separated by a measurable distance. Direct contact and plastic deformation generates another type of attraction through the constitution of a plastic zone with flowing material where induced energy, pressure and temperature allow bonding between the surfaces on a much larger scale than cohesive surface-energy.

In metallic compounds and sheet metal forming, the asperities are usually oxides and the plastic deformation mostly consists of [[brittle fracture]], which presupposes a very small plastic zone. The accumulation of energy and temperature is low due to the discontinuity in the fracture mechanism.
However, during the initial asperity/asperity contact, wear debris or bits and pieces from the asperities adhere to the opposing surface, creating microscopic, usually localized, roughening and creation of protrusions (in effect lumps) above the original surface. The transferred wear debris and lumps penetrate the opposing oxide surface layer and cause damage to the underlying bulk material, plowing it forward. This allows continuous plastic deformation, plastic flow, and accumulation of energy and temperature.
The prevention of adhesive material-transfer is accomplished by the following or similar approaches:

* Low temperature carburizing treatments such as Kolsterising can eliminate galling in austenitic stainless-steels by increasing surface hardness up to 1200 HV0.05 (depending on base material and surface conditions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ojs.kmutnb.ac.th/index.php/ijst/article/download/81/81 ''Surface Hardening of Stainless Steels by Kolsterising'' by Gümpel P. -- University of Applied Science, Konstanz Germany AIJSTPME (2012) 5(1): 11-18 (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Less cohesive or chemical attraction between surface atoms or molecules.
* Avoiding continuous plastic-deformation and plastic flow, for example through a thicker oxide layer on the subject material in sheet-metal forming (SMF).
* [[Coating]]s deposited on the SMF work tool, such as [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) or [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD) and titanium nitride (TiN) or [[diamond-like carbon]] coatings exhibit low chemical reactivity even in high energy frictional contact, where the subject material's protective oxide layer is breached, and the frictional contact is distinguished by continuous plastic deformation and plastic flow.

''Lubricated contact'' places other demands on the surface structure of the materials involved, and the main issue is to retain the protective lubrication thickness and avoid plastic deformation. This is important because plastic deformation raises the temperature of the oil or lubrication fluid and changes the viscosity. Any eventual material transfer or creation of protrusions above the original surface will also reduce the ability to retain a protective lubrication thickness. A proper protective lubrication thickness can be assisted or retained by:

* Surface cavities or small holes can create a favourable geometric situation for the oil to retain a protective lubrication thickness in the contact zone.
* Cohesive forces on the surface can increase the chemical attraction between the surface and lubricants, and enhance the lubrication thickness.
* [[Oil additive]]s may reduce the tendency for galling or adhesive wear.

==Clarification and limitations==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Galling should not be confused with other cases of attraction between surfaces which do not result in plastic deformation. These latter types of attraction involve [[adhesive surface forces]] or [[surface energy]] theories. Different energy potentials at the surfaces can develop adhesive bonds or cohesive forces that may hold the two surfaces together. Surface energy and the cohesive force phenomenon are not the same as galling, and are only partially correlated. Galling necessarily involves plastic deformation of at least one surface.

However, research generally fails to make a clear distinction between energy derived from plastic deformation and the cohesive surface-forces, and chemical attraction between atoms or surface molecules. The latter is likely to be involved in the initial material transfer, where only surface-oxide asperities are in contact. Difficulty comes in distinguishing these adhesive forces from more severe attractions, caused by accumulated energy and increased pressure from plastic deformation. Oxides are brittle and it is probable that most of the energy in the fracture mechanism is consumed in brittle fracture, but the created wear debris will instantaneously penetrate the opposing surface. This means that the transferred oxide material will instantly act as a penetrating body and the concentration of energy, pressure and frictional heating is immediate. Without this accumulation of energy, the tendency for material transfer will certainly decrease.

The formation and constitution (physique) of plastic zones around penetrating objects are arguably a prerequisite and the main factor for excessive material transfer, lump growth, and galling build-up even in the initial contact process.

[[File:Hankycode.jpg|thumb|An assortment of handkerchiefs]]
{{LGBT symbols}}

The '''handkerchief code''' (also known as the '''hanky code''', the '''bandana code''', and '''flagging'''&lt;ref name=Andrews2010 &gt;{{cite book | last=Andrews | first=Vincent | year=2010 | title=The Leatherboy Handbook | publisher=The Nazca Plains Corp. | isbn=978-1-61098-046-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Color coding|color-coded system]], employed usually among the [[gay]] male [[casual sex|casual-sex]] seekers or [[BDSM]] practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, to indicate preferred [[sexual fetish]]es, what kind of sex they are seeking, and whether they are a [[top (sex)|top]]/[[dominance and submission|dominant]] or [[bottom (sex)|bottom]]/submissive.

Wearing a handkerchief on the left side of the body typically indicates one is a "top" (one considered active in the practice of the fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief), while wearing it on the right side of the body would indicate one is a "bottom" (one considered passive in the practice of the fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief).  The hanky code was widely used in the 1970s by gay and [[bisexual]] men.

==Origin==
[[File:Handkerchief code.jpg|thumb|Hanky code]]

The wearing of various colored bandanas around the neck was common in the mid- and late-nineteenth century among [[cowboy]]s, [[Railroad engineer|steam railroad engineer]]s, and [[miner]]s in the [[Western United States]]. It is thought that the wearing of [[Kerchief|bandanas]] by gay men originated in [[San Francisco]] after the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], when, because of a shortage of women, men dancing with each other in [[square dance]]s developed a code wherein the man wearing the blue bandana took the male part in the square dance, and the man wearing the red bandana took the female part (these bandanas were usually worn around the arm or hanging from the belt or in the back pocket of one's [[jeans]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} . It is thought that the modern hanky code started in New York City in late 1970 or early 1971 when a journalist for the ''[[Village Voice]]'' joked that instead of simply wearing keys to indicate whether someone was a "top" or a "bottom", it would be more efficient to subtly announce their particular sexual focus by wearing different colored hankies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Susan |last1= Stryker |authorlink= Susan Stryker |first2= Jim |last2= Van Buskirk |title= Gay by the Bay: A History of Queer Culture in the San Francisco Bay Area |location= San Francisco |publisher= [[Chronicle Books]] |year= 1996 |page= 18 |isbn= 0-8118-1187-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources attribute the expansion of the original red–blue system into today’s code to marketing efforts around 1971 by the San Francisco [[department store]] for erotic merchandise, The Trading Post, promoting handkerchiefs by printing cards listing the meanings of various colors.&lt;ref name="gay-semiotics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Hal |date=1977 |title=Gay Semiotics ♂ |url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/HalPages/GaySempg2.html |location=San Francisco |publisher=NFS Press |isbn=0-917986-03-2|quote=In San Francisco, the signs began appearing around 1971. The Trading Post, a department store specializing in erotic merchandise, began promoting handkerchiefs in the store and printing cards with their meanings. The red and blue handkerchiefs and their significance were already in existence, and meanings were assigned to other colors as well. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alan Selby, founder of Mr. S Leather in San Francisco, claimed that he created the first hanky code with his business partners at Leather 'n' Things in 1972, when their bandana supplier inadvertently doubled their order and the expanded code would help them sell the extra colors they had received.&lt;ref name="selby"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jordy|date=2017|title=The Mayor of Folsom Street, The Auto/Biography of "Daddy Alan" Selby aka Mr. S|publisher=Fair Page Media LLC|isbn=978-0-9989098-0-6|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

This table is drawn from [[Larry Townsend]]'s ''The Leatherman's Handbook II'' (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) and is generally considered authoritative. Implicit in this list is the concept of left/right polarity, left as usual indicating the top, dominant, or active partner; right the bottom, submissive, or passive partner.  Negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because, as Townsend noted, people may wear hankies of any color "only because the idea of the hankie turns them on" or "may not even know what it means".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Townsend |first=Larry|title=The Leatherman's Handbook II |year=1983 |publisher=Modernismo Publications |location=New York |isbn=0-89237-010-6 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Ritirata.jpg|thumb|280px|Performance on [[#Early instruments|period instrument]]s is a key aspect of HIP, such as this [[baroque orchestra]] (Photo: [[Josetxu Obregón]] and the Spanish ensemble La Ritirata)]]
'''Historically informed performance''' (also referred to as '''period performance''', '''authentic performance''', or '''HIP''') is an approach to the performance of [[Western classical music|classical music]], which aims to be faithful to the approach, manner and style of the [[musical era]] in which a work was originally conceived.

It is based on two key aspects: the application of the stylistic and technical aspects of performance, known as '''performance practice'''; and the use of '''[[#Early instruments|period instrument]]s''' which may be reproductions of historical instruments that were in use at the time of the original composition and which usually have different [[timbre]] and [[temperament (music)|temperament]].{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

Because no [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]]s exist of music before the modern era, historically informed performance is necessarily derived from academic [[Musicology|musicological research]]. Historical [[treatise]]s, as well as additional historical evidence, are used to gain insight into the performance practice of a historic era. HIP performers will normally base their interpretations on scholarly or [[urtext edition]]s of a musical score, unencumbered with suggestions or changes made by editors in later eras.{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

Historically informed performance can trace its roots to the late 19th century, but was principally developed in a number of Western countries in the late 20th century. Initially mainly concerned with the performance of [[Medieval music|Medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], and [[Baroque music]], it has since come to encompass music from the [[Classical music era|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] eras as well. The practice has been a crucial part of the [[Early music revival]] movement of the 20th and 21st centuries. Quite recently, the phenomenon has begun to affect the theatrical stage, for instance in the production of [[Baroque opera]], where historically informed approaches to acting and scenery are also used.&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Mary|editor1-last=Greenwald|editor1-first=Helen M.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Opera|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199714841|pages=606–8|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LOFvBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA608&amp;dq=Historically%20informed%20performance%20opera%20theatre&amp;pg=PA608#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 March 2018|language=en|chapter=27. Historically informed performance}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

There are some critics who contest the methodology of the HIP movement, contending that its selection of practices and aesthetics are a product of the 20th century and that it is ultimately impossible to know what performances of an earlier time sounded like. For this reason, the term "historically informed" is now preferred to "authentic", as it acknowledges the limitations of academic understanding, rather than implying absolute accuracy in recreating historical performance style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fabian|first1=Dorottya|title=The Meaning of Authenticity and The Early Music Movement: A Historical Review|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284522166_The_Meaning_of_Authenticity_and_The_Early_Music_Movement_A_Historical_Review|accessdate=3 March 2018|date=1 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter" /&gt;

[[File:Edinburgh St Cecilia's Hall.jpg|thumb|Historical collections of preserved instruments help researchers ([[St Cecilia's Hall]], [[Edinburgh]])]]
The choice of musical instruments is an important part of the principle of historically informed performance. Musical instruments have evolved over time, and instruments that were in use in earlier periods of history were often quite different to their modern equivalents. Many other instruments have fallen out of use, having been replaced by newer tools for creating music. For example, prior to the emergence of the modern [[violin]], other bowed stringed instruments such as the [[rebec]] or the [[viol]] were in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silvela|first1=Zdenko|title=A New History of Violin Playing: The Vibrato and Lambert Massart's Revolutionary Discovery|date=2001|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=9781581126679|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gXqBVbWm6tkC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=violin%20evolved%20from%20rebec&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of ancient instruments in museum collections has helped musicologists to understand how the different design, tuning and tone of instruments may have affected earlier performance practice.{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=18-19}}

As well as a research tool, historic instruments have an active role in the practice of historically informed performance. Modern instrumentalists who aim to recreate a historic sound often use modern reproductions of period instruments (and occasionally original instruments) on the basis that this will deliver a musical performance that is thought to be historically faithful to the original work, as the original composer would have heard it. For example, a modern music ensemble staging a performance of music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] may play reproduction [[Baroque violin]]s instead of modern instruments in an attempt to create the sound of a 17th-century [[Baroque orchestra]].{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=18-19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schippers|first1=Huib|title=Facing the Music: Shaping Music Education from a Global Perspective|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199701933|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-yYzW0ujEsIC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=period%20instruments%20authentic%20performance&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led to the revival of musical instruments that had entirely fallen out of use, and to a reconsideration of the role and structure of instruments also used in current practice.{{Original research inline|date=March 2018}}

Orchestras and ensembles who are noted for their use of period instruments in performances include the [[Taverner Consort and Players]] (directed by [[Andrew Parrott]]), the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] ([[Christopher Hogwood]]), [[The English Concert]] ([[Trevor Pinnock]]), the [[English Baroque Soloists]] (Sir [[John Eliot Gardiner]]), [[Musica Antiqua Köln]] ([[Reinhard Goebel]]), the [[Australian Brandenburg Orchestra]] ([[Paul Dyer]]) and [[La Chapelle Royale]] ([[Philippe Herreweghe]]).&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Nick|title=The Art of Re-enchantment: Making Early Music in the Modern Age|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199939930|page=76|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fWgBAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=The%20Taverner%20Choir%2C%20Consort%20%26%20Players&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard-gardiner"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Waleson|first1=Heidi|title=Super-conductor: John Eliot Gardiner|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vgcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=English%20Baroque%20Soloists%20period%20instruments&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=7 September 1996|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knights|first1=F.|title=A farewell to Musica Antiqua Koln|journal=Early Music|date=1 February 2013|volume=41|issue=1|pages=173–174|doi=10.1093/em/cas166|url=https://academic.oup.com/em/article-abstract/41/1/173/353400|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en|issn=0306-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philippe Herreweghe|url=https://www.concertgebouworkest.nl/en/philippe-herreweghe|website=www.concertgebouworkest.nl|publisher=Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the scope of historically informed performance has expanded to encompass the works of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]], the specific sound of 19th-century instruments has increasingly been recognised in the HIP movement, and period instruments orchestras such as Gardiner's [[Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique]] have emerged.&lt;ref name="npr-gardiner"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Eliot Gardiner's Historical Beethoven At Carnegie Hall|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/15/142340577/john-eliot-gardiners-historical-beethoven|website=NPR|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306121647/https://www.npr.org/2011/11/15/142340577/john-eliot-gardiners-historical-beethoven|archivedate=6 March 2018|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harpsichord===
[[File:Cembalo-Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg-2000.532+2.tif|thumb|Harpsichord by [[Pascal Taskin]], [[Paris]] (1780)  ([[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]])]]
A variety of once obsolete keyboard instruments such as the [[clavichord]] and the [[harpsichord]] have been revived as they have particular importance in the performance of Early music. Before the evolution of the symphony orchestra led by a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], Renaissance and Baroque orchestras were commonly directed from the harpsichord; the director would lead by playing [[Basso continuo|continuo]], which would provide a steady, harmonic structure upon which the other instrumentalists would embellish their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harpsichord - Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|url=http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/harpsichord/|website=Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306230901/http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/harpsichord/|archivedate=6 March 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kottick|first1=Edward L.|title=A History of the Harpsichord|date=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253341663|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uexrDtt7JKEC&amp;lpg=PA469&amp;dq=harpsichord%20baroque%20orchestra&amp;pg=PA469#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious works of the era made similar use of the [[pipe organ]], often in combination with a harpsichord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moses|first1=Don V.|last2=Jr|first2=Robert W.

Composers such as [[François Couperin]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] wrote for the harpsichord, clavichord, and organ.

Among the foremost modern players of the harpsichord are [[Robert Hill (musician)|Robert Hill]], [[Igor Kipnis]], [[Ton Koopman]], [[Wanda Landowska]], [[Gustav Leonhardt]], [[Trevor Pinnock]], [[Skip Sempé]], [[Andreas Staier]], and [[Colin Tilney]].

===Fortepiano===
During the second half of the 18th century, the harpsichord was gradually replaced by the [[fortepiano]], a precursor to the modern piano. As the harpsichord went out of fashion, many were destroyed; indeed, the Paris Conservatory is notorious for having used harpsichords for firewood during the [[French Revolution]] and Napoleonic times.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Boekelheide, "[http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/10982.html Making Way for Beautiful Music]", ''USC News'' (2 October 2005, accessed 20 January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th and 21st centuries, the fortepiano has enjoyed a revival as a result of the trend for historically informed performance, with the works of Beethoven and Schubert being played on fortepiano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haskell|first1=Harry|title=The Early Music Revival: A History|date=1988|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486291628|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bGG22O24ObAC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Historically%20informed%20performance%20fortepiano&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vast quantity of music for [[viol]]s, for both ensemble and solo performance, was written by composers of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras, including [[Diego Ortiz]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[William Byrd]], [[William Lawes]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe]], [[J.S. Bach]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Marin Marais]], [[Antoine Forqueray]], and [[Carl Frederick Abel]].

From largest to smallest, the viol family consists of:
*contrabass or [[violone]]
*bass viol (about the size of a [[cello]])
*tenor viol (about the size of a [[guitar]])
*alto viol (about the size of a [[viola]])
*treble or descant viol (about the size of a [[violin]]).

Among the foremost modern players of the viols are [[Paolo Pandolfo]], [[Wieland Kuijken]], [[Jordi Savall]], [[John Hsu]], and [[Vittorio Ghielmi]]. There are many modern [[viol consort]]s.

===Recorder===
{{Main|List of recorder players}}
[[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorder]]s in multiple sizes (contra-bass, bass, tenor, alto, soprano, the sopranino, and the even smaller kleine sopranino or garklein) are often played today in consorts of mixed size. [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]], among others, wrote solo works for the recorder. [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] did much to revive the recorder as a serious concert instrument, reconstructing a "consort of recorders (descant, treble, tenor and bass) all at low pitch and based on historical originals".&lt;ref&gt;Brian Blood, "[http://www.dolmetsch.com/Dolworks.htm The Dolmetsch Story]", ''Dolmetsch Online'' (26 September 2013, accessed 20 January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singing==
[[File:Christina Pluhar, Philippe Jaroussky - Misteria Paschalia 2011 (1).JPG|thumb|[[Countertenor]] [[Philippe Jaroussky]], accompanied by [[Christina Pluhar]] ([[theorbo]])]]
As with instrumental technique, the approach to historically informed performance practice for singers has been shaped by musicological research and academic debate.  In particular, there was debate around the use of the technique of [[vibrato]] at the height of the Early music revival, and many advocates of HIP aimed to eliminate vibrato in favour of the "pure" sound of straight-tone singing. The difference in style may be demonstrated by the sound of a [[boy treble]] in contrast to the sound of a [[Grand opera]] singer such as [[Maria Callas]].&lt;ref name="malafronte"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malafronte|first1=Judith|title=Vibrato Wars|url=https://www.earlymusicamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VibratoWars-1.pdf|website=www.earlymusicamerica.org|publisher=Early Music America|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306103109/https://www.earlymusicamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/VibratoWars-1.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2018|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain historic vocal techniques have gained in popularity, such as ''[[Trill (music)#Trillo|trillo]]'', a [[tremolo]]-like repetition of a single note that was used for ornamental effect in the early Baroque era. Academic understanding of these expressive devices is often subjective however, as many vocal techniques discussed by treatise writers in the 17th and 18th centuries have different meanings, depending on the author. Despite the fashion for straight tone, many prominent Early music singers make use of a subtle, gentle form of vibrato to add expression to their performance.&lt;ref name="malafronte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="start"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stark|first1=James|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802086143|page=150|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=Historically%20informed%20performance%20singing%20technique&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 March 2018|language=en|chapter=Vocal Tremulousness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the singers who have contributed to the historically informed performance movement are [[Emma Kirkby]], [[Max van Egmond]], [[Julianne Baird]], [[Nigel Rogers]], and [[David Thomas (singer)|David Thomas]].

The resurgence of interest in Early music, particularly in sacred renaissance polyphony and Baroque opera, has driven a revival of the [[countertenor]] voice. High-voice male singers are often cast in preference to female [[contralto]]s in HIP opera productions, partly as a substitute for [[castrato]] singers. [[Alfred Deller]] is considered to have been a pioneer of the modern revival of countertenor singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countertenor|url=http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/countertenor/|website=Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|accessdate=6 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306145032/http://www.oae.co.uk/instruments/countertenor/|archivedate=6 March 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading contemporary performers include [[James Bowman (countertenor)|James Bowman]], [[David Daniels (countertenor)|David Daniels]], [[Derek Lee Ragin]], [[Andreas Scholl]], [[Michael Chance]], [[Drew Minter]], [[Daniel Taylor (countertenor)|Daniel Taylor]], [[Brian Asawa]], [[Yoshikazu Mera]], and [[Philippe Jaroussky]].

==Layout==
Standard practice concerning the layout of a group of performers, for example in a choir or an orchestra, has changed over time. Determining a historically appropriate layout of singers and instruments on a performance stage may be informed by historical research. In addition to documentary evidence, musicologists may also turn to [[Iconography|iconographic evidence]] — contemporary paintings and drawings of performing musicians — as a [[primary source]] for historic information. Pictorial sources may reveal various practices such as the size of an ensemble; the position of various types of instruments; their position in relation to a choir or keyboard instrument; the position or absence of a conductor; whether the performers are seated or standing; and the performance space (such as a concert hall, palace chamber, domestic house, church, or outdoors etc.).{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}} The German theorist [[Johann Mattheson]], in a 1739 treatise, states that the singers should stand in front of the instrumentalists.&lt;ref&gt;Mattheson 1739, {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main layouts are documented:{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
* Circle (Renaissance)
* Choir in the front of the instruments (17th–19th century)
* Singers and instruments next to each other on the choir loft.

==Recovering early performance practices==
[[File:L’Orfeo. Favola in musica. Reprint of the First Edition of the Score, Venice 1609 - Toccata.jpg|thumb|Reprint of the 1st Edition of Monteverdi's ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1609); musicologists refer to [[Music manuscript|autograph scores]] or early editions to interpret performance practice]]
[[File:Cantiga bowed plucked lutes.jpg|thumb|Historical images, such as this Galician 13th-century illustration of lutanists, can inform modern performance practice, but must be interpreted with caution]]

===Interpreting musical notation===
Some familiar difficult items are as follows:

*Early composers often wrote using the same symbols as today, yet in a different meaning, often context-dependent. For example, what is written as an [[appoggiatura]] is often meant to be longer or shorter than the notated length.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. E. Bach, ''Versuch über die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen'', Berlin 1753: Teil 1, Section 2 Par. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The notation may be partial. E.g., the note durations may be omitted altogether, such as in [[unmeasured prelude]]s, pieces written without [[Beats per minute|rhythm]] or [[Measure (music)|metre]] indications.
*The music may be written using alternative, non-modern notations, such as [[tablature]]. Some tablature notations are only partially decoded, such as the notation&lt;ref&gt;Peter Greenhill, ''The Robert ap Huw Manuscript: An Exploration of its Possible Solutions'', 5 vols. (all), Bangor: University of Wales, CAWMS dissertation, 1995-2000.&lt;/ref&gt; in the harp manuscript&lt;ref&gt;Thurston Dart, "Robert ap Huw's Manuscript of Welsh Harp Music", ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol 21 (1963). {{JSTOR|841428}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Robert ap Huw]].
*The reference [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of earlier music cannot generally be interpreted as designating the same pitch used today.
*Various tuning systems ([[Musical temperament|temperament]]s), are used. Composers always assume the player will choose the temperament, and never indicate it in the score.&lt;ref&gt;"Stimmung und Temperatur", in F. Zaminer, ed., ''Geschichte der Musiktheorie'', Vol. 6: "Hören, Messen und Rechnen in der Frühen Neuzeit", Darmstadt, Germany: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft (1987) {{ISBN|978-3534012060}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In most ensemble music up to the early Baroque, the actual musical instruments to be used are not indicated in the score, and must be partially or totally chosen by the performers. A well-discussed example can be found in Monteverdi's ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', where the indications on which instruments to use are partial and limited to critical sections only.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Glover, "Solving the Musical Problem" in John Whenham (ed.) ''Claudio Monteverdi: Orfeo'', 138-155. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-521-24148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Issues of pronunciation, that impact on musical accents, carry over to church [[Latin]], the language in which a large amount of early vocal music was written. The reason is that Latin was customarily pronounced using the speech sounds and patterns of the [[Latin regional pronunciation|local]] vernacular language.

===Mechanical music===
Some information about how music sounded in the past can be obtained from contemporary mechanical instruments. For instance, the Dutch [[Museum Speelklok]] owns an 18th-century mechanical organ of which the music programme was composed and supervised by [[Joseph Haydn]].&lt;ref&gt;Rob van der Hilst, "[http://www.derecensent.nl/recensies/haydnh.htm Fluitekruid van Joseph Haydn]", review of Jan Jaap Haspels, Marije Hulleman, and Bob van Wely, ''Haydn herboren: 12 originele opnamen uit 1793'' (Utrecht: Nationaal Museum van Speelklok tot Pierement, 2004), {{ISBN|90-801699-3-5}}. ''De Recensent.nl'' (2004, accessed January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuning and pitch===
Until modern era, different tuning references have been used in different venues. The baroque oboist Bruce Haynes has extensively investigated surviving wind instruments and even documented a case of violinists having to retune by a minor third to play at neighboring churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Haynes, "Pitch Standards in the Baroque and Classical Periods" (diss., U. of Montreal, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2009}}

===Iconographic evidence===
The research of musicologists often overlaps with the work of [[art historian]]s; by examining paintings and drawings of performing musicians contemporary to a particular musical era, academics can infer details about performance practice of the day. In addition to showing the layout of an orchestra or ensemble, a work of art may reveal detail about contemporary playing techniques, for example the manner of [[Violin technique#Bowing techniques|holding a bow]] or a wind player's [[embouchure]]. However, just as an art historian must evaluate a work of art, a scholar of musicology must also assess the musical evidence of a painting or illustration in its historical context, taking into consideration the potential cultural and political motivations of the artist and allow for [[artistic license]]. An historic image of musicians may present an idealised or even fictional account of musical instruments, and there is as much a risk that it may give rise to a historically misinformed performance.{{sfn|Lawson|Stowell|1999|p=17-18}}

==Issues==
[[File:John Eliot Gardiner at rehearsal in Wroclaw.jpg|thumb|Many scholars and performers such as [[John Eliot Gardiner]] have questioned the terminology of "authentic performance"]]
Prior to audio and video recording, no direct record of performing arts survives. Opinions on the implications of these motivations and on how they should translate into criteria for historically informed performance vary.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Lawson and Robin Stowell (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Musical Performance'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2012):{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;!--If a parenthetical "all", now removed, was meant to say this entire book verifies the claim that informed opinion vary, this is an opinion about the book by someone else--i.e, Original Research, unless a specific source is named for the opinion.--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the [[early music]] revival, awareness of the pitfalls was clear. Though championing the need (for example in his editorship of Scarlatti sonatas) for a thoroughly informed approach, not least in understanding as fully as possible a composer's actual wishes and intentions in their historical context, [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]], while pioneering the harpsichord rediscovery, highlights the risk of using historical exoterism to hide technical incompetence: "too often historical authenticity can be used as a means of escape from any potentially disquieting observance of esthetic values, and from the assumption of any genuine artistic responsibility. The abdication of esthetic values and artistic responsibilities can confer a certain illusion of simplicity on what the passage of history has presented to us, bleached as white as bones on the [[Sands of time (idiom)|sands of time]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Kirkpatrick, ''Interpreting Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2010}}

Classical recording producer Michael Sartorius writes: "While the debate on authenticity in baroque performance will continue, certain essential characteristics should be present, if the performance is to reflect the true baroque spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sartorius, "Baroque Music Performance: 'Authentic' or 'Traditional': A Discussion of the Essential Issues Involved", http://www.baroquemusic.org/barperf.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars see the HIP movement essentially as a 20th-century invention. Writing about the periodical ''Early Music'' (one of the leading periodicals about historically informed performance), Peter Hill noted "All the articles in ''Early Music'' noted in varying ways the (perhaps fatal) flaw in the 'authenticity' position. This is that the attempt to understand the past in terms of the past is—paradoxically—an absolutely contemporary phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hill, "'Authenticity in Contemporary Music," ''Tempo'' New Series no. 159 (December 1986), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents of the Early music revival have distanced themselves from the terminology of "authentic performance". Conductor John Eliot Gardiner has expressed the view that the term can be "misleading", and has stated, "My enthusiasm for period instruments is not antiquarian or in pursuit of a spurious and unattainable authenticity, but just simply as a refreshing alternative to the standard, monochrome qualities of the symphony orchestra."&lt;ref name="billboard-gardiner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube-gardniner"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Eliot Gardiner: Why the Word "Authentic" Bothers Him|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym9oxgr3EnU|website=YouTube|publisher=Carnegie Hall|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more skeptical voices of the historically informed performance movement has been [[Richard Taruskin]]. His thesis is that the practice of unearthing supposedly historically informed practices is actually a 20th-century practice influenced by modernism and, ultimately, we can never know what music sounded like or how it was played in previous centuries. "What we had been accustomed to regard as historically authentic performances, I began to see, represented neither any determinable historical prototype nor any coherent revival of practices coeval with the repertories they addressed. Rather, they embodied a whole wish list of modern(ist) values, validated in the academy and the marketplace alike by an eclectic, opportunistic reading of historical evidence."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Taruskin, "Last Thoughts First," ''Text and Act'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
"'Historical' performers who aim 'to get to the truth'...by using period instruments and reviving lost playing techniques actually pick and choose from history's wares. And they do so in a manner that says more about the values of the late twentieth century than about those of any earlier era."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Taruskin, "The Modern Sound of Early Music," ''Text and Act'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Leech-Wilkinson concedes that much of the HIP practice is based on invention: "Historical research may provide us with instruments, and sometimes even quite detailed information on how to use them; but the gap between such evidence and a sounding performance is still so great that it can be bridged only by a large amount of musicianship and invention. Exactly how much is required can easily be forgotten, precisely because the exercise of musical invention is so automatic to the performer."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, "'What we are doing with early music is genuinely authentic to such a small degree that the word loses most of its intended meaning'" ''Early Music,'' vol. 12, no. 1 (February 1984), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leech Wilkinson concludes that performance styles in early music "have as much to do with current taste as with accurate reproduction."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, "'What we are doing with early music is genuinely authentic to such a small degree that the word loses most of its intended meaning'" ''Early Music,'' vol.&amp;nbsp;12, no.&amp;nbsp;1 (February 1984), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'', [[Lydia Goehr]] discusses the aims and fallacies of both proponents and critics of the HIP movement.&lt;ref name="Lydia Goehr pp. 279"&gt;Lydia Goehr, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press), pp.&amp;nbsp;279–84.&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that the HIP movement itself came about during the latter half of the 19th century as a reaction to the way modern techniques were being imposed upon music of earlier times. Thus performers were concerned with achieving an "authentic" manner of performing music—a 19th-century ideal that carries implications for all those involved with music. She distills the late 20th century arguments into two points of view, achieving either fidelity to the conditions of performance, or fidelity to the musical work.&lt;ref name="Lydia Goehr pp. 279"/&gt;

She succinctly summarizes the critics' arguments (for example, anachronistic, selectively imputing current performance ideas on early music), but then concludes that what the HIP movement has to offer is a different manner of looking at and listening to music: "It keeps our eyes open to the possibility of producing music in new ways under the regulation of new ideals. It keeps our eyes open to the inherently critical and revisable nature of our regulative concepts. Most importantly, it helps us overcome that deep‐rooted desire to hold the most dangerous of beliefs, that we have at any time got our practices absolutely right."&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Goehr, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (New York: Oxford University Press), p.&amp;nbsp;284. Goehr acknowledges the following writings informed her arguments: Theodor Adorno, "Bach Defended Against his Devotees," ''Prisms'' (London: N. Spearman, 1967), p. 135-146; Lawrence Dreyfus, "Early Music Defended Against Its Devotees: A Theory of Historical Performance in the Twentieth Century", ''Musical Quarterly'' 69 (1983), 297–322; Harry Haskell, ''The Early Music Revival'' (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1988) {{ISBN|9780500014493}}; Nicholas Kenyon (ed.), ''Authenticity and Early Music: A Symposium'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|9780198161523}}); Joseph Kerman, ''Contemplating Music: Challenges to Musicology'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985 {{ISBN|9780674166776}}), chapter 6; Michael Morrow, "Musical Performance", ''Early Music'' 6 (1978), 233–46; Charles Rosen, "Should Music Be Played "Wrong"?", ''High Fidelity'' 21 (1971), 54–58; and Richard Taruskin, et al., "The Limits of Authenticity: A Discussion", ''Early Music'' 12 (1984), 3–25, 523–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In his book, ''The Aesthetics of Music'', the British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] wrote that "the effect [of HIP] has frequently been to cocoon the past in a wad of phoney scholarship, to elevate musicology over music, and to confine Bach and his contemporaries to an acoustic time-warp. The tired feeling which so many 'authentic' performances induce can be compared to the atmosphere of a modern museum.... [The works of early composers] are arranged behind the glass of authenticity, staring bleakly from the other side of an impassable screen".&lt;ref&gt;''The Aesthetics of Music'' (1997), p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of penicillin''' follows a number of observations and discoveries of apparent evidence of antibiotic activity in [[mold]]s before the modern isolation of the chemical [[penicillin]] in 1928. There are anecdotes about ancient societies using molds to treat infections, and in the following centuries many people observed the inhibition of bacterial growth by various molds.&lt;ref name="BIO"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alexander Fleming |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/alexander-fleming |website=Science History Institute |accessdate=21 August 2018|date=June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unknown if the species involved were ''[[Penicillium]]'' species or if the antimicrobial substances produced were penicillin.

The Scottish physician [[Alexander Fleming]] was the first to suggest that a ''[[Penicillium]]'' mold must secrete an antibacterial substance, and the first to concentrate the active substance involved, which he named [[penicillin]], in 1928. Penicillin was the first modern [[antibiotic]]. During the next twelve years Fleming grew, distributed, and studied the original mold, which was determined to be a rare variant of ''[[Penicillium notatum]]'' (now ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'').&lt;ref name="Landmark"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macfarlane"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macfarlane |first1=Gwyn |title=Alexander Fleming, the man and the myth |date=1984 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many later scientists were involved in the stabilization and mass production of penicillin and in the search for more productive strains of ''Penicillium''.&lt;ref name="Barreiro"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barreiro |first1=Carlos |last2=Martín |first2=Juan F. |last3=García-Estrada |first3=Carlos |title=Proteomics Shows New Faces for the Old Penicillin Producer |journal=Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology |date=2012 |volume=2012 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1155/2012/105109 |pmid=22318718 |pmc=3270403 |url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2012/105109/ |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important contributors include [[Ernst Chain]], [[Howard Florey]], [[Norman Heatley]], and [[Edward Abraham]].&lt;ref name="Landmark"&gt;{{cite web |title=Discovery and Development of Penicillin |url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html |publisher = American Chemical Society |work = International Historic Chemical Landmarks |accessdate = August 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the discovery of penicillin, scientists found that some disease-causing pathogens display antibiotic resistance to penicillin. Research that aims to develop more effective strains and to study the causes and mechanisms of [[antibiotic resistance]] continues today.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lobanovska"/&gt;

==Early history==

Many ancient cultures, including those in [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[History of India|India]], independently discovered the useful properties of fungi and plants in treating [[infection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.experiment-resources.com/history-of-antibiotics.html |title=History of Antibiotics &amp;#124; Steps of the Scientific Method, Research and Experiments |publisher=Experiment-Resources.com |accessdate=2012-07-13}}{{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt; These treatments often worked because many organisms, including many species of [[mold]], naturally produce [[antibiotic]] substances. However, ancient practitioners could not precisely identify or isolate the active components in these organisms.

In [[Sri Lanka]] in the second century BC, soldiers in the army of king [[Dutugemunu]] (161–137 BC) are recorded to have stored oil cakes (a traditional Sri Lankan sweetmeat) for long periods in their hearth lofts before embarking on military campaigns in order to make a [[poultice]] of the cakes to treat wounds.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} 

In 17th-century [[Poland]], wet bread was mixed with spider webs (which often contained fungal [[spore]]s) to treat wounds. The technique was mentioned by [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] in his 1884 book ''[[With Fire and Sword]]''. In [[England]] in 1640, the idea of using mold as a form of medical treatment was recorded by apothecaries such as John Parkinson, King's Herbarian, who advocated the use of mold in his book on [[pharmacology]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Early scientific evidence==

The modern history of penicillin research begins in earnest in the 1870s, in the United Kingdom. [[John Scott Burdon-Sanderson|Sir John Scott Burdon-Sanderson]], who started out at St. Mary's Hospital (1852–1858) and later worked there as a lecturer (1854–1862), observed that [[microbiological culture|culture]] fluid covered with mold would produce no [[bacteria]]l growth. Burdon-Sanderson's discovery prompted [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], an English surgeon and the father of modern [[antisepsis]], to discover in 1871 that urine samples contaminated with mold also did not permit the growth of bacteria. Lister also described the antibacterial action on human tissue of a species of mold he called ''[[Penicillium glaucum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacFarlane|first1=Gwyn|title=Howard Florey : the making of a great scientist|date=1979|publisher=Oxford Univ. Pr.|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198581611|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nurse at [[King's College Hospital]] whose wounds did not respond to any traditional antiseptic was then given another substance that cured her, and Lister's registrar informed her that it was called Penicillium. In 1874, the Welsh physician [[William Roberts (physician)|William Roberts]], who later coined the term "[[enzyme]]", observed that bacterial contamination is generally absent in laboratory cultures of ''Penicillium glaucum''. [[John Tyndall]] followed up on Burdon-Sanderson's work and demonstrated to the Royal Society in 1875 the antibacterial action of the ''Penicillium'' fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.umn.edu/ships/updates/fleming.htm |publisher=SHiPS Resource Center |title=Penicillin &amp; Chance |author=Douglas Allchin |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528100504/http://www1.umn.edu/ships/updates/fleming.htm |archivedate=28 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' had been shown to cause [[anthrax]], the first demonstration that a specific bacterium caused a specific disease.

In 1877, French biologists [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Jules Francois Joubert]] observed that cultures of the anthrax bacilli, when contaminated with molds, could be successfully inhibited. Some references say that Pasteur identified the strain as ''[[Penicillium notatum]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} However, [[Paul de Kruif]]'s 1926 ''Microbe Hunters'' describes this incident as contamination by other bacteria rather than by mold.&lt;ref&gt;'At once Pasteur jumped to a fine idea: “If the harmless bugs from the air choke out the anthrax bacilli in the bottle, they will do it in the body too! It is a kind of dog-eat-dog!” shouted Pasteur, (...) Pasteur gravely announced: “That there were high hopes for the cure of disease from this experiment,” but that is the last you hear of it, for Pasteur was never a man to give the world of science the benefit of studying his failures.'&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, Garré found similar results. In 1895, [[Vincenzo Tiberio]], an Italian physician at the [[University of Naples]], published research about a mold in a water well in [[Arzano]] that showed antibacterial action.&lt;ref&gt;Tiberio, Vincenzo (1895) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LNg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sugli estratti di alcune muffe"] [On the extracts of certain moulds], ''Annali d'Igiene Sperimentale'' (Annals of Experimental Hygiene), 2nd series, '''5''' : 91–103.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LNg1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From p. 95:]  ''"Risulta chiaro da queste osservazioni che nella sostanza cellulare delle muffe esaminate son contenuti dei principi solubili in acqua, forniti di azione battericida:  sotto questo riguardo sono più attivi o in maggior copia quelli dell' ''Asp. flavescens'', meno quelli del ''Mu. mucedo'' e del ''Penn. glaucum''."''  (It follows clearly from these observations that in the cellular substance of the moulds examined are contained some water-soluble substances, provided with bactericidal action:  in this respect are more active or in greater abundance those of ''Aspergillus flavescens''; less, those of ''Mucor mucedo'' and ''Penicillium glaucum''.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bucci R., Galli P.

Two years later, [[Ernest Duchesne]] at École du Service de Santé Militaire in [[Lyon, France|Lyon]] independently discovered the healing properties of a ''Penicillium glaucum'' mold, even curing infected [[guinea pig]]s of [[typhoid]]. He published a dissertation&lt;ref name="Duchesne 1897"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZVXPIK Duchesne 1897], Antagonism between moulds and bacteria.  An English translation by Michael Witty.  Fort Myers, 2013.  ASIN B00E0KRZ0E and B00DZVXPIK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Duchesne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Contribution à l'étude de la concurrence vitale chez les micro-organismes : antagonisme entre les moisissures et les microbes''] [Contribution to the study of the vital competition in microorganisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes], (Lyon, France:  Alexandre Rey, 1897).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/sfhm/hsm/HSMx2002x036x001/HSMx2002x036x001x0011.pdf Une découverte oubliée : la thèse de médecine du docteur Ernest Duchesne (1874–1912)]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1897 but it was ignored by the [[Institut Pasteur]]. Duchesne was himself using a discovery made earlier by Arab stable boys, who used molds to cure sores on horses. He did not claim that the mold contained any antibacterial substance, only that the mold somehow protected the animals. The penicillin isolated by Fleming does not cure typhoid and so it remains unknown which substance might have responsible for Duchesne's cure.{{efn|At the time, the term ''Penicillium glaucum'' was used as a catch-all phrase for a variety of different fungi, though not for ''Penicillium notatum''. Duchesne's specific mold was unfortunately not preserved, which makes it impossible to be certain today which fungus might have been responsible for the cure and, consequently, even less certain which specific antibacterial substance was responsible.}}

In [[Belgium]] in 1920, Andre Gratia and Sara Dath observed a fungal contamination in one of their ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' cultures that was inhibiting the growth of the bacterium. They identified the fungus as a species of ''Penicillium'' and presented their observations as a paper, but it received little attention. An [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]] scientist, [[Costa Rica]]n [[Clodomiro Picado Twight]], similarly recorded the antibiotic effect of ''Penicillium'' in 1923.

==Modern breakthroughs==

===First isolation and successful treatment===

In 1928, Scottish biologist [[Alexander Fleming]] noticed a halo of inhibition of bacterial growth around a contaminant blue-green mold on a ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' plate culture. He concluded that the mold was releasing a substance that was inhibiting bacterial growth. He grew a pure culture of the mold and subsequently concentrated what he later named "[[penicillin]]". During the next twelve years, Fleming grew and distributed the original mold, which was eventually identified as ''[[Penicillium notatum]]'' (now known as ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]''). He was unsuccessful in making a stable form of it for mass production.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowden |first1=Mary Ellen  |title=Old Brew, New Brew  |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/old-brew-new-brew |journal=Distillations |date=2018|volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=8–11 |accessdate=August 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cecil George Paine]], a pathologist at the Royal Infirmary in [[Sheffield]], attempted to treat [[sycosis]] (eruptions in beard follicles) with penicillin but was unsuccessful, probably because the drug did not penetrate deep enough. Moving on to [[ophthalmia neonatorum]], a gonococcal infection in babies, he achieved the first cure on 25 November 1930. He cured four patients (one adult, the others infants) of eye infections, although a fifth patient was not so lucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wainwright M, Swan HT |title=C.G.

===Stabilization and mass production===

At [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Howard Walter Florey]] organized a large and very skilled biochemical research team, notable among them [[Ernst Boris Chain]] and [[Norman Heatley]], to undertake clinical trials and produce a stable penicillin in quantity. In 1940, Chain and [[Edward Abraham]] reported the first indication of [[antibiotic resistance]] to penicillin, an ''[[E. coli]]'' strain that produced the [[penicillinase]] enzyme, which was capable of breaking down penicillin and completely negating its antibacterial effect.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lobanovska"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lobanovska |first1=M |last2=Pilla |first2=G |title=Penicillin's Discovery and Antibiotic Resistance: Lessons for the Future? |journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |date=March 2017 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=135–145 |pmid=28356901 |pmc=5369031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abraham |first1=EP |last2=Chain |first2=E |title=An enzyme from bacteria able to destroy penicillin. |journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |date=1940 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=677–8 |pmid=3055168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1941 and 1943, Moyer, Coghill and Raper at the [[USDA]] [[National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research|Northern Regional Research Laboratory]] (NRRL) in [[Peoria, Illinois]], [[United States]], developed methods for industrialized penicillin production and isolated higher-yielding strains of the ''Penicillium'' fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/nov2003.html |title=''Penicillium chrysogenum'' (aka ''P. notatum''), the natural source for the wonder drug penicillin, the first antibiotic |work=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for November 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicpeoria.com/entry.php?eid=144&amp;catid=1&amp;cid=1 |title=Historic Peoria, Illinois |publisher=Northern Regional Research Lab }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, survivors of the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] in [[Boston]] were the first burn patients to be successfully treated with penicillin.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart B.

Kane]] and other [[Pfizer]] scientists in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] developed the practical, deep-tank [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] method for production of large quantities of pharmaceutical-grade penicillin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/about/history/1900_1950.jsp|title=1900–1950|year=2009|work=Exploring Our History|publisher=Pfizer Inc|accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ecological restoration of islands''', or '''island restoration''', is the application of the principles of [[ecological restoration]] to [[island]]s and island groups. Islands, due to their isolation, are home to many of the world's [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, as well as important breeding grounds for [[seabird]]s and some [[marine mammal]]s. Their ecosystems are also very vulnerable to human [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and particularly to [[introduced species]], due to their small size. Island groups such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Hawaii]] have undergone substantial [[extinction]]s and losses of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Since the 1950s several organisations and government agencies around the world have worked to restore islands to their original states; New Zealand has used them to hold natural populations of species that would otherwise be unable to survive in the wild. The principal components of island restoration are the removal of introduced species and the reintroduction of native species.

==Islands, endemism and extinction==
Isolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of [[Island biogeography]], formulated by  [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E.O. Wilson]] was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland. For example, 71% of [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|New Zealand]]'s bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic. As well as displaying greater levels of endemism, island species have characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human disturbance.

Many island species evolved on small islands, or even restricted habitats on small islands. Small populations are vulnerable to even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that is they have not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to [[predator]]s. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of [[island tameness|tameness]]. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that [[moa]]s were hunted to extinction in a few short generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the [[dodo]], are thought to have become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the [[Pacific]] islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD.

[[Image:Takahe and chick.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Takahe]] have bred after translocation to restored islands, like these on [[Kapiti Island]].]]
The field of island restoration is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, such as the restoration of [[Nonsuch Island]] in [[Bermuda]] (which began in 1962) have been going on for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] (DOC) is one of the largest in the world. It began on [[Cuvier Island]], where ecologists removed stock, [[goat]]s, [[feral cats]] and finally, in 1993, [[Pacific rat]]s. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the [[magenta petrel]], islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the [[takahe]], where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.

===Eradication of introduced alien species===
One important aspect of island restoration is the removal of [[invasive species|invasive alien species]]. Since these species are most often the reason that native fauna and flora is threatened, their removal is essential to the restoration project. From 1673 until 2009, 786 successful invasive vertebrate eradication have been recorded and in the last few decades the frequency of eradications and the size of islands from which invasive vertebrates have been eradicated has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Islands Invasive Vertebrate Eradication Database: A tool to improve and facilitate restoration of island ecosystems.|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/croll/pdf/Keitt_2011.pdf|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are particularly suitable for restoration as once cleared of an introduced species they can be kept cleared of these species by virtue of being an island. Species removal is intensive and expensive, and methods used must be carefully chosen as to not create too much impact on non-target species. Feral cats, goats and three species of rats are among the most damaging species introduced to islands (Moors &amp; Atkinson 1984). The differences in size, lifestyle and behaviour preclude the use of the same techniques for all of them, but with many species a range of techniques needs to be used in order to ensure success. Larger animals, such as goats and pigs, can be effectively hunted; in the case of [[Round Island (Mauritius)|Round Island]], in [[Mauritius]], all the goats were eliminated by a single marksman. On larger islands ecologists use a [[Judas goat]], where a radio collared goat is released into the wild. This goat is then followed and groups it joins are removed. To remove cats a combination of techniques is needed: hunting, trapping and poisoning. Cats are more difficult to hunt than goats and pigs, requiring the use of experienced hunters and night hunting.

Trapping is ineffective for rats, given their sheer numbers, and the only method that works is [[poison]]ing, which can be delivered into the field by broadcasting (by hand or from the air) or by the maintenance of bait stations. This method has been employed around the world, in the [[Falkland Islands]], in the tropical Pacific, and off New Zealand, where over 40 islands have been cleared. This method is not without problems, especially if the rats share the island with other, native species of rodent that might take the bait as well, as has happened on [[Anacapa Island]] in the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] and Rat Island ([[Hawadax Island|Hawadax]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seabirdrestoration.org/pdf/RatIslandReview.pdf|title=THE RAT ISLAND RAT ERADICATION PROJECT: A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF NONTARGET MORTALITY.

In the Pacific poison intended for rats was taken by land [[crab]]s instead; the crabs were not affected by the poison but frustrated attempts to clear the rats.

The removal of invasive [[weed]]s is, in most cases, more difficult than removing animal species. One such eradication was that of [[sandbur]], ''Cencrus echinatus'', an introduced [[grass]] on [[Laysan]]. The grass, introduced to Laysan around 1961, had taken over 30% of the island by 1991, displaced the native [[bunchgrass]], and reduced the breeding habitat of two endemic threatened species, the [[Laysan duck]] and [[Laysan finch]], as well as those of several [[seabird]]s.  The removal took ten years, with controlled spraying for the first year, then individual removal of plants, then, when few plants were being found, sifting of the sands around plants to remove seeds. The cost of the eradication program was $150,000/year.

====Strategies====

There are three strategies to reduce the numbers of the introduced animals in order to lighten the problems caused by them: exclusion, control, and eradication.
Exclusion is removal of introduced species in limited areas and focused on a local impact.
Control has a meaning of mitigation by reducing the numbers of introduced species down to ecologically and economically less harmful level. Since it is not complete wiping out strategy, this has to be taken constantly and repeatedly. This strategy is said to be feasible but less cost effective due to its incompleteness.
Eradication is the complete removal of all the individuals of the population, down to the last potentially reproducing individual, or the reduction of their population density below sustainable levels&lt;ref&gt;Myers, J. H., Simberloff, D., Kuris, A.  M. &amp; Carey, J. R. (2000). Eradication revisited : dealing with exotic species. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 15, 316–320.&lt;/ref&gt; ( J. H. Myerset al., 2000). For islands, it is usually the best strategy as it gives permanent effects, which potentially means most cost effective. However, it is still logistically and economically high cost. Also, this strategy is sometimes hard to accomplish depending on the environment of island and the alien species.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Courchamp, F., Chapuis, J., and Pascal, M. (2003). Mammal invaders on islands: impact, control and control impact. Cambridge Philosophical Society. 78, 347-383.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods====

Fencing is used for excluding the alien mammals. This method intends to limit the area for the mammals before control or eradication.
Shooting is often used for large animals to control them. This method has meanings of gaining food supply and recreation. It requires accessibility in the field and experience for the hunters. Also, to maintain the effect, it requires good amount of manpower for long time, so it can be costly.
Trapping is designed for medium-sized mammals which are hard to shoot at.  This method is usually only for reduction not eradication. The advantage of this method is that it can be selective since it is possible to exclude or reduce the possibility of trapping native animals. However, trapping requires limited area to cover and limited population to capture.

Poisoning is very effective for small species. However, there are some disadvantages of this method. It is possible that untargeted animals take the poison. It is also necessary to consider the secondary poisoning that other animals are affected by poisoned species. This method can be costly if the area to cover is large.&lt;ref name=tny20141223&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Kolbert|first1=Elizabeth |title=The Big Kill : New Zealand's crusade to rid itself of mammals |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/22/big-kill |accessdate=23 December 2014 |work=The New Yorker |date=23 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogen Introduction (parasitism) is one of the biological methods to eradicate alien species. It is very effective for limited species, but the viruses and bacteria need to be specified clearly for use.&lt;ref name=tny20141223/&gt;

Predator introduction is another biological method to eradicate the introduced species. It is less costly and environmentally clean, but it can cause greater problems, because it is possible that the introduced predator targets the native animals instead of alien species and its existence and its parasites can be new problems.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Competitor introduction is also a biological method to eradicate introduced carnivores. It can be very effective with good amount of information. In the end, the competitor has to be removed as well.
Virus vectored immune-contraception is one of the newest method that is to infect introduced animals with genetically engineered viruses. This method is considered environmentally clean, low cost, selective, and ethical. However, it is not fully operational and the effect comes slowly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Restoration of former habitat===
In many cases the removal of introduced species is sufficient to allow a return to a pre-disturbance state, but generally active management, often in the form of replanting native flora and reintroduction of extirpated fauna is needed to achieve restoration goals. Planting of native species helps to replenish species that were either grazed or out competed. Species of animal can be translocated either from existing populations, or from captive bred populations. These reintroductions need to be carefully managed, particularly in the case of [[endangered species]], where the potential benefits need to be weighed against the possibility of failure. Not all translocations succeed, and it may be necessary to help the reintroduced animals along with supplementary feeding or other kinds of management.

One other important aspect of restoration is prevention, that is, keeping invasive species from returning to a cleared island. This can be achieved by restricting access to the island in question (reducing possible instances of invasion) to more stringent quarantine methods. For example, in order to prevent invasive weeds from returning to Laysan, people working on the island must bring entirely new clothes to the island, which must be frozen prior to arrival.

==Opposition to island restoration==
Prior to the initial efforts to remove rats from New Zealand's offshore islands there was a great deal of skepticism as to the feasibility of island restoration amongst ecologists and conservation workers. However, as the techniques have improved and larger islands have been restored, most of the initial criticisms from within the field have been dropped, in particular as the costs of eradication are often much lower than continuous pest control. Outside of the field of conservation there has been some opposition from other interested groups, particularly from the [[animal rights]] movement, which contends that the [[animal welfare|welfare]] of the pests in question is not adequately addressed in island restoration plans. Because a broad spectrum of pest removal techniques needs to be used, including leg traps, animal rights campaigners accuse ecologists of cruelty, and indifference to non-targeted species that also take bait or are trapped, and suggest that more humane methods such as capture and [[Animal sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] be used instead (something those working in island restoration contend would be too expensive, and potentially ineffective as in [[Kangaroo Island#Conservation|Kangaroo Island]] [[koala]]s.). Some also defend the rights of the introduced species to exist as well.  Others, including scientists affiliated with the animal rights movement, accept that when the choice is between the future of a species and a population of pests, the future of a species must take priority (with the caveat that the extermination is conducted as humanely as possible). Opposition to island restoration has not led to the abandonment of many projects but has delayed several, particularly through court action. Groups sometimes adopt different approaches; opponents of [[hedgehog]] removal in the [[Outer Hebrides]] offered bounties for live hedgehogs removed from the islands and relocated in their natural habitat. Invasive plants can also generate strong feelings. The removal of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' trees from [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] in [[San Francisco Bay]] faced considerable opposition.

==Island restoration projects==
Island restoration has been attempted in many countries since the 1960s, and has met with varying degrees of success. The following examples highlight some of the factors that influence projects. A comprehensive list of projects can be found on the Database of Island Invasive Species Eradications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIISE|url=http://diise.islandconservation.org/|publisher=Island Conservation|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Round Island ===
[[Île Ronde, Mauritius|Round Island]] (Île Ronde in French) is a tropical island 22.5 kilometres north of [[Mauritius]], with an area of 1.69 square kilometres and a maximum elevation of 280 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=30&amp;tcid=82|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - In The Field - Mauritius - Round Island|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarene]] islands and islets, Round Island remained relatively pristine until goats and rabbits were introduced in the 19th century (goats were introduced between 1846 and 1868, whilst rabbits were present in large numbers before 1810).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/216936090|title=Lost land of the dodo : an ecological history of Mauritius, Réunion &amp; Rodrigues|last=S.)|first=Cheke, A. S. (Anthony|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Hume, Julian P. (Julian Pender)|isbn=9780300141863|location=New Haven|oclc=216936090}}&lt;/ref&gt; These herbivores, along with other factors, such as sporadic logging and frequent cyclones, led to the eventual dwindling of the island's forests and dependent fauna. In turn, this led to soil erosion by wind and rain, impeding forest regeneration, acting as a [[Positive feedback|positive feedback mechanism]] that caused rapid deforestation of the island. In 1957, however, Round Island was officially made a nature reserve, and in 1979 and 1986 was rid of goats (shooting) and rabbits (poisoning), respectively, after several unsuccessful attempts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Since removal of the introduced herbivores, the Round Island plant community has recovered dramatically. This is especially stark for three of the endemic tree species, ''Latania loddigesii'', ''Pandanus vandermeerschii'' and ''Hyophorbe lagenicaulis'', which constituted a large portion of the Round Island forest historically. This has led to six reptile species (five of which were [[critically endangered]]) recovering in tandem with the plant community; these are the skinks ''Leiolopisma telfaririi'' and ''Scelotes bojerii'', the geckos ''Phelsuma guentheri'', ''P. ornata'' and ''Nactus serpensinsula'', and the snake C''asarea dussumerii.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-01-01|title=Changes in the vegetation and reptile populations on Round Island, Mauritius, following eradication of rabbits|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320794900043|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=21–28|doi=10.1016/0006-3207(94)90004-3|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Round Island restoration program represents one of the longest-running projects of its kind in the world, since its conservation status was confirmed in 1957. Much of the current conservation work on Round Island is conducted by the [[Mauritian Wildlife Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=1&amp;tcid=1|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - Home|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/|title=Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust {{!}} Home|website=Durrell|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revolves around maintaining soil levels, reforestation of the island, and eradication of remaining invasive plants and invertebrates. 

===Aleutian Islands===
[[Image:Fox with auklet.jpg|200px|thumb|Arctic fox with [[least auklet]].]]
The [[Aleutian Islands]], prior to the 18th century, lacked any terrestrial predators, but from the mid-18th century [[Arctic fox]]es were introduced to act as a source for the [[fur trade]], a practice that continued into the early 20th century. This introduction decimated the birds of the chain, particularly [[seabird]]s like the [[whiskered auklet]]. The reduction in seabirds, in turn, had effects on the [[ecology]] of the islands, as many of the plants were dependent on the guano from nesting birds acting as a fertilizer. In the early 1950s managers of the Aleutian Islands Reservation became aware of the damage, and an eradication program began. Since then over 80 islands have been cleared of non-native foxes (only six islands remain) and bird populations have rebounded. Whiskered auklets, which numbered 25,000 in 1974, had increased to 116,000 in 2003.

===Campbell Island===
[[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]] is a sub [[Antarctic]] island 700&amp;nbsp;km south of New Zealand that became infested with [[Norway rat|rats]] in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, including the [[Campbell teal]] and [[Campbell snipe]], only survived on small rocky islets just off the island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for [[ex-situ conservation]], but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island was one of the most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of [[bird strike]] for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. [[Snipe]] have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.

=== South Georgia ===
Rats, brought to [[South Georgia Island]] as stowaways on sealing and whaling ships in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/%28e%29Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|title=Eradication of Rodents|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands|access-date=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803043220/http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/(e)Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|archivedate=2015-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have caused much damage to native wildlife, destroying tens of millions of ground-nesting birds’ eggs and chicks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3791">'''Kautsky effect''' (also named, ''fluorescence transient'', ''fluorescence induction'' or ''fluorescence decay'') is a phenomenon consisting on a typical variation on the behavior of a plant fluorescence when is exposed to light. It was discovered in 1931 by H. Kautsky and A. Hirsch.

When dark-adapted photosynthesising cells are illuminated with continuous light, [[chlorophyll fluorescence]] displays characteristic changes in intensity accompanying the induction of photosynthetic activity.

==Application of Kautsky effect==
The quantum yield of photosynthesis, which is also the photochemical quenching of fluorescence, is calculated through the following equation:

Φ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = (F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;/F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;

F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the low fluorescence intensity, which is measured by a short light flash that is not strong enough to cause photochemistry, and thus induces fluorescence. F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum fluorescence that can be obtained from a sample by measuring the highest intensity of fluorescence after a saturating flash. The difference between the measured values is the variable fluorescence F&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Explanation==
[[image:kautsky effect.PNG|right|The Kautsky effect]]
When a sample (leaf or algal suspension) is illuminated, the fluorescence intensity increases with a time constant in the microsecond or millisecond range. After a few seconds the intensity decreases and reaches a steady-state level. The initial rise of the fluorescence intensity is attributed to the progressive saturation of the [[reaction center]]s of [[photosystem 2]] (PSII). Therefore, [[photochemical quenching]] increases with the time of illumination, with a corresponding increase of the fluorescence intensity. The slow decrease of the fluorescence intensity at later times is caused, in addition to other processes, by [[non-photochemical quenching]]. Non-photochemical quenching is a protection mechanism in photosynthetic organisms as they have to avoid the adverse effect of excess light. Which components contribute and in which quantities remains an active but controversial area of research. It is known that [[carotenoids]] and the [[special pigment pairs]] (e.g. [[P700]]) have functions in [[photoprotection]].

{{main article|Systems biology}}
[[Systems biology]] is a biological study field that focuses on the systematic study of complex interactions in [[biological system]]s, thus using a new perspective (integration instead of [[reductionist|reduction]]) to study them. Particularly from year 2000 onwards, the term is used widely in the [[biosciences]].

The field has generated interest among scientists, resulting in regular and one-time conferences and meetings. Below is a partial list.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:MIKE11.jpg|right|300px|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 13 July 2008}}|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 13 July 2008}}]] --&gt;
'''MIKE 11''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates flow and water level, [[water quality]] and [[sediment transport]] in rivers, [[flood plain]]s, irrigation canals, reservoirs and other inland water bodies. MIKE 11 is a 1-dimensional river model. It was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]].

MIKE 11 has long been known as a software tool with advanced interface facilities. Since the beginning MIKE 11 was operated through an efficient interactive menu system with systematic layouts and sequencing of menus. It is within that framework where the latest ‘Classic’ version of MIKE 11 – version 3.20 was developed. 

The new generation of MIKE 11 combines the features and experiences from the MIKE 11 ‘Classic’ period, with the powerful Windows based user interface including graphical editing facilities and improved computational speed gained by the full utilization of 32-bit technology.

==Modules==
The computational core of MIKE 11 is a hydrodynamic simulation engine, and this is complemented by a wide range of additional modules and extensions covering almost all conceivable aspects of river modeling. 

'''HD module''': provides fully dynamic solution to the complete [[nonlinear]] [[1-D Saint Venant equation]]s, diffusive wave approximation and kinematic wave approximation, [[Muskingum method]] and [[Muskingum-Cunge method]] for simplified channel routing. It can automatically adapt to [[subcritical flow]] and [[supercritical flow]]. It has ability to simulate standard hydraulic structures such as [[weir]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[pump]]s, [[energy loss]] and [[sluice gate]]s. 

'''GIS Extension''': an extension of [[ArcMap]] from [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] providing features for catchment/river delineation, cross-section and [[Digital Elevation Model]](DEM) data, pollution load estimates, flood visualisation/animation as 2D maps and results presentation/analysis using [[Temporal Analyst]].

'''RR module''': a rainfall runoff module, including the unit hydrograph method (UHM), a lumped conceptual continuous hydrological model and a monthly [[soil moisture]] accounting model. It includes an auto-calibration tool to estimate model parameter based on statistic data of comparison of simulated water levels/discharges and observations.

'''SO module''': a structure operation module. It simulates operational structures such as [[sluice gate]]s, [[weir]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[pump]]s, [[bridge]]s with operating strategies.

'''DB module''': a dam break module. It provides complete facilities for definition of dam geometry, breach development in time and space as well as failure mode.

'''AUTOCAL module''': an automatic calibration tool. It allows automisation of the calibration process for a wide range of parameters, including rainfall runoff parameters, Manning's number, head loss coefficients, water quality parameters etc.

'''AD module''': an advection dispersion module. It simulates transport and spreading of conservative pollutants and constituents as well as heat with linear decay.

'''ST/GST module''': a noncohesive sediment module. It simulates transport, erosion and deposition of non-cohesive and graded noncohesive sediments, including simulations of river morphology.

'''ACS module''': a cohesive sediment module. It has 3-layer bed description, including quasi-2D erosion.

'''MIKE ECO Lab module''': provides ecological modeling. It can simulate [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]/[[Oxygen saturation|DO]], [[Ammonia]], [[Nitrate]], [[Eutrophication]], heavy metals and [[Wetland]]s. It includes standard templates that are well documented and have been used extensively in numerous applications worldwide. Based on predefined process templates, one can develop his/her own templates.

'''MIKE 11 Stratified module''': models vertical density differences such as salinity or temperature in two-layer or multi-layered stratified water bodies.

'''MIKE 11 Real Time module''': a simulation package and [[GIS]] front-end for setting up operational [[flood forecasting]] systems. It includes real-time updating and kalman filtering.

==Applications==
MIKE 11 has been used in hundreds of application around the world. Its main application areas are flood analysis and alleviation design, real-time flood forecasting, dam break analysis, optimisation of reservoir and canal gate/structure operations, ecological and water quality assessments in rivers and wetlands, sediment transport and river morphology studies, salinity intrusion in rivers and estuaries.

'''Magnanimity''' (from Latin ''[[wikt: magnanimitas|magnanimitās]]'', from ''[[wikt: magna|magna]]'' "big" + ''[[wikt:animus|animus]]'' "soul, spirit") is the virtue of being great of mind and heart.  It encompasses, usually, a refusal to be petty, a willingness to face danger, and actions for noble purposes. Its [[antithesis]] is pusillanimity (Latin: ''[[wikt:pusillanimitas|pusillanimitās]]''). Although the word magnanimity has a traditional connection to Aristotelian philosophy, it also has its own tradition in English which now causes some confusion.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker+page%3D1123a#note2 footnote] in the Rackham edition. In the Sachs translation it is remarked that two possible translations "pride" and "high mindedness" both only get half of the meaning, while magnanimity only "shifts the problem into Latin".&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Aristotle==
The Latin word ''magnanimitās'' comes from the Greek word μεγαλοψυχία (''megalopsychia'') which means "greatness of soul." In the context of ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' IV.3, [[Aristotle]] associates ''megalopsychia'' more with a sense of pride and self-worth rather than the modern sense of magnanimity. Aristotle writes (1123b1-2), "Now a person is thought to be great-souled if he claims much and deserves much" (δοκεῖ δὴ μεγαλόψυχος εἶναι ὁ μεγάλων αὑτὸν ἀξιῶν ἄξιος ὤν). W.D. Ross translates Aristotle's statement ἔοικε μὲν οὖν ἡ μεγαλοψυχία οἷον κόσμος τις εἶναι τῶν ἀρετῶν· μείζους γὰρ αὐτὰς ποιεῖ, καὶ οὐ γίνεται ἄνευ ἐκείνων (1124a1-2) as the following: "Pride [''megalopsychia''], then, seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues; for it makes them greater, and it is not found without them." The great-souled, Aristotle adds, are "thought to have a good memory for any benefit they have conferred, but a bad memory for those which they have received [...] It is also characteristic of the great-souled man never to ask help from others, or only with reluctance, but to render aid willingly; and to be dignified towards men of position and fortune, unassuming towards those of moderate station..." (1124b25-26, H. Rackham's translation for [[Loeb Classical Library]]).

==Other uses==
[[Noah Webster]] of the American Language defines ''Magnanimity'' as such:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
MAGNANIMITY, n. [L. magnanimitas; magnus, great, and animus, mind.] Greatness of mind; that elevation or dignity of soul, which encounters danger and trouble with tranquility and firmness, which raises the possessor above revenge, and makes him delight in acts of benevolence, which makes him disdain injustice and meanness, and prompts him to sacrifice personal ease, interest and safety for the accomplishment of useful and noble objects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noah Webster|Webster, N.]], ''Dictionary of the American Language'', 1828.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Edmund Spenser]], in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', had each knight [[allegorical]]ly represent a virtue; Prince Arthur represented "magnificence", which is generally taken to mean Aristotelian magnificence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.4.iv.html#185 ''Nichomachaen Ethics'' IV 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Spenser|Spenser, E.]], ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The uncompleted work does not include Prince Arthur's book, and the significance is not clear.

[[Democritus]] states that "magnanimity consists in enduring tactlessness with mildness".

As an adjective, the concept is expressed as "magnanimous", e.g. "He is a magnanimous man."  An example of referring to one as magnanimous can be seen in [[Hrólfs saga kraka]] where King [[Hrólfr Kraki]] changes the name of a court servant from Hott to Hjalti for his new-found strength and courage, after which Hjalti refuses to taunt or kill those who previously mocked him.  Because of his noble actions, the king then bestows the title Magnanimous upon Hjalti.

One form of magnanimity is the generosity of the victor to the defeated. For example, magnanimity has been codified between societies by the [[Geneva Conventions]].

Magnanimous relief efforts can serve to offset the collateral damage of war.

[[C. S. Lewis]], in his book ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', refers to the chest of man as the seat of magnanimity, or sentiment, with this magnanimity working as the liaison between visceral and cerebral man.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis|Lewis, C. S.]], ''[[The Abolition of Man]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis asserts that, in his time, the denial of the emotions that are found in the eternal and sublime -- that which is humbling as an objective reality -- had led to "men without chests".

The '''Max-Planck-Institut für Kernphysik''' ("MPI for Nuclear Physics" or MPIK for short) is a
research institute in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]].

The institute is one of the 80 institutes of the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft]] (Max Planck Society), an independent, non-profit research organization. The Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics was founded in 1958 under the leadership of Wolfgang Gentner. Its precursor was the Institute for Physics at the MPI for Medical Research.

Today, the institute's research areas are: crossroads of particle physics and astrophysics (astroparticle physics) and
many-body dynamics of atoms and molecules (quantum dynamics). There are five scientific divisions and several further research groups and junior groups. Scientific and technical departments as well as the administration support the researchers. The institute has about 390 employees, as well as many diploma students and scientific guests.

The research field of Astroparticle Physics, represented by the divisions of [[Werner Hofmann (physicist)|Werner Hofmann]] and [[Manfred Lindner]], combines questions related to macrocosm and microcosm. Unconventional methods of observation for gamma rays and neutrinos open new windows to the universe. What lies behind “dark matter” and “dark energy” is theoretically investigated.

The research field of Quantum Dynamics is represented by the divisions of [[Klaus Blaum]], [[Christoph Helmut Keitel|Christoph Keitel]] and [[Thomas Pfeifer]]. Using reaction microscopes, simple chemical reactions can be “filmed”. Storage rings and traps allow precision experiments almost under space conditions. The interaction of intense laser light with matter is investigated using quantum-theoretical methods.

Further research fields are cosmic dust, atmospheric physics as well as fullerenes and other carbon molecules.

Scientists at the MPIK collaborate with other research groups in Europe and all over the world and are involved in numerous international collaborations, partly in a leading role. Particularly close connections to some large-scale facilities like [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research|GSI]] (Darmstadt), [[DESY]] (Hamburg), [[CERN]] (Geneva), [[TRIUMF]] (Canada), and [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|INFN]]-[[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|LNGS]] (Assergi L‘Aquila) exist.

In the local region, the Institute cooperates closely with the University of Heidelberg, where the directors and further members of the Institute are teaching. Three International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS) and a graduate school serve to foster young scientists.

The institute operates accelerators (12 MeV Tandem, 15 MeV high-current injector, 25 MeV linear postaccelerator) injecting highly charged atomic ions or molecular ions into a storage ring (TSR). The electron-beam ion trap (EBIT) is able to produce and store 78-fold charged mercury ions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9921">The '''Nagel–Schreckenberg model''' is a [[computer simulation|theoretical model]] for the [[simulation]] of [[freeway]] traffic. The model was developed in the early 1990s by the [[Germany|German]] [[physicist]]s Kai Nagel and Michael Schreckenberg.&lt;ref name="sn"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nagel | first1 = K. | last2 = Schreckenberg | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1051/jp1:1992277 | title = A cellular automaton model for freeway traffic | journal = Journal de Physique I | url = http://jp1.journaldephysique.org/articles/jp1/pdf/1992/12/jp1v2p2221.pdf | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 2221 | year = 1992 | pmid =  | pmc =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140311105626/http://jp1.journaldephysique.org/articles/jp1/pdf/1992/12/jp1v2p2221.pdf | archivedate = 2014-03-11 | df =  | bibcode = 1992JPhy1...2.2221N }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essentially a simple [[cellular automaton]] model for road [[traffic flow]] that can reproduce traffic jams, i.e., show a slow down in average car speed when the road is crowded (high density of cars). The model shows how [[traffic jam]]s can  be thought of as an emergent or collective phenomenon due to interactions between cars on the road, when the density of cars is high and so cars are close to each other on average.

== Outline of the model ==

In the Nagel–Schreckenberg model, a road is divided into ''cells''. In the original model, these cells are aligned in a single row whose ends are connected so that all cells make up a circle (this is an example of what are called [[periodic boundary conditions]]). Each cell is either empty road or contains a single car; i.e., no more than one car can occupy a cell at any time. Each car is assigned a velocity which is an integer between 0 and a maximum velocity (= 5 in Nagel and Schreckenberg's original work).
[[File:Nagel-Schreckenberg model - plot of average velocity v as a function of density of cars rho.png|thumb|right|at=caption|A plot of the average velocity, &lt;v&gt;, as a function of the density of cars per cell, rho, in the Nagel–Schreckenberg model. The black curve is for ''p'' = 0, i.e., for the deterministic limit, while the red curve is for ''p'' = 0.3.]]

Time is discretized into time steps. This discretization in both space and time results in a cellular automaton. One can think of a cell as being a few car lengths long and the maximum velocity as being the speed limit on the road. The time step is then the time taken for a car at the speed limit to travel around 10 car lengths. However, the model can also be thought as just a way to understand or to model features of traffic jams by showing how interactions between nearby cars cause the cars to slow down. In each time step, the procedure is as follows.&lt;ref name="sn" /&gt;

In each step, the following four actions are conducted in order from first to last, and all are applied to all cars. In each action the updates are applied to all cars in parallel.

# Acceleration: All cars not at the maximum velocity have their velocity increased by one unit. For example, if the velocity is 4 it is increased to 5.
# Slowing down: All cars are checked to see if the distance between it and the car in front (in units of cells) is smaller than its current velocity (which has units of cells per time step). If the distance is smaller than the velocity, the velocity is reduced to the number of empty cells in front of the car – to avoid a collision. For example, if the velocity of a car is now 5, but there are only 3 free cells in front of it, with the fourth cell occupied by another car, the car velocity is reduced to 3.
# Randomization: The speed of all cars that have a velocity of at least 1, is now reduced by one unit with a probability of p. For example, if p = 0.5, then if the velocity is 4, it is reduced to 3 50% of the time.
# Car motion: Finally, all cars are moved forward the number of cells equal to their velocity. For example, if the velocity is 3, the car is moved forward 3 cells.

These four actions are repeated many times, as long as is required to study any traffic jams that may form. The model is an example of a [[cellular automaton]]. The model is for a single lane where cars cannot pass each other; there is no overtaking.

=== Example simulation in the state with traffic jams ===
Above and to the right is a plot of the average velocity as a function of the density of cars, obtained from a simulation of the original Nagel–Schreckenberg model.&lt;ref name="sn" /&gt; In the deterministic limit, ''p'' = 0, the velocity is constant at the maximum velocity (here 5) up to a density ''ρ'' = 1/(maximum velocity&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) = 1 / 6 = 0.167, at which point there is a discontinuity in the slope due to the sudden appearance of traffic jams. Then as the density increases further, the average velocity decreases until it reaches zero when the road is 100% occupied. When p = 0.3, and so there are random decreases in velocity, then at low densities the average velocity is of course slower. However, note p &gt; 0 also shifts the density at which jams appear to lower densities – traffic jams appear at the ''knee'' in the curve which for p = 0.3 is close to 0.15, and the random decelerations round off the discontinuity in the slope found for p = 0 at the onset of traffic jams.&lt;ref name="sn2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eisenblätter | first1 = B. | last2 = Santen | first2 = L. | last3 = Schadschneider | first3 = A. | last4 = Schreckenberg | first4 = M. | title = Jamming transition in a cellular automaton model for traffic flow | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.57.1309 | journal = Physical Review E | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 1309 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = cond-mat/9706041 |bibcode = 1998PhRvE..57.1309E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black pixels are cells with cars in them, white pixels are empty cells. From the top to the bottom successive lines of pixels are the road at successive times,
i.e., the top line is the road at t = 1, the line below it is the road at t = 2, etc. The road is circular ([[periodic boundary conditions]]), and cars move left exiting at the left edge and rejoining on the right edge. The car density is 0.35 and p = 0.3.]]

To the right is the result of an example simulation run of the Nagel–Schreckenberg model, with maximum velocity 5, density of cars 0.35 and probability of deceleration ''p'' = 0.3. It is a road of 100 cells. Cars are shown as black dots, and so, for example, if the road had a single car on it the plot would be white except for a single black line of slope &amp;minus;1/5 (maximum velocity = 5). The lines have slopes that are steeper, indicating that jamming is slowing the cars down. Small traffic jams show up as dark bands, i.e., groups of cars that are nose-to-tail and moving slowly to the right. The rippling of the bands is due to the randomization step.

So, the Nagel–Schreckenberg model includes the effect of cars getting in each other's way and so slowing each other down. The average velocity at this density is a little over 1, while at low density it is a little less than the maximum velocity of 5. It also shows that this is a collective phenomenon in which cars bunch up into traffic jams. When jamming occurs the distribution of cars along the road becomes highly non-uniform.

=== Role of randomization ===
Without the randomization step (third action), the model is a [[deterministic algorithm]], i.e., the cars always move in a set pattern once the original state of the road is set. With randomization this is not the case, as it is on a real road with human drivers. Randomization has the effect of rounding off an otherwise sharp transition.&lt;ref name="sn2" /&gt; Just below this transition, one car braking due to a random slow can slow down the cars behind, spontaneously creating a jam. This feature of one car braking at random and causing a jam is absent in a deterministic model.

== Model properties ==
* The model explains how traffic congestions can emerge without external influences, just because of crowding on a road.
*It was shown that variants of the Nagel–Schreckenberg model deliver (with a tolerance in the range of jam spacing) precisely the same results for vehicle trajectories as kinematic wave models and linear vehicle-following models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daganzo | first1 = C. F. | title = In traffic flow, cellular automata = kinematic waves | doi = 10.1016/j.trb.2005.05.004 | journal = Transportation Research Part B: Methodological | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 396–403 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.its.berkeley.edu/publications/UCB/2004/RR/UCB-ITS-RR-2004-5.pdf| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For a maximum speed of one (instead of five) and no probability of slowing down, the model equals [[Rule 184|cellular automaton 184]] by [[Stephen Wolfram]].
* The model is minimalist, i.e. that the exclusion of any element of the model’s definition will immediately cause loss of crucial properties of traffic.

== Application ==
* The Nagel–Schreckenberg model was further developed during Nagel's research stay at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for parallel computing. The [[transportation forecasting]] model [[Transims]] is based on this work.
* In the German [[states of Germany|state]] (bundesland) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] the Nagel–Schreckenberg model has been used as the foundation for a comprehensive traffic forecasting system which is accessibile online.

The '''New York State College of Forestry at Cornell''' was a [[statutory college]] established in 1898 at [[Cornell University]] to teach scientific forestry. The first four-year college of forestry in the country, it was defunded by the State of New York in 1903, over controversies involving the college's forestry practices in the Adirondacks. Forestry studies continued at Cornell even after the college's closing.

==Background==
The idea of a Cornell Forestry school began with Colonel [[William F. Fox]], Superintendent of New York's state-owned forests during the mid-1890s. At that time, forestry research and education was conducted only in Great Britain and Europe.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archivedate=2007-10-07 |title=Department of Natural Resources - History |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Governor [[Frank S. Black]] went on a fishing trip with a Cornell trustee and discussed Col. Fox's proposal, the suggestion was made that Cornell would be well-suited to implement the demonstration forest. Cornell President [[Jacob Gould Schurman]] then began lobbying for a state-funded college, just as he had successfully advocated for a state-funded veterinary college in 1894. The legislature quickly approved the new college.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 122 of the Laws of 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The act authorized New York State to pay for a tract of forest land in the Adirondacks from funds, previously appropriated for the acquisition of lands to be held "forever wild" in the [[Adirondack Forest Preserve]],&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Alfred Lee,(1921) A History of the Adirondacks, page 203&lt;/ref&gt; with Cornell holding title, possession, management, and control for 30 years.  After 30 years, the land would revert to the State. Schurman recruited German trained, Dr. [[Bernhard Fernow|Bernhard E. Fernow]], who was then the 3rd Chief of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry (predecessor of the [[U.S. Forest Service]]) and one of the top forestry experts in the United States, to be the first Dean of the college.

Fernow moved quickly to acquire a tract of land to serve as a demonstration forest and purchased some.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Fernow's plan called for [[clearcutting]] the forestland at the rate of several thousand acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. He contracted with the [[Brooklyn Cooperage Company]] to take the logs and cordwood from the forest land for a 15-year period. In the 1890s, the more valuable red spruce trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods. The years 1899, 1903, and 1908 were terrible years for forest fires in the Adirondacks. Many, tens of thousands of acres were consumed by forest fires. Most fires were started by sparks or embers flying from coal-burning locomotive stacks and landing on [[logging slash]]. [[Louis Marshall]], with a summer residence at [[Knollwood Club]] on [[Lower Saranac Lake]], branded locomotives as "instruments of arson."&lt;ref&gt;Angus,Christopher. The extraordinary Adirondack journey of Clarence Petty: wilderness guide, pilot, and conservationist, p. 17, [[Syracuse University Press]] 2002 {{ISBN|0-8156-0741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worst sin of the lumbermen was the fire menace that they left behind, and which caused incalculable destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas,Howard. Black River in the  North Country, p.89, Prospect Books,1963&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless,  Fernow had a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the Brooklyn Cooperage Company facility. The company turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into [[methanol]] and [[charcoal]], through a process called [[destructive distillation]]. Historic charcoal kiln photo:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=Milky Way Over Abandoned Kilns |date=25 July 2011 |access-date=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
To his credit, Fernow established the first tree nursery in New York State at Axton, the site of an old lumber settlement originally called Axe-town. But most of the non-native conifer species he planted, such as [[norway spruce]], did not do well for many years, with a denuded area as a result. Smoke from the burning of brush and logging slash, along with Fernow's arrogant disposition toward landowners from nearby Saranac Lake further alienated the public.&lt;ref&gt;Gove, B. 2005. ''Logging railroads of the Adirondacks''. Syracuse University Press. pp. 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Fernow's actions drew criticism also from Adirondack guides such as Ellsworth Petty (father of [[Clarence Petty]]), who protested the plan and, in a letter writing campaign, successfully lobbied the State to assign a special "Committee of the Adirondacks" to tour the Axton site. In its findings, the commission concluded that "the college has exceeded the original intention of the State when the tract was granted the university for conducting silvicultural experiments."&lt;ref name="Christopher 2002. p 31"&gt;Christopher, Angus. 2002.

==Existence==

In  1898, the New York State College of Forestry opened at Cornell, which was the first forestry college in North America.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;  Because some of the students were transfer students, even though the College had a four-year curriculum, it graduated students during each of the five years of its operation, and the demand for students with Cornell forestry degrees exceeded the supply.  It also offered an optional  fifth year for a professional masters in forestry degree.

In 1899, Fernow had been recruited as a member of New York's [[E.H. Harriman]] expedition to Alaska, along with fellow Cornellian [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]]. The expedition set sail from Seattle on May 31, 1899, aboard the refitted steamer, the ''George W. Elder''. "[Fernow's] research on the expedition was hampered by the fact that the coastal itinerary never gave him a look at the inland forests. His overview thus limited, he concluded that Alaska would never be a great source of timber: the wood was inferior and the conditions of lumbering too difficult. Some say that history has proven him wrong, but his opinion did have an effect: for a time, it discouraged commercial interests from prospecting for timber in the Alaskan forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/harriman/1899/1899_part/participantfernow.html |title=Harriman: Bernhard Fernow |publisher=PBS |date=1923-02-06 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Fernow founded and became editor-in-chief of  the ''[[Journal of Forestry]]'', the pioneering scholarly journal in this field.

The demonstration forest, near Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks drew heated opposition from neighboring land owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0L8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=Brooklyn+Cooperage+Company%5D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3FNnwghrFu&amp;sig=aVmNAw0naLbeOJqb9l1Gyk4E0Eo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QpejSuORNoTYsQOvlImNDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Brooklyn%20Cooperage%20Company%5D&amp;f=false|title=''A history of the Adirondacks, Volume 2''|first=Alfred Lee|last=Donaldson|pages=202–207|publisher=Century Co|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with Brookyn Cooperage Company for the project to be viable. The contract proved to be profitable and beneficial only for the company. Cornell gained insufficient funds to replant the clear-cut areas. A lawsuit was filed, naming the Brooklyn Cooperage Company as defendant with the People of New York State as plaintiff. (See ''[[People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company]]''.)

Although the legislature had adopted the 1903 appropriation without debate,&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Governor [[Benjamin B. Odell]] made a [[pocket veto]] of funds for the school. In his statement, Governor Odell said: "The operations of the College of Forestry have been subjected to grave criticism, as they have practically denuded the forest lands of the State without compensating benefits. I deem it wise therefore to withhold approval of this item until a more scientific and more reasonable method is pursued in the forestry of the lands now under the control of Cornell University."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Z. Lincoln, ed. 1910. ''Messages from the Governors, X''. Albany, p.555, as cited in ''Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University'', 1963, by Gould P. Colman, p.161, Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacrifice of College of Forestry for the College of Agriculture==

Dean Bailey and Dean [[Bernhard Fernow]], of the Forestry College were the best of friends.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}} In fact, on that night in May 1903 when the telegram arrived announcing Governor Odell's veto of the annual appropriation for the College of Forestry, Bailey and Fernow were together at a dance. Despite the bad news, the dance went on. Fernow did not want to let the veto end his school, and he continued to work without a salary.  He proposed continuing the school by charging tuition to the students.  (During this time, New York State students attended the College tuition-free.) However, Cornell's Board of Trustees and President Schurman (despite Bailey's urgings to the contrary) decided to close the doors of the Forestry College. In June, 1903, instruction in the College ceased and the faculty was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05EEDB1339E333A2575BC1A9609C946297D6CF|title=CORNELL SCHOOL OF FORESTRY SUSPENDED.; Action Followed Failure of State to Provide Means for Its Support.|work=New York Times|date=June 18, 1903|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was rumored, and with good reason, that a political bargain took place exchanging the College of Forestry, for the establishment of the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell University in 1904. To quote Liberty Hyde Bailey, "Last winter at Albany I was confronted by inquiries which indicated that the State would be willing to give to either a College of Forestry or a College of Agriculture, but not to both."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University,1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 162, Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the legislative session of 1904 began in Albany, a most unexpected mishap occurred: at a hearing before the Federal Commission on Agriculture in Washington, the Secretary of Agriculture, James Wilson, attacked Cornell for not teaching "Soil Physics" and took the occasion to revive the old canards about Cornell misusing the riches conferred by the [[Morrill Act]]. He said of Cornell: "They were better endowed than any institution in the land, yet never did anything." Cornell's President [[Jacob Gould Schurman]] demanded a hearing and spoke in Washington with his usual brilliance, refuting the Secretary point by point.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, in Albany, Senator Ed Stewart of Ithaca introduced a bill drafted by [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]],establishing the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell. Leading the opposition was Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James R. Day]] of Syracuse University. According to Schurman, "the Chancellor led a pious army, the Methodists of the state. He was an angry man; his words breathe a rancor too hot to be contained by facts." He charged that [[Ezra Cornell]] had so "manipulated" the proceeds of the Morrill Act that more than four-fifths were improperly used. He demanded a share in state bounty equal to that accorded Cornell: "Either give to all or not to any!"&lt;ref name="Bishop, p. 367"&gt;Bishop, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Bailey broadcast an immediate refutation, but Chancellor Day had already had his speech published by the Syracuse University Press without change. The Chancellor asked for a hearing before the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee. This request granted, he spoke at the hearing but the chairman and other legislators were insufficiently attentive to him, the Chancellor broke off in a fury and left the room,"before he had adduced a single coherent argument." Dean Bailey, later put up a picture of Chancellor Day, in his office, with the subscription: "Founder of the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell."&lt;ref name="Bishop, p. 367"/&gt;
  
The announcement of the final passage and signing of the bill, in Albany, creating the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell was met with bonfires and the pealing of church bells in Ithaca. However, the price for this new state support at Cornell was the sacrifice of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;Colman,p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The lawsuit, ''People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company'', was decided in favor of the People, and again on appeal in 1906;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9905E2D71F3DE633A25750C1A9619C946797D6CF|title=Cornell Forestry Case: Appellate Division Decision Against Brooklyn Cooperage Company|work=New York Times|page=4|date=July 13, 1906|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the case defined forestry in the United States for a generation. The {{convert|30000|acre|km2}} of forest lands were placed under the "forever wild" protection of the [[Adirondack Forest Preserve]]. At the conclusion of the case, constitutional lawyer [[Louis Marshall]] stated, "I hold before me the decision in the case of the People against the Brooklyn Cooperage Company.....the consequence of that was that this 'tremendous' tract of thirty thousand acres was to be cut down 'flat' from one end of it to the other, in order that the scientific foresters might start a new forest which might mature a hundred years from the time that that contract was entered into. This is scientific forestry?".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reznikoff, Charles, ed., ''Louis Marshall: Champion of Liberty. Selected Papers and Addresses''. 2 vols. Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1957., page 1020.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, [[Bernhard E. Fernow]] became the first professor of forestry in a four-year baccalaureate degree program at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], in State College, after having been the nation's first consulting forester since leaving Cornell and Ithaca in 1903. His office was in New York City. After teaching the 1907 spring semester at Penn State, Dr. Fernow left to become the first head of the Faculty of Forestry at the [[University of Toronto]]. He gave as a reason for leaving Penn State his argument with Dr.[[Joseph Rothrock]] that [[Penn State Mont Alto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/ourhist.htm |title=Penn State Mont Alto: Our History |publisher=Ma.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226102802/http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/ourhist.htm |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; should not have departed from its role as a "ranger school" to pursue higher aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys1muh3jqXsC&amp;dq=A+century+of+forest+resources+education+at+Penn+State:+serving+our+forests+...++By+Henry+D.+Gerhold&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5dZR-SoqGO&amp;sig=gClSfVwnlH6LRXDb5USxCJl0dTk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j3THSuWmB8yY8AaU0KXhCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=bernhard%20fernow&amp;f=false |title=A Century of Forest Resources Education at Penn State: Serving Our Forests ... - Henry D.

It was one of three forestry schools in the nation in 1903, after Yale and Biltmore, respectively.

In 1910, [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], the Dean of Cornell's Agriculture College, succeeded in having what remained of the Forestry College transferred to his school.  At his request, in 1911, the legislature appropriated $100,000 to construct a building to house the new Forestry Department on the Cornell campus, which Cornell later named [[Fernow Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Fernow Hall]]. That Forestry Department continues today as the Department of Natural Resources. In 1927, Cornell established a {{convert|1639|acre|km2|adj=on}} research forest south of Ithaca, the Arnot Woods.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

In 1911, the State Legislature established a [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at [[Syracuse University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not without opposition from Cornell University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B1FFA3B5F13738DDDAD0994DD405B838DF1D3&amp;scp=18&amp;sq=new%20york%20state%20college%20of%20forestry,syracuse&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=OPPOSES FORESTRY SCHOOL; Cornell Against $310,000 Appropriation for Syracuse Department | date=May 14, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the NYS [[Board of Regents]] questioned the need for duplicate, state-supported forestry programs at Cornell and Syracuse. A formal study resulted in an agreement in 1937 that the Syracuse program would be the only place for professional undergraduate training in forestry. Cornell's Department of Forestry continued with courses in "farm" forestry, to [[cooperative extension]] work in forestry, and to research and graduate education.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; In an exchange, [[Syracuse University]] agreed to abandon its School of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" - 1900-1919 |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2013/01/syracuse_universitys_history_a.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF's "primacy" among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies, but ESF does not have a veto power over competing new programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esf.edu/es/documents/GuidelinesforConsidofnewugDegreePgms6302000.pdf | title=Guidelines for Consideration of New Undergraduate Degree Programs in Environmental Science/Studies| accessdate=2010-12-18| author=Peter D.

==Forestry Studies continue at Cornell==

Forestry continued at Cornell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/bailey/cornellag/cornellag_9.html |title=Liberty Hyde Bailey - A Man for All Seasons |publisher=Rmc.library.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
with Dean [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] adding a Department of Forestry to  the [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell University]] in 1910-11.

Cornell’s vertebrate museum’s fishes collection is particularly strong with great diversity in North American fishes, and minnows in particular. Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s the fish collection was greatly expanded thanks to collections made by renowned Cornell ichthyologist Edward Raney and his students.

Following in the footsteps of the great [[botanist]] and [[horticulturist]], [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], a most extraordinary [[plant physiologist]], [[Frederick Campion Steward]], arrived to teach and conduct research at Cornell University in 1950, as Professor of Botany. From his Cornell classrooms and laboratories, Steward was responsible for creating and inspiring a generation of botanists.

In 1978, the [[Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]] relocated to the Ithaca campus from its original site in Yonkers, NY.

By [[Raphael Zon]], Director, Lake States Forest Experiment Station, United States Forest Service.
“Reprinted with revised Bibliography, 1927, from Appendix V of the Final Report of the National Waterways Commission, 1912. (Senate Document No. 469, 62d Congress, 2d Session)”

“Object of the Report”

“ Of all the direct influences of the forest the influence upon the supply of water in streams and upon the regularity of their flow is the most important in human economy. Yet so many are the factors which play related parts in this influence, so great is the difficulty of observing them with precision, and so wide the range of economic interests affected, that considerable divergence of opinion has arisen on the subject. This, however, if prompted by a sincere desire to reach the bottom of a complicated and vital problem, can only be productive of results of the highest scientific value.”

“ There is, perhaps no other problem facing the American people to-day which demands such care in the scientific accuracy of its data and conclusions as does the relation between forests and water. It is imperative, therefore, that no final conclusions be drawn in regard to this relation until ample, reliable, and critically revised evidence upon which to base them is available. A national policy which, though considering the direct value of forests as a source of timber, fails to take full account also of their influence upon erosion, the flow of streams, and climate, may easily endanger the well-being of the whole people.” (page 1)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/labs/awae_flagstaff/Hot_Topics/SierraAnchaEF/publications/hibbert_fortrtmnteffectswateryield.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2010, a gift of  "historic" proportions from the son of a New Jersey chicken farmer created the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]] at Cornell University, to position the university to be a global leader in the effort to create a [[sustainable]] future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablefuture.cornell.edu/index.php |title=Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future - Homepage |publisher=Sustainablefuture.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainability.cornell.edu/ |title=Cornell University - Sustainability |publisher=Sustainability.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $80 million gift is the single largest gift to the Ithaca campus from an individual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gold |first=Lauren |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct10/AtkinsonGift.html |title=Cornell Chronicle: $80M gift bolsters sustainability |publisher=News.cornell.edu |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the ''Ithaca Journal'' (10/28/2010), the largest gift ever given to a university for [[sustainability]] research and faculty support.

'''Officer training''' refers to the training that most [[military officer]]s must complete before acquiring an officer rank. A potential recruit becomes an [[officer cadet]], someone in training. An officer in training can either be trained in a [[Military academy|military college]], such as [[West Point]], or taken from the enlisted ranks. After this training is complete, the recruit in question becomes a fully fledged officer, taking on a commanding position in his or her military branch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11631">'''Peshat''' (also '''P'shat''', {{Hebrew|פשט}}) is one of four classical methods of Jewish biblical [[exegesis]] used by [[rabbis]] and Jewish bible scholars in reading the [[Hebrew Bible]], also known as the [[Tanakh]]. It is the first of the four exegetical methods known together as [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|PaRDeS]]. While Peshat is commonly defined as referring to the surface or literal (direct) meaning of a text,&lt;ref name="Goldin"&gt;Goldin, S. (2007). Unlocking the Torah Text: Bereishit. Gefen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-965-229-412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous scholars and rabbis have debated this for centuries, giving Peshat many uses and definitions.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel"&gt;Garfinkel, Stephen. "Clearing Peshat and Derash." Hebrew Bible/Old Testament - The History of Its Interpretation. Comp. Chris Brekelmans and Menahem Haran. Ed. Magne Sæbø. Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2000. 130-34. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==

Peshat, among the four methods which make up Pardes, is most often defined as "straight," in reference to its tendency to describe the meaning of the text apparent at face value, taking into account idiomatic expressions, and focusing mostly on literal interpretation. It is often considered the most straightforward method for reading and understanding of biblical text. In this way, Peshat differentiates itself from the other methods present in Pardes - Drash, Remez, and Sod, which look at what may be hidden in the text.

Linguistically, the term Peshat finds its root in the [[Biblical Hebrew]] term meaning "to flatten out," or "to extend."&lt;ref name="EJ"&gt;Rabinowitz, Louis Isaac. "Peshat." Encyclopaedia Judaica. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Vol. 16. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 8-9. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 5 Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the Talmudic Era, this definition was expanded to mean "to propound."&lt;ref name ="EJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabinowitz"&gt;Rabinowitz, Louis. "The Talmudic Meaning of Peshat." Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought 6.1 (1963). Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Often when defining Peshat, a quote from the [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] tractate of [[Talmud]] is referenced, stating "אין מקרא יוצא מידי פשוטו," or, "a text cannot be taken from the meaning of its peshat."&lt;ref name ="EJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Rabinowitz"/&gt; Some have used the Talmudic definition of Peshat to widen its overall definition, stating that the Peshat interpretation of a particular passage is "the teaching recognized by the public as obviously authoritative, since familiar and traditional," or "the usual accepted traditional meaning as it was generally taught."&lt;ref name ="EJ"/&gt; Based on the definitions provided by Talmud, it may be inferred that Peshat is solely a literal exegetical method. Others, though, have attributed this line of thought to the work of [[Rashi]], and that he strictly defined Peshat and Drash years later - often his definitions have been used to redact the meaning of Peshat within its Talmudic usage.&lt;ref name ="EJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Rabinowitz"/&gt;

Another linguistic curiosity can be seen in the difference between Peshat and the Hebrew verb Lamad (למד), meaning "to study." Peshat can be interpreted to mean a thorough and intensive learning of a text, rather than just a surface reading signified by Lamad.&lt;ref name ="Rabinowitz"/&gt; In this understanding of Peshat, the idea that it is only the literal meaning of a text is incorrect. Rather, Peshat would refer to what can be extracted from intensive study, while still maintaining the importance of the literal meaning of the text.&lt;ref name ="Rabinowitz"/&gt; Therefore, a slightly different definition of Peshat can be formed, specifically that Peshat should refer to the meaning of a text as was commonly taught and accepted, including, but not limited to, a literal interpretation.&lt;ref name ="Rabinowitz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Angel"&gt;Angel, Rabbi Hayyim. "From Black Fire to White Fire: Conversations about Religious Tanakh Methodology." The Institute for Jewish Ideas and Ideals. 4 Sept. 2008. Web. &lt;http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/black-fire-white-fire-conversations-about-religious-tanakh-methodology-rabbi-hayyim-angel&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of Peshat also note the importance of context, both historical and literary.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel"/&gt; This is in contrast to Drash, which will often take the text of a verse out of its context, for uses beyond the context such as ritual or moral purposes.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel"/&gt; However, this does not mean that Peshat and Drash are fully opposing methods. In fact, one may often be used in helping to explain the other, in finding and defining nuances in text that might be otherwise inexplicable without application of both methods.&lt;ref name="Goldin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel"/&gt;

== Rabbinic views and usage ==

[[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] is quoted in his writings as saying that the Rabbis of the Talmud were well-versed in Peshat, having built their [[Midrashic]] exegeses on it: "They [the talmudic rabbis] knew peshat better than all the generations that came after them."&lt;ref name="Lockshin"&gt;Lockshin, Martin I. "Lonely Man of Peshat." Jewish Quarterly Review 99.2 (2009): 291-300. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Rashbam]], felt that the early rabbis were not knowledgeable in Peshat, and instead used other strategies.&lt;ref name="Lockshin"/&gt; Consequently, these rabbis were led to opposing conclusions of the rabbis' halachic exegesis: Rashbam understood this as a separate type of exegesis from Peshat, while Ibn Ezra felt that the only proper exegesis would lead to his own conclusions, and therefore disregarded the midrashim of the Talmudic Rabbis as exegesis altogether.&lt;ref name="Lockshin"/&gt; Regardless of these differences in opinion in reference to the Rabbis of the Talmud, both Ibn Ezra and Rashbam favored and promoted Peshat as a superior alternative to Midrashic methods.&lt;ref name="Lockshin"/&gt;

One of Rashbam's students, Rabbi [[Eliezer of Beaugency]], is noted as completely removing Drash from his exegetical strategies, relying solely on Peshat. In comparison to Rashbam's tendency to explain how his views would contrast with those of Talmudic Rabbis, Rabbi Eliezer is not compelled to do so, feeling that Peshat is the only proper way to look at text.&lt;ref name="Berger1"&gt;Berger, Yitzhak. "The Contextual Exegesis of Rabbi Eliezer of Beaugency and the Climax of the Northern French Peshat Tradition." Jewish Studies Quarterly 15.2 (2008): 115-29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As Peshat's methods rely often on the importance of context, Rabbi Eliezer's commentaries are known for their tendency to focus on the context of a given verse or text. His commentaries are integrated with text, rather than sitting separate from them, and he insists on ensuring that no verse loses its context during his discussions, in comparison to other methods, such as the "verse-by-verse approach of Rashi"&lt;ref name="Berger1"/&gt;

[[David Kimhi]] (Radak) was also known for his ability in Peshat, and was influenced both by Ibn Ezra and Rashi. While Kimhi preferred Peshat methods over Derash, the influence of Rashi can be seen in some of his commentaries, in the inclusion of midrashic citations.&lt;ref name="Berger2"&gt;Berger, Yitzhak. "Peshat and the Authority of Ḥazal in the Commentaries of Radak." Association for Jewish Studies Review 31.1 (2007): 41-59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Kimhi lived among many famed proponents of Derash, such as Rabbi Moses the Preacher, who "undoubtedly had a substantial impact on Radak."&lt;ref name="Berger2"/&gt; Kimhi tended to go out of his way to reject the views of the Rabbis of the Talmud often, which has led to the theory that, although disagreeing with them, Kimhi fully acknowledged the tradition and authority of the Talmud Rabbis.&lt;ref name="Berger2"/&gt; In his commentaries, Kimhi labels his interpretation as Peshat, and that of the Talmudic Rabbis as Derash, creating a strict divide between the two in his writings.&lt;ref name="Berger2"/&gt;

A student of [[Saadiah Gaon]] is recorded as saying: "This is the sign by which you should know which comments well and which comments badly: Any commentator who first comments with ''peshuto shel mikra'' in concise language, and afterwards brings some of our rabbis' ''midrash'', this is a good commentary, and the reverse is [a] crude [commentary].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/divreyhayamim/divreyhayamim01.pdf Commentary attributed to a student of Saadiah Gaon], Chronicles 36:13. Hebrew וזה לך האות שתדע לשון המפרשים איזה מפרש בטוב ואיזה מפרש שלא בטוב: כל פרשן שמפרש תחלה פשוטו של מקרא בקצור לשון ואח"כ מביא קצת מדרש רבותינו זה פתרון טוב, וחלופיהן בגולם.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical and Talmudic examples ==

Below are several examples of Peshat's usage in the Bible and Talmud

: The Chaldeans formed three divisions and '''deployed (ויפשטו)''' around the camels and seized them. (Job 1:17)

: R. Kahana objected to Mar son of R. Huna: But this refers to the words of the Torah? A verse cannot depart from '''its plain meaning (פשוטו)''', he replied. R. Kahana said: By the time I was eighteen years old I had studied the whole Talmud, yet I did not know that a verse cannot depart from '''its plain meaning (פשוטו)''' until today. What does he inform us? That a man should study and subsequently understand. (Talmud, Tractate Shabbat, Folio 63a)

: Others say: According to the Rabbis no question arises, for since the text has once been torn away from '''its ordinary meaning (פשוטו)''' it must in all respects so remain. (Talmud, Tractate Yevamot, Folio 11b)

: Said Raba: Although throughout the Torah no text loses '''its ordinary meaning (פשוטו)''', here the gezerah shawah has come and entirely deprived the text of '''its ordinary meaning (פשוטו)'''. (Talmud, Tractate Yevamot, Folio 24a)

: If the master of the house '''stretches (פשט)''' his hand. (Talmud, Tractate Shabbat, Folio 2a)

'''Sir Peter Paul Rubens''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|uː|b|ən|z}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rubens "Rubens"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-nl|ˈrybə(n)s|lang}}; 28 June 1577 – 30 May 1640) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] artist. He is considered the most influential artist of [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] tradition. Rubens' highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, color, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and [[history painting]]s of mythological and allegorical subjects.

In addition to running a large studio in [[Antwerp]] that produced paintings popular with nobility and art collectors throughout Europe, Rubens was a classically educated [[Renaissance humanism|humanist scholar]] and diplomat who was [[knight]]ed by both [[Philip IV of Spain]] and [[Charles I of England]]. Rubens was a prolific artist. The catalogue of his works by [[Michael Jaffé]] lists 1,403 pieces, excluding numerous copies made in his workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/1979/153/1/doctoraat.pdf Nico Van Hout, 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;

His commissioned works were mostly "[[history painting]]s", which included religious and mythological subjects, and hunt scenes. He painted portraits, especially of friends, and self-portraits, and in later life painted several landscapes. Rubens designed tapestries and prints, as well as his own house. He also oversaw the [[ephemeral]] decorations of the [[royal entry]] into Antwerp by the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria]] in 1635.

His drawings are predominantly very forceful and without great detail. He also made great use of [[oil sketch]]es as preparatory studies.  He was one of the last major artists to make consistent use of [[panel painting|wooden panels]] as a support medium, even for very large works, but he used [[canvas]] as well, especially when the work needed to be sent a long distance. For [[altarpiece]]s he sometimes painted on [[slate]] to reduce reflection problems.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
[[File:GARDENS IN THE RUBENS HOUSE - ANTWERP.jpg|thumb|The garden designed by Rubens at the [[Rubenshuis]] in [[Antwerpen]]]]

Rubens was born in the city of [[Siegen]] to [[Jan Rubens]] and [[Maria Pypelincks]]. He was named in honour of [[Saint Peter]] and [[Saint Paul]], because he was born on [[Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul|their solemnity]].&lt;ref&gt;Historische levensbeschryving van P.P. Rubens Door Jean Francois Marie Michel. p.14&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], and mother fled Antwerp for [[Cologne]] in 1568, after increased religious turmoil and persecution of [[Protestant]]s during the rule of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] by [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd&amp;nbsp;Duke of Alba|the Duke of Alba]].

Jan Rubens became the legal adviser (and lover) of [[Anna of Saxony]], the second wife of [[William the Silent|William&amp;nbsp;I of Orange]], and settled at her court in Siegen in 1570, fathering her daughter Christine who was born in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;H. C. Erik Midelfort, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dDu1OHSZ1_8C&amp;pg=PA58 "Mad Princes of Renaissance Germany"], page 58, University of Virginia Press, 22 January 1996. Retrieved 2 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Jan Rubens' imprisonment for the affair, Peter Paul Rubens was born in 1577. The family returned to Cologne the next year. In 1589, two years after his father's death, Rubens moved with his mother Maria Pypelincks to Antwerp, where he was raised as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]].

Religion figured prominently in much of his work, and Rubens later became one of the leading voices of the Catholic Counter-Reformation style of painting&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 11–18.&lt;/ref&gt; (he had said "My passion comes from the heavens, not from earthly musings").

=== Apprenticeship ===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Portrait of a Young Scholar - WGA20349.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of a Young Scholar'', from 1597]]

In Antwerp, Rubens received a [[Renaissance humanist]] education, studying Latin and classical literature. By fourteen he began his artistic apprenticeship with [[Tobias Verhaeght]]. Subsequently, he studied under two of the city's leading painters of the time, the late [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists [[Adam van Noort]] and [[Otto van Veen]].&lt;ref&gt;Held (1983): 14–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his earliest training involved copying earlier artists' works, such as [[woodcut]]s by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s [[engraving]]s after [[Raphael]]. Rubens completed his education in 1598, at which time he entered the [[Guild of St. Luke]] as an independent master.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 22–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy (1600–1608) ===
In 1600 Rubens travelled to Italy. He stopped first in [[Venice]], where he saw paintings by [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], and [[Tintoretto]], before settling in [[Mantua]] at the court of Duke [[Vincenzo I of Gonzaga|Vincenzo&amp;nbsp;I Gonzaga]]. The colouring and compositions of [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and Tintoretto had an immediate effect on Rubens's painting, and his later, mature style was profoundly influenced by [[Titian]].&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 42; 57.&lt;/ref&gt; With financial support from the Duke, Rubens travelled to [[Rome]] by way of [[Florence]] in 1601. There, he studied classical Greek and Roman art and copied works of the Italian masters.  The [[Hellenistic]] sculpture ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' was especially influential on him, as was the art of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 52–57&lt;/ref&gt; He was also influenced by the recent, highly naturalistic paintings by [[Caravaggio]].

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - The Fall of Phaeton (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|''[[The Fall of Phaeton (Rubens)|The Fall of Phaeton]]'', 1604, in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.]]

Rubens later made a copy of Caravaggio's ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]'' and recommended his patron, the Duke of Mantua, to purchase [[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|''The Death of the Virgin'']] ([[Louvre]]).&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 59.&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to Antwerp he was instrumental in the acquisition of [[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|''The Madonna of the Rosary'']] ([[Kunsthistorisches Museum|Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]]) for the [[St. Paul's Church, Antwerp|St. Paul's Church]] in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Sirjacobs, Raymond. ''Antwerpen Sint-Pauluskerk: Rubens En De Mysteries Van De Rozenkrans = Rubens Et Les Mystères Du Rosaire = Rubens and the Mysteries of the Rosary'', Antwerpen: Sint-Paulusvrienden, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  During this first stay in Rome, Rubens completed his first altarpiece commission, ''St.&amp;nbsp;Helena with the True Cross'' for the Roman church of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]].

Rubens travelled to Spain on a diplomatic mission in 1603, delivering gifts from the Gonzagas to the court of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip&amp;nbsp;III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Medici Grand Duchy and Rubens' First Trip to Spain|last = Rosen|first = Mark|journal = Oud Holland|issue = Vol. 121, No. 2/3|year = 2008|pages = 147–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he studied the extensive collections of Raphael and Titian that had been collected by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 71–73&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted an equestrian portrait of the [[Francisco Goméz de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma|Duke of Lerma]] during his stay (Prado, Madrid) that demonstrates the influence of works like Titian's ''[[:File:Tizian 082.jpg|Charles V at Mühlberg]]'' (1548; Prado, Madrid). This journey marked the first of many during his career that combined art and diplomacy.

He returned to Italy in 1604, where he remained for the next four years, first in Mantua and then in [[Genoa]] and Rome. In Genoa, Rubens painted numerous portraits, such as the ''[[:File:Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria.jpg|Marchesa Brigida Spinola-Doria]]'' (National Gallery of Art, Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C.), and the portrait of Maria di Antonio Serra Pallavicini, in a style that influenced later paintings by [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Joshua Reynolds]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough]].&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rubens Madonna on Floral Wreath.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Madonna on Floral Wreath'', together with Jan Brueghel the Elder, 1619]]

He also began a book illustrating the palaces in the city, which was published in 1622 as ''[[Palazzi di Genova]]''. From 1606 to 1608, he was mostly in Rome. During this period Rubens received, with the assistance of Cardinal Jacopo Serra (the brother of Maria Pallavicini), his most important commission to date for the High Altar of the city's most fashionable new church, [[Santa Maria in Vallicella]] also known as the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]].

The subject was to be [[St. Gregory the Great|St.&amp;nbsp;Gregory the Great]] and important local saints adoring an [[icon]] of the Virgin and Child. The first version, a single canvas (now at the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Grenoble), was immediately replaced by a second version on three slate panels that permits the actual miraculous holy image of the "Santa Maria in Vallicella" to be revealed on important feast days by a removable copper cover, also painted by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffé (1977): 85–99; Belting (1994): 484–90, 554–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens' experiences in Italy continued to influence his work. He continued to write many of his letters and correspondences in Italian, signed his name as "Pietro Paolo Rubens", and spoke longingly of returning to the peninsula—a hope that never materialized.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antwerp (1609–1621) ===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens Peter Paul Rubens - The Artist and His First Wife, Isabella Brant, in the Honeysuckle Bower.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rubens and [[Isabella Brandt]], the [[Honeysuckle Bower]]'', c. 1609. [[Alte Pinakothek]]]]

Upon hearing of his mother's illness in 1608, Rubens planned his departure from Italy for Antwerp. However, she died before he arrived home. His return coincided with a period of renewed prosperity in the city with the signing of the [[Treaty of Antwerp (1609)|Treaty of Antwerp]] in April 1609, which initiated the [[Twelve Years' Truce]]. In September 1609 Rubens was appointed as court painter by [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]], sovereigns of the [[Low Countries]].

He received special permission to base his studio in Antwerp instead of at their court in [[Brussels]], and to also work for other clients. He remained close to the Archduchess Isabella until her death in 1633, and was called upon not only as a painter but also as an ambassador and diplomat. Rubens further cemented his ties to the city when, on 3 October 1609, he married [[Isabella Brandt]], the daughter of a leading Antwerp citizen and humanist, Jan Brandt.

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Descent from the Cross - WGA20230.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Descent from the Cross]]'', 1618. [[Hermitage Museum]]]]

In 1610 Rubens moved into a new house and studio that he designed. Now the [[Rubenshuis]] Museum, the Italian-influenced villa in the centre of Antwerp accommodated his workshop, where he and his apprentices made most of the paintings, and his personal art collection and library, both among the most extensive in Antwerp. During this time he built up a studio with numerous students and assistants. His most famous pupil was the young [[Anthony van Dyck]], who soon became the leading Flemish portraitist and collaborated frequently with Rubens. He also often collaborated with the many specialists active in the city, including the animal painter [[Frans Snyders]], who contributed the eagle to ''[[Prometheus Bound (Rubens)|Prometheus Bound]]'' (c. 1611-12, completed by 1618), and his good friend the flower-painter [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]].

Another house was built by Rubens to the north of Antwerp in the [[polder]] village of [[Doel]], "Hooghuis" (1613/1643), perhaps as an investment. The "High House" was built next to the village church.

Altarpieces such as ''[[The Elevation of the Cross (Rubens)|The Raising of the Cross]]'' (1610) and ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rubens)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' (1611–1614) for the [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|Cathedral of Our Lady]] were particularly important in establishing Rubens as Flanders' leading painter shortly after his return. ''The Raising of the Cross'', for example, demonstrates the artist's synthesis of [[:File:Jacopo Tintoretto 021.jpg|Tintoretto's ''Crucifixion'']] for the [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]] in Venice, [[Michelangelo]]'s dynamic figures, and Rubens' own personal style. This painting has been held as a prime example of Baroque religious art.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1977): 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens used the production of [[Old master print|prints]] and book title-pages, especially for his friend [[Balthasar Moretus]], the owner of the large [[Plantin Press|Plantin-Moretus publishing house]], to extend his fame throughout Europe during this part of his career. In 1618, Rubens embarked upon a printmaking enterprise by soliciting an unusual triple privilege (an early form of [[copyright]]) to protect his designs in France, the Southern Netherlands, and United Provinces.&lt;ref name=Hottle&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek|last=Hottle|first=Andrew D.|title=Commerce and Connections: Peter Paul Rubens and the Dedicated Print|volume=55|year=2004|pages=54–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enlisted [[Lucas Vorsterman]] to engrave a number of his notable religious and mythological paintings, to which Rubens appended personal and professional dedications to noteworthy individuals in the Southern Netherlands, United Provinces, England, France, and Spain.&lt;ref name=Hottle/&gt; With the exception of few [[etching]]s, Rubens left the [[printmaking]] to specialists, who included Lucas Vorsterman, [[Paulus Pontius]] and [[Willem Panneels]].&lt;ref&gt;Pauw-De Veen (1977): 243–251.&lt;/ref&gt; He recruited a number of engravers trained by [[Christoffel Jegher]], who he carefully schooled in the more vigorous style he wanted. Rubens also designed the last significant [[woodcut]]s before the 19th-century revival in the technique.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no.427–32, {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marie de' Medici Cycle and diplomatic missions (1621–1630) ===
{{Main|Marie de' Medici cycle}}

In 1621, the Queen Mother of France, [[Marie de' Medici]], commissioned Rubens to paint two large allegorical cycles celebrating her life and the life of her late husband, [[Henry IV of France|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]], for the [[Luxembourg Palace]] in Paris. The [[Marie de' Medici cycle]] (now in the Louvre) was installed in 1625, and although he began work on the second series it was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 175; 192; Held (1975): 218–233, esp. pp. 222–225.&lt;/ref&gt; Marie was exiled from France in 1630 by her son, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], and died in 1642 in the same house in Cologne where Rubens had lived as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anna of Austria by Rubens (1622-1625, Norton Simon Museum).jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of [[Anne of Austria|Anna of Austria]]'', Queen of France, c.1622–1625]]

After the end of the Twelve Years' Truce in 1621, the Spanish [[Habsburg]] rulers entrusted Rubens with a number of diplomatic missions.&lt;ref name="peace"&gt;Belkin (1998): 199–228.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Paris in 1622 to discuss the Marie de' Medici cycle, Rubens engaged in clandestine information gathering activities, which at the time was an important task of diplomats.  He relied on his friendship with [[Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc]] to get information on political developments in France.&lt;ref&gt;Auwers: p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1627 and 1630, Rubens' diplomatic career was particularly active, and he moved between the courts of Spain and England in an attempt to bring peace between the Spanish Netherlands and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].  He also made several trips to the northern Netherlands as both an artist and a diplomat.

At the courts he sometimes encountered the attitude that courtiers should not use their hands in any art or trade, but he was also received as a gentleman by many.  Rubens was raised by Philip&amp;nbsp;IV of Spain to the nobility in 1624 and knighted by Charles I of England in 1630.  Philip IV confirmed Rubens' status as a knight a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Auwers: p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rubens was awarded an honorary [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree from [[Cambridge University]] in 1629.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 339–340&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens was in Madrid for eight months in 1628–1629. In addition to diplomatic negotiations, he executed several important works for Philip&amp;nbsp;IV and private patrons. He also began a renewed study of Titian's paintings, copying numerous works including the Madrid ''Fall of Man'' (1628–29).&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 210–218.&lt;/ref&gt; During this stay, he befriended the court painter [[Diego Velázquez]] and the two planned to travel to Italy together the following year. Rubens, however, returned to Antwerp and Velázquez made the journey without him.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 004.jpg|thumb|''[[The Fall of Man (Rubens)|The Fall of Man]]'', 1628–29. Prado, Madrid]]

His stay in Antwerp was brief, and he soon travelled on to London where he remained until April 1630. An important work from this period is the ''Allegory of Peace and War'' (1629; [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], London).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng46 |title=Minerva protects Pax from Mars ('Peace and War') |accessdate=15 October 2010 |publisher=[[The National Gallery]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531113432/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG46 |archivedate=31 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It illustrates the artist's lively concern for peace, and was given to Charles I as a gift.

While Rubens' international reputation with collectors and nobility abroad continued to grow during this decade, he and his workshop also continued to paint monumental paintings for local patrons in Antwerp. The ''[[Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Rubens)|Assumption of the Virgin Mary]]'' (1625–6) for the Cathedral of Antwerp is one prominent example.

=== Last decade (1630–1640) ===
Rubens's last decade was spent in and around Antwerp. Major works for foreign patrons still occupied him, such as the ceiling paintings for the [[Banqueting House at Whitehall|Banqueting House]] at [[Inigo Jones]]'s [[Palace of Whitehall]], but he also explored more personal artistic directions.

In 1630, four years after the death of his first wife Isabella, the 53-year-old painter married his first wife's niece, the 16-year-old [[Hélène Fourment]]. Hélène inspired the voluptuous figures in many of his paintings from the 1630s, including ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 117.jpg|The Feast of Venus]]'' (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 026.jpg|The Three Graces]]'' and ''[[The Judgement of Paris (Rubens)|The Judgment of Paris]]'' (both Prado, Madrid). In the latter painting, which was made for the Spanish court, the artist's young wife was recognized by viewers in the figure of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. In an intimate portrait of her, ''Hélène Fourment in a Fur Wrap'', also known as ''[[Het Pelsken]]'', Rubens' wife is even partially modelled after classical sculptures of the [[Venus Pudica]], such as the [[Venus de' Medici|Medici Venus]].

In 1635, Rubens bought an estate outside Antwerp, the [[Elewijt Castle|Steen]], where he spent much of his time. Landscapes, such as his ''[[Château de Steen with Hunter]]'' (National Gallery, London) and ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 102.jpg|Farmers Returning from the Fields]]'' (Pitti Gallery, Florence), reflect the more personal nature of many of his later works. He also drew upon the Netherlandish traditions of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] for inspiration in later works like ''[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens 014.jpg|Flemish Kermis]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1630; Louvre, Paris).

=== Death ===
Rubens died from heart failure, a result of his chronic [[gout]], on 30 May 1640. He was interred in [[Saint James' Church, Antwerp]]. His epitaph read:&lt;ref&gt;Antwerpen - Parochiekerken ; 1. Afdeeling, Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

His nudes of various biblical and mythological women are especially well-known. Painted in the Baroque tradition of depicting women as soft-bodied, passive, and highly sexualized beings, his nudes emphasize the concepts of fertility, desire, physical beauty, temptation, and virtue. Skillfully rendered, these paintings of nude women were undoubtedly created to appeal to his largely male audience of patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=431556|title=Review on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Rubens was quite fond of painting full-figured women, giving rise to terms like 'Rubensian' or 'Rubenesque' (sometimes 'Rubensesque'). And while the [[male gaze]] features heavily in Rubens's paintings of females generally, he brings multi-layered allegory and symbolism to his portraits.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424300308.html|title=Gender in Art – Dictionary definition of Gender in Art {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His large-scale cycle representing Marie de Medicis focuses on several classic female archetypes like the virgin, consort, wife, widow, and diplomatic regent.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3177384|title=Rubens's France: Gender and Personification in the Marie de Médicis Cycle on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of this iconography in his female portraits, along with his art depicting noblewomen of the day, serve to elevate his female portrait sitters to the status and importance of his male portrait sitters.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Rubens's depiction of males is equally stylized, replete with meaning, and quite the opposite of his female subjects. His male nudes represent highly athletic and large mythical or biblical men. Unlike his female nudes, most of his male nudes are depicted partially nude, with sashes, armour, or shadows shielding them from being completely unclothed. These men are twisting, reaching, bending, and grasping: all of which portrays his male subjects engaged in a great deal of physical, sometimes aggressive, action. The concepts Rubens artistically represents illustrate the male as powerful, capable, forceful and compelling. The allegorical and symbolic subjects he painted reference the classic masculine tropes of athleticism, high achievement, valour in war, and civil authority.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Male archetypes readily found in Rubens's paintings include the hero, husband, father, civic leader, king, and the battle weary.

Rubens was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci's work. Using an engraving done 50 years after Leonardo started his project on the Battle of Anghiari, Rubens did a masterly drawing of the Battle which is now in the Louvre in Paris. "The idea that an ancient copy of a lost artwork can be as important as the original is familiar to scholars," says Salvatore Settis, archaeologist and art historian.

Paintings from Rubens' workshop can be divided into three categories: those he painted by himself, those he painted in part (mainly hands and faces), and those he only supervised as other painters produced them from his drawings or [[oil sketch]]es. He had, as was usual at the time, a large workshop with many apprentices and students, some of whom, such as [[Anthony van Dyck]], became famous in their own right. He also often sub-contracted elements such as animals or [[still-life]] in large compositions to specialists such as [[Frans Snyders]], or other artists such as [[Jacob Jordaens]].

A J Clark was the first to quantify drug-induced biological responses (using an equation described f-mediated receptor activation. So far, nearly all of the quantitative theoretical modelling of receptor function has centred on [[ligand-gated ion channels]] and [[GPCR]]s.&lt;ref name="Rang2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rang HP |title=The receptor concept: pharmacology's big idea |journal=Br.

==History==

===The receptor concept===
In 1901, Langley challenged the [[Scientific hypothesis|dominant hypothesis]] that drugs act at nerve endings by demonstrating that nicotine acted at sympathetic ganglia even after the degeneration of the severed preganglionic nerve endings.&lt;ref&gt;Langley J. On the stimulation and paralysis of nerve cells and of nerve-endings. Part 1. ''J Physiol'' 1901 October 16; 27(3): 224–236.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he introduced the concept of a receptive substance on the surface of skeletal muscle that mediated the action of a drug. It also postulated that these receptive substances were different in different species (citing the fact that nicotine-induced muscle paralysis in mammals was absent in crayfish).&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Langley. On the reaction of cells and of nerve-endings to certain poisons, chiefly as regards the reaction of striated muscle to nicotine and to curare. ''J Physiol'' 1905; 33: 374–413.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, [[Paul Ehrlich|Ehrlich]] was trying to understand the basis of selectivity of agents.&lt;ref name=LEL2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Limbird LE |title=The receptor concept: a continuing evolution |journal=Mol. Interv. |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=326–36 |year=2004 |pmid=15616162 |doi=10.1124/mi.4.6.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that selectivity was the basis of a preferential distribution of lead and dyes in different body tissues. However, he later modified the theory in order to explain immune reactions and the selectivity of the immune response.&lt;ref name=LEL2004/&gt; Thinking that selectivity was derived from interaction with the tissues themselves, Ehrlich envisaged molecules extending from cells that the body could use to distinguish and mount an immune response to foreign objects. However, it was only when Ahlquist showed the differential action of adrenaline demonstrated its effects on two distinct receptor populations, did the theory of receptor-mediated drug interactions gain acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahlquist | first1 = R.P. | year = 1948 | title = A study of the adrenotrophic receptors | url = | journal = Am J Physiol | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 586–600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.E.

===Nature of receptor–drug interactions===

====Receptor occupancy model====
The receptor occupancy model, which describes agonist and competitive antagonists, was built on the work of Langley, [[Archibald Hill|Hill]], and Clark. The occupancy model was the first model put forward by Clark to explain the activity of drugs at receptors and quantified the relationship between drug concentration and observed effect. It is based on mass-action kinetics and attempts to link the action of a drug to the proportion of receptors occupied by that drug at equilibrium.&lt;ref name="CA1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Christopoulos A, El-Fakahany EE |title=Qualitative and quantitative assessment of relative agonist efficacy |journal=Biochem. Pharmacol. |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=735–48 |year=1999 |pmid=10449182 |doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00087-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.M Ross, and T.P. Kenakin. (2001) Pharmacodynamics. Mechanisms of drug action and the relationship between drug concentration and effect. In Goodman &amp; Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Vol. Tenth. J.G. Hardman &amp; L.E. Limbird, Eds. McGraw-Hill. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the magnitude of the response is directly proportional to the amount of drug bound, and the maximum response would be elicited once all receptors were occupied at equilibrium. He applied mathematical approaches used in enzyme kinetics systematically to the effects of chemicals on tissues.&lt;ref name=TK04/&gt;
He showed that for many drugs, the relationship between drug concentration and biological effect corresponded to a hyperbolic curve, similar to that representing the adsorption of a gas onto a metal surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Quirke V |title=Putting theory into practice: James Black, receptor theory and the development of the beta-blockers at ICI, 1958-1978 |journal=Med Hist |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=69–92 |year=2006 |pmid=16502872 |doi= 10.1017/s0025727300009455|pmc=1369014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fitted the [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill–Langmuir equation]].&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; Clark, together with [[John Gaddum|Gaddum]], was the first to introduce the [[Dose-response relationship#Dose–response curve|log concentration–effect curve]] and described the now-familiar 'parallel shift' of the log concentration–effect curve produced by a competitive antagonist.&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; Attempts to separate the binding phenomenon and activation phenomenon were made by [[Everhardus Jacobus Ariëns|Ariëns]] in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding).&lt;ref name="CA1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maehle AH, Prüll CR, Halliwell RF 2002 637–41"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maehle AH, Prüll CR, Halliwell RF |title=The emergence of the drug receptor theory |journal=Nature Reviews.

=====Competitive inhibition models=====

The development of the classic theory of drug antagonism by Gaddum, Schild and Arunlakshana built on the work of Langley, [[Archibald Hill|Hill]] and Clark.&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"&gt;D.

Rang, Editor, Drug Receptors, Macmillan Press (1973), pp. 149–182. http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc-bits/colquhoun-1973.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gaddum|Gaddum]] described a model for the competitive binding of two ligands to the same receptor in short communication to the Physiological Society in 1937. The description referred only to binding, it was not immediately useful for the analysis of experimental measurements of the effects of antagonists on the response to agonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colquhoun D |title=The quantitative analysis of drug-receptor interactions: a short history |journal=Trends Pharmacol. Sci. |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=149–57 |year=2006 |pmid=16483674 |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2006.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Heinz Otto Schild who made measurement of the equilibrium constant for the binding of an antagonist possible.  He developed the [[Schild regression|Schild equation]] to determine a dose ratio, a measure of the potency of a drug. In Schild regression, the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of an agonist alone compared to the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of a competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve used to determine the affinity of an antagonist for its receptor.

=====Agonist models=====

The flaw in Clark's receptor-occupancy model was that it was insufficient to explain the concept of [[agonist|partial agonist]] lead to the development of agonist models of drug action by Ariens in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding).&lt;ref name="colquhoun1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maehle AH, Prüll CR, Halliwell RF 2002 637–41"/&gt;

===Two-state receptor theory===

The two-state model is a simple linear model to describe the interaction between a ligand and its receptor, but also the active receptor (R&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="bridges2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bridges TM, Lindsley CW |title=G-Protein-Coupled Receptors: From Classical Modes of Modulation to Allosteric Mechanisms |journal=ACS Chem. Biol. |volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 530–41|date=July 2008 |pmid=18652471 |doi=10.1021/cb800116f |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model uses an equilibrium dissociation constant to describe the interaction between ligand and receptor.  It proposes that ligand binding results in a change in receptor state from an inactive to an active state based on the [[Protein structure|receptor's conformation]]. A receptor in its active state will ultimately elicit its biological response. It was first described by Black and Leff in 1983 as an alternative model of receptor activation.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Black and P. Leff. (1983) Operational Models of Pharmacological Agonism. In: ''Proc. R. Soc. London Ser.'' B 220, pp. 141–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the receptor occupancy model, the theory originated from earlier work by del Castillo &amp; Katz on observations relating to ligand-gated ion channels.&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; In this model, [[agonists]] and [[inverse agonists]] are thought to have selective binding affinity for the pre-existing resting and active states&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leff P |title=The two-state model of receptor activation |journal=Trends Pharmacol. Sci. |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=89–97 |year=1995 |pmid=7540781 |doi=10.1016/S0165-6147(00)88989-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or can induce a conformational change to a different receptor state.  Whereas [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] have no preference in their affinity for a receptor state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Giraldo J |title=Agonist induction, conformational selection, and mutant receptors |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=556 |issue=1-3 |pages=13–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14706818 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(03)01404-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vauquelin G, Van Liefde I |title=G protein-coupled receptors: a count of 1001 conformations |journal=Fundamental &amp; clinical pharmacology |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=45–56 |year=2005 |pmid=15660959 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-8206.2005.00319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that receptor conformation (state) would affect binding affinity of a ligand was used to explain a mechanism of partial agonism of receptors by del Castillo &amp; Katz in 1957 was based on their work on the action of acetylcholine at the motor endplate&lt;ref name="Rang2006"/&gt; build on similar work by Wyman &amp; Allen in 1951 on conformational-induced changes in hemoglobin's oxygen binding affinity occurring as a result of oxygen binding.&lt;ref name="Colquhoun1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Colquhoun D |title=Binding, gating, affinity and efficacy: the interpretation of structure-activity relationships for agonists and of the effects of mutating receptors |journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. |volume=125 |issue=5 |pages=924–47 |year=1998 |pmid=9846630 |doi= 10.1038/sj.bjp.0702164|url= |pmc=1565672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The del Castillo-Katz mechanism divorces the binding step (that can be made by agonists as well as antagonists) from the receptor activation step (that can be only exerted by agonists), describing them as two independent events.&lt;ref name="Colquhoun1998"/&gt;

===Ternary complex model===
The original Ternary complex model was used to describe ligand, receptor, and G-protein interactions.  It uses equilibrium dissociation constants for the interactions between the receptor and each ligand (K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; for ligand A; K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; for ligand B), as well as a cooperativity factor (α) that denotes the mutual effect of the two ligands on each other’s affinity for the receptor. An α &gt; 1.0 refers to positive allosteric modulation, an α &lt; 1.0 refers to negative allosteric modulation, and an α = 1.0 means that binding of either ligand to the receptor does not alter the affinity of the other ligand for the receptor (i.e., a neutral modulator).&lt;ref name="bridges2008"/&gt; Further, the α parameter can be added as a subtle but highly useful extension to the ATCM in order to include effects of an allosteric modulator on the efficacy (as distinct from the affinity) of another ligand that binds the receptor, such as the orthosteric agonist. Some ligands can reduce the efficacy but increase the affinity of the orthosteric agonist for the receptor.&lt;ref name="bridges2008"/&gt;

Although it is a simple assumption that the proportional amount of an active receptor state should correlate with the biological response, the experimental evidence for receptor overexpression and spare receptors suggests that the calculation of the net change in the active receptor state is a much better measure for response than is the fractional or proportional change. This is demonstrated by the effects of agonist/ antagonist combinations on the desensitization of receptors. This is also demonstrated by receptors that are activated by overexpression, since this requires a change between R and R* that is difficult to understand in terms of a proportional rather than a net change, and for the molecular model that fits with the mathematical model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-balance.com/ijp.pdf Optimal Agonist/Antagonist Combinations Maintain Receptor Response by Preventing Rapid β-adrenergic Receptor Desensitization | BIO BALANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-balance.com/JMGM_article.pdf Molecular dynamics of a biophysical model for b2-adrenergic and G protein-coupled receptor activation | BIO BALANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-balance.com/Graphics.htm The Biophysical Basis for the Graphical Representations | BIO BALANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postulates of receptor theory==
*[[Receptor (biochemistry)|Receptors]] must possess structural and steric specificity.
*Receptors are [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturable]] and finite (limited number of binding sites)
*Receptors must possess high [[Dissociation constant#Protein-ligand binding|affinity]] for its endogenous ligand at physiological concentrations
*Once the endogenous ligand binds to the receptor, some early recognizable chemical event must occur

[[Image:Saltman2.jpg|thumb|Left shoe with lower leg of Salt Man 1]]
The '''Saltmen''' were discovered in the [[Chehrabad]] salt mines, located on the southern part of the Hamzehlu village, on the west side of the city of [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]], in the [[Zanjan Province]] in  [[Iran]]. By 2010, the remains of six men had been discovered, most of them accidentally killed by the collapse of galleries in which they were working.&lt;ref name="Aali2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Aali | first =Abolfazl | author-link = | last2 =Stöllner | first2 =Thomas | author2-link = | last3 =Abar | first3 =Aydin | author3-link = | last4 =Rühli | first4 =Frank | author4-link = | title = The Salt Men of Iran: The Salt Mine of Douzlākh, Chehrābād  | journal = Archäologisches Korrespondenzblatt | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–81 | publisher = Verlag des Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseums | location = Mainz | year = 2012 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = 0342-734X | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The head and left foot of Salt Man 1 are on display at the [[National Museum of Iran]] in [[Tehran]].

== Discovery ==
In the winter of 1993, miners came across a body with long [[hair]], a [[beard]] and some [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s. These included the remains of a body, a lower leg inside a [[leather]] [[boot]], three [[iron]] [[knife|knives]], a [[wool]]len half trouser, a [[silver]] [[Sewing needle|needle]], a [[sling (weapon)|sling]], parts of a leather [[rope]], a [[grindstone (tool)|grindstone]], a [[walnut]], some [[pottery]] shards, some patterned [[textile]] fragments, and a few broken [[bone]]s. The body had been buried in the middle of a tunnel approximately 45 metres in length.

In 2004, another salt miner found the remains of a second man. During archaeological excavations in 2005, the remains of another two well-preserved men were found. In 2006, the Iranian Cultural Heritage News Agency partnered with [[German Mining Museum]] in [[Bochum]] ([[Germany]]), in 2007 with [[University of Oxford]] and the Swiss [[University of Zurich]] for thorough investigations. A scientific long-term project was started, supported by [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (DFG) and British funds.&lt;ref name="Aali2012"/&gt; Four corpses, including a teenager and a woman, are kept at the Archeology Museum (Zolfaghari House) in Zanjan. A sixth corpse found in the excavation campaign 2010 was left in place at the salt mine. Three hundred pieces of fabric were found, some of which retained designs and dyes. In 2008, the Ministry of Industries and Mines canceled the mining permit.&lt;ref name=phsmoi&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.pasthorizons.com/index.php/archives/06/2011/salt-men-of-iran | title = Salt men of Iran |date = June 7, 2011 | publisher = Past Horizons | accessdate = June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
After archaeological studies which included [[Radiocarbon dating|C14 dating]] of different samples of bones and textiles, the Salt Man was dated to about 1,700 years ago. By testing a sample of hair, the [[Human blood group systems|blood group]] B+ was determined.

Visual characteristics included long hair and a beard, and a golden earring on the left ear indicated that he was likely a person of rank or influence. The reason for his presence and death in the salt mine of Chehrabad remains a mystery.

Three bodies are dated to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] (247 BCE–224 CE) and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] (224–651 CE) eras, and the remainder to the [[Achaemenid Dynasty]] (550–330 BCE).&lt;ref name=phsmoi/&gt;

The terms '''signified and signifier''' are most commonly related to [[semiotics]], which is defined by [[Oxford Dictionaries Online]] as "the study of signs and symbols and their use or interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Oxforddictionaries.com]]|title=definition of semiotics|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/semiotics?q=semiotic#semiotics__8 |accessdate= 18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist, was one of the two founders of semiotics. His book, ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' "is considered to be one of the most influential books published in the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2013, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure explained that a sign was not only a sound-image but also a concept. Thus he divided the sign into two components: the signifier (or "sound-image") and the signified (or "concept").&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; For Saussure, the signified and signifier were purely psychological; they were form rather than substance. Today, following [[Louis_Hjelmslev|Hjelmslev]], the signifier is interpreted as the material form (something which can be seen, heard, touched, smelled or tasted) and the signified as the mental concept.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, 2017, pp.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of signs has been around for a long time, having been studied by many philosophers who include [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine]], and others from the medieval period such as [[William of Ockham]]. The term "semiotics" "comes from the Greek root, seme, as in semeiotikos, an interpreter of signs".&lt;ref&gt;Cobley &amp; Jansz, 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the 20th century, however, that Saussure and American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] brought the term into awareness. While both Saussure and Peirce contributed greatly to the concept of signs, it is important to note that each differed in their approach to the study, and it was Saussure who created the terms signifier and signified in order to break down what a sign was.

Succeeding these founders were numerous philosophers and linguists who defined themselves as semioticians. These semioticians have each brought their own concerns to the study of signs. [[Umberto Eco]] (1976), a distinguished Italian semiotician, came to the conclusion that "if signs can be used to tell the truth, they can also be used to lie".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernist social theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] spoke of hyperreality, which referred to a copy becoming more real than reality. In other words, how the signified becomes more important than the signifier . Then French semiotician [[Roland Barthes]] used signs to explain the concept of connotation – cultural meanings attached to words – and denotation – literal or explicit meanings of words.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Without Saussure's breakdown of signs into signified and signifier, however, these semioticians would not have had anything to base their concepts on.

==About==
Today, "contemporary commentators tend to describe the signifier as the form that the sign takes and the signified as the concept to which it refers".&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, 2002, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the signifier and signified is an arbitrary relationship. In other words, "there is no logical connection" between them.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from a symbol, which is "never wholly arbitrary".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that both the signifier and the signified are inseparable is explained by Saussure's diagram, which shows how both components coincide to create the sign.

So the question is, how do signifiers create meaning and how do we know what that meaning is? In order to understand how the signifier and signified relate to each other, one must be able to interpret signs. "The only reason that the signifier does entail the signified is because there is a conventional relationship at play".&lt;ref&gt;Cobley &amp; Jansz, 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a sign can only be understood when the relationship between the two components that make up the sign are agreed upon. Saussure argued that a sign's "meaning depends on its relation to other words within the system" (for example, to understand an individual word such as "tree", one must also understand the word "bush" and how the two relate to each other).&lt;ref&gt; Chandler, 2002, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this difference from other signs that allows the possibility of a speech community.&lt;ref&gt; Cobley &amp; Jansz, 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; However we need to remember that signifiers and their significance change all the time, becoming "dated". It is in this way that we are all "practicing semioticians who pay a great deal of attention to signs… even though we may never have heard them before"&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; And while words are the most familiar form signs take, they stand for many things within life, such as advertisement, objects, body language, music, and so on. Therefore the use of signs, and the two components that make up a sign, can be and are – whether consciously or not – applied to everyday life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52398">'''Situated cognition''' is a theory that posits that knowing is inseparable from doing&lt;ref&gt;[[John Seely Brown]], Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Greeno, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; by arguing that all knowledge is situated in activity bound to social, cultural and physical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Greeno &amp; Moore, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this assumption, which requires an [[epistemological]] shift from empiricism, situativity theorists suggest a model of knowledge and learning that requires thinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of conceptual knowledge. In essence, cognition cannot be separated from the context. Instead knowing exists, ''in situ'', inseparable from context, activity, people, culture, and language. Therefore, learning is seen in terms of an individual's increasingly effective performance across situations rather than in terms of an accumulation of knowledge, since what is known is co-determined by the agent and the context. This perspective rejects [[mind–body dualism]], being conceptually similar to [[functional contextualism]], and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[behavior analysis]].

While situated cognition gained recognition in the field of [[educational psychology]] in the late twentieth century,&lt;ref name="Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989"&gt;Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; it shares many principles with older fields such as [[critical theory]], (Frankfurt School, 1930; Freire, 1968) [[anthropology]] ([[Jean Lave]] &amp; Wenger, 1991), philosophy ([[Martin Heidegger]], 1968), [[critical discourse analysis]] (Fairclough, 1989), and [[sociolinguistics]] theories ([[Bakhtin]], 1981) that rejected the notion of truly objective knowledge and the principles of Kantian [[empiricism]].

Lucy Suchman's work on situated action at Xerox Labs&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plans and situated actions: The problem of human-machine communication|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780521337397|location=Cambridge MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was instrumental in popularizing the idea that an actor's understanding of how to perform work results from reflecting on interactions with the social and material (e.g. technology-mediated) situation in which she or he acts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suchman|first=Lucy|date=January 1993|title=Response to Vera and Simon's Situated Action: A Symbolic Interpretation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.1993.17.issue-1/issuetoc|journal=COGNITIVE SCIENCE|volume=17|pages=71–75|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent perspectives of situated cognition have focused on and draw from the concept of identity formation &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; as people negotiate meaning through interactions within communities of practice.&lt;ref&gt;Brown &amp; Duguid, 2000; Clancey, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Situated cognition perspectives have been adopted in education,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; instructional design,&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; online communities and artificial intelligence (see Brooks, Clancey). Grounded Cognition, concerned with the role of simulations and embodiment in cognition, encompasses Cognitive Linguistics, Situated Action, Simulation and Social Simulation theories. Research has contributed to the understanding of embodied language, memory, and the representation of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Barsalou, L. Grounded Cognition (2008) Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2008. 59:617–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated cognition draws a variety of perspectives, from an anthropological study of human behavior in the context of technology-mediated work,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or within [[communities of practice]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  to the [[ecological psychology]] of the perception-action cycle&lt;ref&gt;[[James J. Gibson]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and intentional dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Kadar, Sim &amp; Reppenger, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and even research on robotics with work on [[autonomous agent]]s at NASA and elsewhere (e.g., work by W. J. Clancey). Early attempts to define situated cognition focused on contrasting the emerging theory with information processing theories dominant in cognitive psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Bredo, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently theorists have recognized a natural affinity between situated cognition, New Literacy Studies and [[new literacies]] research (Gee, 2010). This connection is made by understanding that situated cognition maintains that individuals learn through experiences. It could be stated that these experiences, and more importantly the mediators that affect attention during these experiences is affected by the tools, technologies and languages used by a socio-cultural group and the meanings given to these by the collective group. New literacies research examines the context and contingencies that language and tool use by individuals and how this changes as the Internet and other communication technologies affect literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Leu et al., 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key principles==
===Affordances/effectivities===
[[James J. Gibson]] introduced the idea of [[affordance]]s as part of a relational account of perception.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Perception should not be considered solely as the encoding of environmental features into the perceiver's mind, but as an element of an individual's interaction with her environment (Gibson, 1977). Central to his proposal of an ecological psychology was the notion of affordances. Gibson proposed that in any interaction between an agent and the environment, inherent conditions or qualities of the environment allow the agent to perform certain actions with the environment.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"&gt;Greeno, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the term as properties in the environment that presented possibilities for action and were available for an agent to perceive directly and act upon.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1979/1986"&gt;Gibson 1979/1986&lt;/ref&gt;
Gibson focused on the affordances of physical objects, such as doorknobs and chairs, and suggested that these affordances were directly perceived by an individual instead of mediated by mental representations such as mental models. It is important to note that Gibson's notion of direct perception as an unmediated process of noticing, perceiving, and encoding specific attributes from the environment, has long been challenged by proponents of a more category-based model of perception.

This focus on agent-situation interactions in ecological psychology was consistent with the situated cognition program of researchers such as James G. Greeno (1994, 1998), who appreciated Gibson's apparent rejection of the factoring assumptions underlying experimental psychology. The situated cognition perspective focused on "perception-action instead of memory and retrieval…A perceiving/acting agent is coupled with a developing/adapting environment and what matters is how the two interact".&lt;ref&gt;Young, Kulikowich, &amp; Barab, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;139&lt;/ref&gt; Greeno (1994) also suggested that affordances are "preconditions for activity," and that while they do not determine behavior, they increase the likelihood that a certain action or behavior will occur.

Shaw, Turvey, &amp; Mace (as cited by Greeno, 1994) later introduced the term effectivities, the abilities of the agent that determined what the agent could do, and consequently, the interaction that could take place. Perception and action were co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which acted 'in the moment' together.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 1979/1986; Greeno, 1994; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the agent directly perceived and interacted with the environment, determining what affordances could be picked up, based on his effectivities. This view is consistent with Norman's (1988) theory of "perceived affordances," which emphasizes the agent's perception of an object's utility as opposed to focusing on the object itself.

An interesting question is the relationship between affordances and mental representations as set forth in a more cognitivist perspective. While Greeno (1998) argues that attunements to affordances are superior to constructs such as [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]] and mental models, Glenberg &amp; Robertson (1999) suggested that affordances are the building blocks of mental models.

===Perception (variance/invariance)===
The work of Gibson (1986) in the field of visual [[perception]] greatly influences situated cognition.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"/&gt; Gibson argued that visual perception is not a matter of the eye translating inputs into symbolic representation in the brain. Instead the viewer perceives and picks up on the infinite amount of information available in the environment. Specifically, an agent perceives affordances by discovering the variants, what changes, and more importantly the invariants, what does not change across different situations. Given a specific intention (or intentional set),{{clarify|date=October 2011}} perceptions of invariants are co-determined by the agent and the affordances of the environment, and are then built upon over time.{{clarify|date=October 2011}}

===Memory===
Situated cognition and ecological psychology perspectives emphasize perception and propose that [[memory]] plays a significantly diminished role in the learning process. Rather, focus is on the continuous tuning of perceptions and actions across situations based on the affordances of the environment and the interaction of the agent within that environment (Greeno, 1994). Representations are not stored and checked against past knowledge, but are created and interpreted in activity (Clancey, 1990).

Situated cognition understands memory as an interaction with the world, bounded by meaningful situations, that brings an agent toward a specified goal (intention). Thus, perception and action are co-determined by the effectivities and affordances, which act 'in the moment' together.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 1979/1986; Greeno, 1994; Young Kulikowich, &amp; Barab, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the agent directly perceives and interacts with the environment, determining what affordances can be picked up, based on his effectivities, and does not simply recall stored symbolic representations.

===Knowing===
Situativity theorists recast knowledge not as an entity, thing, or noun, but as knowing as an action or verb.&lt;ref name="Greeno, 1994"/&gt; It is not an entity which can be collected as in knowledge acquisition models. Instead knowing is reciprocally co-determined between the agent and environment.&lt;ref name="br2006"&gt;Barab &amp; Roth, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This reciprocal interaction can not be separated from the context and its cultural and historical constructions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Therefore, knowing isn't a matter of arriving at any single truth but instead it is a particular stance that emerges from the agent-environment interaction.&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt;

Knowing emerges as individuals develop intentions&lt;ref&gt;Young, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; through goal-directed activities within cultural contexts which may in turn have larger goals and claims of truth. The adoption of intentions relates to the direction of the agent's attention to the detection of affordances in the environment that will lead to accomplishment of desired goals. Knowing is expressed in the agent's ability to act as an increasingly competent participant in a community of practice. As agents participate more fully within specific communities of practice, what constitutes knowing continuously evolves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, a novice environmentalist may not look at water quality by examining oxygen levels but may consider the color and smell.&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt; Through participation and enculturation within different communities, agents express knowing through action.

===Learning===
Since knowing is rooted in action and can not be decontextualized from individual, social, and historical goals&lt;ref name="br2006" /&gt; teaching approaches that focus on conveying facts and rules separately from the contexts within which they are meaningful in real-life do not allow for [[learning]] that is based on the detection of invariants. They are therefore considered to be impoverished methods that are unlikely to lead to transfer. Learning must involve more than the transmission of knowledge but must instead encourage the expression of effectivities and the development of attention and intention&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004b&lt;/ref&gt; through rich contexts&lt;ref&gt;Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; that reflect real life learning processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Learning, more specifically literacy learning is affected by the Internet and other communication technologies as also evidenced in other segments of society. As a result of this youth are recently using affordances provided by these tools to become experts in a variety of domains.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"&gt;Gee, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These practices by youth are viewed as them becoming "pro-ams" and becoming experts in whatever they have developed a passion for.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 2006; Leadbeater &amp; Miller, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Individuals don't just read or write texts, they interact with them, and often these interactions involve others in various socio-cultural contexts. Since [[language]] is often the basis for monitoring and tracking learning gains in comprehension, content knowledge and tool use in and out of school the role of situated cognition in language learning activities is important. Membership and interaction in social and cultural groups is often determined by tools, technologies and [[discourse]] use for full participation. Language learning or literacy in various social and cultural groups must include how the groups work with and interact with these texts.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"/&gt; Language instruction in the context of situated cognition also involves the skilled or novice use of language by members of the group, and instruction of not only the elements of language, but what is needed to bring a student to the level of expert. Originating from emergent literacy,&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson &amp; Neuman, 2006; Gee, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; specialist-language lessons examines the formal and informal styles and discourses of language use in socio-cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, 2004; Gee, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A function of specialist-language lessons includes "lucidly functional language", or complex specialist language is usually accompanied by clear and lucid language used to explain the rules, relationships or meanings existing between language and meaning.&lt;ref name="Gee, 2010"/&gt;

===Legitimate peripheral participation===
According to [[Jean Lave]] and Wenger (1991) [[legitimate peripheral participation]] (LPP) provides a framework to describe how individuals ('newcomers') become part of a community of learners. Legitimate peripheral participation was central to Lave and Wenger's take on situated cognition (referred to as "situated activity") because it introduced socio-cultural and historical realizations of power and access to the way thinking and knowing are legitimated. They stated, "Hegemony over resources for learning and alienation from full participation are inherent in the shaping of the legitimacy and peripherality of participation in its historical realizations" (p.&amp;nbsp;42). Lave and Wenger's (1991) research on the phenomenon of apprenticeship in communities of practice not only provided a unit of analysis for locating an individual's multiple, changing levels and ways of participation, but also implied that all participants, through increased involvement, have access to, acquire, and use resources available to their particular community.

To illustrate the role of LPP in situated activity, Lave and Wenger (1991) examined five apprenticeship scenarios (Yucatec midwives, Vai and Gola tailors, naval quartermasters, meat cutters, and non-drinking alcoholics involved in AA). Their analysis of apprenticeship across five different communities of learners lead them to several conclusions about the situatedness of LPP and its relationship to successful learning. Key to newcomers' success included:

* access to all that community membership entails,
* involvement in productive activity,
* learning the discourse(s) of the community including "talking about and talking within a practice," (p.&amp;nbsp;109), and
* willingness of the community to capitalize on the inexperience of newcomers, "Insofar as this continual interaction of new perspectives is sanctioned, everyone's participation is legitimately peripheral in some respect. In other words, everyone can to some degree be considered a 'newcomer' to the future of a changing community" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Planning vs. action ===
Suchman's book, ''Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human-machine Communication'' (1987), provided a novel approach to the study of [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction (HCI)]]. By adopting an anthropological approach to sensemaking and interpretation, Suchman was able to demonstrate how both action and planning were situated in the context of a flow of socially- and materially-mediated activities - an idea that stimulated many of the later conceptualizations of situated cognition. Her studies contrasted the deterministic approach to planning assumed by technology designers with the situated nature of planning as people make sense of the status of their workflow and adjust their course of action accordingly. For example, a photocopier will instruct its user to reload all pages in the original order after a jam, whereas the user understands that they only need to copy the last page again.  By arguing that plans were the result of ongoing processes of prospective/retrospective sense making, Suchman identified the limits of technology system access to relevant social and material resources as a major cause of limitations in how technology supports human work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This position led to a major debate with Vera and Simon (1993), who argued that cognition is based on symbolic representations and that planning must therefore be deterministic, based on a pre-determined repertoire of learned response. Most organizational theorists would now see this debate as reflecting individual/cognitive vs. socially-situated levels of analysis (requiring a similar need for paradigmatic co-existence as [[Wave–particle duality]]). Suchman (1993) argues that planning in the context of work-activity is similar to navigating a canoe through rapids: you know what point on the river you are aiming for, but you constantly adjust your course as you interact with rocks, swells, and currents on the way. As a result many organizational theorists argue that plans can only be viewed as post-hoc justifications of action, while Suchman herself views appears to view plans and actions as interrelated in the moment of action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Representation, symbols, and schemata===
In situated theories, the term "[[Mental representation|representation]]" refers to external forms in the environment that are created through social interactions to express meaning (language, art, gestures, etc.) and are perceived and acted upon in the first person sense. "Representing" in the first person sense is conceived as an act of re-experiencing in the imagination that involves the dialectic of ongoing perceiving and acting in coordination with the activation of neural structures and processes. This form of reflective representation is considered to be a secondary type of learning, while the primary form of learning is found in the "adaptive recoordination that occurs with every behavior".&lt;ref name="clancey1993"&gt;Clancey, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptualizing is considered to be a "prelinguistic" act, while "knowing" involves creative interaction with [[symbol]]s in both their interpretation and use for expression. "Schema" develop as neural connections become biased through repeated activations to reactivate in situations that are perceived and conceived as temporally and compositionally similar to previous generalized situations.&lt;ref name="clancey1993" /&gt;

===Goals, intention, and attention===
[[File:PS Dynamics.jpg|thumb|left|Young-Barab Model (1997)]]The Young-Barab Model (1997) pictured to the left, illustrates the dynamics of intentions and intentional dynamics involved in the agent’s interaction with his environment when problem solving.

Dynamics of Intentions:&lt;ref name=ksy&gt;Kugler et al., 1991; Shaw et al., 1992; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; goal (intention) adoption from among all possible goals (ontological descent). This describes how the learner decides whether or not to adopt a particular goal when presented with a problem. Once a goal is adopted, the learner proceeds by interacting with their environment through intentional dynamics. There are many levels of intentions, but at the moment of a particular occasion, the agent has just one intention, and that intention constrains his behavior until it is fulfilled or annihilated.

Intentional Dynamics:&lt;ref name=ksy /&gt; dynamics that unfold when the agent has only one intention (goal) and begins to act towards it, perceiving and acting.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1979/1986"/&gt; It is a trajectory towards the achievement of a solution or goal, the process of tuning one’s perception (attention). Each intention is meaningfully bounded, where the dynamics of that intention inform the agent of whether or not he is getting closer to achieving his goal. If the agent is not getting closer to his goal, he will take corrective action, and then continue forward. This is the agent’s intentional dynamics, and continues on until he achieves his goal.

===Transfer===
There are various definition of transfer found within the situated cognition umbrella. Researchers interested in social practice often define transfer as increased participation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Ecological psychology perspectives define transfer as the detection of invariance across different situations.&lt;ref&gt;Young &amp; McNeese, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, transfer can only "occur when there is a confluence of an individual's goals and objectives, their acquired abilities to act, and a set of affordances for action".&lt;ref&gt;Young et al., 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied cognition===
{{main|Embodied cognition}}
The traditional cognition approach assumes that perception and motor systems are merely peripheral input and output devices.&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, 2007; Wilson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[embodied cognition]] posits that the mind and body interact 'on the fly' as a single entity. An example of embodied cognition is seen in the area of robotics, where movements are not based on internal representations, rather, they are based on the robot’s direct and immediate interaction with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, research has shown that embodied facial expressions influence judgments,&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and arm movements are related to a person’s evaluation of a word or concept.&lt;ref&gt;Markman, &amp; Brendl, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter example, the individual would pull or push a lever towards his name at a faster rate for positive words, than for negative words. These results appeal to the embodied nature of situated cognition, where knowledge is the achievement of the whole body in its interaction with the world.

==Externalism==
As to the mind, by and large, situated cognition paves the way to various form of [[externalism]]. The issue is whether the situated aspect of cognition has only a practical value or it is somehow constitutive of cognition and perhaps of consciousness itself. As to the latter possibility, there are different positions. David Chalmers and Andy Clark, who developed the hugely debated model of the extended mind, explicitly rejected the externalization of consciousness.&lt;ref name="clark2008"&gt;Clark, A., (2008), ''Supersizing the Mind'', Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For them, only cognition is extended. On the other hand, others, like Riccardo Manzotti&lt;ref name=clark2008 /&gt; or Teed Rockwell,&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, 2005 #1561&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly considered the possibility to situate conscious experience in the environment.

==Pedagogical implications==
Since situated cognition views knowing as an action within specific contexts and views [[direct instruction]] models of knowledge transmission as impoverished, there are significant implications for pedagogical practices. First, curriculum requires instructional design that draws on apprenticeship models common in real life.&lt;ref name="Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989"/&gt; Second, curricular design should rely on contextual narratives that situate concepts in practice. Classroom practices such as [[project-based learning]] and [[problem-based learning]] would qualify as consistent with the [[situated learning]] perspective, as would techniques such as Case Base Learning, [[Anchored Instruction]], and [[cognitive apprenticeship]].

===Cognitive apprenticeship===
Cognitive apprenticeships were one of the earliest pedagogical designs to incorporate the theories of situated cognition (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship uses four dimensions (e.g., content, methods, sequence, sociology) to embed learning in activity and make deliberate the use of the social and physical contexts present in the classroom (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Cognitive apprenticeship includes the enculturation of students into authentic practices through activity and social interaction (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989). The technique draws on the principles of Legitimate Peripheral Participation (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) and reciprocal teaching (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984; 1989) in that a more knowledgeable other, i.e. a teacher, engages in a task with a more novice other, i.e. a learner, by describing their own thoughts as they work on the task, providing "just in time" scaffolding, modeling expert behaviors, and encouraging reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1985; Scardamalia, Bereiter. &amp; Steinbach, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The reflection process includes having students alternate between novice and expert strategies in a problem-solving context, sensitizing them to specifics of an expert performance, and adjustments that may be made to their own performance to get them to the expert level (Collins &amp; Brown, 1988; Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1989). Thus, the function of reflection indicates "co-investigation" and/or abstracted replay by students.&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1983; Collins &amp; Brown, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989) emphasized six critical features of a cognitive apprenticeship that included observation, coaching, [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], modeling, fading, and reflection. Using these critical features, expert(s) guided students on their journey to acquire the cognitive and metacognitive processes and skills necessary to handle a variety of tasks, in a range of situations&lt;ref&gt;Collins et al.,1989&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocal teaching, a form of cognitive apprenticeship, involves the modeling and coaching of various comprehension skills as teacher and students take turns in assuming the role of instructor.

===Anchored instruction===
Anchored instruction is grounded in a story or narrative that presents a realistic (but fictional) situation and raises an overarching question or problem (compare with an essential question posed by a teacher). This approach is designed to 1) engage the learner with a problem or series of related problems, 2) require the learner to develop goals and discover subgoals related to solving the problem(s), and 3) provide the learner with extensive and diverse opportunities to explore the problem(s) in a shared context with classmates. For example, a Spanish teacher uses a video drama series focused on the murder of a main character. Students work in small groups to summarize parts of the story, to create hypotheses about the murderer and motive, and to create a presentation of their solution to the class. Stories are often paired so that across the set students can detect the invariant structure of the underlying knowledge (so 2 episodes about distance-rate-time, one about boats and one about planes, so students can perceive how the distance-rate-time relationship holds across differences in vehicles). The ideal smallest set of instances needed provide students the opportunity to detect invariant structure has been referred to as a "generator set" of situations.

The goal of anchored instruction is the engagement of intention and attention. Through authentic tasks across multiple domains, educators present situations that require students to create or adopt meaningful goals (intentions). One of the educator’s objectives can be to set a goal through the use of an anchor problem.&lt;ref&gt;Barab &amp; Roth, 2006; Young et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example of anchored instruction is the Jasper series.&lt;ref&gt;The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990; Young et al., 1997; Young &amp; McNeese, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Jasper series includes a variety of videodisc adventures focused on problem formulation and problem solving. Each videodisc used a visual narrative to present an authentic, realistic everyday problem. The objective was for students to adopt specific goals (intentions) after viewing the story and defining a problem. These newly adopted goals guided students through the collaborative process of problem formulation and problem solving.

===Perceiving and acting in avatar-based virtual worlds===
[[Virtual world]]s provide unique affordances for embodied learning, i.e. hands on, interactive, spatially oriented, that ground learning in experience. Here "embodied" means acting in a virtual world enabled by an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]].

Contextual affordances of online games and virtual environments allow learners to engage in goal-driven activity, authentic interactions, and collaborative problem-solving – all considered in situated theories of learning to be features of optimal learning. In terms of situated assessment, virtual worlds have the advantage of facilitating dynamic feedback that directs the perceiving/acting agent, through an avatar, to continually improve performance.

==Research methodologies==
The situative perspective is focused on interactive systems in which individuals interact with one another and physical and representational systems. Research takes place ''in situ'' and in real-world settings, reflecting assumptions that knowledge is constructed within specific contexts which have specific situational affordances. Mixed methods and qualitative methodologies are the most prominently used by researchers.

In qualitative studies, methods used are varied but the focus is often on the increased participation in specific communities of practice, the affordances of the environment that are acted upon by the agent, and the distributed nature of knowing in specific communities. A major feature of quantitative methods used in situated cognition is the absence of outcome measures. Quantitative variables used in mixed methods often focus on process over product. For example, trace nodes, dribble files, and hyperlink pathways are often used to track how students interact in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Effken, Fajen, Garret &amp; Morris, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of situativity==
In "Situated Action: A Symbolic Interpretation" Vera and Simon wrote: " ... the systems usually regarded as exemplifying Situated Action are thoroughly symbolic (and representational), and, to the extent that they are limited in these respects, have doubtful prospects for extension to complex tasks"&lt;ref&gt;Vera &amp; Simon, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Vera and Simon (1993) also claimed that the [[information processing]] view is supported by many years of research in which symbol systems simulated "broad areas of human cognition" and that there is no evidence of cognition without representation.

Anderson, Reder and Simon (1996) summarized what they considered to be the four claims of situated learning and argued against each claim from a [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] perspective. The claims and their arguments were:
# Claim: Activity and learning are bound to the specific situations in which they occur. Argument: Whether learning is bound to context or not depends on both the kind of learning and the way that it is learned.
# Claim: Knowledge does not transfer between tasks. Argument: There is ample evidence of successful transfer between tasks in the literature. Transfer depends on initial practice and the degree to which a successive task has similar cognitive elements to a prior task.
# Claim: Teaching abstractions is ineffective. Argument: Abstract instruction can be made effective by combining of abstract concepts and concrete examples.
# Claim: Instruction must happen in complex social contexts. Argument: Research shows value in individual learning and on focusing individually on specific skills in a skill set.

Anderson, Reder and Simons summarize their concerns when they say:
"What is needed to improve learning and teaching is to continue to deepen our research into the circumstances that determine when narrower or broader contexts are required and when attention to narrower or broader skills are optimal for effective and efficient learning" (p.&amp;nbsp;10).

===Considerations===
However, it is important to remember that a theory is neither wrong nor right but provides affordances for certain aspects of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sfard | first1 = A | year = 1998 | title = On two metaphors for learning and the dangers of choosing just one | url = | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 4–13 | doi=10.3102/0013189x027002004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lave and Wenger recognized this in their ironic comment, "How can we purport to be working out a theoretical conception of learning without engaging in the project of abstraction [decontextualized knowledge] rejected above?" (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

{{Internet}}

The '''sociology of the Internet''' involves the application of sociological theory and method to the [[Internet]] as a source of information and communication. [[Sociologists]] are concerned with the social implications of the technology; new [[social networks]], [[Virtual community|virtual communities]] and ways of [[Social interaction|interaction]] that have arisen, as well as issues related to [[cyber crime]].

The Internet—[[History of communication|the newest]] in a series of major [[Information revolution|information breakthroughs]]—is of interest for sociologists in various ways: as a tool for [[social research|research]], for example, in using [[online]] [[questionnaires]] instead of paper ones, as a discussion platform, and as a research topic. The [[sociology]] of the Internet in the stricter sense concerns the analysis of [[online communities]] (e.g. as found in [[newsgroups]]), [[virtual communities]] and [[Virtual World|virtual worlds]], organizational change catalyzed through [[new media]] such as the Internet, and social change at-large in the transformation from [[Industrial society|industrial]] to [[informational society]] (or to [[information society]]). Online communities can be studied statistically through [[Social network#Social network analysis|network analysis]] and at the same time interpreted qualitatively, such as through [[virtual ethnography]]. Social change can be studied through statistical [[demographics]] or through the interpretation of changing messages and symbols in online [[media studies]].

==Emergence of the discipline==
The Internet is a relatively new phenomenon. As [[Robert Darnton]] wrote, it is a revolutionary change that "took place yesterday, or the day before, depending on how you measure it."&lt;ref name="Darnton"&gt;Robert Darnton, ''[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21514 The Library in the New Age]'', The New York Review of Books, Volume 55, Number 10. June 12, 2008. Retrieved on 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet developed from the [[ARPANET]], dating back to 1969; as a term it was coined in 1974. The [[World Wide Web]] as we know it was shaped in the mid-1990s, when [[graphical interface]] and services like [[email]] became popular and reached wider (non-scientific and non-military) audiences and [[commerce]].&lt;ref name="Darnton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"&gt;Paul DiMaggio, Eszter Hargittai, W. Russell Neuman, and John P. Robinson, ''Social Implications of the Internet'', Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 27: 307-336 (Volume publication date August 2001), {{doi|10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307}} [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Explorer]] was first released in 1995; [[Netscape]] a year earlier. [[Google]] was founded in 1998.&lt;ref name="Darnton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; [[Wikipedia]] was founded in 2001. [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], and [[YouTube]] in the mid-2000s. [[Web 2.0]] is still emerging. The amount of information available on the net and the [[Global Internet usage|number of Internet users worldwide]] has continued to grow rapidly.&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; The term '[[digital sociology]]' is now becoming increasingly used to denote new directions in sociological research into digital technologies since Web 2.0.

==Research trends==
According to DiMaggio et al. (1999),&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; research tends to focus on the Internet's implications in five domains:
# [[Economic inequality|inequality]] (the issues of [[digital divide]])
# [[public]] and [[social capital]] (the issues of [[date displacement]])
# [[political participation]] (the issues of [[public sphere]], [[deliberative democracy]] and [[civil society]])
# [[organization]]s and other economic institutions
# [[cultural participation]] and [[cultural diversity]]

Early on, there were predictions that the Internet would change everything (or nothing); over time, however, a consensus emerged that the Internet, at least in the current phase of development, complements rather than displaces previously implemented [[Media (communication)|media]].&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt; This has meant a rethinking of the 1990s ideas of "convergence of new and old media". Further, the Internet offers a rare opportunity to study changes caused by the newly emerged - and likely, still evolving - [[information and communication technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref name="DiMaggio"/&gt;

==Social impact==
The Internet has created new forums of [[social interaction]] and [[social relations]] including [[Social network service|social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]] and sites such as [[meetup.com]] and [[Couchsurfing]] which facilitate offline interaction.

Though [[virtual communities]] were once thought to be composed of strictly virtual social ties, researchers often find that even those social ties formed in virtual spaces are often maintained both online and offline &lt;ref&gt;Lauren F. Sessions, "How offline gatherings affect online community members: when virtual community members ‘meetup’.""Information, Communication, and Society"13,3(April, 2010):375-395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bo Xie, B. ‘The mutual shaping of online and offline social relationships."Information Research, 1,3(2008):n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ongoing debates about the impact of the Internet on [[strong ties|strong]] and [[weak ties]], whether the Internet is creating more or less [[social capital]],&lt;ref&gt;Lee Rainie, John Horrigan, Barry Wellman, and Jeffrey Boase.

It is often said the Internet is a new frontier, and there is a line of argument to the effect that social interaction, cooperation and conflict among users resembles the anarchistic and violent [[American frontier]] of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen. "Military History on the Electronic Frontier: Wikipedia Fights the War of 1812," ''The Journal of Military History'' (October 2012) 76#4  pp 1165-82 [http://www.americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/JMH1812.PDF online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, researchers from the [[Benedictine University at Mesa]] in [[Arizona]] studied how online interactions affect face-to-face meetings. The study is titled, "Face to Face Versus Facebook: Does Exposure to Social Networking Web Sites Augment or Attenuate Physiological Arousal Among the Socially Anxious," published in ''[[Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking]]''.&lt;ref name=Charles-Study&gt;{{cite news|last=Charles|first=Megan|title=Meeting Facebook Friends Face To Face Causes Anxiety (Study) |url=http://www.business2community.com/social-buzz/meeting-facebook-friends-face-face-causes-anxiety-study-0803603#!yTDAe|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=Business 2 Community|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analyzed 26 female students with electrodes to measure social anxiety. Prior to meeting people, the students were shown pictures of the subject they were expected to meet. Researchers found that meeting someone face-to-face after looking at their photos increases arousal, which the study linked to an increase in social anxiety. These findings confirm previous studies that found that socially anxious people prefer online interactions. The study also recognized that the stimulated arousal can be associated with positive emotions and could lead to positive feelings.&lt;ref name=Woollaston-Facebook&gt;{{cite news|last=Woollaston|first=Victoria|title=Is Facebook making us socially AWKWARD?

Recent research has taken the [[Internet of Things]] within its purview, as global networks of interconnected everyday objects are said to be the next step in technological advancement.&lt;ref name="AtzoriIera2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atzori|first1=Luigi|last2=Iera|first2=Antonio|last3=Morabito|first3=Giacomo|last4=Nitti|first4=Michele|title=The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) – When social networks meet the Internet of Things: Concept, architecture and network characterization|journal=Computer Networks|volume=56|issue=16|year=2012|pages=3594–3608|issn=1389-1286|doi=10.1016/j.comnet.2012.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, global space- and earth-based networks are expanding coverage of the IoT at a fast pace.

=== The impact on children ===
[[File:Meebox_electronics.PNG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Meebox_electronics.PNG|thumb|Technological devices can be used intensively.]]Researchers have investigated the use of [[technology]] (as opposed to the Internet) by children and how it can be used excessively, where it can cause medical health and psychological issues.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 4338000 |year = 2014 |last1 = Rosen |first1 = L.

Children can use technology to enhance their learning skills - for example: using online programs to improve the way they learn how to read or do math. The resources technology provides for children may enhance their skills, but children should be cautious of what they get themselves into due to how cyber bullying may occur. [[Cyber bullying]] can cause academic and psychological affects due to how children are suppressed by people who bully them through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.688.1918&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title= Download Limit Exceeded|website= citeseerx.ist.psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; When technology is introduced to children they are not forced to accept it, but instead children are permitted to have an input on what they feel about either deciding to use their technological device or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first= Allison|last= Druin|authorlink=Allison Druin|date= 1999-10-02|title= The Role of Children in the Design Technology|url= https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/1028|language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=September 2018}} [[Social]] exclusion in the classroom occurs to children who associate themselves more with using computers, which causes them to exclude themselves from the classroom's everyday context due to how they grow more attached to the device.

Technology can have negative impacts on the lives of children and can be an essential [[learning]] tool that can encourage cognitive, linguistic and social development. Children that use technological devices have had greater gains in problem-solving, intelligence, language skills and structural knowledge in comparison to those children who have not incorporated the use of technology in their learning.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ898529.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In research conducted, "studies did find improvements in student scores on tests closely related to material covered in computer-assisted instructional packages", which demonstrates how technology can have positive influences on children by improving their learning capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED452818.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Problems have arisen between children and their parents as well when parents limit what children can use their technological devices for, specifically what they can and cannot watch on their devices, making children frustrated.&lt;ref name="komunikasi.unsoed.ac.id"&gt;

Studies have found that "the average child in this country{{which?|date=September 2018}} spends over 6 hours each day with some form of mediated communication", meaning that children spend more time with their technological device rather than spending that time with their family or friends.&lt;ref name="komunikasi.unsoed.ac.id"/&gt; The introduction of technology to children has the positive outcome of increasing a child's learning capabilities, but can have the negative outcome of affecting a child's behavior in acting more isolated from the rest of society.

===Political organization and censorship===
{{See also|Internet censorship}}

The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the [[United States]] became famous for its ability to generate donations via the Internet, and the 2008 campaign of [[Barack Obama]] became even more so. Increasingly, [[social movements]] and other organizations use the Internet to carry out both traditional and the new [[Internet activism]].

Governments are also getting online. Some countries, such as those of [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[North Korea]], [[Myanmar]], the [[People's Republic of China]], and [[Saudi Arabia]] use filtering and censoring software to [[Internet censorship|restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], they also use software to locate and arrest various individuals they perceive as a threat. Other countries including the United States, have enacted laws making the possession or distribution of certain material such as [[child pornography]] illegal but do not use filtering software. In some countries [[Internet service providers]] have agreed to restrict access to sites listed by police.

===Economics===
While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[Electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ "How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World"] ''The Atlantic'' February 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/ "E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland"] ''ZDNet'', January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for [[peer-to-peer charities]], which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites such as [[Donors Choose]] and [[Global Giving]] now allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice.

A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes. [[Kiva]] pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''], by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, Oct. 2, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 &amp; 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Kiva&amp;st=cse ''Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes''], by Stephanie Strom, in The New York Times, Nov. 8, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 &amp; 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, the recent spread of cheap Internet access in developing countries has made genuine peer-to-peer connections increasingly feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] tapped into this trend to offer the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without local intermediaries. Inspired by interactive websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[eBay]], Zidisha's microlending platform facilitates direct dialogue between lenders and borrowers and a performance rating system for borrowers. Web users worldwide can fund loans for as little as a dollar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ "Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008230104/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |date=2011-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
The Internet has been a major source of [[leisure]] since before the World Wide Web, with entertaining social experiments such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much of the main traffic. Today, many [[Internet forum]]s have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of [[Flash animation|Flash movies]] are also popular. Over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas.

The [[pornography]] and [[gambling]] industries have both taken full advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites. Although governments have made attempts to censor Internet porn, Internet service providers have told governments that these plans are not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chivers|first=Tom|title=Internet pornography block plans: other attempts to control the internet|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/8215030/Internet-pornography-block-plans-other-attempts-to-control-the-internet.html|accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=Dec 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also many governments have attempted to put restrictions on both industries' use of the Internet, this has generally failed to stop their widespread popularity.

One area of leisure on the Internet is [[MMORPG|online gaming]]. This form of leisure creates communities, bringing people of all ages and origins to enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[role-playing video game]]s to [[online gambling]]. This has revolutionized the way many people interact and spend their free time on the Internet.

While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]], to which players of games would typically subscribe. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of gameplay or certain games.

Many use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. As discussed above, there are paid and unpaid sources for all of these, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Discretion is needed as some of these sources take more care over the original artists' rights and over copyright laws than others.

Many use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book holidays and to find out more about their random ideas and casual interests.

People use [[Internet Relay Chat|chat]], [[Instant messaging|messaging]] and e-mail to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social networking]] websites like [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]] and many others like them also put and keep people in contact for their enjoyment.

The Internet has seen a growing number of [[Web desktop]]s, where users can access their files, folders, and settings via the Internet.

[[Cyberslacking]] has become a serious drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spends 57 minutes a day surfing the Web at work, according to a study by [[Peninsula Business Services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=914&amp;id=1001802003 Scotsman.com News - Net abuse hits small city firms]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5865">If an aircraft in flight suffers a disturbance in pitch that causes an increase (or decrease) in [[angle of attack]], it is desirable that the aerodynamic forces on the aircraft cause a decrease (or increase) in angle of attack so that the disturbance does not cause a continuous increase (or decrease) in angle of attack.  This is [[longitudinal static stability]].

''Static margin'' is a concept used to characterize the static longitudinal stability and controllability of aircraft and missiles.

In aircraft analysis, static margin is defined as the distance between the center of gravity and the neutral point of the aircraft, expressed as a percentage of the mean aerodynamic chord of the wing.  The greater this distance and the narrower the wing, the more stable the aircraft.  Conventionally, the neutral point is aft of the c.g., although in rare cases (computer controlled fighter aircraft) it may be forward of the c.g., i.e. slightly unstable, to obtain quickness of response in combat.  Too great longitudinal stability makes the aircraft "stiff" in pitch, resulting in such undesirable features as difficulty in obtaining the necessary stalled nose-up pitch when landing.

The position of the neutral point is found by taking the algebraic net moment of all horizontal surfaces, measured from the nose of the aircraft, in the same manner as the c.g. is determined, i.e. the sum of all such moments divided by their total area.  The stabilizer and elevator dominate this result, but it is necessary to account for all surfaces such as fuselage, landing gear, prop-normal, etc.  It is also necessary to take account of the center of pressure of the wing, which can move a good deal fore and aft as angle of attack of a flat-bottom wing section (Clark Y) changes, or not at all in the case of self-stabilizing sections such as the M6.

The neutral point in conventional aircraft is a short distance behind the c.g. ("The feathers of the arrow must be at the back"); but in unconventional aircraft such as canards and those with dual-wings, such as the Quickie, this will not be so.  The overall rule stated above must hold, i.e. the neutral point must be aft of the c.g., wherever that may be. 

The position of the center of gravity is determined by factors such as the positions of  loads, e.g. passengers, fuel, weapons, etc.; whether such loads can vary, e.g. presence or absence of luggage, ammunition, etc.; and how fuel is consumed during flight.  Additional information regarding the usual position of the neutral point aft of the center of gravity is at  [[longitudinal static stability]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_02/textonly/fo01txt.html Effect of CG on handling of swept-wing airplanes]&lt;/ref&gt; (For an aircraft this may be described as positive static margin.)  The response of an aircraft or missile to an angular disturbance such as a [[Tait-Bryan angles|pitch]] disturbance is determined by its static margin.

In missile analysis, static margin is defined as the distance between the center of gravity and the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]].  Missiles are symmetric vehicles and if they have airfoils they too are symmetric.  

For missiles, positive static margin implies that the complete vehicle makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position.  If the [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] is behind the center of gravity then the moment will be restoring.  For missiles with symmetric airfoils, the neutral point and the center of pressure are coincident and the term neutral point is not used.

== Relationship to aircraft and missile stability and control==
* If the center of gravity (CG) of an aircraft is forward of the neutral point, or the CG of a missile is forward of the center of pressure, the vehicle will respond to a disturbance by producing an aerodynamic moment that returns the [[angle of attack]] of the vehicle towards the angle that existed prior to the disturbance.
* If the CG of an aircraft is behind the neutral point, or the CG of a missile is behind the center of pressure, the vehicle will respond to a disturbance by producing an aerodynamic moment that continues to drive the angle of attack of the vehicle further away from the starting position. 

The first condition above is positive static stability.  In missile analysis this is described as positive static margin.  (In aircraft analysis it may be described as negative static margin.)&lt;br /&gt;
The second condition above is negative static stability.  In missile analysis this is defined as negative static margin.  (In aircraft analysis it may be described as positive static margin.)  

Depending on the static margin, humans may not be able to use control inputs to the elevators to control the pitch of the vehicle.  Typically, computer based [[autopilot]]s are required to control the vehicle when it has negative static stability - usually described as negative static margin.

The purpose of the reduced stability (low static margin) is to make an aircraft more responsive to pilot inputs.  An aircraft with a large static margin will be very stable and slow to respond to the pilot inputs.  The amount of static margin is an important factor in determining the handling qualities of an aircraft.  For an unguided rocket, the vehicle must have a large positive static margin so the rocket shows minimum tendency to diverge from the direction of flight given to it at launch.  In contrast, guided missiles usually have a negative static margin for increased maneuverability.

'''''The Selfish Gene''''' is a 1976 book on [[evolution]] by [[Richard Dawkins]], in which the author builds upon the principal theory of [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]'s ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966). Dawkins uses the term "selfish gene" as a way of expressing the [[gene-centered view of evolution|gene-centred view of evolution]] as opposed to the views focused on the organism and the [[Group selection|group]], popularising ideas developed during the 1960s by [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others. From the gene-centred view, it follows that the more two individuals are genetically related, the more sense (at the level of the genes) it makes for them to behave selflessly with each other.

A lineage is expected to evolve to maximise its [[inclusive fitness]]—the number of copies of its genes passed on globally (rather than by a particular individual). As a result, populations will tend towards an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]. The book also coins the term ''[[meme]]'' for a unit of human [[cultural evolution]] analogous to the gene, suggesting that such "selfish" replication may also model human culture, in a different sense. [[Memetics]] has become the subject of many studies since the publication of the book.  In raising awareness of Hamilton's ideas, as well as making its own valuable contributions to the field, the book has also stimulated research on [[human inclusive fitness]].&lt;ref name="SBNK"&gt;{{cite book |author=Holland, Maximilian |year=2012 |title=[[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship|''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches'']] |publisher=Createspace Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the foreword to the book's 30th-anniversary edition, Dawkins said he "can readily see that [the book's title] might give an inadequate impression of its contents" and in retrospect thinks he should have taken [[Tom Maschler]]'s advice and called the book ''The Immortal Gene''.&lt;ref name="timesexcerpt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article738678.ece |title=It's all in the genes |last=Dawkins |first=Richard| date=12 March 2006 |publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate=6 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615135027/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article738678.ece | archivedate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, ''The Selfish Gene'' was listed as the most influential science book of all time in a poll to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the [[Royal Society]] science book prize.

==Background==
Dawkins builds upon [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]'s book ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966), which argued that [[altruism]] is not based upon [[group selection|group benefit]] ''per se'',&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; but is a result of [[natural selection|selection]] that occurs "at the level of the gene mediated by the [[phenotype]]"&lt;ref name=Williams2/&gt; and any selection at the group level occurred only under rare circumstances.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt; This approach was developed further during the 1960s by [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others who opposed [[group selection]] and selection aimed directly at benefit to the individual organism:&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the principle of '[[survival of the fittest]]' the ultimate criterion which determines whether [a gene] ''G'' will spread is not whether the behavior is to the benefit of the behaver, but whether it is to the benefit of the gene ''G'' ...With altruism this will happen only if the affected individual is a relative of the altruist, therefore having an increased chance of carrying the gene.
:— W. D. Hamilton, ''The Evolution of Altruistic Behavior'', pp. 354–355&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An extended discussion of Dawkins' views and his book ''The Selfish Gene'' is provided by Wilkins and Hull.&lt;ref name=Hull/&gt;

===Contents===

Dawkins begins by discussing the [[altruism]] that people display, indicating that he will argue it is explained by gene selfishness, and attacking [[group selection]] as an explanation. He considers the [[origin of life]] with the arrival of molecules able to replicate themselves. From there, he looks at [[DNA]]'s role in [[evolution]], and its organisation into [[chromosome]]s and [[gene]]s, which in his view behave selfishly. He describes [[organism]]s as [[teleology in biology|apparently purposive]] but fundamentally simple survival machines, which use [[negative feedback]] to [[homeostasis|achieve control]]. This extends, he argues, to the [[brain]]'s ability to simulate the world with subjective [[consciousness]], and [[signalling theory|signalling between species]]. He then introduces the idea of the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], and uses it to explain why [[game theory|alternative competitive strategies]] like bullying and retaliating exist. This allows him to consider what selfishness in a gene might actually mean, describing [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s argument for [[kin selection]], that genes for [[ethology|behaviour]] that improves the survival chances of close relatives can spread in a population, because those relatives carry the same genes. 

Dawkins examines childbearing and raising children as evolutionary strategies. He attacks the idea of group selection for the good of the species as proposed by [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards]], arguing instead that each parent necessarily behaves selfishly. A question is whether parents should invest in their offspring equally or should favour some of them, and explains that what is best for the survival of the parents' genes is not always best for individual children. Similarly, Dawkins argues, there are conflicts of interest between males and females, but he notes that [[R. A. Fisher]] showed that the optimal sex ratio is 50:50. He explains that this is true even in an extreme case like the harem-keeping [[elephant seal]], where 4% of the males get 88% of copulations. In that case, the strategy of having a female offspring is safe, as she'll have a pup, but the strategy of having a male can bring a large return (dozens of pups), even though many males live out their lives as bachelors. [[Amotz Zahavi]]'s theory of [[honest signalling]] explains [[stotting]] as a selfish act, he argues, improving the springbok's chances of escaping from a predator by indicating how difficult the chase would be. 

Dawkins discusses why many species live in groups, achieving mutual benefits through mechanisms such as Hamilton's [[selfish herd]] model: each individual behaves selfishly but the result is herd behaviour. Altruism too can evolve, as in the [[social insects]] such as ants and bees, where [[worker bee|workers]] give up the right to reproduce in favour of a sister, the queen; in their case, the unusual ([[haplodiploid]]) system of [[sex determination system|sex determination]] may have helped to bring this about, as females in a nest are exceptionally closely related.

The final chapter of the first edition introduced the idea of the [[meme]], a [[Cultural learning|culturally-transmitted]] entity such as a hummable tune, by analogy to genetic transmission. Dawkins describes God as an old idea which probably arose many times, and which has sufficient psychological appeal to survive effectively in the meme pool. The second edition (1989) added two more chapters.

===Themes===
===="Selfish" genes====
In describing genes as being "selfish", Dawkins states unequivocally that he does not intend to imply that they are driven by any motives or [[Volition (psychology)|will]], but merely that their effects can be metaphorically and pedagogically described ''as if'' they were. His contention is that the genes that are passed on are the ones whose [[evolution]]ary consequences serve their own implicit interest (to continue the [[anthropomorphism]]) in being replicated, not necessarily those of the organism. In later work, Dawkins brings evolutionary "selfishness" down to creation of a widely proliferated [[The Extended Phenotype|''extended phenotype'']].&lt;ref name=ExPh/&gt;

For some, the metaphor of "selfishness" is entirely clear, while to others it is confusing, misleading, or simply silly to ascribe mental attributes to something that is mindless. For example, [[Andrew Brown (Guardian journalist)|Andrew Brown]] has written:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Brown |date=22 December 1998 |url=http://webpages.charter.net/sn9/science/dawkins2.html |title=The Science of Selfishness (book review of ''Unweaving the Rainbow'') |publisher=Salon Media Group |work=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:""Selfish", when applied to genes, doesn't mean "selfish" at all. It means, instead, an extremely important quality for which there is no good word in the English language: "the quality of being copied by a Darwinian selection process." This is a complicated mouthful. There ought to be a better, shorter word—but "selfish" isn't it."

[[Donald Symons]] also finds it inappropriate to use anthropomorphism in conveying scientific meaning in general, and particularly for the present instance. He writes in ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' (1979):&lt;ref name=Symons&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Donald Symons |last=Symons |first=Donald |chapter=The semantics of ultimate causation |title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality |page=42 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0195029079 |edition=Paperback |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lkISQRDurU0C&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In summary, the rhetoric of ''The Selfish Gene'' exactly reverses the real situation: through [the use of] metaphor genes are endowed with properties only sentient beings can possess, such as selfishness, while sentient beings are stripped of these properties and called machines...The anthropomorphism of genes...obscures the deepest mystery in the life sciences: the origin and nature of mind."

===="Replicators"====
Dawkins proposes the idea of the "replicator":&lt;ref name=DawkinsRep&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |author=Dawkins, Richard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OirfBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT231 |publisher=Best Books |year=1976}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It is finally time to return to the problem with which we started, to the tension between individual organism and gene as rival candidates for the central role in natural selection...One way of sorting this whole matter out is to use the terms ‘replicator’ and ‘vehicle’. The fundamental units of natural selection, the basic things that survive or fail to survive, that form lineages of identical copies with occasional random mutations, are called replicators. DNA molecules are replicators. They generally, for reasons that we shall come to, gang together into large communal survival machines or 'vehicles'."
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA253 p. 253] (Anniversary Edition)

The original replicator (Dawkins' ''&lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;eplicator'') was the initial [[molecule]] which first managed to reproduce itself and thus gained an advantage over other molecules within the [[Abiogenesis#"Primordial soup theory|primordial soup]].&lt;ref name=Replicator&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |page=15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA15 |quote=At some point a particularly remarkable molecule was formed by accident. We will call it the ''Replicator''. It may not necessarily have been the biggest or the most complex molecule around, but it had the extraordinary property of being able to create copies of itself |author=Dawkins, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; As replicating molecules became more complex, Dawkins postulates, the replicators became the genes within organisms, with each organism's body serving the purpose of a 'survival machine' for its genes.

Dawkins writes that gene combinations which help an organism to survive and reproduce tend to also improve the gene's own chances of being replicated, and, as a result, "successful" genes frequently provide a benefit to the organism. An example of this might be a gene that protects the organism against a disease. This helps the gene spread, and also helps the organism.

====Genes vs organisms====
There are other times when the implicit interests of the vehicle and replicator are in conflict, such as the genes behind certain male spiders' instinctive mating behaviour, which increase the organism's [[inclusive fitness]] by allowing it to reproduce, but shorten its life by exposing it to the risk of [[Spider cannibalism|being eaten by the cannibalistic female]]. Another example is the existence of [[Intragenomic conflict|segregation distorter]] genes that are detrimental to their host, but nonetheless propagate themselves at its expense.&lt;ref name=DawkinsUR/&gt; Likewise, the persistence of [[Noncoding DNA#Junk DNA|junk DNA]] that [Dawkins believed at that time] provides no benefit to its host can be explained on the basis that it is not subject to selection. These unselected for but transmitted DNA variations connect the individual genetically to its parents, but confer no survival benefit.&lt;ref name=DawkinsUR2/&gt;

These examples might suggest that there is a power struggle between genes and their interactor. In fact, the claim is that there isn't much of a struggle because the genes usually win without a fight. However, the claim is made that if the organism becomes intelligent enough to understand its own interests, as distinct from those of its genes, there can be true conflict.

An example of such a conflict might be a person using birth control to prevent fertilisation, thereby inhibiting the replication of his or her genes. But this action might not be a conflict of the 'self-interest' of the organism with his or her genes, since a person using birth control might also be enhancing the survival chances of their genes by limiting family size to conform with available resources, thus avoiding extinction as predicted under the [[Malthusian]] model of population growth.

====Altruism====
Dawkins says that his "purpose" in writing ''The Selfish Gene'' is "to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism." He does this by supporting the claim that "gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behaviour. However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of [[altruism]] at the level of individual animals." Gene selection provides one explanation for [[kin selection]] and [[eusociality]], where organisms act altruistically, against their individual interests (in the sense of health, safety or personal reproduction), namely the argument that by helping related organisms reproduce, a gene succeeds in "helping" copies of themselves (or sequences with the same [[phenotype|phenotypic effect]]) in other bodies to replicate. The claim is made that these "selfish" actions of genes lead to unselfish actions by organisms. A requirement upon this claim, supported by Dawkins in Chapter 10: "You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours" by examples from nature, is the need to explain how genes achieve [[kin recognition]], or manage to orchestrate [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] and [[coevolution]]. Although Dawkins (and biologists in general) recognize these phenomena result in more copies of a gene, evidence is inconclusive whether this success is selected for at a group or individual level. In fact, Dawkins has proposed that it is at the level of the [[The Extended Phenotype|''extended phenotype'']]:&lt;ref name=ExPh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bury&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=Burying the Vehicle: Commentary |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=17 |number=4 |pages=616–617 |year=1994 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/248092678/Burying-the-Vehicle#scribd |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00036207}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"We agree [referring to Wilson and Sober's book ''Unto others: The evolution and psychology of unselfish behavior''] that genes are replicators, organisms and groups are not. We agree that the group selection controversy ought to be a controversy about groups as vehicles, and we could easily agree to differ on the answer...I coined the [term] vehicle not to praise it but to bury it....Darwinism can work on replicators whose phenotypic effects (interactors) are too diffuse, too multi-levelled, too incoherent to deserve the accolade of vehicle...Extended phenotypes can include inanimate artifacts like beaver dams...But the vehicle is not something fundamental...Ask rather 'Is there a vehicle in this situation and, if so, why?'"
::—Richard Dawkins, ''Burying the Vehicle''

Although Dawkins agrees that groups can assist survival, they rank as a "vehicle" for survival only if the group activity is replicated in descendants, recorded in the gene, the gene being the only true replicator. An improvement in the survival lottery for the group must improve that for the gene for sufficient replication to occur. Dawkins argues qualitatively that the lottery for the gene is based upon a very long and broad record of events, and group advantages are usually too specific, too brief, and too fortuitous to change the gene lottery.
::"We can now see that the organism and the group of organisms are true rivals for the vehicle role in the story, but neither of them is even a ''candidate'' for the replicator role.  The controversy between ‘individual selection’ and ‘group selection’ is a real controversy between alternative vehicles...As it happens the outcome, in my view, is a decisive victory for the individual organism. The group is too wishy-washy an entity." 
::—Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&amp;pg=PA254 pp. 254-255]

Prior to the 1960s, it was common for altruism to be explained in terms of [[group selection]], where the benefits to the organism or even population were supposed to account for the popularity of the genes responsible for the tendency towards that behaviour. Modern versions of [[Multilevel selection theory|"multilevel selection"]] claim to have overcome the original objections,&lt;ref name=Korb&gt;{{cite book |title=Animal Behaviour: Evolution and Mechanisms |author=Judith Korb |chapter=§7.4—The level of selection debate: multilevel selection |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej953ZCO_Q8C&amp;pg=PA195 |pages =195 ''ff'' |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3642026232  |year=2010 |editor=Peter Kappeler}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely, that at that time no known form of group selection led to an evolutionarily stable strategy. The claim still is made by some that it would take only a single individual with a tendency towards more selfish behaviour to undermine a population otherwise filled only with the gene for altruism towards non-kin.&lt;ref name=PinkerS&gt;Pinker describes the futility of the "Public Good Game" where individuals elect not to aid the group: {{cite book |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |authorlink=Steven Pinker|author=Pinker, Steven |page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePNi4ZqYdVQC&amp;pg=PA257 |isbn=9781101200322 |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Selfish Gene'' was extremely popular when first published, causing "a silent and almost immediate revolution in biology",{{Sfn|Grafen &amp; Ridley|p=72}} and it continues to be widely read. It has sold over a million copies, and has been translated into more than 25 languages.{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006}} Proponents argue that the central point, that replicating the gene is the object of selection, usefully completes and extends the explanation of evolution given by [[Charles Darwin]] before the basic mechanisms of [[genetics]] were understood.

According to the ethologist [[Alan Grafen]], acceptance of adaptionist theories is hampered by a lack of a mathematical unifying theory and a belief that anything in words alone must be suspect.&lt;ref name=Grafen&gt;{{cite book |title=Richard Dawkins: How a scientist changed the way we think |author1link=Alan Grafen |last1=Grafen |first1=Alan |author2link=Mark Ridley (zoologist) |last2=Ridley |first2=Mark |page=68 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lH4sh2436rEC&amp;pg=PT59 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=9780191500770}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grafen, these difficulties along with an initial conflict with population genetics models at the time of its introduction "explains why within biology the considerable scientific contributions it [''The Selfish Gene''] makes are seriously underestimated, and why it is viewed mainly as a work of exposition."&lt;ref name=Grafen/&gt; According to comparative psychologist Nicky Hayes, "Dawkins presented a version of sociobiology that rested heavily on metaphors drawn from animal behavior, and extrapolated these...One of the weaknesses of the sociological approach is that it tends only to seek confirmatory examples from among the huge diversity of animal behavior. Dawkins did not deviate from this tradition."&lt;ref name=Hayes&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles Of Comparative Psychology |author=Hayes, Nicky |page=33 |chapter=The "selfish gene" theory |isbn=978-1317758754 |year=2014 |edition=Digital printing of 1996 |publisher=Psychology Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tsx7AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, critics argue that ''The Selfish Gene'' oversimplifies the relationship between genes and the organism. (As an example, see Thompson.&lt;ref name=Thompson2/&gt;)

''The Selfish Gene'' further popularised [[sociobiology]] in Japan after its translation in 1980.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sakura |first=Osamu |date=1 July 1998 |title=Similarities and Varieties: A Brief Sketch on the Reception of Darwinism and Sociobiology in Japan |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1006504623820 |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=341–357 |doi=10.1023/A:1006504623820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the addition of Dawkins's book to the country's consciousness, the term "meme" entered popular culture. Yuzuru Tanaka of Hokkaido University wrote a book, ''Meme Media and Meme Market Architectures'', while the psychologist [[Susan Blackmore]] wrote ''[[The Meme Machine]]'' (2000), with a foreword by Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Lectures/Japan%202005.htm |title=The Evolution of Meme Machines |authorlink=Susan Blackmore |last=Blackmore |first=Susan |date=17 May 2005 |website=Dr. Susan Blackmore |access-date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information scientist Osamu Sakura has published a book in Japanese and several papers in English on the topic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=遺伝子vsミーム―教育 |last=佐倉 |first=統 |publisher=廣済堂出版 |date=2001 |isbn=4331850056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.natureinterface.com/e/ni04/P026-029/ |title=What is the Evolution of Communication? -- Osamu Sakura |website=www.natureinterface.com |access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nippon Animation produced an educational television program titled ''[[Mīmu Iro Iro Yume no Tabi|The Many Journeys of Meme]]''.

In 1976, the ecologist [[Arthur Cain]], one of Dawkins's tutors at Oxford in the 1960s, called it a "young man's book" (which Dawkins points out was a deliberate quote of a commentator on the [[New College, Oxford]]{{efn|Dawkins's college.}} philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]]'s ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936)). Dawkins noted that he had been "flattered by the comparison, [but] knew that Ayer had recanted much of his first book and [he] could hardly miss Cain's pointed implication that [he] should, in the fullness of time, do the same."&lt;ref name="timesexcerpt" /&gt; This point also was made by the philosopher [[Mary Midgley]]: "The same thing happened to AJ Ayer, she says, but he spent the rest of his career taking back what he'd written in ''Language, Truth and Logic''. "This hasn't occurred to Dawkins", she says. "He goes on saying the same thing.""&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mary Midgley: a late stand for a philosopher with soul  |journal=The Guardian |author=Anthony, Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/23/mary-midgley-philosopher-soul-human-consciousness |date=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Wilkins and Hull,&lt;ref name="Hull2"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Wilkins, John S. |author2=Hull, David |title=Replication and Reproduction |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition) |editor=Zalta, Edward N. |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/replication/#DawRepVeh |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins' thinking has developed, although perhaps not defusing this criticism:

:"In Dawkins' early writings, replicators and vehicles played different but complementary and equally important roles in selection, but as Dawkins honed his view of the evolutionary process, vehicles became less and less fundamental... In later writings Dawkins goes even further and argues that phenotypic traits are what really matter in selection and that they can be treated independently of their being organized into vehicles....Thus, it comes as no surprise when Dawkins  proclaims that he "coined the term ‘vehicle’ not to praise it but to bury it."&lt;ref name=Bury/&gt; As prevalent as organisms might be, as determinate as the causal roles that they play in selection are, reference to them can and must be omitted from any perspicuous characterization of selection in the evolutionary process. Dawkins is far from a genetic ''determinist'', but he is certainly a genetic ''reductionist''."
::— John S Wilkins, David Hull, ''Dawkins on Replicators and Vehicles'', The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]

===Units of selection===
As to the [[unit of selection]]: "One internally consistent logical picture is that the unit of replication is the gene,...and the organism is one kind of ...entity on which selection acts directly."&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite book |title=Levels of Selection in Evolution |editor=Keller, Laurent |author1=Reeve, H. Kern |author2=Keller, Laurent  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b_iEzNFlBUC&amp;pg=PA5 |page=5 |chapter=Burying the debate over whether genes or individuals are the units of selection |isbn=978-0691007045 |year=1999 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins proposed the matter without a distinction between 'unit of replication' and 'unit of selection' that he made elsewhere: "the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even strictly the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity."&lt;ref name=Dawkins76A&gt;{{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene  |chapter=Chapter 1: Why are people? |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WkHO9HI7koEC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |edition=30th Anniversary |isbn=978-0199291144 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Dawkins, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he continues in a later chapter:

:"On any sensible view of the matter Darwinian selection does not work on genes directly. ...The important differences between genes emerge only in their ''effects''. The technical word ''phenotype'' is used for the bodily manifestation of a gene, the effect that a gene has on the body...Natural selection favours some genes rather than others not because of the nature of the genes themselves, but because of their consequences—their phenotypic effects...But we shall now see that the phenotypic effects of a gene need to be thought of as ''all the effects that it has on the world''. ...The phenotypic effects of a gene are the tools by which it levers itself into the next generation. All I am going to add is that the tools may reach outside the individual body wall...Examples that spring to mind are artefacts like beaver dams, bird nests, and caddis houses." 
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', Chapter 13, pp. 234, 235, 238

Dawkins' later formulation is in his book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]'' (1982), where the process of selection is taken to involve every possible [[Phenotype|phenotypical]] effect of a gene.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] finds Dawkins' position tries to have it both ways:&lt;ref name=GouldSJ&gt;{{cite book |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LMrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA640 |pages=640–641 |isbn=978-0674417922 |year=2002 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Dawkins claims to prefer genes and to find greater insight in this formulation. But he allows that you or I might prefer organisms—and it really doesn't matter."
::— Stephen Jay Gould, ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', pp. 640-641

The view of ''The Selfish Gene'' is that selection based upon groups and populations is rare compared to selection on individuals. Although supported by Dawkins and by many others, this claim continues to be disputed.&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;For a view opposing 'multilevel selection', see {{cite web |author=Pinker, Steven |authorlink=Steven Pinker |title=The false allure of group selection |url=http://edge.org/conversation/the-false-allure-of-group-selection |work=Edge: the online version of "The Reality Club" |publisher=John Brockman |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2015}} For a more modern (and technical) argument, see {{cite journal |title=Kin selection is the key to altruism |author1=Foster, Kevin R. |author2=Wenseleers, Tom |author3=Francis L.W.

The conflict arises in part over defining concepts: 
:"Cultural evolutionary theory, however, has suffered from an overemphasis on the experiences and behaviors of individuals at the expense of acknowledging complex group organization...Many important behaviors related to the success and function of human societies are only properly defined at the level of groups".&lt;ref name=Smaldino/&gt;

In ''[[The Social Conquest of Earth]]'' (2012), the entomologist [[E. O. Wilson]] contends that although the selfish-gene approach was accepted "until 2010 [when] Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita, and I demonstrated that inclusive fitness theory, often called kin selection theory, is both mathematically and biologically incorrect."&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Edward |title=The Social Conquest of Earth |year=2012 |publisher=Liveright Publishing |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-87140-413-8 |page=143 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StLT0zJOczkC&amp;pg=PA143}} Although it contains no reference to the "selfish gene", Wilson probably is referring to {{cite journal |title=The evolution of eusociality |author1=Nowak, M.

He criticises earlier approaches to social evolution, saying: "...unwarranted faith in the central role of kinship in social evolution has led to the reversal of the usual order in which biological research is conducted. The proven best way in evolutionary biology, as in most of science, is to define a problem arising during empirical research, then select or devise the theory that is needed to solve it. Almost all research in inclusive-fitness theory has been the opposite:  hypothesize the key roles of kinship and kin selection, then look for evidence to test that hypothesis." According to Wilson: "People must have a tribe...Experiments conducted over many years by social psychologists have revealed how swiftly and decisively people divide into groups, and then discriminate in favor of the one to which they belong." (pp.&amp;nbsp;57, 59) According to Wilson: "Different parts of the brain have evolved by group selection to create groupishness." (p.&amp;nbsp;61)

Some authors consider facets of this debate between Dawkins and his critics about the level of selection to be blather:&lt;ref name=Keller2&gt;{{cite book |title=Levels of Selection in Evolution |author1=H Kern Reeve |author2=Laurent Keller |editor=Laurent Keller |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5b_iEzNFlBUC&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |chapter=Burying the debate over whether genes or individuals are the units of selection |isbn=978-0691007045 |year=1999 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The particularly frustrating aspects of these constantly renewed debates is that, even though they seemed to be sparked by rival theories about how evolution works, in fact they often involve only rival metaphors for the very same evolutionary logic and [the debates over these aspects] are thus empirically empty."
::— Laurent Keller, ''Levels of Selection in Evolution'', p.4

Other authors say Dawkins has failed to make some critical distinctions, in particular, the difference between group selection for group advantage and group selection conveying individual advantage.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology |author=Lloyd, Elizabeth |chapter=Units and Levels of Selection |pages=54–57 |isbn=978-1139827621 |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZOgg-x4UyIC&amp;pg=PA54 |editor1=Hull, David L. |editor2=Ruse, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choice of words===
A good deal of objection to ''The Selfish Gene'' stemmed from its failure to be always clear about "selection" and "replication". Dawkins says the gene is the fundamental unit of selection, and then points out that selection doesn't act directly upon the gene, but upon 'vehicles' or 'extended phenotypes'. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] took exception to calling the gene a 'unit of selection' because selection acted only upon [[phenotype]]s.&lt;ref name="onselfishgenesinpandasthumb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1990 |chapter=Caring Groups and Selfish Genes |title=The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=72–78 |isbn=0-393-01380-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0XY7Rg_lOwC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing the Dawkins-Gould difference of view, Sterelny says:&lt;ref name=Sterelny&gt;{{cite book |title=Dawkins ''vs.'' Gould: Survival of the Fittest |author=Sterelny, Kim |isbn=978-1840467802 |publisher=Icon Books |year=2003 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=vXX8VLWaJZHSoATd5IC4Cg&amp;id=LwpFAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Gould thinks gene differences do not cause evolutionary changes in populations, they register those changes." 
::—Kim Sterelny: ''Dawkins ''vs.'' Gould'', p. 83

The word 'cause' here is somewhat tricky: does a change in lottery rules (for example, inheriting a defective gene "responsible" for a disorder) 'cause' differences in outcome that might or might not occur? It certainly alters the likelihood of events, but a concatenation of contingencies decides what actually occurs. Dawkins thinks the use of 'cause' as a statistical weighting is acceptable in common usage.&lt;ref name=DawkinsDC&gt;{{cite book |title=A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love |author=Dawkins, Richard  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loVMMlxC1XoC&amp;pg=PA106e |page=106 |chapter=§2.4 Genes aren't us |isbn=9780618485390 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Like Gould, Gabriel Dover in criticizing ''The Selfish Gene'' says:&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{cite book |title=Dear Mr. Darwin: Letters on the Evolution of Life and Human Nature |isbn=9780520227903 |year=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |author=Dover, Gabriel A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sElrZSzoLYMC&amp;pg=PA56 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It is illegitimate to give 'powers' to genes, as Dawkins would have it, to control the outcome of selection...There are no genes for interactions, as such: rather, each unique set of inherited genes contributes interactively to one unique phenotype...the true determinants of selection".
::— Gabriel Dover: ''Dear Mr. Darwin'', p. 56

However, from a comparison with Dawkins' discussion of this very same point, it would seem both Gould's and Dover's comments are more a critique of his sloppy usage than a difference of views.&lt;ref name=Keller2/&gt; Hull suggested a resolution based upon a distinction between replicators and interactors.&lt;ref name=HullDL&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hull, David L. |title=Individuality and selection |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |year=1980 |volume=11 |pages=311–32 |url=http://www.joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/Hull%201980%20-%20Individuality%20and%20Selection.pdf |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.11.110180.001523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'replicator' includes genes as the most fundamental replicators but possibly other agents, and ''interactor'' includes organisms but maybe other agents, much as do Dawkins' 'vehicles'. The distinction is as follows:&lt;ref name=HullDL/&gt;&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith&gt;{{cite journal |author=Godfrey-Smith, Peter |title=The replicator in retrospect |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=15 |year=2000 |pages=403–423 |url=http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167win10/PGS%2000%20-%20the%20replicator%20in%20retrospect.pdf |doi=10.1023/a:1006704301415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''replicator'': an entity that passes on its structure largely intact in successive replications.
:''interactor'': an entity that interacts as a cohesive whole with its environment in such a way that this interaction ''causes'' replication to be differential.
:''selection'': a process in which the differential extinction or proliferation of interactors causes the differential perpetuation of the replicators that produced them.

Hull suggests that, despite some similarities, Dawkins takes too narrow a view of these terms, engendering some of the objections to his views. According to Godfrey-Smith, this more careful vocabulary has cleared up "misunderstandings in the "units of selection" debates."&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith/&gt;

===Enactive arguments===
[[Behavioural genetics]] entertains the view:

:"that genes are dynamic contributors to behavioral organization and are sensitive to feedback systems from the internal and external environments." "Technically behavior is not inherited; only DNA molecules are inherited. From that point on behavioral formation is a problem of constant interplay between genetic potential and environmental shaping"&lt;ref name=Thiessen&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Mechanism specific approaches in behavior genetics |author=Thiessen, D.

This view from 1970 is still espoused today,&lt;ref name=Kelso&gt;{{cite book |title=Dynamic Patterns: The Self-organization of Brain and Behavior |chapter=Intentional dynamics |quote=To describe the gene as a program sending instructions to cells belittles the complexity of the gene...Moreover, genetic ''rearrangement'' occurs... as a result of normal processes. |page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpjejjytkiIC&amp;pg=PA140 |isbn=978-0262611312 |publisher=MIT Press |author=J.

[[Regulation of gene expression|Gene activation]] depends upon the cellular milieu. An extended discussion of the contrasts between enactivism and Dawkins' views, and with their support by [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]], is provided by Thompson.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind in Life:  Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind |author=[[Evan Thompson]] |chapter=Chapter 7: Laying down a path in walking: Development and evolution |pages=166 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVGna4ZEpWwC&amp;pg=PA166 |isbn=978-0674025110 |year=2007 |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mind in Life'', the philosopher Evan Thompson has assembled a multi-sourced objection to the "selfish gene" idea.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; Thompson takes issue with Dawkin's reduction of "life" to "genes" and "information":
:"Life is just bytes and bytes and bytes of digital information"&lt;ref name=DawkinsRE&gt;{{cite book |title= River out of Eden: A Darwinian View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&amp;pg=PA19 |page=19 |isbn=9780786724260 |publisher=Basic Books  |year=2008 |edition=Paperback reprint of 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"On the bank of the Oxford canal...is a large willow tree, and it is pumping downy seeds into the air...It is raining instructions out there; it's raining programs; it's raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading algorithms.

W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::— Richard Dawkins: ''The Blind Watchmaker'', p. 111

Thompson objects that the gene cannot operate by itself, since it requires an environment such as a cell, and life is "the creative outcome of highly structured contingencies". Thompson quotes Sarkar:&lt;ref name="Sarkar"/&gt;

:"there is no clear technical notion of "information" in molecular biology. It is little more than a metaphor that masquerades as a theoretical concept and ...leads to a misleading picture of the nature of possible explanations in molecular biology."
::— Sahotra Sarkar ''Biological information: a skeptical look at some central dogmas of molecular biology'', p. 187

Thompson follows with a detailed examination of the concept of [[DNA]] as a look-up-table and the role of the cell in orchestrating the DNA-to-RNA [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], indicating that by anyone's account the DNA is hardly the whole story. Thompson goes on to suggest that the cell-environment interrelationship has much to do with reproduction and inheritance, and a focus on the gene as a form of "information [that] passes through bodies and affects them, but is not affected by them on its way through"&lt;ref name=DawkinsRE1&gt;{{cite book |title= River out of Eden: A Darwinian View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxmKvnPyBSoC&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |isbn=978-0786724260 |publisher=Basic Books |year=2008 |edition=Paperback |origyear=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; is tantamount to adoption of a form of material-informational dualism that has no explanatory value and no scientific basis. (Thomson, p.&amp;nbsp;187) The [[Enactivism|enactivist]] view, however, is that information results from the probing and experimentation of the agent with the agent's environment subject to the limitations of the agent's abilities to probe and process the result of probing, and DNA is simply one mechanism the agent brings to bear upon its activity.

===Moral arguments===
Another criticism of the book is its treatment of morality, and more particularly altruism, as existing only as a form of selfishness:

:"It is important to realize that the above definitions of altruism and selfishness are ''behavioural'', not subjective. I am not concerned here with the psychology of motives...My definition is concerned only with whether the effect of an act is to lower or raise the survival prospects of the presumed altruist and the survival prospects of the presumed beneficiary." 
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 12 
:"We can even discuss ways of cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism, something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world."
::— Richard Dawkins, ''The Selfish Gene'', p. 179

The philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] has suggested this position is a variant of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] explanation of altruism as [[enlightened self-interest]], and that Dawkins goes a step further to suggest that our genetic programming can be overcome by what amounts to an extreme version of [[free will]].&lt;ref name=Midgley/&gt; Part of Mary Midgley's concern is that Richard Dawkins' account of ''The Selfish Gene'' serves as a moral and ideological justification for selfishness to be adopted by modern human societies as simply following "nature", providing an excuse for behavior with bad consequences for future human society.

Dawkins' major concluding theme, that humanity is finally gaining power over the "selfish replicators" by virtue of their intelligence, is criticized also by [[primatologist]] [[Frans de Waal]], who refers to it as an example of a "[[veneer theory]]" (the idea that [[morality]] is not fundamental, but is laid over a brutal foundation).&lt;ref name=deWaal&gt;{{cite book |last=De Waal |first=Frans |title=Primates and Philosophers: How morality evolved |quote=Dawkins waited until the very last sentence of ''The Selfish Gene'' to reassure us that, in fact, we are welcome to chuck all those genes out the window: "We alone on earth can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish gene replicators." |isbn=978-1400830336 |year=2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PccMuO2pcOcC&amp;pg=PA9 |page=9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins claims he merely describes how things are under evolution, and makes no moral arguments.{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name=DawkinsMoral&gt;An extended disclaimer is found in {{cite book |title=The Selfish Gene |chapter=Endnotes for p.2: ''I am not advocating a morality based upon evolution'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ICKantUfvoC&amp;pg=PA267 |pages=267–268 |edition=30th Anniversary |isbn=978-0199291144 |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Dawkins, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; On BBC-2 TV, Dawkins pointed to evidence for a [[Tit for tat|"Tit-for-Tat" strategy]] (shown to be successful in game theory&lt;ref name=Dugatkin2/&gt;) as the most common, simple, and profitable choice.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, Dennis (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_7sirll_RDUC&amp;pg=PA56 "The Not-So-Selfish Gene."] ''New Scientist'' 110 (24 Apr): 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the objection has been made that ''The Selfish Gene'' discusses philosophical and [[morality|moral]] questions that go beyond  biological arguments, relying upon anthropomorphisms and careless analogies.&lt;ref name= Kaye&gt;{{cite book |title=The Social Meaning of Modern Biology |last=Kaye |first=Howard L. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aDpwfE9DO0C&amp;pg=PA137 |page=137 |isbn=978-1412838962 |publisher=Transaction Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''The Selfish Gene'' was first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1976 in eleven chapters with a preface by the author and a foreword by [[Robert Trivers]].{{Sfn|Dawkins|1976}} A second edition was published in 1989. This edition added two extra chapters, and substantial endnotes to the preceding chapters, reflecting new findings and thoughts. It also added a second preface by the author, but the original foreword by Trivers was dropped. The book contains no illustrations.

The book has been translated into at least 23 languages including Arabic, Thai and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ti:The Selfish Gene au:Richard Dawkins|url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=ti%3AThe+Selfish+Gene+au%3ARichard+Dawkins&amp;fq=x0%3Abook+%3E+-mt%3Afic&amp;dblist=638&amp;fc=ln:_25&amp;qt=show_more_ln%3A&amp;cookie|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, a 30th-anniversary edition{{Sfn|Dawkins|2006}} was published with the Trivers foreword and a new introduction by the author. It was accompanied by a ''[[festschrift]]'' entitled ''[[Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think]]'' (2006). In March 2006, a special event entitled ''The Selfish Gene'': Thirty Years On was held at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Selfish Gene: Thirty years on |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS/research/projectsCurrentlyOnHold/darwin/events/sg/Home.aspx |publisher=London School of Economics |accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Audible Inc published an audiobook edition narrated by Richard Dawkins and [[Lalla Ward]].

In 2016, Oxford University Press published a 40th anniversary edition with a new epilogue, in which Dawkins describes the continued relevance of the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's eye view of evolution]] and states that it, along with [[Coalescent theory|coalescence analysis]] "illuminates the deep past in ways of which I had no inkling when I first wrote ''The Selfish Gene''...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198788607 |edition=40th Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In April 2016, ''The Selfish Gene'' was listed as number 10 on ''[[The Guardian]]'''s list of the 100 best nonfiction books, by Robert McCrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/04/100-best-nonfiction-books-10-selfish-gene-richard-dawkins |title=The 100 best nonfiction books: No 10 – The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins |first=Robert |last=McCrum |location=London |work=The Guardian |date=4 April 2016 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the book was listed as the most influential science book of all time in a poll to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the [[Royal Society]] science book prize, ahead of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' and [[Isaac Newton]]’s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/jul/20/dawkins-sees-off-darwin-in-vote-for-most-influential-science-book |title=Dawkins sees off Darwin in vote for most influential science book |date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transcellular fluid''' is the portion of [[total body water]] that represents all body fluids which are formed from the transport activities of cells. It is the smallest component of [[extracellular fluid]]. It is contained within epithelial lined spaces. It is often not calculated as a fraction of the extracellular fluid, but it is 5% of extracellular fluid (2.5% of total body water). Examples of this fluid are [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[aqueous humor|ocular fluid]] and [[synovial fluid|joint fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anaesthesiamcq.com/FluidBook/fl2_1.php Fluid Physiology: 2.1 Fluid Compartments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Physiology, 5th Ed.|last=Constanzo|first=Linda S.|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|year=2014|isbn=9781455708475|location=|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Due to the varying locations of transcellular fluid, the composition changes dramatically. Some of the electrolytes present in the transcellular fluid are [[sodium]] ions, [[chloride ion]]s, and [[bicarbonate]] ions.

== Physiological Function ==
There are also varied functions for the trans-cellular fluid. In the joints, it serves a lubrication function, while the urine allows for the removal of electrolytes and molecules from the body.

[[Virtual world]]s are playing an increasingly important role in education, especially in [[language learning]]. By March 2007 it was estimated that over 200 universities or academic institutions were involved in [[Second Life]] (Cooke-Plagwitz, p.&amp;nbsp;548).&lt;ref&gt;Cooke-Plagwitz, Jessamine (2008) "New Directions in CALL: An Objective Introduction to Second Life", ''CALICO Journal'' 25, 3: https://www.calico.org/memberBrowse.php?action=article&amp;id=716&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Miller, Linden Lab Vice President of Platform and Technology Development, claimed in 2009 that "Language learning is the most common education-based activity in Second Life".&lt;ref&gt;Team Engage, "8D taps language learners, bots, microtransactions", ''EngageDigital'', 20 May 2009: http://www.engagedigital.com/2009/05/29/out-of-stealth-8d-taps-language-learners-bots-microtransactions/&lt;/ref&gt; Many mainstream language institutes and private language schools are now using 3D [[virtual environment]]s to support language learning.

==History==
[[Virtual worlds]] date back to the adventure games and simulations of the 1970s, for example [[Colossal Cave Adventure]], a text-only simulation in which the user communicated with the computer by typing commands at the keyboard. These early adventure games and simulations led on to [[MUDs]] (Multi-user domains) and [[MOO]]s (Multi-user domains object-oriented), which language teachers were able to exploit for teaching foreign languages and intercultural understanding (Shield 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Shield L. (2003) "MOO as a language learning tool". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-dimensional virtual worlds such as ''Traveler'' and [[Active Worlds]], both of which appeared in the 1990s, were the next important development. ''Traveler'' included the possibility of audio communication (but not text chat) between avatars represented as disembodied heads in a three-dimensional abstract landscape. Svensson (2003) describes the Virtual Wedding Project, in which advanced students of English made use of ''Active Worlds'' as an arena for constructivist learning.&lt;ref&gt;Svensson P. (2003) "Virtual worlds as arenas for language learning". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adobe Atmosphere]] software platform was also used to promote language learning in the Babel-M project (Williams &amp; Weetman 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Williams C. &amp; Weetman C. (2003) Babel-M: A virtual environment for the promotion of language learning, [http://www.parapal-online.co.uk/prof/atmosphere_design.html ''Paragraph PAL''], 23 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3D world of [[Second Life]] was launched in 2003. Initially perceived as another [[role-playing game]] (RPG), it began to attract the attention of language teachers. 2005 saw the first large-scale language school, [[Languagelab.com]], open its doors in Second Life. By 2007, Languagelab.com's custom [[VoIP]] (audio communication) solution was integrated with Second Life. Prior to that, teachers and students used separate applications for voice chat.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Erard M. (2007) "A Boon to Second Life Language Schools: New Technology will Allow High-Quality Audio in a Virtual World", ''Technology Review'', 10 April 2007: http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18510/page1/&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities, such as Monash University,&lt;ref&gt;Monash University: http://www.monash.edu.au/international/dvc/virtualworlds/monashsecondlife.html&lt;/ref&gt; and language institutes, such as [[British Council|The British Council]], [[Confucius Institute]], [[Instituto Cervantes]] and the Goethe-Institut,&lt;ref&gt;Goethe-Institut: http://www.goethe.de/frm/sec/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; have islands in Second Life specifically for language learning. Many professional and research organisations support virtual world language learning through their activities in Second Life. [[EUROCALL]] and [[CALICO (consortium)|CALICO]], two leading professional associations that promote language learning with the aid of new technologies, maintain a joint Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group (VW SIG) and a headquarters in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds SIG: http://virtualworldssig.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent examples of creating sims in virtual worlds specifically for language education include VIRTLANTIS, which has been a free resource for language learners and teachers and an active community of practice since 2006,&lt;ref&gt;VIRTLANTIS: Free Virtual World Language Learning - Come speak with the world!: http://www.virtlantis.com&lt;/ref&gt; the EU-funded NIFLAR project,&lt;ref&gt;Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research (NIFLAR): http://niflar.ning.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930093225/http://niflar.ning.com/ |date=30 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the EU-funded AVALON project,&lt;ref&gt;Access to Virtual and Action Learning live ONline (AVALON): http://avalon-project.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the EduNation Islands, which have been set up as a community of educators aiming to provide information about and facilities for language learning and teaching.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;EduNation Islands wiki: http://edunation-islands.wikispaces.com/&lt;/ref&gt; NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;NIFLAR (Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research): http://niflar.ning.com/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930093225/http://niflar.ning.com/ |date=30 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other examples are described by Molka-Danielsen &amp; Deutschmann (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Molka-Danielsen J. &amp; Deutschmann M. (eds.) (2009) ''Learning and teaching in the virtual world of Second Life'', Tapir Academic Press, Trondheim, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; and Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Walker R., Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2012) Introduction to the Internet. Section 14.2.1 (Second Life) of Module 1.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-5.htm#secondlife&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007 a series of conferences known as SLanguages have taken place, bringing together practitioners and researchers in the field of language education in Second Life for a 24-hour event to celebrate languages and cultures within the 3D virtual world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slanguages.net/home.php|title=slanguages.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of second life due to increasing support for open source platforms&lt;ref&gt;Karlov, Maria (2012) "OpenSim gains record-breaking 2,177 regions",http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/09/opensim-gains-record-breaking-2177-regions/&lt;/ref&gt; many independent language learning grids such as English Grid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishgrid.com|title=keating.me Secure Email|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chatterdale&lt;ref&gt;Trombly, Anastasiahave (2012): http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/05/virtual-worlds-offer-variety-less-stress-for-language-learners/&lt;/ref&gt; have emerged.

==Approaches to language education in virtual worlds==
Almost all virtual world educational projects envisage a [[blended learning]] approach whereby the language learners are exposed to a 3D virtual environment for a specific activity or time period.  Such approaches may combine the use of virtual worlds with other online and offline tools, such as 2D virtual learning environments (e.g. [[Moodle]]) or physical classrooms. SLOODLE. for example, is an open-source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environments of Second Life and/or [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]] with the Moodle learning-management system.&lt;ref&gt;SLOODLE is a free and open source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environments of Second Life and/or OpenSim with the Moodle learning-management system: http://www.sloodle.org/moodle/&lt;/ref&gt; Some language schools offer a complete language learning environment through a virtual world, e.g. [[Languagelab.com]] and [http://www.avatarlanguages.com/home.php Avatar Languages].

Virtual worlds such as Second Life are used for the [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Canfield |title=Using Immersive Learning Environments in Foreign Language Classes: Second Life |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessamine |last=Cooke-Plagwitz |title=Conversing in the Metaverse: Language Teaching and Learning in Second Life |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and task-based, game-like&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Chan |title=Developing a Meaning-focused and Task-based Virtual Learning Reality |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; opportunities they offer language learners.  As such, virtual world language learning can be considered to offer distinct (although combinable) learning experiences.

* '''Immersive''': Immersive experiences draw on the ability to be surrounded by a certain (real or fictitious) environment that can stimulate language learning.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery A. &amp; Collins, M. (2008). Immersive Learning and Role Plays in Second Life. In K. McFerrin et al. (Eds.), Proceedings of Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education International Conference 2008 (pp. 2628-2632). Chesapeake, VA: AACE: Retrieved from http://www.editlib.org/p/27616, 2011-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Social''': Almost all 3D virtual spaces are inherently social environments where language learners can meet others, either to informally practice a language or to participate in more formal classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laurence |last=Johnson|title=Virtual Worlds: Inherently Immersive, Highly Social Learning Spaces |url=http://immersiveeducation.org/library/Immersive_Learning-Johnson_and_Levine.pdf |work=The Immersive Education Initiative |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Creative''': A less-developed approach to language learning in virtual worlds is that of constructing objects as part of a language learning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gavin |last=Dudeney |title=A Coffee with Gavin Dudeney |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLpb7f06LmI |work= Recording of live event at EduNation in Second Life |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is currently little documentation of such activities.

===Six learnings framework===
The "Six learnings framework" is a pedagogical outline developed for virtual world education in general. It sets out six possible ways to view an educational activity.&lt;ref&gt;Lim K. (2009) "Pedagogy, Education and Innovation in 3-D Virtual Worlds", '' Journal of Virtual Worlds Research 2,1'': http://journals.tdl.org/jvwr/article/view/424/466&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Exploring''': learners explore a virtual world's locations and communities as fieldwork for class.
* '''Collaborating''': learners work together within a virtual world on collaborative tasks.
* '''Being''': learners explore themselves and their identity through their presence in a virtual world, such as through role-play.
* '''Building''': learners construct objects within a virtual world.
* '''Championing''': learners promote real life causes through activities and presentations in a virtual world.
* '''Expressing''': learners represent activities within a virtual world to the outside world, through blogs, podcasts, presentations and videos.

===Learning in 3D worlds===
*''The 7 Sensibilities of Virtual Worlds for Learning'' presentation by Karl Kapp and Tony O'Driscoll illustrates how a 3D environment makes learning fundamentally different.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl &amp; O'Driscoll, Tony (2010) ''The 7 Sensibilities of Virtual Worlds for Learning'', Webinar presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3amL-BXZRk&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''3D Virtual Worlds Learning Archetypes'' presentation by Karl Kapp and Tony O'Driscoll describes 14 archetypes of how people learn in virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl &amp; O'Driscoll, Tony (2010) ''14 archetypes of how people learn in virtual worlds'', Webinar presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNjV8Fvre4U&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivist approaches===
3D virtual worlds are often used for [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] learning because of the opportunities for learners to explore, collaborate and be immersed within an environment of their choice.  Some virtual worlds allow users to build objects and to change the appearance of their avatar and of their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tuncer |last=Can |title=Learning and Teaching Languages Online: a Constructivist Approach |url=http://www.novitasroyal.org/Vol_3_1/can.pdf |work=Novitas-ROYAL |date=April 2009 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivist approaches such as [[#Task-based language learning|task-based language learning]] and [[#Dogme language teaching|Dogme]] are applied to virtual world language learning because of the scope for learners to socially co-construct knowledge, in spheres of particular relevance to the learner.

===Task-based language learning===
[[Task-based language learning]] (TBLL) has been commonly applied to virtual world language education. Task-based language learning focuses on the use of authentic language and encourages students to do real life tasks using the language being learned.&lt;ref&gt;Nunan D. (2004) ''Task-based language teaching'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks can be highly transactional, where the student is carrying out everyday tasks such as visiting the doctor at the Chinese Island of Monash University in Second Life. Incidental knowledge about the medical system in China and cultural information can also be gained at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Island is an initiative by the Chinese Studies Program at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia designed to compliment traditional classroom-based learning with context-based, hands on learning in the virtual environment of Second Life: http://www.virtualhanyu.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tasks may focus on more interactional language, such as those that involve more social activities or interviews within a virtual world.

===Dogme language teaching===
[[Dogme language teaching]] is an approach that is essentially communicative, focusing mainly on conversation between learners and teacher rather than conventional textbooks. Although Dogme is perceived by some teachers as being anti-technology, it nevertheless appears to be particularly relevant to virtual world language learning because of the social, immersive and creative experiences offered by virtual worlds and the opportunities they offer for authentic communication and a learner-centred approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Vickers |title=Dogme 2.0: What "Teaching 2.0" Can Learn from Dogme ELT |url=http://www.avatarlanguages.com/blog/dogme-elt-web20-dogme20 |work= Avatar Languages Blog |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate = 2009-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WebQuests===
Virtual world WebQuests (also referred to as SurReal Quests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Vickers |title=SurReal Quests: Enriched, purposeful language learning in Second Life |url=http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-15/surreal-quests-enriched-purposeful-language-learning-in-second-life |work=The Knowledge Tree |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2009-06-22 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605045109/http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-15/surreal-quests-enriched-purposeful-language-learning-in-second-life/ |archive-date=5 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) combine the concept of 2D WebQuests with the immersive and social experiences of 3D virtual worlds.  Learners develop texts, audios or podcasts based on their research, part of which is within a virtual world.

===Language villages===
The concept of real-life [[English village|language villages]] has been replicated within virtual worlds to create a language immersion environment for language learners in their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ton |last=Koenraad |title=How can 3D Virtual Worlds contribute to language education? |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/71947093/worldcallpdf-2 |work= Paper presented at WorldCALL 2008 |accessdate = 2011-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Digitale School has built two virtual language villages, Chatterdale (English) and Parolay (French), for secondary education students on the OpenSim grid.&lt;ref&gt;3DLES (3D Learning Experience Services): http://www.3dles.com/en/projects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual classrooms===
Hundsberger (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;18)&lt;ref&gt;Hundsberger S. (2009) ''Foreign language learning in Second Life and the implications for resource provision in academic libraries'', Arcadia Fellowship Programme, Cambridge University Library: http://arcadiaproject.lib.cam.ac.uk/docs/second_life.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; defines a virtual classroom thus:

"A virtual classroom in SL sets itself apart from other virtual classrooms in that an ordinary classroom is the place to learn a language whereas the SL virtual classroom is the place to practise a language. The connection to the outside world from a language lab is a 2D connection, but increasingly people enjoy rich and dynamic 3D environments such as SL as can be concluded from the high number of UK universities active in SL."

To what extent a virtual classroom should offer only language practice rather than teaching a language as in a real-life classroom is a matter for debate. Hundsberger's view (p.&amp;nbsp;18) is that "[...] SL classrooms are not viewed as a replacement for real life classrooms. SL classrooms are an additional tool to be used by the teacher/learner."

===Virtual tourism===
Language learning can take place in public spaces within virtual worlds. This offers greater flexibility with locations and students can choose the locations themselves, which enables a more constructivist approach.

The wide variety of replica places in Second Life, e.g. Barcelona, Berlin, London and Paris, offers opportunities for language learning through virtual tourism. Students can engage in conversation with native speakers who people these places, take part in conducted tours in different languages and even learn how to use Second Life in a language other than English.

The Hypergrid Adventurers Club is an open group of explorers who discuss and visit many different OpenSim virtual worlds. By using ''hypergrid'' connectivity, avatars can jump between completely different OpenSim grids while maintaining a singular identity and inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Hypergrid Adventurers Club: http://becunningandfulloftricks.com/hypergrid-adventurers-club/&lt;/ref&gt;

The TAFE NSW-Western Institute Virtual Tourism Project commenced in 2010 and was funded by the Australian Flexible Learning Framework's eLearning Innovations Project. It is focused on developing virtual worlds learning experiences for TVET Tourism students and located on the joycadiaGrid.&lt;ref&gt;TAFE-NSW Virtual Tourism Project: http://jokaydia.com/2010/07/20/wit-jokaydiagrid/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomous learning===
Virtual worlds offer exceptional opportunities for [[Self-paced instruction|autonomous learning]]. The video ''Language learning in Second Life: an Introduction'' by Helen Myers (Karelia Kondor in SL) is a good illustration of an adult learner's experiences of her introduction to SL and in learning Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Myers H. ''Language learning in Second Life: an Introduction'': http://kareliakondor.blip.tv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tandem learning (buddy learning)===
[[Tandem learning]], or buddy learning, takes autonomous learning one step further. This form of learning involves two people with different native languages working together as a pair in order to help one another to improve their language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Little D. (2001) "Learner autonomy and the challenge of tandem language learning via the Internet". In Chambers A. &amp; Davies G. (eds.) ''Information and Communications Technology: a European perspective'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger&lt;/ref&gt; Each partner helps the other through explanations in the foreign language. As this form of learning is based on communication between members of different language communities and cultures, it also facilitates [[intercultural learning]]. A tandem learning group, Teach You Teach Me (Language Buddies), can be found in Second Life.

===Holodecks===
The term [[holodeck]] derives from the ''Star Trek'' TV series and feature films, in which a holodeck is depicted as an enclosed room in which simulations can be created for training or entertainment. Holodecks offer exciting possibilities of calling up a range of instantly available simulations that can be used for entertainment, presentations, conferencing and, of course, teaching and learning. For example, if students of hospitality studies are being introduced to the language used in checking in at a hotel a simulation of a hotel reception area can be generated instantly by selecting the chosen simulation from a holodeck ''rezzer'', a device that stores and generates different scenarios. Holodecks can also be used to encourage students to describe a scene or to even build a scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nergiz |last=Kern |title=Holodecks and language learning |url=http://slexperiments.edublogs.org/2009/04/22/holodecks-and-language-learning  |work=Teaching in Second Life - Reflections of a language teacher |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate = 2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Holodecks are commonly used for a range of role-plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Lim |title=Pedagogy, Education and Innovation in 3-D Virtual Worlds |url=http://journals.tdl.org/jvwr/article/view/424/466 |work= Journal of Virtual Worlds Research |date=April 2009 |accessdate = 2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CAVE technology===
A [[cave automatic virtual environment]] (CAVE) is an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment where projectors are directed to three, four, five or six of the walls of a room-sized cube. The CAVE is a large theatre that sits in a larger room. The walls of the CAVE are made up of rear-projection screens, and the floor is made of a down-projection screen. High-resolution projectors display images on each of the screens by projecting the images onto mirrors which reflect the images onto the projection screens. The user will go inside the CAVE wearing special glasses to allow the 3D graphics that are generated by the CAVE to be seen. With these glasses, people using the CAVE can actually see objects floating in the air, and can walk around them, getting a realistic view of what the object would look like when they walk around it.

O'Brien, Levy &amp; Orich (2009) describe the viability of CAVE and PC technology as environments for assisting students to learn a foreign language and to experience the target culture in ways that are impossible through the use of other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, M., Levy R. &amp; Orich, A. (2009) "Virtual Immersion: The Role of CAVE and PC Technology", ''CALICO Journal'' 26, 2: https://www.calico.org/memberBrowse.php?action=article&amp;id=746&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice chat===
Earlier virtual worlds, with the exception of ''Traveler'' (1996), offered only text chat. Voice chat was a later addition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Kathleen (2006) "Voice Chat Comes to Online Games", ''Wired'', 7 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Second Life did not introduce voice capabilities until 2007. Prior to this, independent [[VoIP]] systems, e.g. [[Ventrilo]], were used. Second Life's current internal voice system has the added ability to reproduce the effect of distance on voice loudness, so that there is an auditory sense of space amongst users.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Other virtual worlds, such as ''[[Twinity]]'', also offer internal voice systems. Browser-based 3D virtual environments tend to only offer text-chat communication, although voice chat seems likely to become more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Seiler, Joey (2009) "Vivox Launches Toolbar For Browser-Based Voice Chat", ''EngageDigital'', 18 March 2009: http://www.engagedigital.com/blog/2009/03/18/vivox-launches-toolbar-for-browserbased-voice-chat/&lt;/ref&gt; Vivox&lt;ref&gt;Vivox online communications services: http://www.vivox.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the leading integrated voice platform for the social web, providing a Voice Toolbar for developers of virtual worlds and multiplayer games. Vivox is now spreading into OpenSim at an impressive rate, e.g. Avination is offering in-world Vivox voice at no charge to its residents and region renters, as well as to customers who host private grids with the company.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2011) "Avination first with Vivox voice on OpenSim", ''Hypergrid Business'', 11 March 2011: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2011/03/avination-first-opensim-grid-to-offer-vivox-voice/&lt;/ref&gt; English Grid began offering language learning and voice chat for language learners using Vivox in May, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2011)"English learning grid launched" May 7, 2012: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/05/english-learning-grid-launched/&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of voice chat in Second Life in 2007 was a major breakthrough. Communicating with one's voice is the ''sine qua non'' of language learning and teaching, but voice chat is not without its problems. Many Second Life users report on difficulties with voice chat, e.g. the sound being too soft, too loud or non-existent – or continually breaking up. This may be due to glitches in the Second Life software itself, but it is often due to individual users' poor understanding of how to set up audio on their computers and/or of inadequate bandwidth. A separate voice chat channel outside Second Life, e.g. [[Skype]], may in such cases offer a solution.

==Owning and renting land in virtual worlds==
Owning or renting land in a virtual world is necessary for educators who wish to create learning environments for their students. Educators can then use the land to create permanent structures or temporary structures embedded within [[#Holodecks|holodecks]], for example the EduNation Islands in Second Life.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The land can also be used for students undertaking building activities. Students may also use public sandboxes, but they may prefer to exhibit their creations more permanently on owned or rented land.

Some language teaching projects, for example NIFLAR, may be implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The Immersive Education Initiative revealed (October 2010) that it would provide free permanent virtual world land in OpenSim for one year to every school and non-profit organization that has at least one teacher, administrator, or student in attendance of any Immersive Education Initiative Summit.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2010) "Initiative: free land for educators migrating from Second Life", ''Hypergrid Business'', 15 October 2010:
http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2010/10/initiative-free-land-for-educators-migrating-from-second-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative 3D worlds==
Many islands in Second Life have language- or culture-specific communities that offer language learners easy ways to practise a foreign language (Berry 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Berry C. D (2009) [http://news.rutgers.edu/focus/issue.2009-04-06.1814922901/article.2009-04-07.1692917645 "Virtual reality and high-tech simulations breathe second life into language classes"], ''Focus'', Rutgers University: USA, NJ. Retrieved 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Second Life is the widest-used 3D world among members of the language teaching community, but there are many alternatives. General-purpose virtual environments such as Hangout and browser-based 3D environments such as ExitReality and 3DXplorer offer 3D spaces for social learning, which may also include language learning. [[Google Street View]] and [[Google Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Language Resource Center at UNC Charlotte |title=Google Earth Activities for Foreign Language Classes |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2496396767023982994&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=true |work=Presentation at Instructional Technology Showcase |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate = 2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also have a role to play in language learning and teaching.

''Twinity'' replicates the real life cities of Berlin, Singapore, London and Miami, and offers language learners virtual locations with specific languages being spoken. Zon has been created specifically for learners of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Zon: A multiplayer, online learning environment designed to teach Chinese language and culture through gameplay: http://enterzon.com/&lt;/ref&gt; English Grid&lt;ref&gt;English Grid: http://englishgrid.com&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by education and training professionals as a research platform for delivering English language instruction using opensim.

[[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]] is employed as free open source standalone software, thus enabling a decentralized configuration of all educators, trainers, and users. Scott Provost, Director at the Free Open University, Washington DC, writes: "The advantage of Standalone is that Asset server and Inventory server are local on the same server and well connected to your sim. With Grids that is never the case. With Grids/Clouds that is never the case. On OSGrid with 5,000 regions and hundreds of users scalability problems are unavoidable. We plan on proposing 130,000 Standalone mega regions (in US schools) with Extended UPnP Hypergrid services. The extended services would include a suitcase or limited assets that would be live on the client".&lt;ref&gt;Immersive Worlds Tool Ranking: http://immersive-worlds-tool-ranking.grouply.com/message/474&lt;/ref&gt; Such a standalone sim offers 180,000 prims for building, and can be distributed pre-configured together with a virtual world viewer using a USB storage stick or SD card. Pre-configured female and male avatars can also be stored on the stick, or even full-sim builds can be downloaded for targeted audiences without virtual world experience. This is favorable for introductory users who want a sandbox on demand and have no clue how to get started.

There is no shortage of choices of virtual world platforms. The following lists describe a variety of different virtual world platforms, their features and their target audiences:

==Virtual world conferences==
*The first SLanguages conference took place on 23 June 2007. The SLanguages conference is now a free annual 24-hours event, bringing together practitioners and researchers in the field of language education in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;SLanguages: A series of annual conferences for language teachers in Second Life: http://www.slanguages.net/home.php&lt;/ref&gt;
*SL Experiments is a group managed by Nergiz Kern (Daffodil Fargis in Second Life) for collecting and sharing ideas on how to use Second Life for teaching foreign languages. The group meets twice a month in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;SL Experiments: A group of language teachers interested in or already teaching in Second Life: http://slexperiments.pbworks.com/w/page/11306631/FrontPage&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual Round Table conference takes place twice a year, focusing on language teaching technologies. A substantial part of the conference takes place in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Round Table: A semi-annual live online conference on language learning technologies: http://www.virtual-round-table.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual Worlds Best Practices in Education (VWBPE) is a global grass-roots community event focusing on education in immersive 3D environments.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Worlds Best Practices in Education (VWBPE): http://www.vwbpe.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual Worlds Education Roundtable (VWER) group meets each week to talk about issues that concern educators with regard to using virtual worlds as a teaching and learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Worlds Education Roundtable (VWER): http://www.vwer.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Immersive Education Initiative (iED) Summits are conferences organized specifically for educators, researchers, and administrators. iED Summits consist of presentations, panel discussions, break-out sessions and workshops that provide attendees with an in-depth overview of immersive learning platforms, technologies and cutting-edge research from around the world. iED Summits feature new and emerging virtual worlds, learning games, educational simulations, mixed/augmented reality, and related teaching tools, techniques, technologies, standards and best practices.&lt;ref&gt;Immersive Education Inititiative (iED): http://mediagrid.org/summit/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual World Conference is an annual conference exploring the uses of virtual worlds for learning, collaborative work and business. The first event was held on 15 September 2010 and hosted entirely in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual World Conference: http://www.thevirtualworldconference.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond virtual worlds==
Virtual World Language Learning is a rapidly expanding field and it converges with other closely related areas, such as the use of MMOGs, SIEs and Augmented Reality Language Learning (ARLL).

===Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs)===
MMOGs (massively multiplayer online games) are also used to support language learning, for example the World of Warcraft in School project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowinschool.pbworks.com/w/page/5268731/FrontPage|title=World of Warcraft in School / FrontPage|publisher=WoWinSchool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic immersive environments (SIEs)===
SIEs are engineered 3D virtual spaces that integrate online gaming aspects.  They are specifically designed for educational purposes and offer learners a collaborative and constructionist environment. They also allow the creators/designers to focus on specific skills and pedagogical objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes J., Oskoz A. &amp; Thorne S. (2008) "Web 2.0, Synthetic Immersive Environments, and Mobile Resources for Language Education", ''CALICO Journal'' 25, 3: pp. 528-546: https://calico.org/html/article_715.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augmented reality language learning (ARLL)===
[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is the combination of real-world and computer-generated data so that computer generated objects are blended into real time projection of real life activities. Mobile AR applications, such as Blippar, [[Layar]] and [[Wikitude]] enable immersive and information-rich experiences in the real world and are therefore blurring the differences between real life and virtual worlds. This has important implications for m-Learning ([[Mobile Assisted Language Learning]]), but hard evidence on how AR is used in language learning and teaching is difficult to come by.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers H. (2009) "Augmented Reality Language Learning – virtual worlds meet m-learning", Avatar Languages Blog: http://www.avatarlanguages.com/blog/arll/&lt;/ref&gt;

The main aim is to promote social integration among users located in the same physical space, so that multiple users may access to a shared space which is populated by virtual objects while remaining grounded in the real world. In other words, it means:
*Communication
*Locked view
*Keep control
*Security

"'''Working in the Coal Mine'''" is a song with music and lyrics by the American musician and [[record producer]] [[Allen Toussaint]].  It was an international hit for [[Lee Dorsey]] in 1966, and has been recorded by other musicians including [[Devo]] in 1981.

==Lee Dorsey==
After Toussaint returned to New Orleans from the [[US Army]], in which he served from 1963 to 1965, he formed a production company, Sansu (also known as "Tou-Sea Productions"), with partner [[Marshall Sehorn]].  He produced a number of singles performed by [[Lee Dorsey]] in 1965 and 1966, including "Ride Your Pony" and "Working in the Coal Mine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=200 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123092505/http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=200 |date=November 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written, arranged and produced by Toussaint, the song concerns the suffering of a man who rises before 5 o'clock each morning in order to work in a [[coal mine]], five days a week, where the conditions are very harsh and dangerous, but which offers the only prospect of paid employment. The singer repeatedly asks the Lord, "How long can this go on?" and complains that when the weekend arrives, he's too exhausted to have any fun. In the instrumental section, as in the song's fade, he says: "Lord, I'm so tired / How long can this go on?"   The song features the sound of a [[pickaxe]] clinking, as if the musicians were working in a mine.  Says producer Allen Toussaint "There wasn’t as much percussion as you might think on there. It was a certain drummer and we had my brother hit the mic' stand with a drum stick for the pick sound. Those were the two percussion instruments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.offbeat.com/articles/masters-of-louisiana-music-allen-toussaint/|title=Masters of Louisiana Music: Allen Toussaint  - OffBeat Magazine|newspaper=OffBeat Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recording took place at [[Cosimo Matassa]] Governor Nichols Street studio in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Musicians included guitarist [[Roy Montrell]], drummer [[June Gardner|Albert "June" Gardner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/songs.php?sid=3945&amp;perfid=12047 |title=The Penguin Discography: Working In The Coal Mine |publisher=Discog.fleetwoodmac.net |date=2006-08-10 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drummerszone.com/news/article/artist-news-1-8502/in-memoriam:-albert-'june'-gardner |title=Drummerszone news - In memoriam: Albert \"June\" Gardner |publisher=Drummerszone.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bassist [[Walter Payton (musician)|Walter Payton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rosebudus.com/2009/toussaint/BrightMississippi.html|title=Allen Toussaint|website=rosebudus.com|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a hit for Lee Dorsey, released on [[Amy Records]] (catalogue number 958), and entered the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on July 23, 1966, eventually peaking at #8, while reaching #5 on the [[Billboard R&amp;B chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also reached #8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="betts"&gt;{{cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952-2004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 0-00-717931-6| page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toussaint said that neither he nor Dorsey had ever been down a coal mine: "We didn’t know anything about a coal mine".  He said of Dorsey:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He was very good to work with. Very inspiring because he had such a happiness about him. He loved what he was doing when he was singing. He was a body and fender man when he wasn’t singing and even at his peak, when he would come off the road at the end of a successful tour, he would go and get into his grease clothes, his dirty work gear and go and work on cars. Straightening out fenders and painting bodywork. But really it was his finest hour when he was singing. He was a very good person for me to work with and he totally trusted me every step of the way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/15059-allen-toussaint-interview |title=Features &amp;#124; A Quietus Interview &amp;#124; Born To Do This: Allen Toussaint Interviewed |publisher=The Quietus |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
