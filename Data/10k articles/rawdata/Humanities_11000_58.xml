      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18613">In 2013, the [[United States Department of Justice]], under [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]], came under scrutiny from the media and some members of [[113th United States Congress|Congress]] for [[subpoena]]ing phone records from the [[Associated Press]] (AP). Under similar justifications, a 2010 subpoena approved by [[Eric Holder]] implicated [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] reporter, [[James Rosen (journalist)|James Rosen]], as a possible co-conspirator under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]]. Investigators gained access to the times of his phone calls, and two days of Rosen's emails. [[Stephen Jin-Woo Kim]] eventually pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act for communicating North Korean nuclear test plans to Rosen. These investigations provoked considerable criticism from major news organizations, and precipitated the revision of media guidelines at the Department of Justice.

==Associated Press==
On May 13, 2013, the Associated Press announced telephone records for 20 of their reporters during a two-month period in 2012 had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. AP reported the Justice Department would not say why it sought the records, but news sources noted the [[United States Attorney|US Attorney's]] office for the [[District of Columbia]] was conducting a criminal investigation into a May 7, 2012 [[Associated Press]] story about a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operation which prevented the Yemeni terrorist [[Fahd al-Quso]]'s plot to detonate an explosive device on a commercial flight.&lt;ref name="RC-Ingram"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=David|title=Associated Press says U.S. government seized journalists' phone records|publisher=Reuters Canada|date=May 13, 2013|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCABRE94C0ZW20130513|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOJ did not direct [[subpoena]]s to the Associated Press; instead, the subpoenas were issued to their telephone providers, including [[Verizon Wireless]].&lt;ref name=verizonslate&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Ryan|title=Verizon Wireless Secretly Passed AP Reporters' Phone Records to Feds|publisher=www.slate.com|date=May 16, 2013|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/05/16/verizon_wireless_passed_ap_reporters_phone_records_to_the_feds.html|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AP claimed these acts were a "massive and unprecedented intrusion" into news-gathering operations.&lt;ref name=TTSanchez&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanchez|first=Raf|title=US Justice Department secretly seizes Associated Press phone records|publisher=The Telegraph|date=May 13, 2013|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/10055318/US-Justice-Department-secretly-seizes-Associated-Press-phone-records.html|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TG130513&gt;{{cite web|author=Washington (AP)|title=US government secretly obtained Associated Press phone records|publisher=The Guardian|date=May 13, 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/13/america-government-associated-press-phone-records|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary B. Pruitt|Gary Pruitt]], CEO of the Associated Press stated: "These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know."&lt;ref name=CNNJohns&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Smith and Joe Johns|title=AP blasts feds for phone records search|publisher=CNN|date=May 14, 2013|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/13/us/justice-ap-phones/?hpt=hp_t2|accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=holder&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary B.

The [[United States Attorney|US Attorney's]] office in [[District of Columbia|Washington]] responded that federal investigators seek records from news outlets only after making "every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means."&lt;ref name=CNNJohns/&gt;  Verizon neither challenged the subpoena nor did it try to alert the journalists whose records were being requested. Debra Lewis, Verizon Wireless spokeswoman, said the company "complies with legal processes for requests for information by law enforcement."&lt;ref name=verizonnyt&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Savage and Scott Shane|title=Verizon Wireless Secretly Passed AP Reporters' Phone Records to Feds|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 14, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/us/politics/facing-trio-of-crises-white-house-dodges-questions.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|publisher=www.nytimes.com|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Rosen==
On May 17, 2013, the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reported the Justice Department had monitored reporter Rosen's activities by tracking his visits to the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], through [[Trap and trace device|phone traces]], timing of calls and his personal emails in a probe regarding possible [[news leak]]s of [[Classified information in the United States|classified information]] in 2009 about North Korea.&lt;ref name=probe&gt;{{cite web|last=Marimow|first=Ann E.|title=A rare peek into a Justice Department leak probe|publisher=The Washington Post|date=May 19, 2013|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-rare-peek-into-a-justice-department-leak-probe/2013/05/19/0bc473de-be5e-11e2-97d4-a479289a31f9_story.html?tid=pm_pop|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In obtaining the warrants, they labeled Rosen a "possible co-conspirator" with [[Stephen Jin-Woo Kim|Stephen Kim]].&lt;ref name=foxrosen&gt;{{cite web|author=FoxNews.com|title=Justice Department affidavit labels Fox News journalist as possible ‘co-conspirator’|publisher=Fox News|date=May 20, 2013|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/20/justice-department-obtained-records-fox-news-journalist/|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=holderrove&gt;{{cite web|last=Rove|first=Karl|title=Did Holder mislead Congress about targeting reporters like James Rosen?|publisher=Fox News|date=May 24, 2013|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/05/24/did-holder-mislead-congress-about-targeting-reporters-like-james-rosen/|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a written statement, the Justice Department said it had followed “all applicable laws, regulations, and longstanding Department of Justice policies intended to safeguard the First Amendment interests of the press in reporting the news and the public in receiving it.”&lt;ref name=probe&gt;{{cite web|last=Marimow|first=Ann E.|title=A rare peek into a Justice Department leak probe|publisher=The Washington Post|date=May 19, 2013|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-rare-peek-into-a-justice-department-leak-probe/2013/05/19/0bc473de-be5e-11e2-97d4-a479289a31f9_story.html?tid=pm_pop|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts have described the Justice Department's actions as "aggressive investigative methods"&lt;ref name=chill&gt;{{cite web|author=Aamer Madhani and Kevin Johnson|title=Are Justice Department leak probes causing a chill?|publisher=USA Today|date=May 21, 2013|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/05/20/justice-leak-probes-cause-chill/2343827/|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn Greenwald|title=Obama DOJ formally accuses journalist in leak case of committing crimes|publisher=Guardian|date=May 20, 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/20/obama-doj-james-rosen-criminality|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have a chilling effect on news organizations' ability to play a watchdog role. Fox News contributor Judge [[Andrew Napolitano]] commented:  "This is the first time that the federal government has moved to this level of taking ordinary, reasonable, traditional, lawful reporter skills and claiming they constitute criminal behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fox News Insider|title=How Does Jay Carney Sleep at Night?|publisher=Fox News|date=May 21, 2013|url=https://web.archive.org/liveweb/http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/05/21/judge-napolitano-government-has-never-gone-level-against-reporter|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial board of the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' wrote: "With the decision to label a Fox News television reporter a possible 'co-conspirator' in a criminal investigation of a news leak, the Obama administration has moved beyond protecting government secrets to threatening fundamental freedoms of the press to gather news."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Editorial Board|title=Another Chilling Leak Investigation|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 21, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/opinion/another-chilling-leak-investigation.html?_r=0|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dana Milbank]] of the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' stated: "The Rosen affair is as flagrant an assault on civil liberties as anything done by George W. Bush’s administration, and it uses technology to silence critics in a way Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of. To treat a reporter as a criminal for doing his job — seeking out information the government doesn’t want made public — deprives Americans of the First Amendment freedom on which all other constitutional rights are based."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dana Milbank|title=In AP, Rosen investigations, government makes criminals of reporters|publisher=Washington Post|date=May 21, 2013|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-21/opinions/39419370_1_obama-administration-watergate-benghazi|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Department of Justice==
Days prior on May 15, 2013, Attorney General Holder had testified [[Perjury|under oath]] in front of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] that he had [[Judicial disqualification|recused]] himself from the leak investigations to avoid any appearance of a [[conflict of interest]]. Holder said his Deputy Attorney General, [[James M. Cole]], was in charge of the AP investigation and would have ordered the subpoenas.&lt;ref name=nbcpolitics&gt;{{cite web|last=Curry|first=Tom|title=Holder addresses AP leaks investigation, announces IRS probe|publisher=NBC News|date=May 14, 2013|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/14/18253923-holder-addresses-ap-leaks-investigation-announces-irs-probe?lite|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioning turned to the possibility of journalists being charged under the Espionage Act for reporting classified material, Holder stated: "With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I've ever been involved in, heard of or would think would be a wise policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlie Savage and Jonathon Weisman|title=Holder Faces New Round of Criticism After Leak Inquiries|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 29, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/us/politics/holder-faces-a-new-round-of-criticism.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2013, [[NBC]] confirmed with the Justice Department that Holder had personally signed off on the Rosen case. The Justice Department defended their decision and spoke about a balance between protecting national secrets and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment]], stating: "After extensive deliberations, and after following all applicable laws, regulations and policies, the Department sought an appropriately tailored search warrant under the Privacy Protection Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|title=DOJ confirms Holder OK'd search warrant for Fox News reporter's emails|publisher=NBC News|date=May 27, 2013|url=http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/23/18451142-doj-confirms-holder-okd-search-warrant-for-fox-news-reporters-emails|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelation brought into question whether Holder was being intentionally misleading during his previous testimony when he denied knowing of, or being part of possible prosecutions of journalists. House Committee members sent an open letter to Holder, saying: "It is imperative that the committee, the Congress, and the American people be provided a full and accurate account of your involvement."&lt;ref name=fnchouse&gt;{{cite web|author=FoxNews.com|title=House Republicans challenge Holder testimony on reporter surveillance|publisher=Fox News|date=May 29, 2013|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/29/prominent-liberal-attorney-turley-joins-call-for-holder-to-be-fired/|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==

Members of Congress and media figures have questioned the motivations behind the Justice Department's actions, and if they were even warranted: "For five days, reporters at the Associated Press had been sitting on a big scoop about a foiled
[[Al-Qaeda]] plot at the request of CIA officials. Then, in a hastily scheduled Monday morning meeting, the journalists were asked by agency officials to hold off on publishing the story for just one more day. The CIA officials, who had initially cited national security concerns in an attempt to delay publication, no longer had those worries, according to individuals familiar with the exchange. Instead, the Obama administration was planning to announce the successful counterterrorism operation that Tuesday. AP balked and proceeded to publish that Monday afternoon."&lt;ref name=wapoatrisk&gt;{{cite web|author=Carol D. Leonnig and Julie Tate|title=Government Spying on Fox News Reporter Even Worse Than AP case|publisher=Washington Post|date=May 15, 2013|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-question-whether-ap-leak-on-al-qaeda-plot-put-us-at-risk/2013/05/15/47003ed4-bd77-11e2-89c9-3be8095fe767_print.html|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2013, while giving a speech at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]], President and CEO of the Associated Press [[Gary Pruitt]] said: “Some longtime trusted sources have become nervous and anxious about talking with us — even on stories unrelated to national security. In some cases, government employees we once checked in with regularly will no longer speak to us by phone. Others are reluctant to meet in person... And I can tell you, that this chilling effect on newsgathering is not just limited to AP. Journalists from other news organizations have personally told me, that it has intimidated both official and nonofficial sources from speaking to them as well.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Erik Wemple|title=AP chief: Intrusive government is chilling journalism|publisher=Washington Post|date=June 19, 2013|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/06/19/ap-chief-intrusive-government-is-chilling-journalism/|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The U.S. Department of Justice undertook a comprehensive evaluation of their practices and policies regarding issuing subpoenas, [[Search warrant#United States|search warrants]] and [[court order]]s to obtain records or information from journalists, meeting with stakeholders in the news media, First Amendment advocates, and members of the Congress. The DOJ published a six-page report of the review entitled "Report on Revised Media Guidelines" on July 12, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Revised Media Guidelines|url=http://www.justice.gov/ag/news-media.pdf|work=Attorney General selected publications|publisher=US Dept of Justice|accessdate=16 April 2014|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holder said the "revised guidelines help ensure the proper balance is struck when pursuing investigations into unauthorized disclosures" and that these "reforms will make a meaningful difference". He claimed that "there are additional protections that only Congress can provide" alluding to [[Shield laws in the United States|media shield legislation]].&lt;ref name=doj&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of Attorney General Eric Holder on the Justice Department Report on Revised Media Guidelines|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/July/13-ag-783.html|work=press release 13-783|publisher=US Dept of Justice|accessdate=16 April 2014|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media lawyers involved in the negotiations of the revised guidelines called them a significant progress, but the reactions of journalists were mixed. [[David E. Sanger]], veteran chief Washington correspondent of ''The New York Times'', for example stated that the revised guidelines were “just formalizing what was observed in past administrations. The guidelines worked pretty well until the Obama administration came in.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Leonard Downie Jr. with reporting by Sara Rafsky|title=The Obama Administration and the Press|url=https://www.cpj.org/reports/2013/10/obama-and-the-press-us-leaks-surveillance-post-911.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=14 February 2015|date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, 2014 the Attorney General Eric Holder signed the final new rules that lay down the guidelines for the U.S. Department of Justice on seeking information from journalists. The Attorney General’s Order No. 3420-2014 mentions it lays down the “Policy regarding obtaining information from, or records of, members of the news media; and regarding questioning, arresting, or charging members of the news media.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Holder Signs Final Rules Regarding Obtaining Information from Journalists|url=http://www.jdjournal.com/2014/02/24/holder-signs-final-rules-regarding-obtaining-information-from-journalists/|accessdate=24 February 2014|newspaper=JD Journal|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:East-Hem 200ad.jpg|thumb|250px|Eastern Hemisphere at the end of the 2nd century AD.]]
The '''2nd century''' is the period from [[101]] to [[200]] in accordance with the [[Julian calendar]] in the [[Common Era]]. It is considered part of the [[Classical era]], epoch, or [[History by period|historical period]].

Early in the century, the [[Roman Empire]] attained its  greatest expansion under the emperor [[Trajan]], but after his death became primarily defensive for the rest of its history. Much prosperity took place throughout the empire at this time, ruled as it were by the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]], a succession of well-received and able rulers.
This period also saw the removal of the [[Jew]]s from [[Jerusalem]] during the reign of [[Hadrian]] after [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]].
The last quarter of the century saw the end of the period of peace and prosperity known as the [[Pax Romana]] at the death of the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], last of the "[[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]", and the ascension of [[Commodus]].

Although the [[Han Dynasty]] of [[China]] was firmly cemented into power and extended its imperial influence into [[Central Asia]] during the first half of the century, by the second half [[History of the Han Dynasty|there was widespread corruption]] and [[Yellow Turban Rebellion|open rebellion]]. This set in motion its ultimate decline, until it was [[End of the Han Dynasty|overthrown in 220]].

'''''A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies'''''&lt;ref&gt;Also translated and published in English as ''A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies'', among several other variants.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-es|Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias}}) is an account written by the Spanish [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] in 1542 (published in 1552) about the mistreatment of and atrocities committed against the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in colonial times and sent to then Prince [[Philip II of Spain]].&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

== Background ==
[[Bartolomé de las Casas]] explains in the prologue that his fifty years of experience in Spanish colonies in the Indies granted him both moral legitimacy and accountability for writing this account.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~daviss/work/files/presentations/casshort/|title=CASAS: A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INDIES|website=www.columbia.edu|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1516, Las Casas was granted the title of [[Protector of the Indians]] by [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Cardinal Cisneros]] after he submitted a report on their severe demographic decline due to harsh labor and mistreatment by colonial officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El protector de indios|last=Bayle|first=Constantino|publisher=Escuela de Estudios Hispano-Americanos|year=1945|isbn=|location=Seville|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time when Las Casas served as the Protector of the Indians, several clerics from [[Hieronymites|the Order of Saint Jerome]] attempted to reform certain systems which used the native populace as laborers. However, Las Casas found their attempts insufficient to protect the welfare of the Indians, and returned to Spain to appeal to the Spanish monarch in 1517.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life and Writings of Bartolomé de Las Casas.|last=Wagner; Parish|first=Henry Raup; Helen Rand|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=New Mexico|pages=109–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1517 to 1540, Las Casas traveled back and forth between Spain and Spanish colonies in Latin America numerous times, struggling to find a common ground between Spanish authorities and his own humanitarian aims to improve the conditions of Indian subjects in Spanish dominions.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; One of many purposes of his travels was to continue to protest Spanish colonial mistreatment of Indians.

In 1542, after Las Casas first wrote the chronicle later known as ''A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies'', during the hearings ordered by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] to resolve issues of forceful conversion and colonial exploitation of Indians, Las Casas presented the account before the members of the [[Council of the Indies]] as proof of atrocities committed upon Indians by colonial authorities.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

Las Casas was one of the first advocates for the indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Vacano|first=Diego|date=2012-01-01|title=LAS CASAS AND THE BIRTH OF RACE|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/hpt/2012/00000033/00000003/art00002|journal=History of Political Thought|volume=33|issue=3|pages=401–426|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published when De Las Casas was sixty-seven years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies'' is one of many books by De Las Casas that shows that he was highly persuasive and respected by the Spanish court.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joralemon|first=Donald|date=Spring 1982|title=New World Depopulation and the Case of Disease|jstor=3629951|journal=Journal of Anthropological Research|volume=38|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Short Account'' was one of the most influential sources used to attempt to improve colonial conditions for the indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The book was also one of the first texts that revealed the devastation of Old World diseases in the New World.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The book has been critiqued for centuries for its reliability about the treatment of the indigenous people and the number of indigenous people who died as a result of the mistreatment by the Spanish conquistadors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was written to persuade the Spanish king to act in response to the Spanish conquistadors' abuse of the indigenous population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a primarily persuasive text, many critics argue that facts and figures about the mistreatment and death toll were exaggerated, making the text largely unreliable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Contents ==
It was written for [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="WDL" /&gt; Las Casas appeals to the King's pathos throughout his account by describing Charles I&lt;ref name="WDL" /&gt; as a lover, cultivator and as a man of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26198156|title=A short account of the destruction of the Indies|last=1484-1566.|first=Casas, Bartolomé de las,|date=1992|publisher=Penguin Books|others=Griffin, Nigel.|isbn=9780140445626|edition=1st|location=London, England|oclc=26198156}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the stated purposes for writing the account is his fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and his concern for the souls of the Native peoples.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The account is one of the first attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict examples of unfair treatment that indigenous people endured in the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the [[Greater Antilles]], particularly the island of [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies|last=De Las Casas|first=Bartolome|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=1992|isbn=|location=London|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas takes a strong anti-colonial stance, on account of the extreme violence inflicted on the indigenous occupants of the islands by the Spaniards. He describes the extensive torture, murder, and mutilation of the Natives, referring to them as "innocent Sheep" who were "assaulted" by the Spanish colonizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/20321/pg20321-images.html|title=A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies|last=de las Casas|first=Bartolome|date=January 9, 2007|orig-year=translation originally published in 1689 |website=Project Gutenberg|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De las Casas noticed that no matter where he visited, the Spanish were committing the same crimes. On the island of Hispaniola, the Spanish were herding people into a straw building and setting fire to it, burning the occupants alive. In addition, “they sent the Males to the Mines to dig and bring away the Gold, which is an intollerable labor; but the Women they made use of to Manure and Till the ground, which is a toil most irksome even to Men of the strongest and most robust constitutions, allowing them no other food but Herbage, and such kind of unsubstantial nutriment, so that the Nursing Womens Milk was exsiccated and so dryed up, that the young Infants lately brought forth, all perished.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/20321/pg20321-images.html|title=A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies|last=de las Casas|first=Bartolome|date=January 9, 2007|orig-year=translation originally published in 1689 |website=Project Gutenberg|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Puerto Rico and Jamaica, he saw the Spanish, “with the same purpose and design they proposed to themselves in the Isle of Hispaniola, perpetrating innumerable Robberies and Villanies as before.” and that “These two Isles containing six hundred thousand at least, though at this day there are scarce two hundred men to be found in either of them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/20321/pg20321-images.html|title=A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies|last=de las Casas|first=Bartolome|date=January 9, 2007|orig-year=translation originally published in 1689 |website=Project Gutenberg|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; De las Casas also notes that what the Spanish were doing drove many natives to commit suicide. On Cuba, “By the ferocity of one Spanish Tyrant (whom I knew) above Two Hundred Indians hang'd themselves of their own accord; and a multitude of People perished by this kind of Death” and “Six Thousand Children and upward were murder'd, because they had lost their Parents who labour'd in the Mines.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/20321/pg20321-images.html|title=A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies|last=de las Casas|first=Bartolome|date=January 9, 2007|orig-year=translation originally published in 1689 |website=Project Gutenberg|page=4|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
''A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies'' is a book that marks a significant moment in the way 21st century colonial Latin American historians would address world history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By comparing what historians know today about colonial Latin America, with the descriptions and recommendations given by De Las Casas in ''A Short Account'', they are able to understand more about De Las Casas' own biases, prejudices, and outlook on the colonization of the Americas. De Las Casas' ''A Short Account'', was a revised history of the conquest, in the way that he includes facts that would aid him in his argument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; De Las Casas' ''A Short Account'', revealed the ways 16th century scholars used rhetoric to lobby for changes during the Spanish colonization of the Americas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His book, ''A Short Account'', complicated the humanitarian and ethical arguments made in the 16th century by empathizing with indigenous people while recommending the use of enslaved African people in the Americas. De Las Casas supported the overall Spanish colonial experiment in the Americas, while condemning the abuse of the indigenous people.

De Las Casas used the term “New World” to look at the Americas and Western hemisphere and did not use the term or idea of the “ancient world” as a way to describe the Spain, Europe and the Eastern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This linguistic shift marked a transition in historical text and thought by moving away from the medieval view of geography and world history to a more modern view.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; De Las Casas addressed the new population in the Americas and introduced it in a political way in addressing the Spanish King.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; De Las Casas introduced and presented the people of the Americas in the context of the Spanish empire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

De Las Casas is also noted as one of the first writers and thinkers to racialize the indigenous people of the Americas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his attempt to defend the indigenous people, he argues that they are part of the human race by describing their bodies, skin color, language and culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In ''A Short Account'', De Las Casas racialized the indigenous people and created a new understanding for them in the context and hierarchy of European ideas of race.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His account was largely responsible for the passage of the new Spanish colonial laws known as the [[New Laws|New Laws of 1542]], which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history and led to the [[Valladolid debate]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} This text was used as a way to convince the King of Spain of the cruelties caused by the Spanish Conquistadors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, he did not focus or mention the effects of disease as a cause of suffering for the native people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Instead, De Las Casas focused on the suffering caused by the Spanish conquistadors so that the King would address the conquistador’s behavior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It was republished in 1620, by [[Jan Evertszoon Cloppenburch]], alongside the book ''Origin and progress of the disturbances in the Netherlands'' by Dutch historian [[Johannes Gysius]].&lt;ref name="WDL" /&gt; The book was frequently reprinted, alone or in combination with other works, in the Netherlands and in other countries struggling against the power of Spain in Europe and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/515/|title=Mirror of the Cruel and Horrible Spanish Tyranny Perpetrated in the Netherlands, by the Tyrant, the Duke of Alba, and Other Commanders of King Philip II|date=1620-01-01|website=www.wdl.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images described by Las Casas were later depicted by [[Theodor de Bry]] in copper plate engravings that helped expand the [[Black Legend]] against Spain.

== Reliability ==
The purpose of ''A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies'' was to convince the King of Spain to take action on the mistreatment of the indigenous people of the Americas. De Las Casas has been accused by many scholars{{cn|date=August 2018}} about making exaggerated claims in terms of the death toll and mistreatment of the indigenous people.   

Today, it is known that Old World diseases and the lack of immunity caused a large number of indigenous deaths.

The reason why De Las Casas did not mention the number of indigenous deaths caused by old world diseases is not a political one. During the 1400s, people did not know what caused disease or how it spread. The discovery of germs wasn't until the 1500s, and their association with diseases was not even accepted by the medical profession until the 1900s. 

It is important to look at ''A Short Account'' as an important observation of what was happening to the indigenous people at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors, instead of only looking at it as an example of rhetoric or propaganda.

== Rhetorical strategy ==
''A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies'' is a book that is acclaimed by scholars for its rhetorical effect. De Las Casas juxtaposes the inhumane mistreatment of the Spanish conquistadors with the inherent goodness of the indigenous people in an exaggerated manner in his strategy of persuasion. His text largely uses an emotionally persuasive argument instead of a logical argument in ''A Short Account'' in his effort to convince the King of Spain. De Las Casas revised and re-edited this book in order to make his best argument in favor of the indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

__NOTOC__
[[Image:Wurdi Youang.jpg|thumb|A small part of the Wurdi Youang stone arrangement]]

'''Aboriginal stone arrangements''' are a form of [[rock art]] constructed by [[Indigenous Australians]]. Typically, they consist of stones, each of which may be about 30&amp;nbsp;cm in size, laid out in a pattern extending over several metres or tens of metres. Notable examples have been made by many different [[Australian Aboriginal culture]]s, and in many case are thought to be associated with spiritual ceremonies.

Particularly fine examples are in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], where the stones can be very large (up to 1 metre high). For example, the stone arrangement at [[Wurdi Youang]] consists of about 100 stones arranged in an egg-shaped oval about 50m across. Each stone is well-embedded into the soil, and many have "trigger-stones" to support them. The appearance of the site is very similar to that of the [[megalithic]] [[stone circles]] found throughout [[Great Britain|Britain]] (although the function and culture are presumably completely different). Although its association with [[Indigenous Australians]] is well-authenticated and beyond doubt, the purpose is unclear, although it may have a connection with initiation rites. It has also been suggested that the site may have been used for [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy|astronomical]] purposes (Morieson 2003). Other well-known examples in Victoria include the stone arrangements at [[Carisbrook stone arrangement|Carisbrook]] and [[Lake Bolac stone arrangement|Lake Bolac]].&lt;ref&gt;Long, A. &amp; Schell, P., 1999, Lake Bolac stone arrangement (AAV 7422-394); management plan. An unpublished report to Aboriginal Affairs Victoria.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's largest collection of standing stones is said to be at [[Murujuga]], also known as the Burrup peninsula or the Dampier archipelago, in [[Western Australia]], which includes tall standing stones similar to the European [[menhir]]s, as well as circular stone arrangements.

[[Image:Macassan stone arrangement.jpg|thumb|Part of the Yirrkala stone arrangement representing a Macassan fishing boat]]
A very different example is found near [[Yirrkala]] in [[Arnhem Land]], where there are detailed images of the [[prau]]s used by [[Macassan]] fisherman fishing for [[Holothuroidea|Trepang]], several hundred years before European contact. Here the stones are small (typically 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm), sit on the surface of the ground, and can easily be moved by hand, which also implies that they can be easily damaged or altered by modern hands, so that caution is needed when interpreting such sites. Similar examples are found scattered throughout Australia, mainly in remote or inaccessible places, and it is likely that there were many more prior to European settlement of Australia.

In South East Australia are found [[Bora (Australian)|Bora rings]] which consist of two circles of stones, one larger than the other, which were used in an [[initiation ceremony]] and [[rite of passage]] in which boys were transformed into men.

Some Aboriginal stone arrangements in south-east Australia are aligned to [[cardinal directions]] with an accuracy of a few degrees,&lt;ref&gt;Orientations of linear stone arrangements in New South Wales [http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rnorris/papers/n278.pdf Hamacher et al., 2013, Australian Archaeology, 75, 46-54]&lt;/ref&gt;
while the [[Wurdi Youang]] stone arrangement, which indicates the direction of solstitial sunsets, appears to have been built around the east-west direction, again with an accuracy of a few degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Wurdi Youang: An Australian Aboriginal Stone Circle with possible solar indications [http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rnorris/papers/n258.pdf Norris et al., 2013, Rock Art Research, 30, 55-65.]&lt;/ref&gt; This requirement for highly accurate direction is also indicated by the practice of orienting the graves of deceased Kamilaroi men to an accuracy of a few degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Further Notes on the Australian Class Systems [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2842513 A. W. Howitt and Lorimer Fison, 1889, J. Anthropol. Inst. of Great Britain and Ireland, 18, 31-70]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Angry white male"''' is a pejorative expression{{refn|name=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dent |first1=Susie |title=The Language Report |date=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-860860-8 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Language_Report.html?id=0-lZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22angry+white+male%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[white male]]s holding [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] to [[reactionary]] views in the context of [[politics of the United States|U.S. politics]], typically characterized by "opposition to [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] anti-discriminatory policies" and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary |quote=angry white male n.

== Development ==
The term was popularized in reference to a political voting bloc which emerged in the early 1990s as a reaction to perceived injustices faced by white men in the face of affirmative action quotas in the workplace. Angry white men are characterised as having animosity toward young people, women or minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Angry White Men: American Masculinity and the End of an Era|author=Michael S. Kimmel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of [[Donald Trump]] have been described by some political commentators as angry white men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-donald-trump-angry-white-males-20160823-story.html|title=The beginning of the end of angry white males|last=Bloomberg|newspaper=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/donald-trumps-vote-bank-angry-white-males-with-no-college-degrees/articleshow/53428529.cms|title=Donald Trump's vote bank: Angry white males with no college degrees - The Economic Times|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/how-angry-white-male-wayne-allyn-root-knows-that-trump-has-deep-support-among-black-voters/|title=How 'Angry White Male' Wayne Allyn Root Knows That Trump Has Deep Support Among Black Voters {{!}} Right Wing Watch|newspaper=Right Wing Watch|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/why-angry-white-men-love-calling-people-cucks|title=Why Angry White Men Love Calling People 'Cucks'|last=Schwartz|first=Dana|date=2016-08-01|newspaper=GQ|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Australia==
The rhetoric of the angry white man is not limited to the United States. It appeared during Australia's [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 federal elections]].&lt;ref name=Sawer1999&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sawer|first=Marian|date=1999|title=EMILY'S LIST and angry white men: Gender wars in the nineties|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443059909387494|journal=Journal of Australian Studies|volume=23|issue=62|pages=1–9|doi=10.1080/14443059909387494}}&lt;/ref&gt; New political parties appeared in that election due to the preexisting [[fathers' rights movement in Australia]]. These included the Abolish Family Support/Family Court Party and the Family Law Reform Party.&lt;ref name=Sawer1999/&gt; Similar to the usage of the term in the United States, the Australian men categorized as angry white men opposed what they perceived as the feminist agenda. These political parties were created as a reaction to the historic number of women elected to the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=Sawer1999/&gt; Members of these groups claimed that "feminists have entrenched themselves in positions of power and influence in government and are using their power to victimise men".&lt;ref name=Sawer1999/&gt;

The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] (major centre-right) senator [[Eric Abetz]], arguing against [[Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975]], says it's "passing strange" that the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] does not seem to care about what he perceives as "racist terminology" such as angry white man but it does care if another color is used to describe someone: "One cannot help but think that the term 'white' can only refer to skin colour and therefore [you] are making reference to a skin colour [and] one assumes it must have been on the basis of race that the comment was made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/15/eric-abetz-says-the-phrase-angry-white-man-is-racial-vilification|title=Eric Abetz says the phrase 'angry white man' is racial vilification|first1=Gareth|last1=Hutchens|first2=Paul|last2=Karp|date=15 August 2016|accessdate=9 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The term is applied to those believed to be opposed to the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[second-wave feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosin, Hanna (November 24, 2013) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/angry-white-men-by-michael-kimmel.html "Even Madder Men: 'Angry White Men,' by Michael Kimmel" (review)] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The movies ''[[Joe (1970 film)|Joe]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[George Packer]], [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2012/02/poor-white-and-republican.html "Poor, White, and Republican"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', February 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Falling Down]]'', ''[[God Bless America (film)|God Bless America]]'', and [[Clint Eastwood]]'s performances in both the ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' series and ''[[Gran Torino (film)|Gran Torino]]'' have been described as definitive explorations of the angry white man.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Romney, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/gran-torino-clint-eastwood-117-mins-15-1628608.html "Gran Torino, Clint Eastwood: The screen legend plays an angry old man at war with the city of Detroit"], ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', February 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Senaga, [http://honoluluweekly.com/film/current-film/2009/01/angry-white-man/ "Angry white man: Clint Eastwood channels ghosts from past films in Gran Torino"], ''[[Honolulu Weekly]]'', January 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeday.com/2016/11/18/angry-white-men-on-film-seven-times-cinema-got-to-the-trump-vote-before-us/|title=Angry white men on film: Seven times cinema got to the Trump vote before us {{!}} Cambridge Day|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the protagonist of ''[[Falling Down]]'' (a divorced, laid-off defense worker who descends via chance and choice into a spiral of increasing rage and violence) was widely reported upon as a representative of the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Zc0e8caLkEC |pages=61–5 |title=Critical race narratives |first1=Carl Scott |last1=Gutiérrez-Jones |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8147-3145-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is puzzled by where he ended up and asks, "I'm the Bad Guy? (Police Sergeant 'Yeah') How'd that happen? I did everything they told me to. Did you know I build missiles? I helped to protect America. You should be rewarded for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Douglas|first=Michael|title=Falling Down|date=1993-02-26|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106856/trivia?tab=qt&amp;ref_=tt_trv_qu|last2=Duvall|last3=Hershey|last4=Ticotin|first2=Robert|first3=Barbara|first4=Rachel|accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the TV sitcoms ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]'' "turned the angry white male into a cultural icon", according to [[CBS News]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/farewell-archie/ Farewell Archie]. CBS News.&lt;/ref&gt; The actor [[Carroll O'Connor]] who played Archie Bunker said paraphrasing [[James Baldwin]], "The American white man is trapped by his own cultural history. He doesn't know what to do about it."&lt;ref name=Hano1972&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/03/12/archives/can-archie-bunker-give-bigotry-a-bad-name-archie-bunker-and-bigotry.html|title=Can Archie Bunker Give Bigotry A Bad Name?|last=Hano|first=Arnold|date=1972-03-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-28|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor goes on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Archie's dilemma is coping with a world that is changing in front of him. He doesn't know what to do, except to lose his temper, mouth his poisons, look elsewhere to fix the blame for his own discomfort. He isn't a totally evil man. He's shrewd. But he won't get to the root of his problem, because the root of his problem is himself, and he doesn't know it. That is the dilemma of Archie Bunker.&lt;ref name=Hano1972/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Bookstore tourism''' is a type of [[cultural tourism]] that promotes [[independent bookstores]] as a group travel destination.  It started as a [[grassroots]] effort to support locally owned and operated bookshops, many of which have struggled to compete with large bookstore chains and online retailers.

Those who promote bookstore tourism encourage schools, libraries, reading groups and other miscellaneous organizations to create day-trips and literary outings to cities and towns with a concentration of independent bookstores.  Groups of various sizes around the U.S. have offered such excursions, usually via a chartered bus, and often incorporating book signings, author home tours and historical sites.  They also encourage local booksellers to attract bibliophiles to their communities by employing bookstore tourism as an [[economic development]] tool.  Others benefiting include local retailers, restaurants, bus companies and travel professionals.  The effort also provides organizations with an outreach opportunity to support reading and [[literacy]].  

The bookselling, publishing, and motorcoach industries have recognized the concept's potential as a group travel niche and marketing tool.

The main bodies were hewn directly from the [[sandstone]] cliffs, but details were modeled in mud mixed with straw, coated with [[stucco]].

The lower parts of the statues' arms were constructed from the same mud-straw mix supported on wooden armatures. It is believed that the upper parts of their faces were made from great wooden masks or casts. The rows of holes that can be seen in photographs held wooden pegs that stabilized the outer stucco.

Bamiyan lies on the [[Silk Road]], which runs through the [[Hindu Kush]] mountain region, in the Bamiyan Valley. The Silk Road has been historically a caravan route linking the markets of China with those of the Western world. It was the site of several [[Buddhist monasteries]], and a thriving center for religion, philosophy, and art. Monks at the monasteries lived as [[hermit]]s in small caves carved into the side of the Bamiyan cliffs. Most of these monks embellished their caves with religious statuary and elaborate, brightly colored [[fresco]]es. It was a Buddhist religious site from the 2nd century up to the time of the [[Islam]]ic invasion in the later half of the 7th century. Until it was completely conquered by the [[Muslim]] [[Saffarids]] in the 9th century, Bamiyan shared the culture of [[Gandhara]].

[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|right|Taller Buddha in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction]]

The two most prominent statues were the giant standing sculptures of Buddhas [[Vairocana]] and [[Sakyamuni]], identified by the different [[mudras]] performed. The Buddha popularly called "Solsol" measured 53 meters tall, and "Shahmama" 35 meters—the niches in which the figures stood are 58 and 38 meters respectively from bottom to top.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;Research of state and stability of the rock niches of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in [http://www.unibw.de/bauv5/forschung/abgeschlossene_forschungsvorhaben/buddha "Completed Research Results of Military University of Munich"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032715/http://www.unibw.de/bauv5/forschung/abgeschlossene_forschungsvorhaben/buddha |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/template/doc/antalya/120.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216070456/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/template/doc/antalya/120.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 December 2013 |title=Computer Reconstruction and Modeling of the Great Buddha Statue in Bamiyan, Afghanistan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being blown up in 2001 they were the largest examples of standing Buddha carvings in the world (the 8th century [[Leshan Giant Buddha]] is taller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/779 |title=Mount Emei Scenic Area, including Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that statue is sitting).

Plans for the construction of the Spring Temple Buddha were announced soon after the blowing up of the Bamiyan Buddhas and China condemned the systematic destruction of the Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan.

[[File:BamyanBuddha Smaller 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Smaller Buddha in 1977]]

It is believed that the monumental Buddha sculptures were carved into the cliffs of Bamiyan between the 3rd to 6th centuries AD, while the cave complex in the east, including the 38 meter Buddha, a stupa was built in the 3rd or 4th centuries AD. The 55 meter Buddha is believed to date from the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Historic documentation refers to celebrations held every year attracting numerous pilgrims and that offers were made to the monumental statues (http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/208rev.pdf). They were perhaps the most famous cultural landmarks of the region, and the site was listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] along with the surrounding cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamiyan Valley. Their color faded through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110225122816.htm |title=Bamiyan Buddhas Once Glowed in Red, White and Blue |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese Buddhist pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited the site on 30 April 630 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Yamada, Meiji (2002).

He also noted that both Buddha figures were "decorated with gold and fine jewels" (Wriggins, 1995). Intriguingly, Xuanzang mentions a third, even larger, reclining statue of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="gall1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="laputanlogic"/&gt; A monumental seated Buddha, similar in style to those at Bamiyan, still exists in the [[Bingling Temple]] caves in China's [[Gansu]] province.

The destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas became a symbol of oppression and a rallying point for the freedom of religious expression. Despite the fact that most Afghans are now Muslim, they too had embraced their past and many were appalled by the destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hazaristantimes.wordpress.com/2009/06/04/bamyan-series/ |title=Buddhas of Bamiyan |publisher=Hazaristantimes.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=TIM MCGIRK/Bamiyan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,238674,00.html |title=What Lies Beneath |publisher=Time.com |date=20 May 2002 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on the Buddha's statue===

====11th to the 20th century====
In 1221, with the advent of [[Genghis Khan]], "a terrible disaster befell Bamiyan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/afghanistan/bamiyan.html |title=Bamiyan and Buddhism Afghanistan |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kashgar.com.au/articles/Remembering-Bamiyan |title=Remembering Bamiyan |publisher=Kashgar.com.au |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004201837/http://www.kashgar.com.au/articles/Remembering-Bamiyan |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the statues were spared. Later, the Mughal emperor, [[Aurangzeb]], tried to use heavy artillery to destroy the statues. Another attempt to destroy the Bamiyan statues was made by the 18th century Persian king [[Nader Shah|Nader Afshar]], directing cannon fire at them.&lt;ref&gt;''Asian Art'', chap. "History of attacks on the Buddhas"&lt;/ref&gt;

The enormous statues, the male Salsal ("light shines through the universe") and the (smaller) female Shamama ("Queen Mother"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christian-frei.info/dvd/christian_frei-booklet_en.pdf |title=booklet web E.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they were called by the locals, did not fail to fire the imagination of Islamic writers in centuries past. The larger statue reappears as the malevolent giant Salsal in medieval Turkish tales.&lt;ref&gt;Laban Kaptein, ''Eindtijd en Antichrist'', p. 127. Leiden 1997. {{ISBN|90-73782-89-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1997 to 2001, under the Taliban====
Abdul Wahed, a Taliban commander operating around the area, announced his intention to blow up the Buddhas in 1997, even before he had taken control of the valley. In 1998 when he battled off the [[Hizb-i-Wahdat]] militia from the area and took control of Bamiyan, Wahed drilled holes in the Buddhas' heads for explosives. He was prevented from taking further action by the local governor and a direct order of [[Mohammed Omar]], although tires were later burned on the head of the great Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Michael [http://aan-afghanistan.com/index.asp?id=1538 ''Why the Buddhas of Bamian were destroyed''], [[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1999, Mullah Mohammed Omar issued a decree in favor of the preservation of the Bamiyan Buddha statues. Because Afghanistan's Buddhist population no longer exists, and the statues were no longer worshipped, he added: "The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors. The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but protected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Harding| first = Luke| date = 3 March 2001| title = How the Buddha got his wounds| publisher = The Guardian| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/03/books.guardianreview2| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228113747/http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0%2C4273%2C4145138%2C00.html| archivedate = 28 February 2006| accessdate = 23 March 2008| location = London| deadurl = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2000, local Taliban authorities asked for UN assistance to rebuild drainage ditches around tops of the alcoves where the Buddhas were set.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Michael [http://aan-afghanistan.com/index.asp?id=1538 Why the Buddhas of Bamian were destroyed], [[Afghanistan Analysts Network]] 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Afghanistan's radical clerics began a campaign to crack down on "un-Islamic" segments of Afghan society. The Taliban soon banned all forms of imagery, music, and sports, including television, in accordance with what they considered a strict interpretation of [[Sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Destruction of Statues Displayed in an Islamic State| publisher = Ask-Imam.com| first = Moulana Imraan| last= Vawda |url = http://www.islam.tc/ask-imam/view.php?q=3436| accessdate = 6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, the statues were destroyed by the Taliban of Mullah Omar following a decree issued by him. The Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar explained why he ordered the statues to be destroyed in an interview:
{{quote|I did not want to destroy the Bamiyan Buddha. In fact, some foreigners came to me and said they would like to conduct the repair work of the Bamiyan Buddha that had been slightly damaged due to rains. This shocked me. I thought, these callous people have no regard for thousands of living human beings - the Afghans who are dying of hunger, but they are so concerned about non-living objects like the Buddha. This was extremely deplorable. That is why I ordered its destruction. Had they come for humanitarian work, I would have never ordered the Buddha's destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mohammad Shehzad |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/apr/12inter.htm |title=The Rediff Interview/Mullah Omar|date=3 March 2001|work=The Rediff|accessdate=27 October 2010 | location=Kabul}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Information and Culture Minister Qadratullah Jamal told [[Associated Press]] of a decision by 400 religious clerics from across Afghanistan declaring the Buddhist statues against the tenets of Islam. "They came out with a consensus that the statues were against Islam," said Jamal.

According to UNESCO Director-General [[Koïchiro Matsuura]], a meeting of ambassadors from the 54 member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) was conducted. All OIC states—including [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], three countries that officially recognised the Taliban government—joined the protest to spare the monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 March 2001| title = World appeals to Taliban to stop destroying statues| publisher = CNN| url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/03/afghan.buddhas.03/index.html| accessdate = 6 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224155700/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/03/afghan.buddhas.03/index.html |archivedate = 24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia and the UAE later condemned the destruction as "savage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 March 2001 |first=Barry |last=Bearak |title=Over World Protests, Taliban Are Destroying Ancient Buddhas |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/world/04AFGH.html?ex=1218686400&amp;en=f513bb4edae409e0&amp;ei=5070 |accessdate=13 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302192951/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/04/world/04AFGH.html?ex=1218686400&amp;en=f513bb4edae409e0&amp;ei=5070 |archivedate=2 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[India]] never recognised the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, [[New Delhi]] offered to arrange for the transfer of all the artifacts in question to India, "where they would be kept safely and preserved for all mankind".

Initially, the statues were fired at for several days using anti-aircraft guns and artillery. This caused severe damage, but did not obliterate them. During the destruction, Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal lamented that, "This work of destruction is not as simple as people might think. You can't knock down the statues by shelling as both are carved into a cliff; they are firmly attached to the mountain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/12/afghan.buddha.02/ |title=Photos document destruction of Afghan Buddhas |accessdate=2007-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313235406/http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/12/afghan.buddha.02/ |archivedate=13 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Taliban placed anti-tank mines at the bottom of the niches, so that when fragments of rock broke off from artillery fire, the statues would receive additional destruction from particles that set off the mines. In the end, the Taliban lowered men down the cliff face and placed explosives into holes in the Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2104119/entry/2104187|title=Destruction and Rebuilding of the Bamyan Buddhas |publisher=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; After one of the explosions failed to obliterate the face of one of the Buddhas, a rocket was launched that left a hole in the remains of the stone head.&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;Bergen, Peter.

On 6 March 2001, ''[[The Times]]'' quoted Mullah Mohammed Omar as stating, "Muslims should be proud of smashing idols. It has given praise to Allah that we have destroyed them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Markos Moulitsas Zúniga |coauthors= |title=American Taliban: How War, Sex, Sin, and Power Bind Jihadists and the Radical Right |year=2010 |publisher=Polipoint Press |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Cdx6yTUFxIC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;ots=Hl1nwYSxkK&amp;sig=rG9zIIyemmmJytx4C5aP6fpP8Js&amp;ei=D_niTJ6OK8SjnQfH6-zWDg&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA&amp;q=%22Muslims%20should%20be%20proud%20of%20smashing%20idols%22 |isbn=1-936227-02-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 13 March interview for Japan's [[Mainichi Shimbun]], Afghan Foreign Minister [[Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel]] stated that the destruction was anything but a retaliation against the international community for economic sanctions: "We are destroying the statues in accordance with Islamic law and it is purely a religious issue."

On 18 March 2001, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that a Taliban envoy said the Islamic government made its decision in a rage after a foreign delegation offered money to preserve the ancient works. The report also added, however, that other reports "have said the religious leaders were debating the move for months, and ultimately decided that the statues were idolatrous and should be obliterated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Crossette| first = Barbara|date=19 March 2001| title = Taliban Explains Buddha Demolition| publisher = The New York Times| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/world/19TALI.html?ex=1142571600&amp;en=e5ba6c267eada53a&amp;ei=5070| accessdate = 6 January 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090503215139/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/world/19TALI.html?ex=1142571600&amp;en=e5ba6c267eada53a&amp;ei=5070|archivedate=3 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then Taliban [[ambassador-at-large]] [[Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi]] said that the destruction of the statues was carried out by the Head Council of Scholars after a Swedish monuments expert proposed to restore the statues' heads. Hashimi is reported as saying: "When the Afghan head council asked them to provide the money to feed the children instead of fixing the statues, they refused and said, 'No, the money is just for the statues, not for the children'. Herein, they made the decision to destroy the statues"; however, he did not comment on the claim that a foreign museum offered to "buy the Buddhist statues, the money from which could have been used to feed children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kassaimah |first=Sahar |date=12 January 2001 |title=Afghani Ambassador Speaks At USC |publisher=[[IslamOnline]] |url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-03/13/article12.shtml |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008012138/http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2001-03/13/article12.shtml |archivedate=8 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas despite protests from the international community has been described by Michael Falser, a heritage expert at the Center for Transcultural Studies in Germany, as an attack by the Taliban against the globalising concept of "cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;Falser, Michael. "The Bamiyan Buddhas, performative iconoclasm and the 'image' of heritage". In: Giometti, Simone; Tomaszewski, Andrzej (eds.): ''The Image of Heritage. Changing Perception, Permanent Responsibilities.'' Proceedings of the International Conference of the ICOMOS International Scientific Committee for the Theory and the Philosophy of Conservation and Restoration. 6–8 March 2009 Florence, Italy. Firenze 2011: 157-169.&lt;/ref&gt; The director general of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Koichiro Matsuura called the destruction a "...crime against culture. It is abominable to witness the cold and calculated destruction of cultural properties which were the heritage of the Afghan people, and, indeed, of the whole of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=81406&amp;page=1#.UA4FSrQe5TI U.N. Confirms Destruction of Afghan Buddhas], 12 March 2001, ABC News.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commitment to rebuild==
{{BuddhasHolySites}}

Though the figures of the two large Buddhas have been destroyed, their outlines and some features are still recognizable within the recesses. It is also still possible for visitors to explore the monks' caves and passages that connect them. As part of the international effort to rebuild Afghanistan after the Taliban war, the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] and several other organizations—among them the Afghanistan Institute in [[Bubendorf]], Switzerland, along with the [[ETH]] in [[Zurich]]—have committed to rebuilding, perhaps by [[anastylosis]], the two larger Buddhas.

===Developments since 2002===
In April 2002, Afghanistan's post-Taliban leader [[Hamid Karzai]] called the destruction a "national tragedy" and pledged the Buddhas to be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/04/09/gen.karzai.bamiyan/index.html|title=CNN.com - Karzai pledges to rebuild Afghan Buddhas - April  9, 2002|first=Staff and|last=wires|website=edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, [[Mawlawi Mohammed Islam Mohammadi]], Taliban governor of Bamiyan province at the time of the destruction and widely seen as responsible for its occurrence, was elected to the Afghan Parliament. He blamed the decision to destroy the Buddhas on [[Al-Qaeda]]'s influence on the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;''Focus on Terrorism, Volume 8'' by Edward V. Linden&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, he was assassinated in Kabul.

Swiss filmmaker [[Christian Frei]] made a 95-minute documentary titled ''[[The Giant Buddhas]]'' (released in March 2006) on the statues, the international reactions to their destruction, and an overview of the controversy. Testimony by local Afghans validates that [[Osama Bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]] ordered the destruction and that, initially, Mullah Omar and the Afghans in Bamiyan opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=28 March 2006 |title=Laden ordered Bamyan Buddha destruction |work=[[The Times of India]] |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1466974.cms |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506154952/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1466974.cms |archivedate=6 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A novel titled 'An Afghan Winter' provides a fictional backdrop to the destruction of the Buddhas and its impact on the global Buddhist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/rajesh-talwar/afghan-winter/|title=AN AFGHAN WINTER by Rajesh Talwar - Kirkus Reviews|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, international funding has supported recovery and stabilization efforts at the site. Fragments of the statues are documented and stored with special attention given to securing the structure of the statue still in place. It is hoped that, in the future, partial [[anastylosis]] can be conducted with the remaining fragments. In 2009, [[ICOMOS]] constructed scaffolding within the niche to further conservation and stabilization. Nonetheless, several serious conservation and safety issues exist and the Buddhas are still listed as [[World Heritage in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;Petzet, Michael (2010). "Safeguarding the Buddhas of Bamiyan". In Christoph Machat, Michael Petzet and John Ziesemer (Eds.), {{cite web |url=http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/world_report/2008-2010/H@R_2008-2010_final.pdf |title=Heritage at Risk: ICOMOS World Report 2008-2010 on Monuments and Sites in Danger}}. Berlin: hendrik Bäßler verlag, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2006, Afghan officials were deciding on the timetable for the re-construction of the statues. As they wait for the Afghan government and international community to decide when to rebuild them, a $1.3 million UNESCO-funded project is sorting out the chunks of clay and plaster—ranging from boulders weighing several tons to fragments the size of tennis balls—and sheltering them from the elements.

The Buddhist remnants at Bamiyan were included on the 2008 [[World Monuments Watch]] List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the [[World Monuments Fund]].

In 2013, the foot section of the smaller Buddha was rebuilt with iron rods, bricks and concrete by the German branch of ICOMOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martini |first1=Alessandro |last2=Rivetti |first2=Ermanno |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Organisation says actions of German archaeologists who have partially rebuilt one of the statues "border on the criminal" |url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com:80/articles/Unesco-stops-unauthorised-reconstruction-of-Bamiyan-Buddhas/31660 |newspaper=[[The Art Newspaper]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115033225/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Unesco-stops-unauthorised-reconstruction-of-Bamiyan-Buddhas/31660 |archive-date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=2017-12-17 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further constructions were halted by order of UNESCO, on the grounds that the work was conducted without the organization's knowledge or approval.

==Discoveries==
[[File:BAMIYAN BUDDHAS - GROTTO PAINTINGS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Grotto painting in 2008]]
After the destruction of the Buddhas, 50 caves were revealed. In 12 of the caves, wall paintings were discovered.&lt;ref name="earth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/200569,scientists-discover-first-ever-oil-paintings-in-afghanistan.html|title=Scientitsts discover first-ever oil paintings in Afghanistan|publisher=Earthtimes.org|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, an international team of researchers stated the wall paintings at Bamiyan were painted between the 5th and the 9th centuries, rather than the 6th to 8th centuries, citing their analysis of radioactive isotopes contained in straw fibers found beneath the paintings. It is believed that the paintings were done by artists travelling on the Silk Road, the trade route between [[China]] and the West.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt;

Scientists from the [[Tokyo Research Institute for Cultural Properties]] in Japan, the [[Centre of Research and Restoration of the French Museums]] in France, the Getty Conservation Institute in the United States, and the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF) in [[Grenoble]], France, analysed samples from the paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080422083309.htm|title=Ancient Buddhist Paintings From Bamyan Were Made Of Oil, Hundreds Of Years Before Technique Was 'Invented' In Europe|publisher=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm across.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; They discovered that the paint contained [[pigment]]s such as vermilion (red [[mercury sulfide]]) and lead white ([[lead carbonate]]). These were mixed with a range of binders, including natural resins, gums (possibly animal skin glue or egg),&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; and oils, probably derived from walnuts or poppies.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt; Specifically, researchers identified drying oils from murals showing Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures as being painted in the middle of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="earth"/&gt; It is believed that they are the oldest known surviving examples of [[oil painting]], possibly predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries.&lt;ref name="paint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2008/04/22/sciart122.xml |title=Oil painting invented in Asia, not Europe |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=24 April 2008 |location=London |first=Roger |last=Highfield |date=22 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423165040/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=%2Fearth%2F2008%2F04%2F22%2Fsciart122.xml |archivedate=23 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }} However, the press release picked up by media, clearly misdates the earliest uses of oil paint in Europe, which is fully described in a treatise by [[Theophilus Presbyter]] of 1100-1120, and may date back to the Ancient Romans. See: Rutherford John Gettens, George Leslie Stout, 1966, Courier Dover Publications, {{ISBN|0-486-21597-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bdQVgKWl3f4C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=oil+painting+Theophilus&amp;sig=oEkZ_FzY5mTDvyXr-FE9GLyZu-o Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopedia (online text)], p. 42 {{cite web |url=http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost12/Theophilus/the_da00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411000138/http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost12/Theophilus/the_da00.html |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery may lead to a reassessment of works in ancient ruins in Iran, China, Pakistan, Turkey, and India.&lt;ref name="paint"/&gt;

Initial suspicion that the oils might be attributable to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition,&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080422/full/news.2008.770.html|title=Ancient Buddhas painted in oils|publisher=nature.com|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was dispelled by [[spectroscopy]] and [[chromatography]] giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt; Oils were discovered underneath layers of paint, unlike surface contaminants.&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

Scientists also found the translation of the beginning section of the original [[Sanskrit]] [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] Sutra translated by [[Xuanzang]] that spelled out the basic belief of Buddhism and said all things are transient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=37,3417,0,0,1,0 |title=Secret sutra found in rubble of Bamiyan Buddha |publisher=Buddhistchannel.tv |date=12 November 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Another giant statue unearthed===
On 8 September 2008, archaeologists searching for a legendary 300-metre statue at the site announced the discovery of parts of an unknown {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=on}} [[Parinirvana|reclining Buddha]], a pose representing Buddha's [[Parinirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110820235540/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iMwnIv89hH3Q7rvdzmDQH9zCL6KA New Bamiyan Buddha find amid destruction], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], 8 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Cultural Landscape and Archaeological Remains of the Bamiyan Valley-109153.jpg|thumb|caution sign, 2017]]
The UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan cultural projects convened to discuss what to do about the two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in [[Paris]]. Researcher Erwin Emmerling of [[Technical University Munich]] announced he believed it would be possible to restore the smaller statue using an [[Organic compound|organic]] [[silicon]] [[Chemical compound|compound]].&lt;ref name="restoration"&gt;[http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/01/researchers-say-they-can-restore-1-of-destroyed-bamiyan-buddhas/?icid=maing%7Cmain5%7Cdl1%7Csec1_lnk2%7C47607 Researchers Say They Can Restore 1 of Destroyed Bamiyan Buddhas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305032019/http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/01/researchers-say-they-can-restore-1-of-destroyed-bamiyan-buddhas/?icid=maing%7Cmain5%7Cdl1%7Csec1_lnk2%7C47607 |date=5 March 2011 }}. [[AOL|AOL News]], 1 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamiyan site. These included leaving the larger Western niche empty as a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/749 Expert Working Group releases recommendations for Safeguarding Bamiyan] 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of [[anastylosis]], where original elements are combined with modern material. It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration. The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Harison, Emma (16 May 2012)[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/16/stone-carvers-taliban-bamiyan ''Stone carvers defy Taliban to return to the Bamiyan valley''] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] (ICOMOS).

The work has come under some criticism. It is felt by some, such as human rights activist Abdullah Hamadi, that the empty niches should be left as monuments to the fanaticism of the Taliban, while [[NPR]] reported that others believe the money could be better spent on housing and electricity for the region.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kakissis|first=Joanna|title=Bit By Bit, Afghanistan Rebuilds Buddhist Statues|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/27/137304363/bit-by-bit-afghanistan-rebuilds-buddhist-statues?ft=1&amp;f=1004|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, including Habiba Sarabi, the provincial governor, believe that rebuilding the Buddhas would increase tourism which would aid the surrounding communities.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

===Rise of Buddhas with 3D light projection===
After fourteen years, on 7 June 2015, a Chinese adventurist couple Xinyu Zhang and Hong Liang filled the empty cavities where the Buddhas once stood with [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] [[laser light]] projection technology. The projector used for the installation, worth approximately $120,000, was donated by Xinyu and Hong, who were saddened by the destruction of the statues. With the desire of paying tribute, they requested permission from [[UNESCO]] and the [[Afghan government]] to do the project. About 150 local people came out to see the unveiling of the [[holographic]] statues on Sunday, 7 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Mary-Ann Russon|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/buddha-statues-destroyed-by-taliban-resurrected-laser-projections-1505794 |title= Afghanistan: Buddhas of Bamiyan resurrected as laser projections | publisher=International Business Times |date= 12 June 2015| accessdate= 16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= PAULA MEJIA|url=http://www.newsweek.com/afghanistan-buddha-statues-destroyed-taliban-reimagined-holograms-343113 |title= Afghanistan Buddha Statues Destroyed by Taliban Reimagined as Holograms | publisher=News Week |date= 15 June 2015| accessdate= 16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="639">'''Certosina''' is a decorative art technique used widely in the [[Italian Renaissance]] period. Similar to [[marquetry]], it uses small pieces of wood, bone, metal, or mother-of-pearl to create inlaid geometric patterns on wood. The term comes from [[Certosa di Pavia|Certosa Church in Pavia]], where the technique was used in ornamenting an altarpiece.

      <comment>Changing [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]] from "Will of the people as source of political authority" to "Will of the people as source of political legitimacy" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16104">{{short description|Will of the people as source of political legitimacy}}
In [[political philosophy]], the phrase '''consent of the governed''' refers to the idea that a [[government]]'s [[political legitimacy|legitimacy]] and [[natural and legal rights|moral right]] to use state power is only justified and lawful when consented to by the people  or [[society]] over which that [[political power]] is exercised. This theory of [[consent]] is historically contrasted to the [[divine right of kings]] and had often been invoked against the legitimacy of [[colonialism]]. Article 21 of the United Nation's 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government".

==History==
In his 1937 book ''[[A History of Political Theory]]'', [[George Sabine]] collected the views of many political theorists on consent of the governed. He notes the idea mentioned in 1433 by [[Nicholas of Cusa]] in ''De Concordantia Catholica''. In 1579 [[Theodore Beza]] wrote ''Vindiciae contra Tyrannos'' which Sabine paraphrases: "The people lay down the conditions which the king is bound to fulfill. Hence they are bound to obedience only conditionally, namely, upon receiving the protection of just and lawful government…the power of the ruler is delegated by the people and continues only with their consent."&lt;ref name=Sabine&gt;George Sabine (1937) A History of Political Theory, [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|381}} In England, the [[Levellers]] also held to this principle of government.

[[John Milton]] wrote
{{quote|The power of kings and magistrates is nothing else, but what is only derivative, transferred and committed to them in trust from the people, to the common good of them all, in whom the power yet remains fundamentally, and cannot be taken from them, without a violation of their natural birthright.&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|510}}&lt;ref&gt;John Milton ''Works'' V: 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, Sabine notes the position of [[John Locke]] in ''Essay concerning Human Understanding'': 
{{quote|[Civic power] can have no right except as this is derived from the individual right of each man to protect himself and his property. The legislative and executive power used by government to protect property is nothing except the natural power of each man resigned into the hands  of the community…and it is justified merely because it is a better way of protecting natural right than the self-help to which each man is naturally entitled.&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|532}} }}

However, with [[David Hume]] a contrary voice is heard. Sabine interprets Hume's [[skepticism]] by noting
{{quote|The political world over, absolute governments which do not even do lip-service to the fiction of consent are more common than free governments, and their subjects rarely question their right except when tyranny becomes too oppressive.&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|603}}}}

Sabine revived the concept from its status as a [[political myth]] after Hume, by referring to [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Green wrote that government required "will not force" for administration.  As put by Sabine,&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|731}}
{{quote|Even the most powerful and the most despotic government cannot hold a society together by sheer force; to that extent there was a limited truth to the old belief that governments are produced by consent.}}

Consent of the governed, within the [[social liberalism]] of T. H. Green, was also described by [[Paul Harris (public servant)|Paul Harris]]:
{{quote|The conditions for the existence of a political society have less to do with force and fear of coercion than with the members' mutual recognition of a good common to themselves and others, although it may not be consciously expressed as such. Thus for the conditions for any civil combination to disappear through resistance to a despotic government or disobedience to law would require such a disastrous upheaval as to be unlikely in all but the most extreme circumstances in which we might agree with Green that the price would be too high to pay, yet sufficiently rare to allow us to acknowledge that there would ordinarily be a moral duty to act to overthrow any state that did not pursue the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harris (1982) "Green’s theory of political obligation and disobedience", pp 127 to 142 in ''The Philosophy of T. H. Green'', Andrew Vincent editor, [[Gower Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-566-05104-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In the United States==
"Consent of the governed" is a phrase found in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

Using thinking similar to that of [[John Locke]], the founders of the [[United States]] believed in a state built upon the consent of "free and equal" citizens; a state otherwise conceived would lack [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and [[Rational-legal authority]]. This was expressed, among other places, in the 2nd paragraph of the Declaration of Independence (emphasis added):&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.htm{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that [[all men are created equal]], that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]].--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the {{em|consent of the governed}}, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in the earlier [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], especially Section 6, quoted below, founding father [[George Mason]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That elections of members to serve as representatives of the people, in assembly, ought to be free; and that all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, the attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage, and cannot be taxed or deprived of their property for public uses without their own consent, or that of their representatives so elected, nor bound by any law to which they have not, in like manner, assented, for the [[public interest|public good]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Virginia Declaration of Rights|Virginia Declaration of Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the [[Continental Congress]] at the outset of the [[American Revolution]] had no explicit legal authority to govern,&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, Ch. 34, p.353 [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;rgn=full%20text;idno=AAN2921.0007.001;didno=AAN2921.0007.001;view=image;seq=00000363 (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; it was delegated by the states with all the functions of a national government, such as appointing ambassadors, signing treaties, raising armies, appointing generals, obtaining loans from Europe, issuing paper money (called "Continentals"), and disbursing funds. The Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and was required to request money, supplies, and troops from the states to support the war effort. Individual states frequently ignored these requests. According to the ''Cyclopædia of Political Science''. New York: Maynard, Merrill, and Co., 1899, commenting on the source of the Congress' power:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The appointment of the delegates to both these congresses was generally by popular conventions, though in some instances by state assemblies. But in neither case can the appointing body be considered the original depositary of the power by which the delegates acted; for the conventions were either self-appointed "committees of safety" or hastily assembled popular gatherings, including but a small fraction of the population to be represented, and the state assemblies had no right to surrender to another body one atom of the power which had been granted to them, or to create a new power which should govern the people without their will. The source of the powers of congress is to be sought solely in the acquiescence of the people, without which every congressional resolution, with or without the benediction of popular conventions or state legislatures, would have been a mere ''brutum fulmen''; and, as the congress unquestionably exercised national powers, operating over the whole country, the conclusion is inevitable that the will of the whole people is the source of national government in the United States, even from its first imperfect appearance in the second continental congress...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of consent==

===Unanimous consent===
A key question is whether the [[unanimous consent]] of the governed is required; if so, this would imply the [[right of secession]] for those who do not want to be governed by a particular collective. All democratic governments today allow decisions to be made even over the dissent of a minority of voters, which in some theorists' view, calls into question whether said governments can rightfully claim, in all circumstances, to act with the consent of the governed.&lt;ref name=Cassinelli/&gt;

===Hypothetical consent===
The theory of hypothetical consent of the governed holds that one's obligation to obey government depends on whether the government is such that one ''ought'' to consent to it, or whether the people, if placed in a [[state of nature]] without government, would agree to said government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hanna |last1=Pitkin |year=1966 |title=Obligation and Consent—II |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=39–52 |jstor=1953805 |doi=10.2307/1953805}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been rejected by some scholars{{Who|date=May 2015}}, who argue that since government itself can commit aggression, creating a government to safeguard the people from aggression would be similar to the people, if given the choice of what animals to be attacked by, trading "[[weasel|polecats]] and foxes for a lion", a trade that they would not make.&lt;ref name=Bookman/&gt;

===Overt versus tacit consent===

Another division that is sometimes made is between [[overt consent]] and [[tacit consent]]. Overt consent, to be valid, would require [[voluntariness]], a specific act on the part of the consenters, a particular act consented to, and specific agents who perform this action. [[Immigrating]] into a particular jurisdiction is sometimes regarded as an overt act indicating consent to be ruled by that jurisdiction's government. Not all who are ruled by a particular government have immigrated to that jurisdiction, however; some were born there; however others argue that the power to emigrate from (i.e. leave) a jurisdiction ''implies'' such consent omission.

It has been pointed out that in jurisdictions where [[proportional representation]] is not used, but candidates are instead elected by [[plurality vote]], a candidate can be elected despite the overt dissent of a majority of the people. Not every voter has necessarily had an opportunity to vote on the constitutional provisions specifying that plurality voting should be used; according to some theorists, this calls into question whether said voters have consented to be governed by the candidates who obtain plurality support. A counterargument is that, by failing to act through the process of [[constitutional amendment]] to change such provisions, the people have consented to them. A rebuttal to this is that in some jurisdictions, the means of amending the constitution are not completely in the hands of the electorate; the same issues arise, in claiming that the constitution left in place by the decisions of the people's elected representatives is consented to by the people, as arise in claiming that any other actions taken by said representatives are consented to by the people. Some proponents of the "overt consent" theory hold that the act of voting implies consent, while others question the connection between voting and consenting to a particular scheme of representative, since some voters may oppose the system as a whole but desire to influence decisions on particular issues or candidates.&lt;ref name=Cassinelli&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/106591295901200202 |title=The 'Consent' of the Governed |year=1959 |last1=Cassinelli |first1=C. W. |journal=Political Research Quarterly |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=391–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of tacit consent of the governed holds that if the people live in a country that is not undergoing a rebellion, they have consented to the rule of that country's government.&lt;ref name=Bookman&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1984.tb01750.x |title=Locke's Contract: Would People consent to It? |year=1984 |last1=Bookman |first1=John T. |journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=357–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this likewise meets with the criticism that tacit consent is incompatible with ''express'' opposition: i.e. the People cannot consent if they have no ''right'' to refuse.

===Engineered consent===
In 1988, [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] described a [[propaganda model]] of [[news media in the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Herman &amp; Noam Chomsky (1988) [[Manufacturing Consent]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which coverage of [[current events]] was skewed by [[corporations]] and the [[state (polity)|state]] in order to manufacture the consent of the governed. According to the propagandist [[Edward L. Bernays]], the public may be manipulated by its subconscious desires to render votes to a political candidate. The [[public relations]] techniques were described in his essay and book ''[[The Engineering of Consent]]'' (1955). Consent thus obtained undermines the legitimacy of government: "The basic principle involved is simple but important: If the opinions of the public are to control the government, these opinions must not be controlled by the government."&lt;ref&gt;John C. Livingston &amp; Robert G. Thompson (1966) ''The Consent of the Governed'', 2nd edition, page 457, [[Collier Macmillan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literal consent===
The theory of literal consent holds the logical position that valid consent must denote final authority belonging to the people, rather than elected officials, therefore this implies that the people have the absolute sovereign power to overrule their government at any time via popular vote (or as stated in the Declaration of Independence, "the right of the People to alter or abolish" their government). Without this unfettered power, theorists hold that true consent cannot exist and that any government is therefore despotism via governing the people by force without their actual consent.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CwG-books-Neale-Donalnd-Walsch-photo-by-Gil-Dekel.jpg|thumb|UK edition of 'Conversations with God' books (Book 1 is known as the 'blue cover'.)]] --&gt;
'''''Conversations with God''''' ('''''CwG''''') is a sequence of books written by [[Neale Donald Walsch]]. It was written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and [[God]] answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsch|first=Neale Donald|authorlink=Neale Donald Walsch|title=Conversations with God|year=1995|type=Paperback|ISBN=0-399-14278-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book of the ''Conversations with God'' series, ''Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue'', was published in 1995 and became a publishing phenomenon, staying on ''[[The New York Times Best Sellers List]]'' for 137 weeks.  The succeeding volumes in the nine book series also appeared prominently on the List.

In an interview with [[Larry King]], Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working.  After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: "Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zechner/cwg/lkl-ndw.html Neale Donald Walsch on CNS's ''Larry King Live''] (April 7th, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down.  The ensuing dialogue became the ''Conversations with God'' books. When asked in a recent interview how does he ‘open up’ to God these days, Neale stated “I am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/creative-thoughts/being-at-one-neale-donald-walsch-interview-with-gil-dekel-phd-part-1-of-3  'Being at One': Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel, PhD (Part 1 of 3), Paragraph 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of the dialogue ==
Containing nearly 3,000 pages of material in total, the series presents a large number of ideas.  The second and third books in the original trilogy deal with political and social issues.

=== CwG's basic messages ===
In ''Friendship with God'', Walsch writes that God presents four concepts which are central to the entire dialogue:

# We are all one.
# There's enough.
# There's nothing we have to do.
# Ours is not a better way, ours is merely another way.
# God is a collective, that is, there are many Gods and Goddesses who have been delegated some work each, respectively.

[[Existence]] is essentially [[Nondualism|non-dual]] in nature. At the highest level there is no separation between anything and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God.  The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us.  The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto Itself, has no need of anything and therefore has no requirements of [[World population|humanity]]. The final concept puts an end to our need to always be right. Given that we have and are everything, and there's nothing we ''have'' to do, there are an ''infinite'' number of ways to experience this, not just the ''one'' way we may have chosen so far.

According to the books, God recommends many [[Economy|economic]] and [[social]] changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world, it recommends that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also speak of [[reincarnation]] and the existence of life on other planets.

=== God's motive for creation ===
In Walsch's first dialogue, God notes that "knowing" and "experiencing" oneself are different things. Before creation, there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully, without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love, since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in [[myriad]] ways because everything is one.

This present creation then, in Walsch's viewpoint, is established by and within God, so that [[sentience]] can exist which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than just "know" itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. Walsch claims that God says that we have a common interest in keeping the game going, for there is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules, because all experience is subjective, and is chosen. But within this, there are ways that (it is stated and implied) people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, actions are either working or they are not working. A thing is either [[wikt:functional|functional]] or [[dysfunctional]], not right or wrong. These rememberings take place over "time" and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes.

=== Nature of the dialogue ===

Book 1 (page 4) argues that words are not the ultimate truth, rather words are symbols, and are open to interpretations. Thus the readers are advised to consult their own inner knowing or intuition to determine their own truth while reading the book, or any other book. Though the books bear the title ''Conversations with God'' and the author states in book 1 that he is "taking dictation" from God, the 'dialogue' is said to be between God and all people at all times. The question, according to Neale, is not to whom does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with people in many ways (the next song you hear, the next sunset you experience, the next time you hear laughter, the next movie that really moves you), and not necessarily through words 'spoken' by God to a person. "All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me." (CwG1, page 58). [[Jesus]] is said to have sought to lead by example, which is why he said, "I am the way and the life, follow me". Follow me meant that we should follow his example and become one with God - Jesus and other living things are/were not one with God presently (everything is happening right now with no space/time difference) - rather than become his followers. Jesus is supposed to have said, "I and the Father (God) are one and you are my brethren". This means that living things are all one (particles of the collective God) (Book 3, Chapter20, pgs. 329-330). Jesus is said to have said, "without the father (God), I am nothing". The father of all is pure thought which is the energy of life (Book 3, Chapter11, pg. 180). In Book 3 of ''Conversations with God'' (1998), by [[Neale Donald Walsch]], it is mentioned that [[Mahavatar Babaji]] may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], Jesus and other humans.&lt;ref&gt;Walsch, Neale Donald, ''Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3)'', page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; When Neil asks God if reincarnation is a false doctrine, God replies that it is not. Neale then asks why some religions do not know the truth about something so basic. In response, God says that we must understand that humans have many fear based religions whose teachings surround the doctrine of a God who is to be worshipped and feared. It was through fear that the entire Earth society reformed itself from a matriarchy into a patriarchy. It was through fear that the holy priests got people to mend their wicked ways and heed the word of the Lord. It was through fear that the churches gained and controlled their membership. Churches even insisted that God will punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday, not going to church was declared a sin - and not just any church. One had to attend one particular church - if you went to a church of a different denomination that too was a sin. That was an attempt at control, pure and simple, using fear. The amazing thing is it worked. People will always believe in hell and in a God who would send them there as long as we believe that God is like man &amp;mdash; ruthless, self-serving, unforgiving and vengeful. In the past, most people could not imagine a God who might rise above all of that so they accepted the teachings of many churches to fear the terrible vengeance of the Lord. It was as if people could not trust themselves to be good and act appropriately, on their own by their own built in reasons. So they had to create a religion that taught the doctrine of an angry, retributive God in order to keep themselves in line. The idea of reincarnation threw a monkey wrench into all of that. The church was proclaiming that you better be nice or else&amp;mdash;and along came the reincarnationists saying you have another chance after this and another chance after that and still more chances, so don't worry. Do the best you can. Don't become so paralysed with fear that you can't budge. Promise yourself to do better and get on with it. Naturally, the early Church couldn't hear of such a thing that did two things. First, it denounced the doctrine of reincarnation as heretical, then it created the sacrament of confession. Confession could do for the Church goer what reincarnation promised. That is, give him another chance. There was a catch however - this absolution could not come directly from God, it had to flow through the church whose priests pronounced penances which had to be performed. These were usually prayers which were required of the sinner. So now you had two reasons to keep up church membership. The church found confession to be such a good drawing card that soon it declared to be a sin not to go to confession. Everybody had to do it at least once a year. If they didn't, God would have another reason to be angry. More and more rules - many of them arbitrary and capricious - began to be promulgated by the church, each rule having the power of God's eternal condemnation behind it, unless, of course, failure was confessed and then the person was forgiven by God and condemnation avoided. That lead to another problem. People figured out that this must mean they could do anything as long as they confessed it. The church was in a quandary. Fear had left the hearts of the people. Church attendance and membership dropped. People came to confess once a year, said their penances, were absolved of their sins and went on with their lives. There was no question about it. A way had to be found to strike fear into the heart again, so purgatory was invented. Purgatory was described as a place something like hell, but not eternal. This new doctrine declared that God would make you suffer for your sins even if you confessed them. Under the doctrine, a certain amount of suffering was decreed by God for each nonperfect soul, based on the number and type of sins committed. There were mortal sins and venial sins. Mortal sins would send you right to hell if not confessed before death. Once more, Church attendance shot up, collections were up, too and especially contributions&amp;mdash;for the doctrine of purgatory could buy one's way out of the suffering. According to the church's teaching, one could receive a special indulgence but not directly from God - only from an official of the church. These special indulgences freed one from the suffering in purgatory which they had earned with their sins or at least part of it. These reprieves were granted to very few like those who made a  huge contribution to the church. For a really huge sum, one could obtain a plenary indulgence. This meant no time in purgatory at all - it was a non-stop ticket straight to heaven. This special favor from God was available for even fewer. Royalty, perhaps and the super rich. The amount of money, jewels and land given to the church in exchange for these plenary indulgences was enormous. The exclusivity of this brought great frustration and resentment to the masses. The poorest peasant had no hope of gaining a bishop's indulgence and so the rank and file lost faith in the system with attendance threatening to drop once again. Then they brought in the novena candles. People could come to the church and light a novena candle for the poor souls in purgatory and by saying a novena (a series of prayers in a particular order that took some time to complete), they could reduce by many years the sentence of the dearly departed, extricating them from purgatory sooner than God would otherwise have allowed. They couldn't do anything for themselves but at least they could pray for mercy for the departed. Of course, it would be helpful if a coin or two were dropped through the slot for each candle lit. A lot of little candles were flickering behind a lot of red glass and a lot of pesos and pennies were being dropped into a lot of tin boxes in an attempt to get God to ease up on the suffering being inflicted on the souls in purgatory (Book 3, Chapter7, pgs. 126-130).

== Parallels in other belief systems ==
In the dialogue many philosophical ideas are presented that had already been advanced earlier by major Eastern and Western thinkers, but Walsch presents the information in language for modern readers and does not specifically cite any of these philosophers. In fact, Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the latter volumes, Walsch and "God" acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity, but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly, and put into this cohesive unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch's writings are also mirrored within other well known spiritual writings and traditions:

* All things are one, there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. ([[The Law of One]]/[[Advaita]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Souls reincarnate to eventually experience God-realization ([[Hinduism]]/' '[[Bhagavad-Gita]]/[[Sikhism]]'' ).
* Feelings are more important as a source of guidance than intellect ([[Rousseau]]/[[Sikhism]]).
* We are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know ([[Hinduism]]/[[Plato]]/[[Sikhism]]).
* Physical reality is an illusion ([[Hinduism]]/ [[Buddhism]]'s concept of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''/[[Sikhism]]).
* One cannot understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite (''[[Tao Te Ching]]'').
* God is everything. ([[Hinduism]] / [[Spinoza]] / [[Brahman]]/[[Sikhism]])
* God is self-experiential, in that it is the nature of the Universe to experience itself. ([[Hinduism]]/[[Hegel]]/[[Sikhism]], and process theology as first outlined by [[Alfred North Whitehead]])
* God is not fear-inducing or vengeful, only our parental [[Psychological projection|projections]] onto God are. ([[Sikhism]])
* Fear or love are the two basic alternative perspectives on life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insight.poeticmind.co.uk/12-application/12-2-space-pt-4-of-6/  'Inspiration: a functional approach to creative practice', Paragraph 2]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Drewermann]])
* Good and evil do not exist (as absolutes, but can exist in a different context and for different reasons). ([[Nietzsche]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Reality is a representation created by will. ([[Schopenhauer]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Nobody knowingly desires evil. ([[Socrates]]/[[Sikhism]])

{{Leninism sidebar|expanded=Concepts}}
"'''Dual Power'''" ({{lang-rus|Двоевластие|r=Dvoyevlastiye}}) was a term first used by [[Communism|communist]] [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870-1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=The Dual Power|date=April 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/may/20.htm|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|title=Has Dual Power Disappeared?|date=May 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1930/hrr/ch11.htm|first=Leon|last=Trotsky|title=Dual Power|date=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described a situation in the wake of the [[February Revolution]], the first of two [[Russian Revolution]]s in that tumultuous year of [[1917]]. Two powers coexisted with each other and competed for legitimacy: the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] ([[workers councils]]), particularly the [[Petrograd Soviet]], and the continuing official state apparatus of the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] of democratic socialists.

Lenin argued that this essentially unstable situation constituted a unique opportunity for the Soviets and Bolsheviks to seize power by smashing the weak tottering Provisional Government and establishing themselves as the basis of a new form of state power.

This notion has informed the strategies of subsequent [[communist]]-led revolutions elsewhere in the world, including the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] of 1949 led by [[Mao Zedong]] (1893-1976) after the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927-1931 and 1946-1949) and in [[eastern Europe]] after [[World War II]] (1939-1945), such as in [[Czechoslovakia]] where after three years of post-war agitation and occupation by the invading Russian [[Red Army]] finally overthrew a moderate government with the Communists seizing power in 1948.

== Background ==
After [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] abdicated the throne, the resulting [[February Revolution]] led to the establishment of the Provisional Government and its counterpart, the [[Petrograd Soviet]]. The Provisional Government was composed of former State Duma representatives with approval from the Petrograd Soviet, whereas the Petrograd Soviet was made up of socialist leaders elected by a [[proletariat]] constituency.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 71&lt;/ref&gt; With the Russian government moving from an [[autocracy]] to this system of "dual power" with the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet constantly vying for power, there was much confusion on how both could coexist and govern effectively.

In this confusion, the Provisional Government realized the Soviet had the people's trust and enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 59&lt;/ref&gt; In the hopes of appeasing the Soviet and keeping the support of the population, the Provisional Government launched several very bold liberal acts and promoted civil liberties through means of freedom of speech, press, and assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 71-72&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, other than strategic political motives, the Provisional Government understood that their power was illegitimate, due to the fact that they were not elected by the people. To solve the problem of illegitimacy, the Provisional Government was in the process of establishing the Constituent Assembly, whose members would be democratically elected by the people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 72&lt;/ref&gt; The Constituent Assembly would never come to be under the Provisional Government's rule, as the elections were set after the Bolsheviks seized power in the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 348&lt;/ref&gt;

After the February Revolution, Lenin published his April Theses and in it he expressed unhappiness with the February Revolution as he described it as a "Bourgeois Revolution".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Origins of the Russian Revolution, 1861-1917|last=Wood|first=Alan|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed for the slogan "All Power to the Soviets". Lenin mentioned that a Proletariat Revolution is necessary, and expressed that he has no interest in cooperating with the Provisional Government or the other Soviet leaders who are willing to compromise. Other Soviet leadership were skeptical to Lenin's ideas since they were afraid that Lenin and the Bolsheviks were advocating for anarchism. Lenin also criticized the Petrograd Soviet for governing alongside the Provisional Government, and accused them of forgetting and abandoning socialist ideas and the proletariat revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Provisional Government ==
The [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]'s members primarily consisted of former [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]] members under [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]'s reign. Its members were mainly members of the [[Constitutional Democratic Party]] (known as the Kadets party), as the Kadets were the only formal political party functioning in the Provisional Government at its conception. The ideological and political ideas differed wildly throughout the party's leadership and members, but most were moderates, offering both liberal and conservative views at times.  The Kadets and the Provisional Government alike pushed for new policies including the release of political prisoners, a decree of freedom of press, cessation of the [[Okhrana]], abolition of the death penalty, and rights for minorities. The Provisional Government and the Kadets also wanted Russia to continue to be involved in [[World War I]], much to the dismay of the Soviets. Despite certain political ideas, the Kadets became slightly more conservative overall with the rise of left-wing parties and left-wing thought within both the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet.&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government realized that their power was not legitimate since they were former Duma members, and not elected by a general public. They knew that to be seen as a legitimate government body, they would need to be elected by the people, and they established the [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] and scheduled popular elections to take place later in the year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Alexander Kerensky]], a former member of the Fourth Duma and a chairmen of the Soviet Executive Committee and eventually the Prime Minister for the Provisional Government, was brought into the Provisional Government as a way to gain support from left-wing parties and the Petrograd Soviet. Kerensky was a moderate socialist, and believed that cooperation with the Provisional Government was necessary. Historian S.A. Smith explains that after the appointment of Kerensky "Thus was born 'dual power', an institutional arrangement under which the Provisional Government enjoyed formal authority, but where the Soviet Executive Committee had real power."&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 106&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government feared the Soviets immense growing power, and through this fear they tried to appease them as much as possible. When Kerensky became Prime Minister, he attempted to work with the Soviets including arming the Soviets and their followers during the [[Kornilov affair]]. The attempts of Kerensky would not last for a while, as the [[Bolsheviks]] did not believe in compromise and overthrew the Provisional Government in the October Revolution.

== Petrograd Soviet ==
The Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies in Petrograd served as the voice of the smaller councils of deputies elected by commoners, specifically soldiers and workers. The Petrograd Soviet, therefore, could claim a much better understanding of the people's will, since it was composed of many orators whom the lower class population elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50418695|title=Voices of revolution : 1917|last=1953-|first=Steinberg, Mark D.,|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300101690|location=New Haven, CT|oclc=50418695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet was established after the February Revolution, composed of numerous socialist revolutionaries. However, its rapid rise to power meant the Petrograd Soviet did not have any legitimate claim to power, like its counterpart, the Provisional Government.

The workers and soldiers of Russia saw hope in the Petrograd soviets, and elected deputies to it en masse, causing it to gain membership at an alarming rate (1200 seats had been filled in a week). The Petrograd Soviet was seen as a benefactor that would bring them land, bread, and peace.

The Executive Committee was initially made up of Nikolai Ckheidze, Matvei Skobelev, and Alexander Kerensky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/954018220|title=Russia in revolution : an empire in crisis, 1890 to 1928|last=1952-|first=Smith, S. A. (Stephen Anthony),|isbn=9780198734826|edition=First|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|oclc=954018220}}&lt;/ref&gt; These men were socialists, but feared radicalism. To keep radical mentality from spreading and provoking a 'counter-revolutionary movement,' they chose to support the Provisional Government where necessary. This led to the uneasy balance of power called "Dual Power."

==July Days impact ==
The events of the [[July Days]] would solidify the issues of dual power within government between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet. Between the dates of July 3 and July 7 ([[Julian calendar|Julian Calendar]] date), a Bolshevik uprising, still disputed if intentional by Lenin, occurred. In what is seen as a "[[Grassroots|grass roots]]" uprising, workers and lower ranks of soldiers violently demonstrated in the streets, calling for the Soviet to take power over the Provisional Government.&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),124&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising was supported by the Bolshevik Military Organization and Petersburg Committee, who sent in more support, but the leaders of the party had less concrete opinions about the demonstration.&lt;ref name="soviethistory.msu.edu"&gt;Lewis Siegelbaum, "July Days" [subject essay], ''Seventeen Moments in Soviet History: An On-Line Archive of Primary Sources'', accessed November 5, 2017, http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1917-2/july-days/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Kerensky|Alexander Kerenksy]], head of the Provisional Government, led a crackdown on those involved with the events of the July Days and overthrow of the Provisional Government. The military was used to gather and arrest violent demonstrators, retake government buildings from Bolshevik forces, and dissolve military units that had participated in the attempted overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 156&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional Government also attempted to undermine Lenin and his party by revealing their investigation of his ties to Germany, Russia's enemy during World War I.&lt;ref name="soviethistory.msu.edu"/&gt; These combined actions would quell the Bolshevik uprising and support until August 1917 (Julian).

The reinstatement of the death penalty for soldiers, and Kerensky transferring the Provisional Government into the Winter Palace were among the actions that led to accusations of counterrevolutionary activity (reestablishment of autocratic government) by the Provisional Government.&lt;ref name=":0x"&gt;Ferro, Marc (1971). "The Russian Soldier in 1917: Undisciplined, Patriotic, and Revolutionary". ''Slavic Review''. 30 (3): 483-512&lt;/ref&gt; A new kind of duality between the classes (proletariat and bourgeoisie) was a split noticeable not only in government, but also in everyday life for Russians. This led to increased tensions between both theaters, and made it difficult for groups to collaborate.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Kaiser, ''The Workers' Revolution in Russia, 1917: The View From Below'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 6&lt;/ref&gt; The Petrograd Soviet represented the Proletariat, while the Provisional Government members were part of the former State Duma, representing the old government under the tsar. This divide was also evident in the military, between rank-and-file soldiers and military officers.&lt;ref name=":0x" /&gt; As World War I continued on, soldiers started to mutiny or to disobey orders from their superiors, while supporting the soviets, hoping to bring an end to Russia's involvement in the war.

== Bolshevik takeover ==
Although the Bolshevik party was largely put down after the events of the July Days, Lenin still believed that the group could gain power in government because of unsteadiness due to the dual power situation. In April he wrote that the time was not yet right for revolution, as the Petrograd Soviet was still involved and working with the Provisional Government, as well as stating, "we do not as yet know a type of government superior to and better than the Soviets."&lt;ref&gt;V.I Lenin,"The Dual Power", ''Marxist Internet Archive'', 2005, accessed October 30, 2017, https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/09.htm&lt;/ref&gt; With the July Days seen as "Lenin's worst blunder,"&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),122&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was not necessarily his intention, the Bolsheviks were still not in place to take over the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet.

However, with the [[Kornilov affair]] of August 1917 (Julian-style date), the Bolsheviks regained both power in their party, but also with the masses. With Kornilov's soldiers moving towards the capital of Petrograd (modern day [[Saint Petersburg]]) and the Provisional Government, Kerensky had released many Bolshevik leaders arrested during the July Days and also provided arms in order for the Bolsheviks to defend the Provisional Government. By arming and calling on those who he had earlier punished, the Bolsheviks saw that they truly were gaining power in the government and Russian society. The Russian population lost faith in the Provisional Government because of how it handled Kornilov's coup, and many began supporting the Bolsheviks, with the group winning elections throughout Petrograd, especially in districts made up of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 171&lt;/ref&gt; This event, coupled with food shortages, the continuation of Russian involvement in World War I, and mass unemployment, worked in the Bolsheviks favor, turning people away from the government in charge&lt;ref&gt;S.A. Smith, ''Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis 1890 to 1928'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017),147&lt;/ref&gt; and toward the party that promised "Bread, Peace, Land."&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 79&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Bolsheviks overthrew the Provisional Government during the [[October Revolution]], they were able to do so with little resistance. The Provisional Government realized that their power was limited at the point of takeover, as the Bolsheviks had been gaining supporters and had more revolutionaries. When the actual overthrow occurred between the days of October 25 and 26 (Julian), Bolsheviks first seized means of transportation and communication, such as roads, bridges, railways, and post offices.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, ''Russian Revolution 1905-1921'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2017), 80&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin then went to the Second Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies to present the overthrow of the Provisional Government and state authority by the Bolshevik party.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 173&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Winter Palace]] (at the time, the home of the Provisional Government) was seized without a causality the morning of the 26th, and the Congress had no choice but to approve Lenin's decree.&lt;ref&gt;Mark D. Steinberg, Voices of Revolution, 1917 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 175&lt;/ref&gt; With this, the period of dual power between the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet came to a close.

== Strategy and ideological concepts ==
{{Main|Dual power (leftist theory)}}
As the [[ideology|ideological]] monopoly of dominant [[institutions]] is broken and people increasingly rely on Alternative Institutions (AIs), those who benefited from existing arrangements may seek to dismantle their upstart competitors. At the same time, those who seek fundamental changes in society or who find the alternative ways of organizing it valuable may seek to enlarge and strengthen the alternative infrastructure. Counter institutions (XIs) are created both to defend the AIs and to promote their growth. These work to challenge and attack the [[status quo]] while creating, defending, and securing space for opposition and alternative institutions. They do this with everything from [[political protest]]s, to direct appropriation (of plantations, government buildings, factories, etc.) for the use of alternative institutions, to civil disobedience or armed resistance. The line between AIs and XIs is seldom entirely clear as many alternative institutions are also self-promoting or defending. Together the AIs and XIs form an alternative source of power in society which is "necessarily autonomous from, and competitive with, the dominant system, seeking to encroach upon the latter's domain, and, eventually, to replace it."&lt;ref name="Dominick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://left-liberty.net/?p=265|title=An Introduction to Dual Power Strategy|last=Dominick|first=Brian A.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the process of building the alternative institutions and the ideology that supports them, the advantage of dual power is the creation of real, and not merely political, momentum towards the revolutionary transformation of society. Actual changes are ongoing, rather than postponed to a revolutionary moment, so needs unmet by the pre-existing order are being met during the struggle and no sector of society is told that its concerns can only be dealt with after victory is achieved. That is, creation of AIs and the political space for them has intrinsic benefits, apart from the advancement of the revolutionary project. Over the course of building AIs, the society at large is empowered, committed to change, and skilled in running society. Simultaneously, the credibility of a revolutionary vision is increased immensely by putting it into practice and by refining and improving it over time. It is also conceivable that factional splits between revolutionaries and reformers (and all the shades in between) could be reduced by having a common project that both find useful. Those forces that would be sent to suppress a revolutionary movement find themselves confronting people who have taken control over their own lives, rather than armed cadre attempting to impose a vision on the country, potentially obviating military conflict or at least reducing its severity. {{Citation needed | date = October 2017}}

Successful dual-power rebellions end with the acceptance of the new social forms by much of the populace and the realization by the old rulers that they are no longer capable of using their systems of force against the revolutionary movement. This can occur because noncooperation has crippled the old structures of power, because too few people remain loyal to the old rulers to enforce their will, or because the rulers themselves undergo an ideological conversion. At this point, there is not general confusion. The disappearance of old leaders and structures of power is accommodated by the expansion of the alternative system. The alleged "necessity" for a revolutionary vanguard to guide the revolutionary impulse is shown to have no basis: because the people have already learned how to govern their own affairs, they need no tutelage from above. The possibility of co-option is minimized: "When the people recognize their true power, it cannot be taken away by rhetoric or […] imposition."&lt;ref name='Dominick'/&gt;

Dual power is a strategy, rather than an ideology, and it could plausibly be used to advance a variety of forms of social change. However, the advantages of the strategy make it most compatible with perspectives that emphasize the exercise of power at the community level, that seek to make the revolutionary movement accountable to the people, that see the capability to revision and transform society as common rather than rare, and that seek decentralized forms of power. Call this version of the strategy grassroots dual power, the bottom-up transformation and replacement of the mechanisms of society.{{Citation needed | date = October 2017}}

[[Libertarian socialists]] have more recently appropriated the term to refer to the nonviolent strategy of achieving a libertarian socialist economy and polity by means of incrementally establishing and then networking institutions of direct [[participatory democracy]] to contest the existing power structures of state and capitalism. This does not necessarily mean disengagement with existing institutions; for example, Yates McKee describes a dual-power approach as "forging alliances and supporting demands on existing institutions — elected officials, public agencies, universities, workplaces, banks, corporations, museums — while at the same time developing self-organized counter-institutions."&lt;ref name='Yates'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagingnonviolence.org/feature/art-after-occupy/|first=Yates|last=McKee|title=Art after Occupy — climate justice, BDS and beyond|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the strategy itself is sometimes also referred to as "counterpower" to differentiate it from the term's Leninist origins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4226">'''Edward Oswald Gabriel Turville-Petre''' [[British Academy|F.B.A.]] (known as Gabriel) (25 March 1908 &amp;ndash; 17 February 1978) was Professor of Ancient Icelandic Literature and Antiquities at the [[University of Oxford]]. He wrote numerous books and articles in English and Icelandic on literature and religious history.

==Life==
Gabriel Turville-Petre was born into a Roman Catholic, [[landed gentry]] family in England, the fourth of the five children of Oswald and Margaret Petre (née Cave). His older brother was the archaeologist [[Francis Turville-Petre]]. Gabriel was born at the ancestral home of [[Bosworth Hall (Husbands Bosworth)|Bosworth Hall]], [[Husbands Bosworth]], Leicestershire in 1908.  He was educated at [[Ampleforth College]] and at [[Christ Church, Oxford University]]. He studied for a B.Litt in English from 1931 &amp;ndash; 1934 and was supervised by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

He studied [[Iceland]]ic and early [[Scandinavia]]n literature and traditions from an early age, first in England and later in Iceland (where he spent several years) and in other northern countries.

Turville-Petre married [[Joan Turville-Petre|Joan Elizabeth Blomfield]] on 7 January 1943. They had three sons: Thorlac Francis Samuel (born 6 January 1944), Merlin Oswald (born 2 July 1946) and Brendan Arthur Auberon (born 16 September 1948).

Turville-Petre was appointed the first Vigfusson Reader in Ancient Icelandic Literature and Antiquities at Oxford University in 1941, and was appointed Professor in 1953.  He held the position until his retirement in 1975.

He was created a Knight of the Falcon (Iceland), a member of the [[Royal Gustavus Adolphus Academy]] (Sweden), and an honorary Life Member of the [[Viking Society for Northern Research]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1973.

Turville-Petre bequeathed his personal library to the English Faculty Library of Oxford University (Icelandic Collections).

The '''U.P. Gawad Plaridel''' is the sole award in the [[University of the Philippines]] System given to outstanding media practitioners.

The Gawad bestows honor on Filipino media practitioners who have excelled in any of the media (print, film, radio, television, and new media) and performed with the highest level of professional integrity in the interest of public service.  The recognition, which comes with a trophy sculpted by National Artist Napoleon V. Abueva, is given to one practitioner in one medium for each year.  The awardee is expected to deliver the Plaridel Lecture which addresses important media issues.

== Award profile ==
[[File:Pilar, Marcelo H. del.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Marcelo H. del Pilar, Filipino journalist-reformist, was the inspiration for the UP Gawad Plaridel awarded by the College of Mass Communication.]]

The award is named after [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]] (''[[nom de plume]]'', Plaridel),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the selfless propagandist whose stewardship of the reformist newspaper ''[[La Solidaridad]]'' from 1889 to 1895 helped crystallize nationalist sentiments and ignite [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ideas, mainly through his 150 essays and 66 editorials published under the nom de plume Plaridel. A crusading journalist, this native of Bulacan served as editor of the vernacular section of the Diariong Tagalog (Tagalog Newspaper), the first Philippine bilingual newspaper, in 1882. Among his major publications were ''Dasalan at Tocsohan'' (Prayerbook and Teasing Game), ''Pasyong Dapat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Tauong Babasa'' (Passion That Should Inflame the Heart of the Reader), and ''La Soberania Monacal en Filipinas'' (Monastic Supremacy in the Philippines), all published in 1889.

From 1890 to around 1895, he edited and published ''La Solidaridad'' almost on his own because funds for the support of the fortnightly had become more and more difficult to raise in the Philippines.  Del Pilar slowly lost hope in reforms and began to entertain the possibility of the Philippines separating from Mother Spain.

Pining for his mother country and suffering from tuberculosis, Del Pilar died in [[Barcelona, Spain]] on July 4, 1896 at the age of 45.

Like Plaridel, the recipient of this award must believe in the vision of a Philippine society that is egalitarian, participative, and progressive, and in media that are socially responsible, critical and vigilant, liberative and transformative, and free and independent.

Given annually, it started in 2004 with [[Eugenia Apostol]], publisher and founding chair of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' as its first awardee.&lt;ref name="Yuson2006"&gt;{{cite book

== 2008: Community Print Media ==
For 2008, Pachico A. Seares, editor-in-chief of [[Sun.Star Cebu]] and Sun.Star Superbalita ([[Cebu]]), was chosen as the recipient of the award for his "outstanding contributions to the print media industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plarideljournal.org/videos/gawad-plaridel-2008-seares/|title=Gawad Plaridel 2008 awarded to Pachico Seares|work=Plaridel Journal|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges cited Seares' contributions to community journalism, among them: his major help in steering Sun.Star Cebu and Sun.Star Superbalita [Cebu] to become the readership and advertising leaders among community newspapers in the country, his “continuing advocacy on issues that serve community interest, adopting and implementing journalism values that serve as example to Sun.Star affiliate papers in their respective areas, inspiring the community and regarding the people as citizens who can help the community.”

After the awarding rites, Seares delivered the Plaridel Lecture entitled "The Future of Community Newspapers," which situated the country's community print media today, presented the success story behind the two publications he heads and its growth into a network of publications, and presented prospects for the field in the future.

== 2009: Independent Film ==
Independent filmmaker Kidlat Tahimik (real name: Eric de Guia) was the recipient of the UP Gawad Plaridel for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/features/06/20/09/kidlat-tahimik-2009-gawad-plaridel-awardee|title=Kidlat Tahimik is the 2009 UP Gawad Plaridel Awardee|date=19 June 2009|work=ABS-CBN News|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known for his repertoire of independent films that mirror Filipino culture, including "Mababangong Bangungot," Tahimik encouraged budding film-makers and mass communication students to unleash the "sariling duwende" in producing their own motion pictures.

== 2010: No awardee ==
For the first time, no one bagged the Gawad Plaridel in 2010, which was supposed to honor an individual who made significant contributions to community radio. In a statement issued by the UP College of Mass Communication, it was said that while many of the nominees had made a mark in the industry, they were yet to achieve the highest level of professionalism and public service expected of a Gawad Plaridel recipient. UP CMC also acknowledged the fact that community radio is relatively young but still had room to develop itself into a mass medium worthy of recognition.

== 2011: Radio ==
Radio drama talent and director Eloisa Cruz-Canlas received the 2011 Gawad Plaridel for her work in Philippine radio drama through the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/706722/eloisa-cruz-canlas-2011-gawad-plaridel-awardee|title=Eloisa Cruz Canlas is 2011 UP Gawad Plaridel awardee|work=philstar.com|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awarding ceremonies for Canlas were held on July 20 at the UP Film Institute in Diliman, Quezon City. Canlas was the executive producer of ''Drama Sa Nuebe Nubenta'' over [[DZIQ]] Radyo Inquirer 990 and has worked with [[DZRH]] and [[Radyo Natin]]-[[Nueva Ecija]] for many years, portraying the popular character ''Lola Sela.''

'''Nora Cabaltera Villamayor'''' or popularly known as '''[[Nora Aunor]]''' was the recipient of the 2014 U.P. Gawad Plaridel. She was recognized for her "unique artistry and versatility as a singer," as well as for "portraying with keen intelligence and uncommon sensitivity an amazing range of cinematic roles." UP CMC also cited Ms. Aunor for using her “tremendous popularity as an opportunity to (help) the masses...appreciate films and plays that dramatized and analyzed the abject conditions of the Filipino majority and the poor and powerless characters that she played with conviction.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''glottis''' is the opening between the [[vocal folds]] &lt;ref&gt;Ladefoged, Peter. 2006. A course in Phonetics. UCLA.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[rima glottidis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=WebMD |chapter=glottis |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8UfI3BH78wC&amp;pg=PA178 |page=178 |year=2009 |title=Webster's New World Medical Dictionary |edition=3rd |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-544-18897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
{{empty section|date=September 2014}}

==Function==
===Phonation===
{{Main|Phonation}}
As the vocal folds vibrate, the resulting vibration produces a "buzzing" quality to the speech, called '''[[Voice (phonetics)|voice]]''' or '''voicing''' or '''pronunciation'''.

Sound production that involves moving the vocal folds close together is called ''glottal''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introductory Phonology|last=Hayes|first=Bruce|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4051-8411-3|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; English has a [[Voiceless glottal fricative|voiceless glottal transition]] spelled "h". This sound is produced by keeping the vocal folds spread somewhat, resulting in non-turbulent airflow through the glottis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In many accents of English the [[glottal stop]] (made by pressing the folds together) is used as a variant [[allophone]] of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}} (and in some dialects, occasionally of {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/p/}}); in some languages, this sound is a [[phoneme]] of its own.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Skilled players of the Australian [[didgeridoo]] restrict their glottal opening in order to produce the full range of timbres available on the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/43639a |pmid=16001056 |title=Acoustics: The vocal tract and the sound of a didgeridoo |journal=Nature |volume=436 |issue=7047 |pages=39 |year=2005 |last1=Tarnopolsky |first1=Alex |last2=Fletcher |first2=Neville |last3=Hollenberg |first3=Lloyd |last4=Lange |first4=Benjamin |last5=Smith |first5=John |last6=Wolfe |first6=Joe |bibcode=2005Natur.436...39T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vibration produced is an essential component of ''voiced'' [[consonant]]s as well as [[vowel]]s. If the vocal folds are drawn apart, air flows between them causing no vibration, as in the production of voiceless consonants.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The glottis is also important in the [[valsalva maneuver]].
* Voiced consonants include {{IPA|/v/, /z/, /ʒ/, /d͡ʒ/, /ð/, /b/, /d/, /ɡ/, /w/.}}
* Voiceless consonants include {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /ʃ/, /t͡ʃ/, /θ/, /p/, /t/, /k/, /ʍ/, and /h/.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6348">[[Image:Great Mural map.png|right|thumb]]
'''Great Mural Rock Art''' consists of prehistoric paintings of humans and other animals, often larger than life-size, on the walls and ceilings of natural rock shelters in the mountains of northern [[Baja California Sur]] and southern [[Baja California]], Mexico. This group of monuments comprises the site [[Rock Paintings of Sierra de San Francisco]], which is included on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/baja/sierra_de_san_francisco.php|title=The Cave Paintings of the Sierra de San Francisco|last=Foundation|first=Bradshaw|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The [[rock art]] may be either monochrome or polychrome. Red and black were the colors most frequently used, but white, pink, orange, and green also occur.

The most common figures are humans and deer, but a variety of other animals, such as rabbits, bighorn sheep, birds, fish, and snakes are also represented. The human images often include stylized headdresses. A minority of human images are shown with sexual characteristics, such as male genitalia or female breasts. A minority of human and animal images are overlain with depictions of projectiles (presumably arrows or [[atlatl]] [[Dart (missile)|darts]]).

The images are essentially silhouettes, without representational details inside their outlines. Instead, geometrical patterns such as stripes or bands of different colors are used. A dorsal/ventral (front-facing) perspective is employed for humans, turtles, birds, and most fish, while a lateral perspective is used for deer and most other animals.

Overpainting of earlier by later images is very common. Some murals seem to show intentional composition in their arrangements of multiple images, but in many cases the figures seem to have been painted individually, without regard to other nearby (or underlying) images.

==Distribution==
The Great Murals occur in the sierras of Guadalupe, [[Sierra de San Francisco|San Francisco]], San Juan, and [[Sierra de San Borja|San Borja]] in the central part of the Baja California peninsula. To the north and south their place is taken by other, less spectacular rock art styles. Within the Great Mural area as well, [[pictograph]]s and [[petroglyph]]s belonging to other styles are present.

The Great Murals lie within the ethnohistoric territory of the [[Cochimí]], and they have been commonly linked with the late prehistoric [[Comondú Complex]], although the Cochimí denied to eighteenth-century [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries that they were responsible for the paintings. Recent [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] studies, both on materials recovered from archaeological deposits in the rockshelters and on materials in the paintings themselves, have suggested that the Great Murals may have a time range extending as far back as 7,500 years ago.

==Interpretations==
No consensus exists about the motivations that led to the painting of the Great Murals. Among the contexts suggested for their production have been hunting magic, warfare, shamans' traces, weather control, and ancestor veneration.

==Studies==
The existence of the Great Murals was noted by Jesuit missionaries [[José Mariano Rotea]] and Francisco Escalante in the eighteenth century. The first scientific studies were made between 1889 and 1913 by a French naturalist, [[Léon Diguet]]. Mexican journalist Fernando Jordan and archaeologists Barbro Dahlgren and Javier Romero reported on Great Mural sites in the early 1950s.

The Great Murals came to popular attention in the United States through a 1962 [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] article by mystery writer [[Erle Stanley Gardner]]. Since then, numerous investigators have documented and analyzed the sites. For instance, Eve Ewing has been studying the art for 50 years and has made over a hundred trips to view the different paintings. Particularly notable have been the extensive contributions from [[Clement Woodward Meighan|Clement W. Meighan]], Campbell Grant, [[Harry W. Crosby]], Enrique Hambleton, Justin R. Hyland, and María de la Luz Gutiérrez.

'''[[Heritage tree]]s in [[Singapore]]''' are individual mature trees specially selected for protection by law under the Heritage Trees Scheme adopted on 17 August 2001. Implemented at the same time as the [[Heritage roads in Singapore|Heritage Roads scheme]], it is part of a nationwide drive in tree conservation efforts not just within [[nature reserve]]s, [[park]]s, and newly established [[Tree conservation areas in Singapore|tree conservation areas]], but also anywhere else in the urban and rural environment of Singapore.

[[Image:Heritage trees plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque used to identify a heritage tree in Singapore]]

==Selection==
Trees are added to the scheme through endorsement by a nine-member panel of experts, currently headed by Dr [[Leong Chee Chiew]], Deputy Chief Operating Officer of the [[National Parks Board]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6733">The '''International Council of Onomastic Sciences''' ('''ICOS''') is an international academic organization of scholars with a special interest in [[onomastics]], the scientific study of [[names]] (e.g. [[place-names]], [[personal names]], and proper names of all other kinds). The official languages of ICOS are English, French, and German.

== Work of the scholars of ICOS ==

Members research the origin and history of names, the personal name-systems used by different cultures, the demographic patterns of names in different societies, the use and significance of names of characters in [[literature]], [[brand-name]] creation, and many related topics in the naming of persons, places, institutions, works of art, and other miscellaneous objects. They are also involved in practical projects such as the international standardization of geographical names. The aim of ICOS (as opposed to the many national societies for name-study) is the advancement, representation and co-ordination of name-research on an international level and in an interdisciplinary context. To that end, it is engaged in the publication of research and the development of research tools as described below. The Council's members are drawn from disciplines such as [[linguistics]] and [[philology]], [[history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[geography]] and literary research. This organization has replaced the former International Committee of Onomastic Sciences, which was a closed society consisting exclusively of co-opted representatives of countries. The former body was therefore not open to individual scholars as the present one is.

== ''ONOMA'' ==

ICOS publishes the annual journal ''ONOMA'', which is its official publication. ''ONOMA'' is managed by a General Editor in conjunction with an Editorial Board. It contains topical research reports as well as basic theoretical articles concerning all areas of scholarly name research. Presently, each issue is thematic, and has a guest editor. ICOS also publishes an irregular newsletter.  {{ISSN|0078-463X}}.

== Working groups ==

ICOS has two active working groups, striving:
# to create an international bibliography of name-study
# to help create an internationally agreed technical terminology for name-study

== Congresses ==

The International Congress of Onomastic Sciences, which is normally held every three years, is a major academic conference organised on behalf of ICOS by one of its members. The General Assembly of ICOS, which also functions as its business meeting, and at which its officers are elected, is usually held at these congresses. The ordinary business of ICOS is transacted by the elected Board of Directors.

Until the present, the following congresses have been run:

'''Inuit Sign Language''' ('''IUR''', [[Inuktitut language|Inuktitut]]: {{lang|iu|'''Uukturausingit'''}} &lt;small&gt;'''ᐆᒃᑐᕋᐅᓯᖏᑦ'''&lt;/small&gt; or '''Atgangmuurngniq &lt;small&gt;ᐊᒼᖕᒨᕐᓂᖅ&lt;/small&gt;''') is an Indigenous [[sign language|sign]] [[language isolate]] native to [[Inuit]] communities of the Canadian Arctic. It is currently only attested within certain communities in [[Nunavut]], particularly around Baker Lake and Rankin Inlet. Although there is a possibility that it may be used in other places where Inuit people live in the Arctic, this has not been confirmed.&lt;ref name=Schuit2012&gt;{{cite book

Of the estimated 155 deaf residents of Nunavut in 2000, around 47 were thought to use IUR, while the rest use ASL due to schooling.&lt;ref name=DOJCan&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how many hearing people use the language nor how many people are monolingual. As it is a highly endangered and relatively hidden language, it has no protection under the federal or territorial governments of Canada. However, IUR exists alongside ASL interpretation within the Nunavut Legislative Assembly as of 2008.&lt;ref name=NLA /&gt; Recently, there has been increased interest in the documentation of the language which would be done through the Nunavut Council for People with Disabilities and the Inuit Broadcasting Corporation (IBC).&lt;ref name=InuDoc/&gt; As well, there is push to expand the interpretation/translation programme through [[Arctic College]] to include IUR.&lt;ref name=Right/&gt;

==History==
At least since the 18th century, hearing Inuit used some form of sign language for trade and communication between various [[Inuit languages]], a similar role to that played by [[Plains Sign Language]] further south. This may have been IUR or at least its ancestor, as the region has a high incidence of congenital deafness. In the territory of [[Nunavut]], for example, the incidence of hereditary deafness is six times that of southern Canada. The deaf are well integrated in the community, and there are perhaps two hearing people proficient in IUR for every deaf speaker, as in other communities with high rates of congenital deafness such as [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|Martha's Vineyard]]. However, IUR is not (or no longer) used as a contact language among the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;According to Schuit (2012). MacDougall (2000) reports that hearing people have been observed using it for inter-dialectical communication, noting that "this is not unusual for nomadic hunters and others living in isolated places". However, it is not clear if he is referring to historical or contemporary accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; Its users are the deaf and those hearing people they regularly communicate with.&lt;ref name=Schuit2012/&gt;

The history of the language is not well known, with stories passed down from elders noting the use of IUR, or related languages/dialects therein, for generations where the language(s) would be used by both hearing and [[Deaf culture|Deaf]] Inuk, especially out on the tundra. However, due to the sparseness of communities and the relative youth of the field of research, there is little understanding of who uses the language where. That being said, IUR has been shown to be passed down in some families through generations, regardless of deafness.&lt;ref name=Access /&gt; In fact, deafness within Inuit society holds less stigma than it does within its southern neighbour's which leads to a wider acceptance and adoption of IUR.&lt;ref name=Schuit2012 /&gt;

==Status==
Inuit Sign Language is a threatened language. A decline in use is in progress due to a variety of reasons, chief of which is the encroachment of ASL.&lt;ref name=Access /&gt; As there exists no formal educational opportunities using IUR, parents are increasingly opting to send their children south to schools where ASL is the primary language of instruction or English–ASL interpreted curriculum; LSQ and/or French education appears to not hold precedence.&lt;ref name=Access /&gt; This trend is seen in the fact that an estimated third of the population (47 in ca. 2000) use IUR as their native language.&lt;ref name=DOJCan /&gt; It is unknown the status of the language, though, outside of select communities within Nunavut.

Efforts to protect and document the language are underway. Increasingly, there is support from within and outside the linguistic community to expand local programmes and to document IUR,&lt;ref name=Right&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674recognition_of_inuit_sign_language_should_be_deemed_a_right_expert_say/|title=Inuit Sign Language should be recognized as a right, expert says|last=Dawson|first=Samantha|publisher=Nunatsiaq Online|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially after R. v. Suwarak, 1999,&lt;ref name=Justice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/aj-ja/rr00_17/p00.html|title=Access to Justice for Deaf Persons in Nunavut: Focus on Signed Languages|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=29 September 2015|date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/crown-stays-sex-charge-against-deaf-man/article668304/|publisher=Globe and Mail|title=Crown stays sex charge against deaf man|last=Minogue|first=Sara|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which saw an Inuk man put to trial where no interpreter was able to be provided as none existed. Through the Nunavut Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth (CLEY) and the Department of Justice, Dr Jamie MacDougall is spearheading a project with community members to document and revitalize the language.&lt;ref name=InuDoc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/2008/809/80926/news/nunavut/80926_1564.html|title=Project documents unique Inuit sign language|last=Bird|first=John|publisher=Nunatsiaq Online|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, Inuit Sign Language is offered no rights or protections beyond what is found in the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]],&lt;ref name=Justice/&gt; meaning no province or territory has established it as an official language. However, alongside ASL, interpreters have used IUR at Nunavut's legislative assembly since 2008.&lt;ref name=NLA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-sign-language-makes-debut-in-nunavut-legislature-1.772092|publisher=CBC|title=Inuit sign language makes debut in Nunavut legislature|date=17 September 2008|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
[[File:US &amp; Canada sign-language map (excl. ASL and LSQ).png|thumb|{{Legend|#50C9FF|Confirmed range of Inuiuuk in Nunavut amongst various sign languages of the US and Canada.}}]]

As academic research into IUR is a new field, there is limited information related to its varieties. However, it is known that there is dialectal variation of the language across at least Nunavut, as to be expected from separated linguistic communities. It is reported that a sign language of [[Greenland]] is closely related to IUR with ASL and [[Danish Sign Language]] loans,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} but it is yet to be determined whether that is valid as Greenlandic Sign Language may be a variety or related to Danish Sign Language itself.&lt;ref&gt;Brentari (2010) ed. ''Sign Languages'', p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond dialectal variation, there is little known of the range of the language or whether not there are multiple languages that exist. It is said that Inuit have spoken IUR, or at least a variation therein, for generations across much of their territories, however no current research confirms those rumours. As such, IUR is unattested to the west of Nunavut.&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
As of 2015, there have been few linguistic studies on Inuit Sign Language, notably done by Schuit (2012) wherein they looked primarily at verb agreement and classifier use. Schuit makes note that at this early stage of research, they cannot say the absolute word order of the language; they plan to pursue further studies in negation and morphological typology later. Moreover, preliminary findings dictate that Inuit Sign Language does not exhibit a large amount of non-manual simultaneity, but that manual simultaneity certainly exists. As well, there exists limited verb agreement within the language, but all types of verbs found in sign languages (plain, agreement and spatial) can be found in Inuit Sign Language. Finally, Inuit Sign Language appears to be not a subject-drop language but, rather, one that leaves the subject unspecified, which aligns similarly with Inuit culture.&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011/&gt;

===Verb agreement===
IUR exhibits a three-way distinction between plain, agreement and spatial verbs. In plain verbs, one sees no reference to an object or subject, such as the following example:

{{quote|OTTAWA INDEX-LOC&lt;sub&gt;Ottawa&lt;/sub&gt; CALL–ON–PHONE LONG–AGO. &lt;br /&gt; 'Long ago, I phoned Ottawa.' (referring to a shop in Ottawa)&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011/&gt;}}

Although appearing to reference Ottawa, the verb, &lt;small&gt;CALL–ON–PHONE&lt;/small&gt;, makes no movement nor orientation to suggest it agrees with the object. However, agreement can take the shape of varying executions in different spaces, such as with:

{{quote|USE–ICE–AUGER&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; INDEX&lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt; USE–ICE–AUGER&lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt; INDEX&lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 'I use an ice auger, and so does he.'&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011/&gt;}}

Here, the verb's location and movement shifts to agree with the subject of either clause. Additionally, agreement can be seen on transitive verbs such as the following where the verb &lt;small&gt;SEE&lt;/small&gt; interacts only with its object. Verbs agreeing with both subject and object are rare.

{{quote|INDEX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; COMMUNICATE INDEX&lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt; SEE&lt;sub&gt;3b&lt;/sub&gt; INDEX&lt;sub&gt;3b&lt;/sub&gt; PAY–ATTENTION &lt;br /&gt; 'I tell him to watch this (the fishing), to pay attention.'&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011/&gt;}}

Finally, IUR also uses spatial verbs with certain locative agreements. Some verbs set up a specific signing space in front of the signer whereas others use the index finger to locate absolutely a geographical point (also seen in the first example with &lt;small&gt;OTTAWA&lt;/small&gt;) as seen in the following two examples:

{{quote|INDEX–LOC&lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt; SCOOP DRILL–HOLE–WITH–AUGER FINISH. &lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt;WALK&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; TAKE LONG–ITEM &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;WALK&lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt; WHITE–MAN CHISEL&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;. DROP LONG–THIN–OBJECT MOVES–BELOW–SURFACE &lt;br /&gt; 'Over there they started a hole with a scoop, and then drilled it with an ice-auger. Someone walked from there towards me and took my chisel. The white man walked back (to the hole) and used the chisel. Then he dropped it, and it went all the way to the bottom (of the sea).'&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011/&gt;}}

{{quote|NEXT–DAY NEXT–DAY &lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt;PLANE–FLY&lt;sub&gt;3b&lt;/sub&gt;. WINNIPEG INDEX–LOC&lt;sub&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;W'peg&lt;/sub&gt;PLANE–FLY–WITH–STOPS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; HERE &lt;br /&gt; 'In two days, they take a plane that flies them to Winnipeg, followed by the plane from Winnipeg, that flies with some stops to here (Rankin Inlet).'&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011/&gt;}}

Spatial localization, however, is not obligatory, as seen here:

{{quote|WHITE–MAN INUK INDEX&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; MOVE–CL&lt;sub&gt;two-vehicles&lt;/sub&gt; SNOW–MOBILE GO&lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; 'A white man and me, an Inuk, go by snow mobile (to Landing Lake).'&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011/&gt;}}

Here, the location remains unspecified even though it was known.

===Geolocative===
One unique feature of IUR is its absolute referents when referencing geographic locations. As in most other sign languages, signers will make a signing location in front of their body to indicate notions like 'here' or referencing a person abstractly. However, for geographic points, IUR references those locations absolutely using the index finger in the case of INDEX–LOC or other handshapes as is the case for {{sub|Winnipeg}}PLANE–FLY–WITH–STOPS{{sub|1}}. The actual locations vary from local, nearby villages or cities to cities such as Winnipeg that are thousands of kilometres away. However far the referent is, the signer will invariably point or indicate the direction in which it is.&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011/&gt;

===Classifiers===
IUR has both handling and entity [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] as in many other sign languages. Its handling classifiers appear on transitive verbs and mark the direct object, such as PICK–UP:CL&lt;sub&gt;egg&lt;/sub&gt; ('pick up an egg') or MOVE{{sub|up}}:CL&lt;sub&gt;box&lt;/sub&gt; ('move a box'). Entity classifiers have so far been identified in the semantic class of vehicles, animals, two-legged beings and flying birds, such as in: MOVE&lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt;:CL&lt;sub&gt;birds&lt;/sub&gt; GOOSE SHOOT++&lt;sub&gt;3a&lt;/sub&gt; ('geese flying in, I will shoot them out of the air'). Handling classifiers are used more frequently.&lt;ref name=SchuitBakerPfau2011/&gt;

'''Jabal es Saaïdé''' ({{lang-ar|جبل سعيدة}}), Jabal es Saaide, Jabal as Sa`idah, Jabal as Sa`īdah, Jebal Saaidé, Jebel Saaidé or Jabal Saaidé is a Mountain in Lebanon near the inhabited village of Saaïdé, approximately {{convert|12|km|mi}} northeast of [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]].

Saaidé I &amp; Saaidé II are archaeological sites of note in this area. In the summer of 1966, the [[Lebanese Army]] dug a trench at Saaidé I, and recovered a large number of tools and lithics including sickles, grinders, scrapers, chisels, awls and blades suggested to date to the [[PPNB]] or [[PPNA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usj.edu.lb/mpl/pdf/1.pdf Besançon, J., Copeland, L., Hours, F., « Tableau de préhistoire libanaise »,. Paléorient 3, 1975-1976-1977, p. 5-46.]&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Besançon &amp; Francis Hours later discovered a [[Palaeolithic]] layer below the [[Neolithic]] level, recovering [[knives]], [[arrowheads]], scrapers and retouched blades along with a fragment of a small, flat, cutting [[axe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haidar-Boustani|first=Maya|date=2001–2002|title=Le Néolithique du Liban dans le contexte proche-oriental: Etat des connaissances|journal=Annales d'histoire et d'archéologie|publisher=[[Université Saint-Joseph]]|volume=12-13|issn=1729-6927|url=http://www.usj.edu.lb/mpl/pdf/1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saaidé II, almost {{convert|0.25|ha|ft2}} in size, was first excavated in 1969 by [[Bruce Schroeder]] from the [[University of Toronto]] who found the site badly damaged by modern agriculture. Investigations have recovered a wide range of [[mortar (masonry)|mortars]] and pestles, scrapers, [[chisels]], borers, retouched [[microliths]], geometric and non-geometric microliths. One grave was found with some tiny skull fragments from an adult aged 45–50 years. Local fauna consisted of turtles, birds ([[duck]], [[goose]], [[eagle]]) and mammals ([[badger]], [[lynx]], [[deer]], [[ox]], [[gazelle]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]). Jebal Saaidé is the only pre-agricultural village found in [[Lebanon]] to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFNtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Jebal+Saaid%C3%A9&amp;dq=Jebal+Saaid%C3%A9&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f1hkTZWANtSxhQfqluS_DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg|title=Berytus: archeological studies, Volumes 17-19|publisher=The [[American University of Beirut]]|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhabitants seem to have hunted different animals including lynx, red deer, gazelle, and some aquatic and migratory birds.&lt;ref name="Akk"&gt;{{Cite book

'''Jaʿfar b. ʿAlī Tabrizi''' (also known as Farīd al-Dīn and Qeblat al-Kottāb)&lt;ref&gt;Bayani, M. ''Ahvāl-o Āsār-e Khoshnevīsān'', (Tehran, 1363/1984), 115.&lt;/ref&gt; was a renowned master in [[calligraphy]] as well as a poet and scribe in the 15th century. He was noted for being competent in [[Nastaʿlīq]] as well as other six classical scripts. His prominent student, Azhar Tabrizi once called Ja'far the second founder of [[Nastaʿlīq]] asserting that he even surpassed his teacher.

==Biography==
Jaʿfar Tabrizi had a great role in the evolution of the “[[Nastaʿlīq script]]” after Mir 'Ali Tabrizi - generally known as the inventor of the [[Nastaʿlīq script]] - canonised the newly emerged script.&lt;ref&gt;Bayani, 114-123&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaʿfar Tabrizi was moved from Tabriz to [[Herat]] along with some other painters and calligraphers to work for the young Timurid Prince [[Baysonqor|Baysonghor]] following his campaign to Tabriz in 823/1420.&lt;ref&gt;Ḥāfiẓ-i Abrū, ''Zobdat al-tavārīkh'' (Tehran, 1379/2000), 739-42.&lt;/ref&gt; He did enjoy the sobriquet '''Bāysonghorī'''  after being appointed to the head of the court library-workshop, where he was responsible for supervising the artistic projects as well as providing regular reports on the activities carried out in the library. Only one such report has survived to our time and is found in an album housed at the Topkapi Palace Library in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;Album H. 2153, folio 98a&lt;/ref&gt; It undated document is called the ''ʿArżeh-dāsht'' (petition), which contains information about several projects including the names of artists and artisans (calligrapher, painter, drawer, binder, illuminator, ruling-maker, etc.) involved in each section and their progress.&lt;ref&gt;Parsay Qods, A. "Sanadī marbūt beh faʿālīyat-hā-ye hunarī-ye dowreh-ye Teymūrī dar kitāb-khāneh-ye Bāysonghorī-ye Harāt”, ''Honar va mardom'', No. 15 (175), 2536/1977, 42-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, W.M. ''Album Prefaces and Other Documents in the History of Calligraphers and Painters'', (Leiden, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

This important document was initially written in the format of scrolls, like verdicts and petitions used to be. It lacks ''bismillah'' at the beginning as well as the names of the sender and receiver, which in an official correspondence could only indicate that the heading and footing were damaged in the course of time and therefore trimmed. The size of the petition was basically one zar‘ (canonical cubit) long, which is 49.879&amp;nbsp;cm, meaning that the ''ʿArżeh-dāsht'' has lost approximately 4&amp;nbsp;cm of its initial length.&lt;ref&gt;Akimushkin O. "The Library-Workshop (kitābkhāna) of Bāysunghur-Mīrzā in Herat", ''Manuscripta Orientalia'', Vol. 3, No. 1, March 1997, 14-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Jaʿfar Tabrizi copied a number of manuscripts both before and after joining the royal library of [[Baysonqor]] Mīrzā. Among works in his hand are the sumptuous manuscript of the Bāysonghorī Shāhnāmeh (1430), the Golestān of Saʿdī (1427), Khosrow-o Shīrīn (1421), the Khamseh of Nezāmī (1431), Kulliyāt of Homām Tabrizi (1413), Nasāyeh-e Eskandar (1425), The Dīvān of Hasan Dehlavī (1422), Lamaʿāt of ʿIrāqī (1432), Kalīleh-o Demneh (1431), Tārīkh-e Iṣfahān (1431), and also Jong-e Marāsī, an elegy upon prince's death in 837/1433. Following [[Baysonqor]]'s death, Jaʿfar worked under the patronage of prince's son, [[ʿAlā al-Dowleh]]. He wrote poems portraying his court position at the service of [[Shahrukh Mirza]], [[Baysonqor]] and ʿAlā al-Dowleh.&lt;ref&gt;Bayani, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; He died around 860/1455.

In 1986, Raymond's book ''A Passion for Friends: a Philosophy of Female Friendship'' was named the best non-fiction book of the year by the UK magazine, City Limits.&lt;ref name="City Limits 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;93"&gt;City Limits, 16–23 October 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond has been the recipient of grants from the [[U.S. Department of State]], the U.S. [[National Institute of Justice]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[United States Information Agency]], the [[National Science Foundation]], the Norwegian Organization for Research and Development (NORAD), and [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name="catwinternational1"/&gt;

==Publications==

In her 1993 book, ''Women as Wombs: Reproductive Technologies and the Battle over Women's Freedom'', Raymond examined how reducing infertility to a disease in the West has helped to promote the use of new reproductive technologies such as in-vitro fertilization and surrogacy. At the same time, women's fertility is rejected in the East promoting technologies of forced sterilization, sex predetermination and female feticide.  The book was one of the first to look at the international reproductive trafficking of women and children as organized by the adoption, organ and surrogacy trade.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"&gt;Kaufmann, K. "Reproductive Technology and Women's Rights." San Francisco Chronicle Book Review, January 9, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Women as Wombs'', as the San Francisco Chronicle reviewer wrote, "is a strongly written, carefully reasoned critique of ...'reproductive liberalism'."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt; The Library Journal reviewer stated that "...it is hard to resist her conclusion that many reproductive experiments can represent another form of violence against women."&lt;ref&gt;Beverly Miller, Book Review of Women as Wombs, Library Review Journal, November 1, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond's 1986 book, ''A Passion for Friends: a Philosophy of Female Affection'', deviates from her work on medical technologies into the realm of feminist friendship as a basis for a  broader feminist theory and politics. Carolyn Heilbrun in ''The Women's Review of Books'' wrote: "Hers is a brave undertaking, and she begins by facing the central issue of women's friendships: the necessary relation of these friendships to power and the public sphere...Raymond's is the most probing and honorable discussion of female friendships we have..."&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Heilbrun, "The Future of Friendship," The Women's Review of Books, June, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Published also in a UK edition, ''A Passion for Friends'' received the City Limits award for the Best Non-Fiction Book of 1986.&lt;ref name="City Limits 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;93"/&gt; Novelist Jeanette Winterson wrote that "It's a complex, food-for thought book that rewards the time and concentration that it needs."&lt;ref&gt;Jeanette Winterson, Short Review of A Passion for Friends, Time Out, June 4–10, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings on transsexualism===
{{See also|The Transsexual Empire}}

In 1979, Raymond published a book on [[transsexualism]] called ''[[The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0807762725 |title=book |publisher=Worldcat.org |accessdate=2010-03-23|isbn=9780807762721 |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial even today, it looked at the role of transsexualism – particularly psychological and surgical approaches to it – in reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes, the ways in which the medical-psychiatric  complex is medicalizing "gender identity" and the social and political context that has helped spawn transsexual treatment and surgery as normal and therapeutic medicine.

Raymond maintains that transsexualism is based on the "patriarchal myths" of "male mothering," and "making of woman according to man's image." She claims this is done in order "to colonize [[feminist]] identification, culture, politics and [[human sexuality|sexuality]]," adding: "All transsexuals [[rape]] women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves… Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Janice. (1994). ''The Transsexual Empire'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2014 interview, Raymond said that she had "used rape as a metaphor" in the sense of a transgender person's demanding "access to women's bodies" not as sexual property, but through hormonal or [[sexual reassignment surgery|surgical construction]] to become women, and said that the metaphor was not appropriate and one which she would not use again in the same context.&lt;ref name=cp-interview-2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Dispelling Fictions and Disrupting Hashtags |last1=Vigo |first1=Julian |url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2014/08/25/dispelling-fictions-and-disrupting-hashtags/ |date=25 August 2014 |website=CounterPunch |publisher= |accessdate=18 December 2017 |quote=In The Transsexual Empire, I used rape as a metaphor as in the figure of speech, 'rape of the earth,' to describe the male transgender person's demand for access to women's bodies in undergoing treatment and surgery to become women. It was not an appropriate metaphor, and I would not use it again in this context. I was trying to point out the age-old patriarchal presumption that women's bodies should always be made available to men and the unique way in which transsexual surgery mimics this access to women's bodies, with men gaining entrée to the female body not as sexual and/or reproductive property, but through hormonal and surgical construction. In this case, rape was not a proper metaphor because it minimized the distinct meaning of rape and took on a critical life of its own rather than illuminating the point I was trying to make.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These views on [[transsexuality]] have been criticized by many in the [[LGBT]] and feminist communities as extremely [[transphobic]] and as constituting hate-speech against transsexual men and women.&lt;ref name="rose2004"&gt;Rose, Katrina C. (2004) "The Man Who Would be Janice Raymond." ''Transgender Tapestry'' 104, Winter 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="serano2007"&gt;[[Julia Serano]] (2007) ''Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity'', pp. 233–234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="namaste2000"&gt;Namaste, Viviane K. (2000) ''Invisible Lives: The Erasure of Transsexual and Transgendered People'', pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hayes2003"&gt;Hayes, Cressida J., 2003, "Feminist Solidarity after Queer Theory: The Case of Transgender," in ''Signs'' 28(4):1093–1120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Transsexual Empire'' Janice Raymond includes sections on [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]], a trans woman who had worked as a sound engineer for [[Olivia Records]], and Christy Barsky, accusing both of creating divisiveness in women's spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Janice. (1994). ''The Transsexual Empire'', pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; These writings have been heavily criticized as personal attacks on these individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Ruth, 1996, "Gender and Genitals: Constructs of Sex and Gender," in ''Social Text'' 46/47, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings on prostitution and sex trafficking===

In 2000, Raymond co-published one of the first studies on trafficking in the United States entitled ''Sex Trafficking in the United States: Links Between International and Domestic Sex Industries''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://action.web.ca/home/catw/readingroom.shtml?x=16939 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922030546/http://action.web.ca/home/catw/readingroom.shtml?x=16939 |archivedate=2009-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she directed and co-authored a multi-country project in the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Venezuela and the United States, entitled ''Women in the International Migration Process: Patterns, Profiles and Health Consequences of Sexual Exploitation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.web.ca/home/catw/attach/CATW%20Comparative%20Study%202002.pdf |title=Traffick Study TOC PGMKR |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210080318/http://action.web.ca/home/catw/attach/CATW%20Comparative%20Study%202002.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many articles she has published, her work entitled "Ten Reasons for Not Legalizing Prostitution and a Legal Response to the Demand for Prostitution"&lt;ref name="action1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.web.ca/home/catw/readingroom.shtml?AA_EX_Session=d1ec193c5ca6e0caa26e77d53493abcb&amp;scroll_user=2 |title=Coalition Against Trafficking in Women |publisher=Action.web.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609174725/http://action.web.ca/home/catw/readingroom.shtml?AA_EX_Session=d1ec193c5ca6e0caa26e77d53493abcb&amp;scroll_user=2 |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been translated into over 10 languages. This essay looks at the legislative models that have legalized or decriminalized the prostitution industry and the rationales supporting them, and argues that legitimating the sex trade has made its harm to women invisible. Raymond supports the alternative legal model of rejecting legalization and decriminalization of the sex industry, and penalizing the male demand for buying women and children for sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="action1"/&gt;

'''Joseph Elie Aoun''' (Arabic: جوزيف عون) (born March 26, 1953 in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]])&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the seventh president of [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where he took office on August 15, 2006. Prior to taking on the presidency at Northeastern, Aoun was dean of the College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences at the [[University of Southern California]].

== Robot-Proof ==

''Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence'' was published and released in 2017 by MIT Press. The book appeared over a year after Aoun wrote a commentary for the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aoun|first1=Joseph|title=Robot-Proof: How Colleges Can Keep People Relevant in the Workplace|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Robot-Proof-How-Colleges-Can/235057|website=Chronicle|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that shares the first part of the book's title.

In ''Robot-Proof'', Northeastern University president Joseph Aoun proposes a way to educate the next generation of college students to invent, to create, and to discover—to fill needs in society that even the most sophisticated artificial intelligence agent cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aoun|first1=Joseph|title=Robot-Proof|url=http://robot-proof.com|website=Robot-Proof|publisher=MIT Press|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "robot-proof" education, Aoun argues, is not concerned solely with topping up students' minds with high-octane facts. Rather, it calibrates them with a creative mindset and the mental elasticity to invent, discover, or create something valuable to society—a scientific proof, a hip-hop recording, a web comic, a cure for cancer. Aoun lays out the framework for a new discipline, humanics, which builds on our innate strengths and prepares students to compete in a labor market in which smart machines work alongside human professionals.

The only certainty about the future is change. Higher education based on the new literacies of humanics can equip students for living and working through change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aoun|first1=Joseph|title=Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence|date=September 1, 2017|publisher=MIT Press|url=http://robot-proof.com/|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was released on Aug. 25, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/robot-proof-joseph-aoun/1126186896?ean=9780262037280|website=Barnes and Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2017, Aoun appeared on C-SPAN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robot Proof, Sept 12 2017|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?433708-1/robot-proof|website=c-span.org|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to talk about ''Robot-Proof'' in which he argues for the need for better and continuous education to keep up with changing technology.

In an Op-Ed for ''Time'' on Sept. 26, 2017, Aoun said, "Beyond simply conferring degrees, the foundational purpose of colleges and universities must be to educate — and that means equipping people of all ages, at all stages of their careers, to build successful and fulfilling lives. This means we need to take several important steps to make our students robot-proof."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How College Students Should Prepare for Our Automated Future|url=http://time.com/4957419/college-students-artificial-intelligence-preparation/|website=Time.com|publisher=Time|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kārlis Mīlenbahs''' (his surname was formerly also written as '''Mühlenbach''', '''Mühlenbachs''', '''Mǖlenbachs''' or '''Mīlenbachs''') (18 January 1853 in [[Courland]] – 27 March 1916 in [[Võru]], [[Estonia]]) was the first native speaker of [[Latvian language|Latvian]] to devote his career to linguistics. Mīlenbahs studied classical [[philology]] at the [[University of Dorpat]] (he did not remain at the university because of his poverty). He was the author of over a hundred scholarly articles on the language in Latvian, [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[German language|German]], but his main achievement was the Latvian-German dictionary that remains the most important lexicographical work on Latvian (the first four volumes were printed posthumously between 1923 and 1932 in [[Riga]]; the dictionary was completed and expanded by [[Jānis Endzelīns]], with whom Mīlenbahs co-wrote other works, including a major Latvian grammar). His polemics with the poet [[Rainis]] led to an important essay on literary Latvian published in 1909, and he was also a translator of [[The Odyssey]] (1890–95).

'''Margam Stones Museum''' is a small Victorian schoolhouse near [[Port Talbot]], South Wales, which now provides a home for one of the most important collections of Celtic stone crosses in Britain. All originally found within the locality of [[Margam]], and mostly assembled as a collection in the 19th century, they provide enduring testimony to a Welsh Christian culture between the 6th and 16th centuries. The striking Cross of Conbelin is the most celebrated example. From around 1000 AD, it is a huge disc cross with Celtic interlace and plaitwork patterns, figurative scenes including a hunting scene, and inscriptions telling us who made it and who erected it. There are 17 early Christian stones, plus 11 memorials and other stones from the post-Norman periods. The museum is run by [[Cadw]], the Welsh historic sites agency, and is close to [[Margam Abbey]] Church and the ruins of  the Abbey buildings.

==Access==
Postcode: SA13 2TA. Access road is just north of J38 of the M4, {{convert|4|miles|km}} south-east of [[Port Talbot]]. There is a car park for visitors to the Abbey, Museum and Abbots Kitchen Restaurant.

==History of the museum==
[[Margam Abbey]] was a Cistercian Abbey founded in 1147, and the nave survives as Margam Parish Church. Upon its [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution]] in 1536 the [[Baron Mansel|Mansel family]] acquired it, and built a mansion in the [[Margam Country Park|grounds]]. In 1786 it passed by marriage to the [[Talbot]] family of [[Lacock]], Wiltshire, and it is they, during the 19th century, who began to gather together various stone crosses and standing stones in the locality. Initially they were placed in the mansion grounds. In 1892 Emily Talbot gave them to the nation, in the care of the Commissioner of Public Works. In 1932 they were moved into their present building, a former Church schoolhouse close to Margam Abbey Church. Other stones from the Abbey and the local area were added to the collection, which is now in the care of [[Cadw]].&lt;ref name=boards&gt;Sign boards at the museum, undated, viewed in the Museum in June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Stones==
Of the 30 or so ancient carved stones in the museum, 17 are pre-Norman, and are displayed on the ground floor. The remainder are Margam Abbey memorials, housed in the upper gallery, and are mainly tomb slabs. They include Cistercian and post-reformation memorials.

The pre-Norman stones form a distinct local group of early Christian carvings and inscribed text, and are described as one of the most important such collections in Britain.&lt;ref name=boards/&gt; Ten of these stones originate from Margam and its outlying settlements. Four others came from the area that became the [[Port Talbot steelworks]], and three are from the hills and farms of the wider area.&lt;ref name=boards/&gt;

The stones in the museum are part of a much larger group of carved and inscribed stones found across [[Glamorgan]] dating to the early Christian centuries. They can be classified into three groupings:&lt;ref name=boards/&gt;

;Latin inscribed memorials: These date from 450 to 650 AD, and indicate an early Welsh Christian culture. The three stone pillars in the museum provide early text including a Welsh family tree, and a stone with both [[Latin]] and [[Ogham]] inscriptions.&lt;ref name=boards/&gt;
;Cross inscribed slabs: Dating from 600 to 900 AD and crudely produced compared to the sculptured crosses, they have outline crosses cut into the stone.
;Sculptured crosses and cross slabs: From 900 to 1100 AD, these have detailed patterns of lattice or plaitwork, and include a number of inscriptions in [[Latin]]. They are the most visually dramatic group within the museum, and are the bulk of the pre-Norman collection.

==Latin inscribed memorials==

The milestone dates to 309–313, the dates for Emperor Maximinus. It was turned upside-down and re-used in the 6th century, when a memorial to Cantusus was inscribed. It is a sandstone pillar, {{convert|1.52|m|ft}} high, and {{convert|0.48|m|ft}} by {{convert|0.25|m|ft}}, first noted in 1839.&lt;ref name=milestone&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/prtt1_1.html Celtic Inscribed Stones Project – Roman Milepost PRTT1/1] 1999, ''ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp''.

[[File:Margam Stones 2 Pumpeius stone.JPG|thumb|100px|alt=Pumpeius Stone, 6th century|Pumpeius Stone]]

===No. 2. Stone of Pumpeius Carantorius===
This stone is also known as the Pumpeius Stone,&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey of Great Britain New Popular Edition, Sheet 153 – Swansea, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; the Kenfig Stone, and by local tradition 'Bêdh Morgan Morganwg' (The sepulchre of Prince Morgan).&lt;ref name=cispkenfg&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/kenfg_1.html Celtic Inscribed Stones Project – Pumpeius stone KELFG1] 1999, ''ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp''. Accessed 21 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was first recorded in 1578. A squared pillar of [[Old Red Sandstone]], {{convert|1.35|m|ft}} tall, it contains both [[Latin]] and [[Ogham]] scripts. Two areas of Ogham script appear, written as notches along the side of the stone, on the same face as the Latin name.&lt;ref name="babelstone"&gt;{{Cite web | last=West | first=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew West (linguist) | title=The Ogham Stones of Wales | url=http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Blog/2010/03/ogham-stones-of-wales.html | date=1 March 2010 | accessdate=2012-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Margam Stones 3 Bodvoc stone.JPG|100px|thumb|alt=Bodvoc Stone, 6th C|Bodvoc Stone]]

===No. 3. Bodvoc Stone===
A stone pillar also known as 'The Margam Stone', and 'Carreg Lythyrenog'. It originates from a nearby mountain location, set into a prehistoric buriel mound, where a replica now stands. It was first documented in 1578, and local folk-lore declared that anyone reading the inscription would die soon afterwards.&lt;ref name=cispmarg&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/marg1_1.html Celtic Inscribed Stones Project – Bodvoc Stone MARG1/1], ''ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp''. Accessed 21 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It is a stone pillar, {{convert|1.01|m|ft}} high, with four lines of Latin inscription and an incised cross. On the back there is an [[Ordnance Survey]] [[Benchmark (surveying)|bench mark]], and various more recent carvings. It was moved to the museum before 1945.&lt;ref name=cispmarg/&gt;
;Date: Late 6th or early 7th century&lt;ref name=boards/&gt;
;Inscription:BODVOCI HIC IACIT FILIUS CATOTIGIRNI PRONEPUS ETERNALI VEDOMAVI
:translates as '[The Stone] of Bodvoc. Here he lies, son of Cattegern [or Cattegirn], and great-grandson of Eternalis Vedomavus'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/301392/details/MYNYDD+MARGAM+PILLAR+STONE%3BBODVOC+STONE%2C+SITE+OF/ Coflein.gov.uk Bodvoc record] Accessed 17 June&lt;/ref&gt;
;decoration: A small incised [[Maltese cross]] is on the top surface of the pillar. This may be of the same date as the inscription.&lt;ref name=cispmarg/&gt;
;Location: It originally stood on a cairn on Margam Mountain, between [[Bridgend]] and [[Maesteg]]. The [[Ordnance Survey]] cut a [[Benchmark (surveying)|bench mark]] on it, and [[graffiti]] was also carved onto the stone, before it was moved to the museum, with a replica replacing it at its original location&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bridgend.gov.uk/web/groups/public/documents/services/llynfivalley3finallowres.pdf Llynfi Valley Walk 3]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://naturalneighbourhoods.com/community/whats-green-near-me/routes/llynfi-valley-walk-3.aspx Llynfi Valley Walk 3] at naturalneighbourhoods.com, accessed 18 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; (coordinates {{coord|51.5857|-3.6893|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Bodvoc Stone find spot}}, {{gbmapping|SS 8306 8878}}&lt;ref name="babelstone"/&gt;).

==Cross inscribed slabs==
[[File:Margam Stones 4 Pillar of Thomas.JPG|thumb|100px|Pillar of Thomas]]
These date from 600 to 900 AD and are crudely produced compared to the later sculptured crosses. Several of the Margam stones feature these incised carvings, including No 3, and the back of No 13. Only No 4 falls purely within this category.

===No. 4. Pillar of Thomas===
A tall cylindrical stone pillar with the top broken and missing. Three outline [[Latin cross]]es are cut in, and a short inscription. The pillar is {{convert|1.14|m|ft}} high, with a diameter of {{convert|0.38|m|ft}}, tapering slightly towards the base. It was discovered 'under a hedge' at Cwrt Uchaf Farm in 1857, before being moved to join the Margam collection.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/prtt2_1.html Celtic Inscribed Stones Project – Pillar of Thomas PRTT2/1] 1999, ''ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp''. (Accessed 26 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
;Date: 8th to early 9th century
;Inscription: TO ME
::'Thomas' (implying 'The cross of Thomas', which could be a reference to the apostle or a local namesake.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;)
;Location: It is from Cwrt Uchaf Farm, Port Talbot (Now under the steelworks).&lt;ref name=boards/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Sculptured crosses and cross slabs==
These date from 900 to 1100 AD, and form the great majority of the Margam early Christian collection. Seven of them are from the immediate environs of Margam, and three are from the same location as the Pillar of Thomas, implying perhaps two pre-Norman monastic establishments in the area, using the local sandstone to create distinctive Celtic stone sculpture.

[[File:Margam Stones 5 Cross of Einion.JPG|thumb|100px|Cross of Einion]]

===No. 5. Cross of Einion===
The earliest of the Glamorgan disc-headed crosses (along with one at [[Llantwit Major]]). The cross and stem have intricate lattice patterns with an inscription in ''[[Insular script|insular majuscule]]'' script.&lt;ref name=boards/&gt; First mention of this cross was in 1873, by which time it was in the Abbey Chapter house collection. It measures {{convert|1.88|m|ft}}high, {{convert|0.96|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|0.13|m|ft}} thick, made from locally occurring [[Pennant Measures|Pennant sandstone]].&lt;ref name=einion&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/marg2_1.html Celtic Inscribed Stones Project: Cross of Einion: MARG2/1 '(Euniaun Stone)'] 1999 ''ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp'', accessed 20 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The circular head of the cross has been roughly cut back to make it a more even shape for re-use as building material.
;Date:late 9th century
;Decoration: Square headed ringed cross, Geometric ribbon interlace and geometric key pattern.

The shaft includes carved figures flanking the cross, taken to be [[John the Evangelist|St John]] holding his [[gospel]], and the [[virgin Mary]]. This is set into a massive stone pedestal block with intricate geometrical patterns and a hunting scene which would originally have formed the front, but was at some point reversed, so is now at the back of the pedestal.

[[File:MargamAbbey.JPG|thumb|Margam Abbey: West front of the Church]]
[[File:Margam Abbey Ruins - geograph.org.uk - 848570.jpg|thumb|Margam Abbey Ruins, including the Chapter House]]
In 1147 the Margam monastery was re-founded as a [[Cistercian]] Abbey by [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]] and lord of Glamorgan. With French monks, an English lord and new Abbey buildings, there would have been little or no interest in the earlier monastery, and the early stones are the main evidence that survives. The Nave and west front of the [[Margam Abbey|Cistercian Abbey Church]], on the other hand, survived both the reformation and a 19th-century renovation, and is now the Parish Church. The remainder of the Abbey buildings,including the Chapter house, with its memorials to the Cistercian Abbots, became part of the estate of the [[Baron Mansel|Mansel]] and then [[Talbot]] families, and are now part of [[Margam Country Park|Margam public park]].

The Talbot family collected the early Christian Stones in and around the Chapter house, and under the care of the Commissioner of Public Works they were all re-housed in the current museum, including five grave-slabs and an effigy from the pre-reformation period, and four post-reformation memorial slabs. Following [[Cadw]]s major reworking of the museum building in the 1990s these later stones are all housed in the upper gallery, creating a clear distinction between the early Christian stones and the Cistercian and later memorials.&lt;ref name=boards/&gt;
 
[[File:Margam Stones upper gallery.JPG|thumb|left|Margam Stones Museum upper gallery]]
Most of the grave slabs give simple initials, but three that have names are to Robert, Abbot of Rievaulx (No. 21, 1307); Henry, the 9th Abbot (No. 23, 14th century) and a partial inscription in Welsh '...EV GORWEDD GORPH ELI[ZABETH] .. HON V GLADDWYD ...' ( [here] lies the body of Elizabeth ... who was buried...', (No. 25, c. 1600).&lt;ref name=boards/&gt;

'''Marwan Hasib Ibrahim Barghouti''' (also transliterated '''al-Barghuthi'''; {{lang-ar|مروان حسيب ابراهيم البرغوثي}}; born 6 June 1959) is a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] political figure convicted and imprisoned for murder by an Israeli court.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; He is regarded as a leader of the [[First Intifada|First]] and [[Second Intifada]]s.

== Biography ==
Barghouti was born in the village of [[Kobar]] near [[Ramallah]], and comes from the [[Barghouti]] clan, an extended family from [[Deir Ghassaneh]]. [[Mustafa Barghouti]], a fellow Palestinian political figure, is a distant cousin. Barghouti was one of seven children, and his father was a migrant worker in Lebanon. His younger brother Muqbel described him as "a naughty and rebellious boy".&lt;ref name=NYTBennet&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennet|first=James|title=Jailed in Israel, Palestinian Symbol Eyes Top Post|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/19/international/middleeast/19palestine.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barghouti joined Fatah at age 15,&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; and he was a co-founder of the Fatah Youth Movement (Shabiba) on the West Bank. By the age of 18 in 1976, Barghouti was arrested by Israel for his involvement with Palestinian militant groups. He completed his secondary education and received a high school diploma while serving a four-year term in jail, where he gained fluency in Hebrew.&lt;ref name="Hajjar" &gt;Lisa Hajjar, 'Interview with Marwan Barghouti' in  Joel Beinin, Rebecca L. Stein (eds.),[https://books.google.com/books?id=EVN_FhziN_EC&amp;pg=PA105 ''The Struggle for Sovereignty: Palestine and Israel, 1993-2005,''] Stanford University Press, 2006 p.105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barghouti enrolled at [[Birzeit University]] (BZU) in 1983, though arrest and exile meant that he did not receive his B.A. (History and Political Science) until 1994. He earned an M.A. in International Relations, also from Birzeit, in 1998. As an undergraduate, he was active in student politics on behalf of Fatah and headed the BZU Student Council. On 21 October 1984, he married a fellow student, Fadwa Ibrahim. Fadwa took bachelor's and master's degrees in law and was a prominent advocate in her own right on behalf of Palestinian prisoners, before becoming the leading campaigner for her husband’s release from his current jail term. The couple has a daughter, Ruba (born 1986), and three sons, Qassam (born 1985), Sharaf (born 1989) and Arab (born 1990).

== First Intifada, the Oslo Accords and the aftermath==
Barghouti became one of the major leaders in the West Bank of the [[First Intifada]] in 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israeli occupation.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; During the uprising, he was arrested by Israel and deported to [[Jordan]] for incitement,&lt;ref name="BeininStein2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joel Beinin|author2=Rebecca L.

== Second Intifada ==
[[File:QalandiaWallBarghouti.JPG|250px|thumb|A portrait of Marwan Barghouti on the wall by [[Qalandia]].]]
In September 2000, the [[Second Intifada]] began. Barghouti became increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah armed branch, the [[Tanzim]], seen as one of the major forces fighting against the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Barghouti led marches to Israeli checkpoints, where riots broke out against Israeli soldiers and spurred on Palestinians in speeches at funerals and demonstrations, condoning the use of force to expel Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; He has stated that, "I, and the Fatah movement to which I belong, strongly oppose attacks and the targeting of civilians inside Israel, our future neighbor, I reserve the right to protect myself, to resist the Israeli occupation of my country and to fight for my freedom" and has said, "I still seek peaceful coexistence between the equal and independent countries of Israel and Palestine based on full withdrawal from Palestinian territories occupied in 1967."&lt;ref name=wp-oped-20020116&gt;{{cite news|title=Want Security?

As the Palestinian death toll in the Second Intifada increased, Barghouti called for Palestinians to target Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank and Gaza.&lt;ref name="BeininStein2006" /&gt; During the second intifada Barghouti was accused by Israel of being a senior member of the [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]], an organization which conducted numerous attacks and suicide bombings on civilians both within and outside of Israel proper,&lt;ref name="BBCProfile" /&gt; and has been accused of having directed some of these bombings personally.&lt;ref name="BBCProfile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Marwan Barghouti|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13628771|accessdate=1 May 2017|publisher=BBC|date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NavonMFAReport"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Navon|first1=Dani|title=The Involvement of Arafat, PA Senior Officials and Apparatuses in Terrorism against Israel: Corruption and Crime|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/The%20Involvement%20of%20Arafat-%20PA%20Senior%20Officials%20and.aspx|accessdate=1 May 2017|publisher=MFA Israel|date=6 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some Palestinian militants advocated adopting tactics based on those used by Hezbollah to drive the Israeli army out of Lebanon, Barghouti was seen as less radical, supporting violent actions based on popular movements but exclusively within the Palestinian territories.&lt;ref&gt;Gilead Sher, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EdgAWFiDryMC&amp;pg=PA183 ''The Israeli-Palestinian Peace Negotiations, 1999-2001: Within Reach,''] Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006 p.183.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[National Public Radio]], Barghouti "cut his ideological teeth as the political leader of Fatah's armed militant wing, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.&lt;ref name="Westervelt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westervelt|first1=Eric|title=Groups Call for Release of Marwan Barghouti|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12026376|accessdate=1 May 2017|publisher=National Public Radio|date=17 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israeli trial and imprisonment ===
Israel accused him of founding the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and attempted to assassinate him in 2001.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; The missile hit his bodyguard's car, killing the bodyguard.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; Barghouti survived but was arrested by the [[Israeli Army]] in [[Ramallah]], on 15 April 2002 and transferred to the '[[Russian Compound]]' police station in Jerusalem.

Amos Harel wrote in ''[[Haaretz]]'' that Barghouti was arrested by soldiers of the [[Duchifat Battalion]] who had approached the building hidden in an ambulance to avoid detection: "The Duchifat soldiers were squeezed into a protected ambulance in order to arrive as quickly as possible at the house where Barghouti was hiding, and to seal it off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.787563|title = גורמי ביטחון: ברגותי מפגין יהירות בחקירה|publisher=Haaretz|date=18 April 2002|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months later, he was indicted in an Israeli civilian court on 26 charges of murder and attempted murder stemming from attacks carried out by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades on Israeli civilians and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/12/State%20of%20Israel%20vs%20Marwan%20Barghouti-%20Ruling%20by%20Jud Full indictment], [[Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/8/Marwan%20Barghouti%20Indictment%20-%20Appendix-%20Terrorist Indictment appendix] listing all charges&lt;/ref&gt;

Marwan Barghouti refused to present a defense to the charges brought against him, maintaining throughout that the trial was illegal and illegitimate.&lt;ref name=medea /&gt; The Israeli verdict against him in effect removed Arafat's only political rival.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Shindler  [https://books.google.com/books?id=U_ukZhiBzykC&amp;pg=PA337  ''A History of Modern Israel,''] Cambridge University Press, 2013 p.337.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barghouti stressed that he supported armed resistance to the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation]], but condemned attacks on civilians inside Israel. According to the case argued by Israel at his trial, he had supported and authorized such attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Issacharoff |first=Avi |title=In rare court appearance, Marwan Barghouti calls for a peace deal based on 1967 lines |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/in-rare-court-appearance-marwan-barghouti-calls-for-a-peace-deal-based-on-1967-lines-1.409329 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 2004, he was convicted of five counts of murder: authorizing and organizing the [[murder of Georgios Tsibouktzakis]], a shooting adjacent to [[Giv'at Ze'ev]] in which a civilian was killed, and the [[Seafood Market attack]] in [[Tel Aviv]] in which three civilians were killed. In addition, he was convicted of attempted murder for a failed [[car bomb]] attack near [[Malha Mall]] that exploded prematurely, resulting in the deaths of two suicide bombers,  and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization. He was acquitted of 21 counts of murder in 33 other attacks as no proof was brought to link Barghouti directly with the specific decisions of the local leadership of the Tanzim to carry out these particular attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/barghouti-found-guilty-of-5-murders-1.123188 Barghouti Found Guilty of 5 Murders], Haaretz, 21st May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 June 2004, he was sentenced to the maximum possible punishment for his convictions: five cumulative life sentences for the murders and an additional 40 years, consisting of 20 years each for attempted murder and for membership and activity in a terrorist organization.

The [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] reviewed the case and released a report that criticized Barghouti's arrest, treatment while in detention, and trial. It said his rights were violated and international treaties and norms were contravened.&lt;ref name="Foreman" &gt;Simon Foreman  [http://www.ipu.org/hr-e/174/report.htm  'The trial of Mr. Marwan Barghouti,'] [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Inter-Parliamentary Union report is widely cited, including:

=== Campaign for release ===
[[File:Kufr ad-Deek.protest.4.JPG|250px|thumb|A portrait of Marwan Barghouti at a demonstration at [[Kafr ad-Dik]].]]
Since Barghouti's arrest, many of his supporters have campaigned for his release. They include prominent Palestinian figures, members of European Parliament and the Israeli group [[Gush Shalom]]. [[Reuters]] reported that some see Barghouti "as a Palestinian Nelson Mandela, the man who could galvanize a drifting and divided national movement if only he were set free by Israel".&lt;ref name=r20091119&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1129348.html|title=Marwan Barghouti: Peace talks with Israel have failed |newspaper=Haaretz|date=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Jerusalem Post'', "[u]nlike many in the Western media, Palestinian journalists and writers have rarely - if ever - referred to Barghouti as...the 'Palestinian Nelson Mandela.'"&lt;ref name=jp20091126&gt;{{cite news|title=Analysis: Marwan Barghouti - A Nelson Mandela or a PR gimmick?|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Analysis-Marwan-Barghouti-A-Nelson-Mandela-or-a-PR-gimmick|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=26 November 2009|author=Khaled Abu Toameh|authorlink= Khaled Abu Toameh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is to suggest that Israel's freeing of Barghouti would be an excellent show of good faith in the peace process. This view gained popularity among the Israeli left after the 2005 [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Disengagement]] from the [[Gaza Strip]]. Still others, operating from a [[realpolitik]] perspective, have pointed out that allowing Barghouti to re-enter Palestinian politics could serve to bolster Fatah against gains in [[Hamas]]' popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/6966 "The Blame Game – Forward.com"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pinhas Inbari]] of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Hamas understands it needs to provide its supporters with some comfort, especially seeing the suffering of the Palestinian people. For this reason, Hamas is willing to accept Barghouti's release and to deal with him after he is free. Without the severe state of the Palestinian people, Hamas would object to the release of Barghouti.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org.il/Templates/showpage.asp?FID=440&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=2&amp;TMID=99&amp;IID=11247 On the chances of the release of Gilad Shalit (Hebrew)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224031351/http://www.jcpa.org.il/Templates/showpage.asp?FID=440&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=2&amp;TMID=99&amp;IID=11247 |date=24 December 2007 }}, [[Pinhas Inbari]], 20 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following Barghouti's January 2006 re-election to the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]], a debate over Barghouti's fate began anew in Israel, ranging from former MK [[Yossi Beilin|Yossi Beilin's]] support for a Presidential pardon to the total refusal of any idea of early release. Israeli Foreign Minister [[Silvan Shalom]] stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"We must not forget that he is a cold-blooded murderer who was sentenced by the court to five life sentences… It is out of the question to free an assassin who has blood on his hands and was duly sentenced by a court.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=93696|title=Barghouti´s Popularity Spurs Campaign to Free Him|publisher=Israel National News|date=25 January 2006|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=20341|title=Israelis may release jailed Fatah leader|publisher=The Daily Star|date=28 November 2005|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However several MKs, including Kadima MK [[Meir Sheetrit]], suggested that Barghouti will likely be released as part of future peace negotiations, although they did not specify when. In January 2007, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] declared that he would sign a presidential pardon for Marwan Barghouti if elected to the Israeli presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloomfield|first=David|title=Marwan Barghouti could stand as Palestinian president|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/6516150/Marwan-Barghouti-could-stand-as-Palestinian-president.html|accessdate=4 July 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite Peres winning the presidency, a pardon was not issued.

== Split from Fatah ==
[[File:בית אומר 23.4.11 001.jpg|250px|thumb|A portrait of Marwan Barghouti at a demonstration at [[Beit Ummar]].]]
On 14 December 2005, Barghouti announced that he had formed a new political party, [[Al-Mustaqbal (electoral list)|al-Mustaqbal]] ("The Future"), mainly composed of members of Fatah's "Young Guard", who repeatedly expressed frustration with the entrenched corruption in the party. The list, which was presented to the Palestinian Authority's central elections committee on that day, included [[Mohammed Dahlan]], [[Kadoura Fares]], [[Samir Mashharawi]] and [[Jibril Rajoub]].&lt;ref name=medea&gt;{{cite web|title=Barghouti, Marwan|url=http://www.medea.be/en/themes/biographies/abc/barghouti-marwan/|publisher=MEDEA|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The split followed Barghouti's earlier refusal of [[Mahmoud Abbas]]' offer to be second on the Fatah party's parliamentary list, behind Palestinian Prime Minister [[Ahmed Qurei]]. Barghouti had actually topped the list,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4530206.stm "Fatah splits before key election"]. [[BBC News]]. 15 December 2005. Accessed 9 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but this had not become apparent until after the new party had been registered.

Reactions to the news was split. Some suggested that the move was a positive step towards peace, as Barghouti's new party could help reform major problems in Palestinian government. Others raised concern that it could wind up splitting the Fatah vote, inadvertently helping Hamas. Barghouti's supporters argued that al-Mustaqbal would split the votes of both parties, both from disenchanted Fatah members as well as moderate Hamas voters who do not agree with Hamas' political goals, but rather its social work and hard position on corruption. Some observers also hypothesized that the formation of al-Mustaqbal was mostly a negotiating tactic to get members of the Young Guard into higher positions of power within Fatah and its electoral list.

Barghouti eventually was convinced that the idea of leading a new party, especially one that was created by splitting from Fatah, would be unrealistic while he was still in prison. Instead he stood as a Fatah candidate in the January 2006 [[Palestinian Legislative Council|PLC]] elections, comfortably regaining his seat in the [[Palestinian Parliament]].

== Political activity in prison ==
In late 2004, Barghouti announced from his Israeli prison his intention to run in the Palestinian Authority [[Palestinian presidential election, 2005|presidential election in January 2005]], called for following the death of President [[Yasser Arafat]] in November. On 26 November 2004, it appeared he would withdraw from the contest following pressure from the [[Fatah]] faction to support the candidacy of [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. However, just before the deadline on 1 December, Barghouti's wife registered him as an independent candidate. On 12 December, facing pressure from Fatah&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/barghouti-withdrawal-leaves-abbas-with-clear-path-to-succeed-arafat-534751.html Barghouti withdrawal leaves Abbas with clear path to succeed Arafat]&lt;/ref&gt; to withdraw in favor of Abbas, he chose to abandon his candidacy for the benefit of Palestinian unity. On 11 May 2006, Palestinian leaders held in Israeli prisons released the [[Palestinian Prisoners' Document|National Conciliation Document of the Prisoners]]. The document was a proposal initiated by Marwan Barghouti and leaders of [[Hamas]], the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]], the [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]] and the [[DFLP]] that proposed a basis upon which a coalition government should be formed in the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]]. This came as a result of the political stalemate in the [[Palestinian territories]] that followed Hamas' election to the PLC in January 2006. Crucially, the document also called for negotiation with the state of Israel in order to achieve lasting peace. The document quickly gained popular currency and is now considered the bedrock upon which a national unity government should be achieved. According to Haaretz, Barghouti, although not officially represented in the negotiations of a Palestinian unity government in February 2007, played a major role in mediating between Hamas and Fatah and formulating the compromise reached on 8 February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/824020.html article]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, he was elected to party leadership at the Fatah Conference in Bethlehem.&lt;ref name="haaretz1" /&gt;

In April 2017 he organized a hunger strike of Palestinian security prisoners in Israeli jails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/04/21/hunger-strike-puts-jailed-palestinian-in-spotlight.html, Hunger strike puts jailed Palestinian in spotlight], Fox news from AP wire, 21 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He laid out the motivation{{specify|date=May 2017}} behind the strike in an op-ed in [[the New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/opinion/palestinian-hunger-strike-prisoners-call-for-justice.html?_r=0 Why We Are on Hunger Strike in Israel’s Prison], 16 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May, the [[Israel Prison Service]] released a video allegedly showing Barghouti secretly eating snacks in his prison cell, once on 27 April and again on 5 May.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39843196 Palestinian hunger strike leader Barghouti 'filmed eating'], BBC, 8 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/05/08/did-hunger-striking-palestinian-prisoner-barghouti-just-eat-some-cookies-israel-says-he-did/ Did hunger striking Palestinian prisoner Barghouti just eat some cookies? Israel says he did.], Washington Post, 8 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Haaretz'', anonymous sources in the prison service said food was made available to Barghouti as part of a setup to check his adherence to his hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.787803 Israel Releases Footage of Palestinian Hunger Strike Leader Barghouti Eating in His Prison Cell], Haaretz, 8 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Barghouti's wife said that the video was faked and was intended to undermine the hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4958906,00.html Barghouti's wife: 'Recordings of Marwan breaking the strike are fake'], YNet, 8 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularity ==
Despite being out of the public eye for a few years, Marwan Barghouti remains a popular leader among the Palestinian people. According to polling data in mid-2012, 60% of Palestinians would vote for him for president of the Palestinian Authority if they were given that chance, and he would beat both Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas leader [[Ismail Haniyeh]] for the top post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/poll-barghouti-would-defeat-abbas-and-haniyeh-in-vote-for-palestinian-president.premium-1.444382|title=Poll: Barghouti Would Defeat Abbas and Haniyeh in Vote for Palestinian President|date=27 June 2012|last=Issacharoff|first=Avi|website=Haaretz|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
In [[phonology]], '''minimal pairs''' are pairs of [[word]]s or phrases in a particular [[language]], spoken or [[Sign language|signed]], that differ in only one phonological element, such as a [[phoneme]], [[toneme]] or [[chroneme]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Daniel|year=1944|title=Chronemes and Tonemes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have distinct meanings. They are used to demonstrate that two [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] are two separate phonemes in the language.

Many phonologists in the middle part of the 20th century had a strong interest in developing techniques for discovering the phonemes of unknown languages, and in some cases, they set up writing systems for the languages. The major work of [[Kenneth Pike]] on the subject is ''Phonemics: a technique for reducing languages to writing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pike|first=Kenneth|year=1947|title=Phonemics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimal pair was an essential tool in the discovery process and was found by '''substitution''' or '''commutation''' tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swadesh|first=M.|year=1934|title=The Phonemic Principle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern phonology is much less interested in such issues, and the minimal pair is consequently considered{{by whom|date=November 2017}} to be of little theoretical importance.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

As an example for [[English language|English]] [[vowel]]s, the pair "l'''e'''t" + "l'''i'''t" can be used to demonstrate that the phones {{IPA|[ɛ]}} (in l'''e'''t) and {{IPA|[ɪ]}} (in l'''i'''t) actually represent distinct phonemes {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɪ/}}. An example for English [[consonants]] is the minimal pair of "'''p'''at" + "'''b'''at". The following table shows other pairs demonstrating the existence of various distinct phonemes in English. All of the possible minimal pairs for any language may be set out in the same way.

[[Phonemic differentiation]] may vary between different [[dialect]]s of a language so a particular minimal pair in one [[accent (dialect)|accent]] may be a pair of [[homophone]]s in another. That means not that one of the phonemes is absent in the homonym accent but only that it is not contrastive in the same range of contexts.

==Types==
In addition to the minimal pairs of vowels and consonants provided above, others may be found:

===Quantity===
Many languages show contrasts between long and short vowels and consonants. A distinctive difference in length is attributed by some phonologists to a unit called a [[chroneme]]. Thus, [[Italian language|Italian]] has the following minimal pair that is based on long and short {{IPA|/l/}}:
{|class="wikitable"
! spelling || IPA ||meaning
|-
| pala ||{{IPA|/ˈpala/}}|| shovel
|-
| palla ||{{IPA|/ˈpalla/}} || ball
|}
However, in such a case it is not easy to decide whether a long vowel or consonant should be treated as having an added chroneme or simply as a [[geminate]] sound with phonemes.

[[Classical Latin]], [[German language|German]], some [[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]], almost all [[Uralic languages]], [[Thai language|Thai]], and many other languages also have distinctive length in [[vowel]]s. An example is the ''cŭ/cū'' minimal pair in the dialect that is spoken near [[Palmi]] ([[Calabria]], [[Italy]]):

{|class="wikitable"
! Dialect spoken in Palmi || IPA || Quality || Etymology || Latin || Italian || English
|-
| Cŭ voli? || {{IPA|/kuˈvɔːli/}} || short || cŭ &lt; lat. ''qu(is)'' ("who?") || Quis vult? || Chi vuole? || Who wants?
|-
| Cū voli? || {{IPA|/kuːˈvɔːli/}} || long || cū &lt; lat. ''qu(o) (ill)ŭ(m)'' ("for-what him?") || Quō illum/illud vult? || Per che cosa lo vuole? || For what (reason) does he want him/it?
|}

====Syntactic gemination====
In some languages like Italian, word-initial consonants are [[geminate]]d after certain vowel-final words in the same [[prosodic unit]]. Sometimes, the phenomenon can create some [[syntactic gemination|syntactic-gemination]]-minimal-pairs:

{|class="wikitable"
! Italian [[sandhi]] || IPA || Meaning || Sample sentence || Meaning of the sample sentence
|-
| {{lang|it|dà casa}}  || {{IPA|/dakˈkasa/}} || (he/she) gives (his/her) house || ''{{lang|it|Carlo ci dà casa.}}'' || Carlo gives us his house.
|-
| {{lang|it|da casa}} || {{IPA|/daˈkasa/}} || from home || ''{{lang|it|Carlo uscì da casa.}}'' || Carlo got out from home.
|}
In the example, the graphical [[accent (phonetics)|accent]] on ''dà'' is just a [[diacritical mark]] that does not change the [[pronunciation]] of the word itself. However, in some specific areas, like [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscany]], both phrases are pronounced {{IPA|/daˈkkaːza/}} and so can be distinguished only from the context.

===Tone===
Minimal pairs for tone contrasts in [[tone language]]s can be established; some writers refer to that as a contrast involving a [[toneme]]. For example, [[Kono language|Kono]] distinguishes high tone and low tone on syllables:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roach|first=Peter|year=2009|pages=122|title=English Phonetics and Phonology}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{|class="wikitable"
! tone || word ||meaning
|-
| high ||{{IPA|/ ̄ buu/}}|| horn
|-
| low ||{{IPA|/_buu/}} || cross
|}

===Stress===
Languages in which [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] may occur in different positions within the word often have contrasts that can be shown in minimal pairs, as in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]:
{|class="wikitable"
! language ||word || IPA || meaning
|-
| Greek || ποτέ || {{IPA|/poˈte/}} || ever
|-
| Greek || πότε || {{IPA|/ˈpote/}} || when
|-
| Spanish || esta || {{IPA|/ˈesta/}} || this
|-
| Spanish || está || {{IPA|/esˈta/}} || (he/she/it) is
|}

===Juncture===
English-speakers are able to hear the difference between, for example, "great ape" and "grey tape", but phonemically, the two phrases are identical: {{IPA|/ɡreɪteɪp/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=D.|year=1931|title=The "Word" as a phonetic entity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor and Tooley|year=1964|title=The perceptibility of certain word-boundaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the two phrases, which constitute a minimal pair, is said to be one of [[juncture]]. At the word boundary, a "plus juncture" /+/ is posited and said to be the factor conditioning allophones to allow distinctivity: the result is that "great ape" has an {{IPA|/eɪ/}} diphthong shortened by [[clipping (phonetics)|pre-fortis clipping]] and, since it is not syllable-initial, a {{IPA|/t/}} with little [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] (variously {{IPA|[t˭]}}, [[Flapping|{{IPA|[ɾ]}}]], [[T-glottalization|{{IPA|[ʔt]}}]], {{IPAblink|ʔ}}, etc., depending on dialect); meanwhile in "grey tape", the {{IPA|/eɪ/}} has its full length and the {{IPA|/t/}} is aspirated {{IPA|[tʰ]}}.

Only languages with allophonic differences associated with grammatical boundaries have juncture as a phonological element.  It is claimed that [[French language|French]] does not have juncture as a phonological element&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|year=1973|title=Phonetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; so, for example, "{{lang|fr|des petits trous}}" (little holes) and "{{lang|fr|des petites roues}}" (little wheels), phonemically both {{IPA|/depətitʁu/}}, are phonetically identical.

==Minimal sets==
The principle of a simple binary opposition between the two members of a minimal pair may be extended to cover a '''minimal set''' in which a number of words differ from one another in terms of one phone in a particular position in the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ladefoged|first=P.|year=2006|pages=35–6|title=A Course in Phonetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the vowels {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}} of [[Swahili language|Swahili]] are shown to be distinct by the following set of words:
''pata'' 'hinge', ''peta'' 'bend', ''pita'' 'pass', ''pota'' 'twist', ''puta'' 'thrash'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ladefoged|first=P.|year=2001|pages=26|title=Vowels and Consonants}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, establishing such sets is not always straightforward{{hsp}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fromkin and Rodman|year=1993|pages=218–220|title=An Introduction to Language}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may require very complex study of multiple oppositions as expounded by, for example, [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trubetzkoy|first=N.|year=1969|title=Principles of Phonology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is beyond the scope of this article.

==Teaching==
Minimal pairs were an important part of the theory of pronunciation teaching during its development in the period of [[structuralist linguistics]], particularly in the 1940s and 1950s, and minimal pair drills were widely used to train students to discriminate among the phonemes of the target language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Celce-Murcia|year=1996|pages=3–4|title=Teaching Pronunciation|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, later writers have criticized the approach as being artificial and lacking in relevance to language learners' needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Gillian|year=1990|pages=144–6|title=Listening to Spoken English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers have claimed that learners are likely not to hear differences between phones if the difference is not a phonemic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lado|first=R.|year=1961|pages=15|title=Language Testing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pennington|first=M.|year=1996|pages=24|title=Phonology in English Language Teaching}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the objectives of [[contrastive analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lado|first=R.|year=1957|title=Linguistics across Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt; of languages' sound systems was to identify points of likely difficulty for language learners that would arise from differences in phoneme inventories between the native language and the target language. However, experimental evidence for this claim is hard to find, and the claim should be treated with caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Celce-Murcia|year=1996|pages=19–20|title=Teaching Pronunciation|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In sign languages ==
In the past, signs were considered holistic forms without internal structure. However, the discovery in the mid-20th century that minimal pairs also exist in sign languages showed that sign languages have sublexical structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stokoe|first=W. C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Sign Language Structure: An Outline of the Visual Communication Systems of the American Deaf|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/deafed/eni001|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=3–37|doi=10.1093/deafed/eni001|issn=1465-7325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs consist of [[Phoneme#Phonemes in sign languages|phonemes]], which are specifications for location, movement, handshape, orientation, and non-manual elements. When signs differ in only one of these specifications, they form a minimal pair. For instance, the German Sign Language signs [https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/9/14916.mp4 shoes] and [https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/9/14976.mp4 socks] are identical in form apart from their handshapes.

'''''Moon''''' is a 2009 [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Duncan Jones]] and written by Nathan Parker from a story by Jones. The film follows Sam Bell ([[Sam Rockwell]]), a man who experiences a personal crisis as he nears the end of a three-year solitary stint mining [[helium-3]] on the [[far side of the Moon]]. It was the feature debut of director Duncan Jones. [[Kevin Spacey]] voices Sam's robot companion, GERTY. ''Moon'' premiered at the 2009 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was released in selected cinemas in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]] on 12 June 2009. The release was expanded to additional theatres in the [[United States]] on 10 July and to the [[United Kingdom]] on 17 July.

''Moon'' was modestly budgeted and grossed just under $10 million worldwide&lt;ref name="Mojo"/&gt; but was well-received by critics. Rockwell's performance found praise as did the film's [[scientific realism]] and plausibility. It won numerous film critic and film festival awards and was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film]].

==Plot==

In the near future,{{efn|A computer screen shows a date of 2035 in one scene towards the end.}} Lunar Industries has made a fortune after an oil crisis by building Sarang Station, an automated facility on the far side of [[the Moon]] to mine the alternative fuel [[helium-3]] from lunar soil, rich in the material. The facility is [[Post-scarcity economy|fully automated]], requiring only a single human to maintain operations, oversee the harvesters, and launch canisters bound for [[Earth]] containing the extracted helium-3. Sam Bell nears the end of his three-year work contract at Sarang Station. Chronic communication problems have disabled his live feed from Earth and limit him to occasional recorded messages from his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left. His only companion is an [[artificial intelligence]] named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation and provides comfort for him.

Two weeks before his return to Earth, Sam begins to suffer from hallucinations of a teenage girl. One such image distracts him while out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his [[lunar rover]] into the harvester. Rapidly losing cabin air from the crash, Sam falls unconscious.

Sam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident. He overhears GERTY having what appears to be a live chat with Lunar Industries management. Lunar Industries then orders Sam to remain on base and informs him that a rescue team will arrive to repair the harvester. Suspicious, Sam manufactures a fake problem to persuade GERTY to let him outside. He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds his unconscious [[doppelgänger]]. He brings the double back to the base and tends to his injuries. The two Sams start to wonder if one is a [[Human cloning|clone]] of the other. After a heated argument and physical altercation, they coerce GERTY into revealing that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell. GERTY activated the newest clone after the rover crash, and convinced him that he was at the beginning of his three-year contract.

The two Sams search the facility, discovering a secret vault containing hundreds of hibernating clones and a communications substation beyond the facility's perimeter which has been interfering with the live feed from Earth. They determine that Lunar Industries is unethically using clones of the original Sam Bell to avoid the cost of training and transporting new astronauts, as well as deliberately [[Radio jamming|jamming]] the live feed in order to prevent the clones from contacting Earth; clones who believe they're entering the final hibernation at the end of their contract just before their final return to Earth are in fact incinerated. The older Sam clone drives past the interference radius in a second rover and tries to call Tess on Earth. He instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died "some years ago". He hangs up when Eve tells her father (offscreen, identified as "Original Sam" in [[closed captioning]]) that someone is calling regarding Tess.

The two Sams realize that the incoming rescue team will kill them both if they are found together. The newer Sam convinces GERTY to wake another clone, planning to leave the awakened clone in the crashed rover and send the older Sam to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports. But the older Sam, having learned that the clones are [[Planned obsolescence|designed to "break down"]] at the end of the 3-year contract, knows that he will not live much longer. With his health declining, the older Sam suggests that he be placed back into the crashed rover to die so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything, while the younger Sam escapes instead.
 
Following GERTY's advice, the younger Sam reboots GERTY to wipe its records of the events. Before leaving, the younger clone reprograms a harvester to crash and wreck the jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth. The older Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the transport carrying the younger Sam to Earth. The rescue team is successfully fooled after finding both a newly awakened clone in the medical bay and the corpse of the older Sam inside the crashed rover.

The helium transport arrives at Earth, and over the film's credits, news reports describe how Sam's testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, and the company's [[business ethics|unethical practices]] have plummeted the company's stock.

This is the first feature film directed by [[television commercial|commercial]] director Duncan Jones, who co-wrote the script with Nathan Parker.&lt;ref name="lands"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Tatiana|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985128.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1| title=Sony lands 'Moon' rights|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=5 May 2008|accessdate=27 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was specifically written as a vehicle for actor Sam Rockwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawtrey|first=Adam| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998560.html?categoryid=19&amp;cs=1|title=U.K. co-productions storm Sundance|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rockwell almost turned the film down and [[Paddy Considine]] was an alternate choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Duncan|date=20 December 2012|title=Duncan Jones on Moon|url=https://twitter.com/manmademoon/status/285518301742899201|website=Twitter|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film pays homage to the films of Jones' youth, such as ''[[Silent Running]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]''.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite news|title=News Etc.|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=February 2009|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired.com]]'', speaking about those films, Jones stated it was his "intent to write for a science fiction-literate audience" and that he "wanted to make a film which would be appreciated by people like myself who loved those films".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Moon Is Duncan Jones' Homage to Classic Sci-Fi |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/06/duncan-jones-moon/ |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired.com]]'' |location=San Francisco |date=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones described his interest in the lunar setting:
{{quote|[We] wanted to create something which felt comfortable within that canon of those science fiction films from the sort of late seventies to early eighties.&lt;ref name="exl"/&gt; for me, the Moon has this weird mythic nature to it.... There is still a mystery to it. As a location, it bridges the gap between [[science fiction]] and [[science]] fact. We (humankind) have been there. It is something so close and so plausible and yet at the same time, we really don't know that much about it.}}

The director described the lack of romance in the Moon as a location, citing images from the Japanese lunar orbiter [[SELENE]]: "It's the desolation and emptiness of it...it looks like some strange ball of clay in blackness.... Look at photos and you'll think that they're monochrome. In fact, they're not. There simply are no primary colours." Jones made reference to the photography book ''Full Moon'' by Michael Light in designing the look of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Macnab|first=Geoffrey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/moon-rising-two-new-lunar-movies-are-taking-viewers-back-into-orbit-969621.html|title=Moon rising: Two new lunar movies are taking viewers back into orbit|work=[[The Independent]]|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=27 December 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===

''Moon'' grossed £700,394 from its domestic release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenrush.co.uk/films/film-136189/box-office/|title=AlloCine - Select your country|author=|date=|website=www.screenrush.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; $3,370,366 from its North American release and $9,760,104 worldwide,&lt;ref name="Mojo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=moon09.htm |title=Moon (2009) |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the film a modest financial success.

===Critical reception===

''Moon'' was generally well-received by critics. Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 90% of critics gave the film a positive review based on 191 reviews, with an average score of 7.5/10. The site's consensus states: "Boosted by Sam Rockwell's intense performance, ''Moon'' is a compelling work of science-fiction, and a promising debut from director Duncan Jones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rottentomatoes.com/m/10009075-moon/|title=Moon (2009) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the film has a score of 67 based on 29 reviews, considered to be "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/moon|title=Moon|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damon Wise of ''[[The Times]]'' praised Jones' "thoughtful" direction and Rockwell's "poignant" performance. Wise wrote of the film's approach to the science fiction genre: "Though it uses impressive sci-fi trappings to tell its story—the fabulous models and moonscapes are recognisably retro yet surprisingly real—this is a film about what it means, and takes, to be human."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Wise | first=Damon | url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/reviews/article1864390.ece | title=Poignant tale of starman waiting in the sky | work=[[The Times]] | date=24 January 2009 | accessdate=24 February 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duane Byrge of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' applauded screenwriter Nathan Parker's "sharp [and] individualistic" dialogue and the way in which Parker combined science fiction and [[Authoritarian personality|Big Brother]] themes. Byrge also believed that cinematographer Gary Shaw's work and composer [[Clint Mansell]]'s music intensified the drama. Byrge wrote: "Nonetheless, 'Moon' is darkened by its own excellencies: The white, claustrophobic look is apt and moody, but a lack of physical action enervates the story thrust." The critic felt mixed about the star's performance, describing him as "adept at limning his character's dissolution" but finding that he did not have "the audacious, dominant edge" for the major confrontation at the end of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Byrge | first=Duane | url=http://www.pastdeadline.com/hr/film-reviews/film-review-moon-1003934260.story | title="Moon" a well-assembled sci-fi thriller | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=26 January 2009 | accessdate=11 June 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616141701/http://www.pastdeadline.com/hr/film-reviews/film-review-moon-1003934260.story | archive-date=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, saying:
{{quote|Moon is a superior example of that threatened genre, [[Hard science fiction|hard science-fiction]], which is often about the interface between humans and alien intelligence of one kind of or other, including digital. [[John W. Campbell Jr.]], the godfather of this genre, would have approved. The movie is really all about ideas. It only seems to be about emotions. How real are our emotions, anyway? How real are we? Someday I will die. This laptop I'm using is patient and can wait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090617/REVIEWS/906179987 |title=Moon |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine praised Rockwell's performance, including it in '10 Egregious Oscar Snubs—The worthy contenders that the Academy overlooked' feature and referred to his performance as "one ... of the best performances of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/oscars2010/snubs/ |title=10 Egregious Oscar Snubs |first=James |last=White | work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked the film at number 23 on their ''Top 40 Sci-Fi Movies of the 21st Century'', finding that "Duncan Jones’ debut feature keeps you wondering whether its hero - played by an on-point Sam Rockwell - is losing a battle with what appears to be his “double” or if he, is, in fact, losing his mind...this sci-fi indie does a helluva lot with very, very little".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Weingarten, Christopher R. |author2=Murray, Noel |author3=Scherer, Jenna |author4=Grierson, Tim |author5=Fear, David |author6=Montgomery, James |author7=Marchese, David |author8=Grow, Kory |author9=Tallerico, Brian |title=The Top 40 Sci-Fi Movies of the 21st Century |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-lists/the-top-40-sci-fi-movies-of-the-21st-century-28134/moon-2009-162495/ |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021145630/https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-lists/the-top-40-sci-fi-movies-of-the-21st-century-28134/moon-2009-162495/ |archivedate=21 October 2018 |date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Digital Spy]]'' said it was an "incredible low-budget science fiction movie", opining that Jones' direction of the film "brilliantly explores ideas of identity while mixing in some practical VFX spectacle to boot. This is perhaps one of the best sci-fi films of the 21st century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simon |first1=Reynolds |title=9 incredible low-budget science fiction movies: Moon, Monsters, Primer |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/feature/a644623/9-incredible-low-budget-science-fiction-movies-moon-monsters-primer/ |publisher=''[[Digital Spy]]'' |date=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]], chief film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Jones directing "demonstrates impressive technical command, infusing a sparse narrative and a small, enclosed space with a surprising density of moods and ideas". Scott said that like most of science fiction, the film "is a meditation on the conflict between the streamlining tendencies of technological progress and the stubborn persistence of feelings and desires that can’t be tamed by utilitarian imperatives", while also asserting that "the film’s ideas are interesting, but don’t feel entirely worked out..the smallness of this movie is decidedly a virtue, but also, in the end, something of a limitation".&lt;ref name="nytscottao"/&gt; ''Moon'' also received positive reviews at the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Flynn | first=Gaynor | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/brits-in-the-thick-of-it-at-sundance-1514545.html | title=Brits in the thick of it at Sundance | work=[[The Independent]] | date=24 January 2009 | accessdate=24 February 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Reception from the scientific community===

''Moon'' was screened as part of a lecture series at [[NASA]]'s [[Space Center Houston]], at the request of a professor there. “He'd been reading online that we'd done this film about [[helium-3]] mining and that's something that people at NASA are working on”, says Jones. “We did a Q&amp;A afterward. They asked me why the base looked so sturdy, like a bunker, and not like the kind of stuff they are designing that they are going to transport with them. I said 'Well, in the future I assume you won't want to continue carrying everything with you, you'll want to use the resources on the moon to build things' and a woman in the audience raised her hand and said, 'I'm actually working on something called [[Lunarcrete|mooncrete]], which is concrete that mixes [[lunar soil|lunar regolith]] and ice water from the moon's polar caps.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="PMInterview" /&gt;

In the 2013 October issue of the journal ''[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]]'', academics ranked their top brain science movies of all time; their database being compiled by [[Cognitive science|cognitive science]] researchers who are also movie buffs. The database, called the Cognitive Science Movie Index, ranks films for quality, relevance and accuracy in the field of cognitive science. On their top 10 lists of brain science movies of all time, ''Moon'' appears at number 5 on the quality list, number 9 on the accuracy list and number 3 on the relevance list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Rettner, Rachael |title=Top Brain Science Movies Revealed |url=https://www.livescience.com/40080-brain-science-movie-rankings.html |publisher=''[[Live Science]]'' |date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==

Jones released a follow-up film, titled ''[[Mute (2018 film)|Mute]]'', in 2018, which serves as a spiritual successor to ''Moon''. "Sam has agreed to do a little [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in the next film", said Jones, who ultimately hopes to complete a [[trilogy]] of films set in the same [[fictional universe]]. It was released on February 23, 2018, as a [[Netflix]] exclusive. In the film, on a TV broadcast of a court trial, Sam Bell and several of his clones are all seen in the courtroom, identifying themselves in an [[Spartacus (film)#"I'm_Spartacus!"|"I'm Spartacus"]] allusion.&lt;ref name=PMInterview&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a4154/4313243/|title=Questions for Duncan Jones| publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date=30 September 2009|accessdate=30 September 2009|first=Erin|last=McCarthy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2009/12/11/sam_rockwell_will_have_a_cameo_in_moon_s_quasi_sequel/ |title=Sam Rockwell Will Have A Cameo In Moon’s Quasi-Sequel|work=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]] |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naganeupseong'''(樂安邑城, 낙안읍성) is a Korean fortress in Nagan-myeon, [[Suncheon, South Korea|Suncheon]], [[Jeollanamdo]], [[South Korea]].
[[File:Nagan castle.jpg|thumbnail]]
Naganeupseong is the only remaining [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty castle in [[Jeollanamdo]].
It finely has the old images of [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] folk village and castle, with about 100 houses and government offices. Nowadays, there still are 85 households and 229 people living there.
It has the biggest feature that it was built on the plain fields and has the narrow stone walls around the castle.

==History==
It was firstly built in 1397 [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]] [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]], by the general Kim Bin-gil after the defeat of [[Wokou]] to protect its area.
It was surrounded by a sand wall but changed to a stone wall during king [[Sejong]], [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty because of its difficulty to protect its area against the Japanese invaders [[Wokou]].

'''Nanguan''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|南管}}|p=Nánguǎn|poj=Lâm-kóan|l=southern pipes}}; also '''''nanyin''''', '''''nanyue''''', or '''''nanqu''''') is a style of [[Chinese classical music]] originating in the southern Chinese province of [[Fujian]], and is also now highly popular in [[Taiwan]], particularly [[Lukang, Changhua|Lukang]] on west coast, as well as among [[Overseas Chinese]] in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wang | first=Ying-Fen | title=Amateur Music Clubs and State Intervention: The Case of ''Nanguan'' Music in Postwar Taiwan | url=http://ntur.lib.ntu.edu.tw/bitstream/246246/65128/1/141.pdf |date=September 2003 | issue=141 | work=Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore | accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fujian is a mountainous coastal [[province of China]]. Its provincial capital is [[Fuzhou]], while [[Quanzhou]] was a major port in the 7th century CE, the period between the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] eras. Situated upon an important maritime trade route, it was a conduit for elements of distant cultures. The result was what is now known as '''nanguan''' music, which today preserves many archaic features. 

It is a genre strongly associated with male-only community amateur musical associations ([[quguan]] or "song-clubs"), each formerly generally linked to a particular temple, and is viewed as a polite accomplishment and a worthy social service, distinct from the world of professional entertainers.&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt; It is typically slow, gentle, delicate and melodic, heterophonic and employing four basic scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Xinxin | last=Wang | url=http://www.gim.ntu.edu.tw/class_nm_e.htm | title= Nanguan Music: Appreciation and Practice (course description) | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119022902/http://www.gim.ntu.edu.tw/class_nm_e.htm | archivedate=January 19, 2010 | publisher=Graduate Institute of Musicology, [[National Taiwan University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanguan was inscribed in 2009 on the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/nanyin-00199 |title=Nanyin |work=UNESCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Styles and instruments==
Nanguan repertory falls into three overlapping styles, called ''chí'', ''phó·'' and ''khiok'' (''zhi'', ''pu'' and ''qu'' in Mandarin), differentiated by the contexts in which they occur, by their function, the value accorded them by musicians and by their formal and timbral natures. 

*The '''Chí''' (指) is perceived as the most "serious" repertoire: it is a purely instrumental suite normally more than thirty minutes in length, of two to five sections usually, each section being known as a ''cu'' or ''dei'' ("piece"). Each is associated with a lyric that alludes to a story but, although this may denote origins in song or opera, today chí is an important and respected instrumental repertory. However, the song text significantly eases the memorising of the piece.
*'''Phó·''' (譜) literally means "notation" - these are pieces that have no associated texts and thus must be written down in [[gongchepu]] notation. It is an instrumental style that uses a wider range than chí and that emphasises technical display.&lt;ref name="chou"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/music/staff/cchiener/nanguan.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312070339/http://www.shef.ac.uk/music/staff/cchiener/nanguan.html | last=Chou | first=Chenier | title=Nanguan Music | publisher=University of Sheffield | archivedate=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Khiok''' (曲) is a vocal repertory: two thousand pieces exist in manuscript. It is lighter and less conservative in repertory and performance than chí. Most popular pieces today are in a fast common metre and last around five minutes. 

A nanguan ensemble usually consists of five instruments. The ''pie'' (''muban'' (木板) or wooden clapper) is usually played by the singer. The other four, known as the ''téng-sì-kóan'' or four higher instruments, are the four-stringed lute (''gî-pê'', or ''[[pipa]]'' in Mandarin), a three-stringed, fretless, snakeskin-headed long-necked lute that is the ancestor of the Japanese ''[[shamisen]]'', called the ''sam-hiân'', (''[[sanxian]]'' in Mandarin), the vertical flute, ([[Xiao (flute)|''siau'']] (簫), also called ''tōng-siau''), and a two-stringed "hard-bowed" instrument called the ''jī-hiân'', slightly differing from the Cantonese ''[[erxian]]''. Each of the four differs somewhat from the most usual modern form and so may be called the "nanguan pipa" etc. Each instrument has a fixed role. The gî-pê provides a steady rhythmic skeleton, supported by the sam-hiân. The siau, meanwhile, supplemented by the jī-hiân, puts "meat on the bones" with colourful counterpoints.&lt;ref name="chou"/&gt;

These instruments are essential to the genre, while the ''ē-sì-kóan'' or four lower instruments are not used in every piece. These are percussion instruments, the chime (''hiangzua''), a combined chime and wood block called the ''giaolo'', a pair of small bells (''xiangjin'') and a four-bar xylophone, the ''xidei''. The transverse flute called the ''pin xiao'' ([[Dizi (musical instrument)|dizi]] in Mandarin) and the oboe-like ''aiya'' or ''xiao [[suona]]'' are sometimes added in outdoor or ceremonial performances. When all six combine with the basic four, the whole ensemble is called a ''cha̍p-im''  or "ten sounds".&lt;ref name="chou"/&gt;

==Diaspora==
Starting in the 17th century, the [[Hoklo people]] who immigrated from [[Fujian]] to Taiwan took with them informal [[folk music]] as well as more ritualized instrumental and [[opera]]tic forms taught in amateur clubs, such as [[beiguan music|beiguan]] and ''nanguan''. Large Hoklo diaspora can also be found in Malaysia, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore, Burma, Thailand and Indonesia, where they are usually referred to as ''Hokkien''. 

There are two ''nanguan'' associations in [[Singapore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://soch.wordpress.com/2006/05/ | title=Nan Yin — A Historical Perspective | last=Koh | first=Sze Wei | work=Save Our Chinese Heritage | date=May 30, 2006 | accessdate=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were formerly several in the Philippines; ''Tiong-Ho Long-Kun-sia'' is still active. [[Gang-a-tsui]] and [[Han-Tang Yuefu]] have popularized the ''nanguan'' ensemble abroad.  A Quanzhou nanguan music ensemble was founded in the early 1960s, and there is a Fuzhou folk music ensemble, founded in 1990.

The '''National Origins Formula''' was an American system of [[immigration to the United States|immigration]] quotas, used between 1921 and 1965, which restricted immigration on the basis of existing proportions of the population. It aimed to reduce the overall number of unskilled immigrants (especially from [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Asia]]), to allow families to re-unite, and to prevent immigration from changing the ethnic distribution of the largely [[Protestant]] [[Northwestern Europe]]an-descended United States population.

== History ==
The 1921 [[Emergency Quota Act]] restricted immigration to 3% of foreign-born persons of each nationality that resided in the United States in 1910.

The [[Immigration Act of 1924]], also called the National Origins Act, provided that for three years the formula would change from 3% to 2% and the basis for the calculation would be the census of 1890 instead of that of 1910. After June 30, 1927, total immigration from all countries will be limited to 150,000, with allocations by country based upon national origins of inhabitants according to the census of 1920. The quota system applied only to non-Asian immigrants. It aimed to reduce the overall number of unskilled immigrants, to allow families to re-unite, and to prevent immigration from changing the ethnic distribution of the population. The 1924 Act also included the [[Asian Exclusion Act]], which limited immigration to persons eligible for naturalization. 
As a result, East Asians and South Asians were effectively banned from immigrating. Africans were also subjected to severe restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5078/ Who Was Shut Out?]&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration from North and South America was not restricted.

The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] retained but relaxed the National Origins Formula (President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] wanted to abolish it, but Congress overrode his veto). It modified the ratios to be based on the 1920 census and eliminated racial restrictions, but retained restrictions by national origin. President [[Harry Truman]] vetoed it because of its continued use of national quotas, but the  Act was passed over his veto. The quotas were in addition to 600,000 refugees admitted from Europe after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Reimers, ''Unwelcome Strangers'' (1998), 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Origins Formula was abolished by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]], which marked a significant change in American immigration policy. It replaced the system with two quotas for the Western and Eastern hemispheres.

The '''Person Dignity Theory''' ({{lang-vi|Thuyết Nhân vị}}) was a [[Vietnam]]ese [[political doctrine]] and [[ideology]] coined by [[Ngô Đình Nhu]] in 1954, based on [[Emmanuel Mounier]]'s works.&lt;ref&gt;{{book cite|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=qh5lffww-KsC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=can+lao+party+ideology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jCDXH2uwWr&amp;sig=3mlVbTbuocYLq3-Le8h_kl9RPYo&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mQ6TVazKKcnyUPKLitgL&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=can%20lao%20party%20ideology&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War|author=Spencer C. Tucker|publisher=Paperback|date=November 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the official ideology of the [[Can Lao Party]], a former [[political party]].

==Doctrine==
The [[Can Lao Party]]'s leader [[Ngô Đình Nhu]] created this ideology to oppose the advance of the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]]. The Person Dignity Theory was conceived like a "[[third way]]" between [[capitalism]] and [[communism]], both of which it refuted for their strictly [[materialist]] views, with the establishment of a [[social market economy]]. Both capitalism and communism assume that people are only [[Production (economics)|production]] instruments, while the Person Dignity Theory promote a [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritual]] like physical person, with consequential change of the [[supply and demand]] based not on the singular but on the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{book cite|language=Vietnamese|title=Ký ức Huỳnh Văn Lang|author=Huỳnh Văn Lang|publisher=Hoa Kỳ|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Personal Dignity is based on "Three Theories":
*[[Personalism]] (one leader's rule)
*[[Community]] (the community's good)
*[[Supernatural]] (not materialist but spiritualism)

For the creation of a good community, it's necessary the individual's will. The ideal community, as the Person Dignity Theory, is based on [[family]], [[society]], [[nation]], [[humanity (virtue)|humanity]] and [[nature]]. The supernatural strengthen the community for obtained "true, compassion, unity".
For obtained the "Three Theories" are necessary a [[party]] (the Can Lao) for the ideology's promotion, a true [[social justice]] and the technological [[modernization]].

==International link==
The Person Dignity Theory had also various points of reference, like [[Juan Perón]] of [[Argentina]], [[Carlos Castillo Armas]] of [[Guatemala]], [[Sukarno]] of [[Indonesia]], [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] of [[Portugal]], [[Francisco Franco]] of [[Spain]] and [[Norodom Sihanouk]] of [[Cambodia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3441">In the field of [[artificial intelligence]], '''Semantic role labeling''', sometimes also called shallow semantic parsing, is a process in [[natural language processing]] that assigns labels to words or phrases in a sentence that indicate their semantic role in the sentence, such as that of an agent, goal, or result.&lt;ref name="Jurafsky2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jurafsky|first1=Daniel|last2=Martin|first2=James H.|title=Chapter 22 -Semantic Role Labeling|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/22.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the detection of the semantic arguments associated with the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] or [[verb]] of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] and their classification into their specific [[Thematic relation|roles]]. For example, given a sentence like "Mary sold the book to John", the task would be to recognize the verb "to sell" as representing the predicate, "Mary" as representing the seller (agent), "the book" as representing the goods (theme), and "John" as representing the recipient. This is an important step towards making sense of the meaning of a sentence. A semantic analysis of this sort is at a '''lower-level of abstraction''' than a [[Concrete syntax tree|syntax tree]], i.e. it has more categories, thus groups fewer clauses in each category. For instance, "the book belongs to me" would need two labels such as "possessed" and "possessor" whereas "the book was sold to John" would need two other labels such as "goal" (or "theme") and "receiver" (or "recipient") even though these two clauses would be very similar as far as "subject" and "object" functions are concerned.

==History==

The [[FrameNet]] project produced the first major computational lexicon that systematically described many predicates and their corresponding roles. Daniel Gildea ([[University of California, Berkeley]] / [[International Computer Science Institute]]) and [[Daniel Jurafsky]] (currently teaching at [[Stanford University]], but previously working at [[University of Colorado]] and [[UC Berkeley]]) developed the first automatic semantic role labeling system based on FrameNet. The [[PropBank]] corpus added manually created semantic role annotations to the [[Penn TreeBank]] corpus of [[Wall Street Journal]] texts. Many automatic semantic role labeling systems have used PropBank as a training dataset to learn how to annotate new sentences automatically.

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}

In its original sense, a '''shaggy dog story''' or '''yarn''' is an extremely long-winded [[anecdote]] characterized by extensive narration of typically [[Non sequitur (literary device)|irrelevant incidents]] and terminated by an [[Anti-climax (narrative)|anticlimax]] or a pointless punchline.

Shaggy dog stories play upon the audience's preconceptions of joke-telling. The audience listens to the story with certain expectations, which are either simply not met or met in some entirely unexpected manner.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book|title=Jokes|page=8|author=Ted Cohen|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-11230-6|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthy shaggy dog story derives its humour from the fact that the joke-teller held the attention of the listeners for a long time (such jokes can take five minutes or more to tell) for no reason at all, as the end resolution is essentially meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to be funny : an extremely silly guidebook|year=1978|author=Jovial Bob Stine|publisher= Dutton |isbn=0-525-32410-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of their delivery is reflected in the [[English language|English]] [[idiom]] ''[[wiktionary:spin a yarn|spin a yarn]]'', by way of [[analogy]] with the production of [[yarn]].

==Archetypal story==

The commonly believed [[archetype]] of the shaggy dog story is a story that concerns a [[wikt:shaggy|shaggy]] dog.  The story builds up, repeatedly emphasizing how shaggy the dog is. At the climax of the story, someone in the story reacts with, "That dog's not so shaggy." The expectations of the audience that have been built up by the presentation of the story, that the story will end with a punchline, are thus disappointed. Ted Cohen gives the following example of this story:&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

{{quote|A boy owned a dog that was uncommonly shaggy. Many people remarked upon its considerable shagginess.  When the boy learned that there are contests for shaggy dogs, he entered his dog. The dog won first prize for shagginess in both the local and the regional competitions.  The boy entered the dog in ever-larger contests, until finally he entered it in the world championship for shaggy dogs. When the judges had inspected all of the competing dogs, they remarked about the boy's dog: "He's not that shaggy."}}

However, authorities disagree as to whether this particular story is the archetype after which the category is named.  [[Eric Partridge]], for example, provides a very different story, as do William and Mary Morris in ''The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''.

According to Partridge and the Morrises, the archetypical shaggy dog story involves an advertisement placed in the ''Times'' announcing a search for a shaggy dog. In the Partridge story, an aristocratic family living in [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] is searching for a lost dog, and an American answers the advertisement with a shaggy dog that he has found and personally brought across the Atlantic, only to be received by the butler at the end of the story who takes one look at the dog and shuts the door in his face, saying, "But not so shaggy as ''that'', sir!" In the Morris story, the advertiser is organizing a competition to find the shaggiest dog in the world, and after a lengthy exposition of the search for such a dog, a winner is presented to the aristocratic instigator of the competition, who says, "I don't think he's so shaggy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secret of Humor|author=Leonard Feinberg|year=1978|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-6203-370-9|pages=181&amp;ndash;182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaggy Dog Story|work=World Wide Words|author=Michael Quinion|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-sha1.htm|date=19 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
===Mark Twain and the story of grandfather's old ram===
A typical shaggy dog story occurs in [[Mark Twain]]'s book about his travels west, ''[[Roughing It]]''. Twain's friends encourage him to go find a man called Jim Blaine when he is properly drunk, and ask him to tell "the stirring story about his grandfather's old ram."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/marktwain/learnmore/writings_story.html |title=The Story of Grandfather's Old Ram |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=26 September 2013 |author=Twain, Mark |author-link=Samuel Clemons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twain, encouraged by his friends who have already heard the story, finally finds Blaine, an old silver miner, who sets out to tell Twain and his friends the tale. Blaine starts out with the ram ("There never was a bullier old ram than what he was"), and goes on for four more mostly dull but occasionally hilarious unparagraphed pages.

Along the way, Blaine tells many stories, each of which connects back to the one before by some tenuous thread, and none of which has to do with the old ram. Among these stories are: a tale of boiled missionaries; of a lady who borrows a false eye, a peg leg, and the wig of a coffin-salesman's wife; and a final tale of a man who gets caught in machinery at a carpet factory and whose "widder bought the piece of carpet that had his remains wove in&amp;nbsp;..." As Blaine tells the story of the carpet man's funeral, he begins to fall asleep, and Twain, looking around, sees his friends "suffocating with suppressed laughter." They now inform him that "at a certain stage of intoxication, no human power could keep [Blaine] from setting out, with impressive unction, to tell about a wonderful adventure which he had once had with his grandfather's old ram — and the mention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had heard him get, concerning it."

===Isaac Asimov and the story of the Shah Guido G. ===
In the collection of stories by [[Isaac Asimov]] titled ''[[Buy Jupiter and Other Stories]]'', is a story titled "[[Shah Guido G.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Asimov, Isaac |author-link=Isaac Asimov |title=Buy Jupiter and other stories'', |publisher=Fawcett Crest |location=New York, NY |year=1975 |pages=33–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his background notes, Asimov identifies the tale as a shaggy dog story, and explains that the title is a play on "shaggy dog".

==Examples in music==
* [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s classic anti-war story-song "[[Alice's Restaurant Massacree]]" is a shaggy dog story about the military draft, hippies, and improper disposal of garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Berman |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/booth-reviews/2010/11/song-of-the-day-alices-restaurant-massacree-by-arlo-guthrie/ |title=Song Of The Day – "Alice’s Restaurant Massacree" by Arlo Guthrie &amp;#124; Booth Reviews |publisher=Chicagonow.com |date= |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Bromberg]]'s version of "Bullfrog Blues" (on "[[How Late'll Ya Play 'Til?]]") is a rambling shaggy dog story performed as a [[talking blues]] song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Foss |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/how-latell-ya-play-til-vol-1-live-mw0000200090 |title=How Late'll Ya Play 'Til?, Vol. 1: Live - David Bromberg &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=stevenhartwriter |url=https://stevenhartsite.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/blue-monday-26/ |title=Blue Monday &amp;#124; STEVENHARTSITE |publisher=Stevenhartsite.wordpress.com |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s "[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]," the final track on his 1999 album ''[[Running with Scissors ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Running with Scissors]]'', is an over-eleven-minute digression from one of the first topics mentioned in the song, the narrator-protagonist's longstanding dislike of [[sauerkraut]].

"'''Suicides'''" is a [[short story]] by French writer [[Guy de Maupassant]]. It was originally published on 29 August 1880 in the French newspaper ''[[Le Gaulois]]''. On 17 April 1883, it was published in ''[[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]'' under the pseudonym Maufrigneuse, and by other three periodicals, before being republished in the short story collection ''[[Les Sœurs Rondoli]]'' in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;''Maupassant, contes et nouvelles'', p. 1331, [[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The narrator finds a letter from a man who killed himself officially «without reason». This man of fifty-seven describes his life: thirty years of boredom, always repeated gestures and loneliness. Suffering from stomach pain, he can not eat much «what is still the greatest happiness». That evening he starts a task constantly postponed, to store in his desk correspondence and memories of a lifetime. Moved to tears by all these old stories which come to mind, he looks horrified «the hideous and lonely old age and the coming infirmities». He shoots himself in the head.
== Theme==
The theme of this story is that suicide can be caused by minor causes like solitude and boredom.

Published in 1995 by [[Faber and Faber]], the novel was adapted for the stage in 2009 and explores Muslim [[fundamentalism]], youth culture, sex, drugs, and alienation in a young British-Pakistani man’s world that is being pulled in different directions by a modern lifestyle of London and traditional [[Muslim]] culture.

Kureishi, a British-Pakistani novelist, playwright, screenwriter, and filmmaker, premiered the adaptation at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in July 2009 and was awarded the second [[Asia House]] Literature Award on the closing night of [[Asia House Festival of Asian Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Anita M.|title=Power and Civil Society In Pakistan|date=September 20, 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character List ==

* '''Shahid''' (''Protagonist)'': The son of Pakistani immigrants, a British-Pakistani student from Kent, UK, whose father has recently died. Shahid moves to London for college, seeking to find a sense of independence in identity.
* '''Chili''' : Shahid’s older brother
* '''Deedee''' : Shahid's lecturer professor/lover/mentor
* '''Riaz''' : Shahid's friend, and means of introduction into radical [[Islam]]

== Critical reception ==
Although only having been staged recently, the reception to ''The Black Album'' has been neutral when compared to the Kureishi's novel. Many felt that the stage adaptation left out many of the details that made the novel memorable and powerful, instead feeling that the adaptation lost many of the details that readers felt were so elegantly explained in the novel.

"But the stage version does scant justice to the book's panoramic portrait of late-1980s London with its pubs, clubs and ecstasy-filled raves. In a nutshell, one misses the heady exuberance of Kureishi's descriptive writing." -''The Guardian''{{full citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The reception to the timing of the adaptation of the novel was positive as it came in the post-9/11 era of the world view. Kureishi had thought, back in the Nineties, of turning his novel into a film but it never happened. But a decade and a half on, in the wake of 9/11, 7/7 and the "war on terror", the relevance of the story became even greater. In an interview with production team, it was asked: "Was it easy ... transforming the tale from page to stage? "The novel had a kaleidoscopic view of London," he says, "moving quickly from episode to episode. The play maintains that episodic sense. Hanif has retained a lot of the language of the original. The novel is full of deft wit. The play is too. It moves between the real and the absurd. Hanif calls it 'hyper-real'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Album: A Work In Progress|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/the-black-album-a-work-in-progress-1754288.html|website=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sign of the Four''''' (1890), also called '''''The Sign of Four''''', is the second [[novel]] featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]] written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Doyle wrote four novels and 56 short stories featuring the fictional detective.

==Plot==
The story is set in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Conan Doyle, A. ''The Sign of the Four'', "Chapter 2: The Statement of the Case", in which characters state: "He disappeared upon the 3d of December, 1878,—nearly ten years ago." &amp; "About six years ago—to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882"&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sign of the Four'' has a complex plot involving service in India, the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], a stolen [[treasure]], and a secret pact among four [[convict]]s ("the Four" of the title) and two corrupt prison guards. It presents the detective's [[Substance dependence|drug habit]] and humanizes him in a way that had not been done in the preceding novel, ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' (1887). It also introduces [[Dr. Watson|Doctor Watson]]'s future wife, [[Minor Sherlock Holmes characters#Mary Morstan (later Watson)|Mary Morstan]].

According to Mary, in December 1878, her father had telegraphed her upon his safe return from India and requested her to meet him at the [[Langham Hotel]] in London. When Mary arrived at the hotel, she was told her father had gone out the previous night and not returned. Despite all efforts, no trace has ever been found of him. Mary contacted her father's only friend who was in the same regiment and had since retired to England, one Major John Sholto, but he denied knowing her father had returned. The second puzzle is that she has received six pearls in the mail from an anonymous benefactor, one per year since 1882 after answering an anonymous newspaper query inquiring for her. With the last pearl she received a letter remarking that she has been wronged and asking for a meeting. Holmes takes the case and soon discovers that Major Sholto had died in 1882 and that within a short span of time Mary began to receive the pearls, implying a connection. The only clue Mary can give Holmes is a map of a fortress found in her father's desk with the names of Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan and Dost Akbar.

Holmes, Watson, and Mary meet Thaddeus Sholto, the son of the late Major Sholto and the anonymous sender of the pearls. Thaddeus confirms the Major ''had'' seen Mary's father the night he died; they had arranged a meeting to divide a priceless treasure Sholto had brought home from India. While quarrelling over the treasure, Captain Morstan&amp;mdash;long in weak health&amp;mdash;suffered a heart attack. Not wanting to bring attention to the object of the quarrel&amp;mdash;and also worried that circumstances would suggest that he had killed Morstan in an argument, particularly since Morstan's head struck a table as he fell&amp;mdash;Sholto disposed of the body and hid the treasure. However, he himself suffered from poor health and an enlarged spleen (possibly due to [[malaria]], as a [[quinine]] bottle stands by his bed). His own health became worse when he received a letter from India in early 1882. Dying, he called his two sons and confessed to Morstan's death and was about to divulge the location of the treasure when he suddenly cried, "Keep him out!" before falling back and dying. The puzzled sons glimpsed a face in the window, but the only trace was a single footstep in the dirt. On their father's body is a note reading "The Sign of Four". Both brothers quarrelled over whether a legacy should be left to Mary Morstan, and Thaddeus left his brother Bartholomew, taking a [[wikt:chaplet|chaplet]] and sending its pearls to Mary. The reason he sent the letter is that Bartholomew has found the treasure and possibly Thaddeus and Mary might confront him for a division of it.

Bartholomew is found dead in his home from a poison dart and the treasure is missing. While the police wrongly take Thaddeus in as a suspect, Holmes deduces that there are two persons involved in the murder: a one-legged man, Jonathan Small, as well as another "small" accomplice. He traces them to a boat landing where Small has hired a steam [[Launch (boat)|launch]] named the ''[[Aurora]]''. With the help of dog [[Minor Sherlock Holmes characters#Toby|Toby]] that he sends Watson to collect from Mr Sherman, the [[Baker Street Irregulars]] and his own disguise, Holmes traces the steam launch. In a police steam launch Holmes and Watson chase the ''Aurora'' and capture it, but in the process end up killing the "small" companion after he attempts to kill Holmes with a [[poisoned dart]] shot from a [[Blowgun|blow-pipe]]. Small tries to escape but is captured. However, the iron treasure box is empty; Small claims to have dumped the treasure over the side during the chase.

Small confesses that years before he was a soldier of the Third [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]] in India and lost his right leg in a swimming accident to a [[crocodile]]. After some time, when he was an overseer on a [[tea plantation]], the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] occurred and he was forced to flee for his life to the [[Agra Fort|Agra fortress]]. While standing guard one night he was overpowered by two Sikh troopers who gave him a choice of being killed or being an accomplice to [[waylaying]] a disguised servant of a [[Rajah]] who sent the servant with a valuable fortune in pearls and jewels to the British for safekeeping. The robbery and murder took place and the crime was discovered, although the jewels were not. Small got penal servitude on the [[Andaman Islands]], and after twenty years he overheard that John Sholto had lost money gambling. Small saw his chance and made a deal with Sholto and Arthur Morstan: Sholto would recover the treasure and in return send a boat to pick up Small and the Sikhs. Sholto double-crossed both Morstan and Small and stole the treasure for himself. Small vowed vengeance and escaped the Andaman Islands with an [[Andamanese people|islander]] named Tonga. It was the news of his escape that shocked Sholto into his fatal illness. Small arrived too late to hear of the treasure's location but left the note which referred to the name of the pact between himself and his three Sikh accomplices. When Bartholomew found the treasure, Small planned to only steal it but claims a miscommunication led Tonga to kill Bartholomew as well.

Mary Morstan is left without the bulk of the Agra treasure, although she will apparently receive the rest of the chaplet. John Watson falls in love with Mary, and it is revealed at the end that he proposed to her and she has accepted.

==Publication history ==
[[File:The Sign of Four cover 1892.jpg|thumb|The 1892 cloth-bound cover of ''The Sign of Four'' after it was compiled as a single book]]
[[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] described how he was commissioned to write the story over a dinner with Joseph M. Stoddart, managing editor of an American publication ''[[Lippincott's Monthly Magazine]]'', at the [[Langham Hotel, London|Langham Hotel]] in London on 30 August 1889. Stoddart wanted to produce an English version of ''Lippincott’s'' with a British editor and British contributors. The dinner was also attended by [[Oscar Wilde]], who eventually contributed ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' to the July 1890 issue. Doyle discussed what he called this "golden evening" in his 1924 autobiography ''Memories and Adventures''.

The novel first appeared in the February 1890 edition of ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'' as ''The Sign of the Four; or The Problem of the Sholtos'' (five-word title), appearing in both London and [[Philadelphia]]. The British edition of the magazine originally sold for a [[shilling]], and the American for 25 cents. Surviving copies are now worth several thousand dollars.

Over the following few months in the same year, the novel was then republished in several regional British journals. These re-serialisations gave the title as ''The Sign of Four''. The novel was published in book form in October 1890 by [[Spencer Blackett]], again using the title ''The Sign of Four''. This edition was illustrated by [[Charles H. M. Kerr]]. The title of both the British and American editions of this first book edition omitted the second "the" of the original title.

Different editions over the years have varied between the two forms of the title, with most editions favouring the four-word form. The actual text in the novel nearly always uses "the Sign of the Four" (the five-word form) to describe the symbol in the story, although the four-word form is used twice by Jonathan Small in his narrative at the end of the story.

As with the first story, ''A Study in Scarlet'', produced two years previously, ''The Sign of the Four'' was not particularly successful to start with. It was the short stories, published from 1891 onwards in ''[[Strand Magazine]]'', that made household names of Sherlock Holmes and his creator.

'''''What's Up, Tiger Lily?''''' is a 1966 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Woody Allen]] in his feature-length directorial debut.

Allen took a Japanese spy film, ''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi|International Secret Police: Key of Keys]]'', and overdubbed it with completely original dialogue that had nothing to do with the plot of the original film.&lt;ref name="dvdtalk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavis |first=Paul |title=What's Up, Tiger Lily? |publisher=''DVD Talk'' |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/37849/whats-up-tiger-lily/ |accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By putting in new scenes and rearranging the order of existing scenes, he completely changed the tone of the film from a [[James Bond]] clone into a comedy about the search for the world's best [[egg salad]] recipe.&lt;ref name="isptsreggsalad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyostreetreport.com/events/2009/04/international-secret-police/ |title=International Secret Police |publisher=''Tokyo Street Report'' |date=April 16, 2009|accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During post-production, Allen's original one-hour television version was expanded without his permission to include additional scenes from ''International Secret Police: A Barrel of Gunpowder'', the third film in the International Secret Police series,&lt;ref name="dvdtalk"/&gt; and musical numbers by the band [[The Lovin' Spoonful]]. This experience helped convince Allen that he should secure creative control for all his future projects.&lt;ref name="utopia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Woody Allen |publisher=''Screenwriter's Utopia'' |url=http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=2725 |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band released a [[What's Up, Tiger Lily? (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]]. [[Louise Lasser]], who was married to Allen at the time, served as one of the voice actors for the "new" dialogue soundtrack, as did [[Mickey Rose]], Allen's writing partner on ''[[Take The Money and Run]]'' (1969) and ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971).&lt;ref name="isptsreggsalad"/&gt; In 2003, Image released the film on DVD, with both the theatrical and television soundtracks. The DVD also offers the 11 minutes of TV footage as a separate bonus. 

==Plot==
The plot provides the setup for a string of [[sight gag]]s, [[pun]]s, jokes based on Asian [[stereotypes]], and general [[farce]]. The central plot involves the misadventures of secret agent Phil Moskowitz, hired by the Grand Exalted High Majah of Raspur ("a nonexistent but real-sounding country") to find a secret [[egg salad]] recipe that was stolen from him.

The movie has an ending unrelated to the plot, in which [[China Lee]], a [[Playboy Playmate|''Playboy'' Playmate]] and then-wife of Allen's comic idol [[Mort Sahl]], who does not appear elsewhere in the film, does a striptease while Allen explains that he promised he would put her in the film somewhere.

==Reception==
The reviews were mixed upon the film's release. Expressing disappointment in the movie, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that "the peppery English sound track wears thin as the action churns around in absolute chaos."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E01E2DC173EE63BBC4052DFB767838D679EDE "Screen: Woody-Allenized:'Tiger Lily,' Innovation of Sorts, Is Here The Cast," ''The New York Times'', Friday, November 18, 1966.] Retrieved January 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "The production has one premise - deliberately mismatched dialog - which is sustained reasonably well through its brief running time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1965/film/reviews/what-s-up-tiger-lily-1200420923/ |title=What's Up, Tiger Lily? |magazine=Variety |date=December 31, 1965 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women Can Do It''' (WCDI) is a training programme for women originated in the Norwegian Labour Party Women.

The aim of Women Can Do It is to make more women participate in society. The program's ideal is that because women make up half the world's population, they should have half the power and as many formal positions and authority as men. This is not the fact at present. Women are systematically under-represented in decision-making positions around the world, less visible in the media, hold fewer parliamentary seats and occupy fewer leading posts in political parties than men.&lt;ref name="Women in National Parliaments"&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm Women in National Parliaments]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Training==
Women Can Do It is a training course for women; it aims at building confidence, learning the rules of political and organisational work and giving courage to the participants to speak out and taking part in decision-making processes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''The quality of the seminars:'' In the seminars gender equality issues are presented in a simple
way, and the skills taught are down-to-earth and practical. An overwhelming percentage of
respondents in the survey as well as among the interviewees are very satisfied with the
seminars. They report that the knowledge and skills gained in the seminars are useful in
everyday life." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norad.no/items/3400/38/0558703167/WCDI_rapp_2_05.pdf NORAD Women Can Do It – an evaluation of the WCDI programme in the Western Balkans p.8]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Arranging WCDI is one way of increasing women's participation. Encouraging women to participate in society, in NGOs, in political parties, speaking up at work or in the family, is important. Women's opinions are important and should be heard. Women often hold back from speaking their mind, worried that they will not be as eloquent as the men, will not be listened to, or they are afraid to be ridiculed or neglected at meetings.&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Every fourth Russian woman suffers from some kind of domestic violence and doesn’t get proper respect and confession in our society."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slw.nko-gis.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=70&amp;Itemid=29 Extract from the presentation of Olga Janishina, Polyarniy]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Women Can Do It is both training for specific organisational skills, but it is also an opportunity for women to meet and form networks. WCDI can be arranged independently of an organization for the general purpose of increasing women's participation in society, or it can be held within a party or organization for increasing the number of women within.

The programme has been conducted in more than 25 countries worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.google.no/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=no&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=106886933811522789212.00045b9170a7a8be30140&amp;z=2 25 countries worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paixbalkans.org/societe_civile.htm Documents de la société civile et Balkans]&lt;/ref&gt; and The Norwegian Labour Party&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arbeiderpartiet.no The Norwegian Labour Part]&lt;/ref&gt; arranges the training with the partnership of Norwegian People's Aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npaid.org/www/English/World/Gender_Equality/Women_Can_Do_It Norwegian People's Aid]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
The Training contents the following topics: Democracy and women’s participation,&lt;ref name="Women in National Parliaments" /&gt; Communication, Argumentation, speeches, debates, 
Working with the media, Negotiations – resolution of conflicts, Networking, Advocacy and campaigning,&lt;ref&gt;[[Political campaign]]&lt;/ref&gt; Violence against women &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npaid.org/www/English/World/Gender_Equality/Violence_against_women Violence against women: How do we fight it?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zemi Figures from Vere, [[Jamaica]]''' (this area is situated in the modern parish of Clarendon)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-land-we-love.com/clarendon-jamaica.html|title=Clarendon Jamaica-The Third Largest Parish|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are an important collection of [[pre-Columbian]] wooden figures found in the Carpenters Mountains in Jamaica in the late 18th century. They were originally made by the [[Taino]] people and may have served as venerated objects that housed local spirits or deities.  They now form part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=13309&amp;plaA=13309-3-2 Zemi figures], British Museum Collection, retrieved 15 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The three figures were found by a surveyor in a cave near the settlement of Vere in the Carpenters Mountains in June 1792. They were exhibited for the first time at the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1799 by Isaac Alves Rebello.&lt;ref name=allsworth&gt;{{cite book|last=Allsworth-Jones|first=P.|title=Pre-Columbian Jamaica|year=2008|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=0817354662|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0817354662|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures' subsequent [[provenance]] after this remains obscure before their acquisition by the British Museum.

==Description==
All three figures are carved from a tropical hardwood called [[guayacan]] (Guaiacum officinale L.). The surface of the sculptures were probably polished with pebbles to bring the resin to the surface and attain the black [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]]. The largest figure (the head of which is illustrated here) represents a male spiritual being, with prominent genitalia and powerful limbs, demonstrating masculine strength and virility. The second figure, at 87&amp;nbsp;cm high slightly smaller than the male [[zemi]], mixes human and animal characteristics. The head can be described as birdlike with a protruding beak and teeth made of inlaid shells, but the body is more human-like with male sexual organs. The third sculpture has an unusually wide face carved below a canopy, which was probably used for the ritual inhalation of a hallucinogenic substance called cahoba.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient American Art In Detail, British Museum Press, p 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Original purpose ==
As the Taino's written record is in the form of [[petroglyphs]] (a type of [[Proto-writing]]) on which very little research has been done,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icoquito.com/discover-puerto-rico/tainos-symbols-and-meanings-in-puerto-rico/&lt;/ref&gt; the purpose and role of these figures is based on records kept by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] during the early colonial period. It appears that the Taino actively sought contact with spiritual beings who were capable of performing many deeds on their behalf. The taking of [[hallucinogenic]] drugs seems to have been an important part of communicating with these deities. The ingredients of the substance called cahoba is thought to have been based on powdered tobacco but other additions including brine and lime have been proposed and hallucogins prepared from ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina]]''.&lt;ref name=winter&gt;{{cite book|last=Winter|first=ed. by Joseph C.|title=Tobacco use by Native North Americans : sacred smoke and silent killer|year=2000|publisher=Univ. of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman|isbn=0806132620|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0806132620}}&lt;/ref&gt;
