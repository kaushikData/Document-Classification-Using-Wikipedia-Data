      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2607">An '''adaptive algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that changes its behavior at the time it is run, based on information available and on ''a priori'' defined reward mechanism (or criterion). Such information could be the story of recently received data, information on the available computational resources, or other run-time acquired (or ''a priori'' known) information related to the environment in which it operates.

Among the most used adaptive algorithms is the [[Least mean squares filter|Widrow-Hoff’s least mean squares (LMS)]], which represents a class of stochastic gradient-descent algorithms used in adaptive filtering and machine learning. In adaptive filtering the LMS is used to mimic a desired filter by finding the filter coefficients that relate to producing the least mean square  of the error signal (difference between the desired and the actual signal).

For example, [[stable partition]], using no additional memory is ''O''(''n'' lg ''n'') but given ''O''(''n'') memory, it can be ''O''(''n'') in time. As implemented by the [[C++ Standard Library]], [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/stable_partition &lt;code&gt;stable_partition&lt;/code&gt;] is adaptive and so it acquires as much memory as it can get (up to what it would need at most) and applies the algorithm using that available memory.  Another example is [[adaptive sort]], whose behavior changes upon the presortedness of its input.

An example of an adaptive algorithm in [[radar]] systems is the [[constant false alarm rate]] (CFAR) detector.

In [[machine learning]] and [[optimization]], many algorithms are adaptive or have adaptive variants, which usually means that the algorithm parameters are automatically adjusted according to statistics about the optimisation thus far (e.g. the rate of convergence). Examples include [[adaptive simulated annealing]], [[adaptive coordinate descent]], [[AdaBoost]], and [[adaptive quadrature]].

In [[data compression]], [[adaptive coding]] algorithms such as [[Adaptive Huffman coding]] or [[Prediction by partial matching]] can take a stream of data as input, and adapt their compression technique based on the symbols that they have already encountered.

In [[signal processing]], the [[Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding]] (ATRAC) codec used in [[MiniDisc]] recorders is called "adaptive" because the window length (the size of an audio "chunk") can change according to the nature of the sound being compressed, to try to achieve the best-sounding compression strategy.

'''UML''' ([[Unified Modeling Language]]) is a modeling language used by [[software developer]]s.&lt;ref name="power of uml"/&gt; [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] can be used to develop diagrams and provide users with ready-to-use, expressive modeling examples.&lt;ref group="note"&gt; UML can be applied in areas like [[embedded system]]s, [[web application]]s, [[commercial application]]s etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Some UML tools generate program language code from UML.&lt;ref name = "uml tools generate program language code"/&gt; UML can be used for modeling a system independent of a platform language. UML is a graphical language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting information about software-intensive systems.&lt;ref name="grady booch, jacobson and rumbaugh book"/&gt; UML gives a standard way to write a [[system model]], covering [[Conceptualization (information science)|conceptual idea]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[1412.2458] Systems, Views and Models of UML. By Ruth Breu Radu Grosu Franz Huber Bernhard Rumpe Wolfgang Schwerin. arXiv arxiv.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, models of [[business process]]es and [[Function model|system function]]s, as well as things like [[Class (computer programming)|class]]es written in a programming language, [[database schema]]s, and reusable [[software component]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;  With an understanding of modeling, the use and application of UML can make the [[software development process]] more efficient.

==History==
{{main article|Unified Modeling Language#History}}
UML has applied to various activities since the second half of the 1990s and been used with object-oriented development methods.

==Fields applying UML==
UML has been used in following areas 
{{col-begin}}
{{Col-2}}
*[[Enterprise information systems]]
*[[banking|Banking and financial services]]
*[[Telecommunications]]
*[[Defense industry|Defense]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such as, software engineering in aircraft combat systems&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-break}}
{{Col-2}}
*[[Transportation]] 
*[[Retail]]
*[[Science|Science and Research]]
*[[Web service|Distributed Web-based services]]
{{col-end}}

UML can also be used to model nonsoftware systems, such as [[workflow]] in the legal systems, [[medical electronics]] and [[Health system|patient healthcare system]]s, and the [[hardware design|design of hardware]].&lt;ref name="grady booch, jacobson and rumbaugh book"/&gt;

==Modeling applications of UML using various diagrams==
The following lists of UML diagrams and functionality summaries enable understanding of UML applications in [[Real life|real-world example]]s.

=== Structure diagrams and their applications ===
Structuring diagrams show a view of a system that shows the structure of the objects, including their classifiers, relationships, attributes and operations:
*[[Class diagram]]
*[[Component diagram]]
*[[Composite structure diagram]]
*[[Deployment diagram]]
*[[Object diagram]]
*[[Package diagram]]
*[[Profile diagram]]

===Behaviour diagrams and their applications===
Behaviour diagrams are used to illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems. Some Behaviour diagrams are:

*[[Activity diagram]]
*[[State machine diagram]]
*[[Use Case Diagram]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Use Case Diagrams from UML are useful to understand real time systems&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interaction diagrams and their applications===
Interaction diagrams are subset of behaviour diagrams and emphasize the flow of control and data among the things in the system being modelled:
*[[Communication diagram]] &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Communication diagrams are used for showing communication between objects or parts.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Interaction overview diagram]]
*[[Sequence diagram]] &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sequence diagram are used for communication between objects in terms of sequences.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Timing diagram (Unified Modeling Language)|Timing diagram]] &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Timing diagram are a specific type of interaction diagram where the focus is on timing constraints.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Web applications==
Web applications of UML can be used to model user interfaces of web applications and make the purpose of the website clear.
Web applications are software-intensive systems&lt;ref name="modeling web applications with uml"/&gt; and UML is among the efficient choice of languages for modeling them. Web software complexity of an application can be minimized using various UML tools. 

[[UML-based web engineering]] aims at offering a UML profile that matches the needs of web development better. The following are examples:            
*Representation of web applications using a set of models&lt;ref name="modeling web applications with uml"/&gt; 
**Web app use case model 
**Web app implementation model 
**Web app deployment model 
**Web app security model 
**Web app site map
*To model pages, hyperlinks, and dynamic content on the client and server side.
*For modeling server side aspects of web page with one class and client side aspect with another and distinguishing the two by using UML's extension mechanism to define [[Stereotype (UML)|stereotype]]'s and icons for each server and client page.
*Stereotypes in UML are used to define new semantics for modeling element.
*Forms in HTML can also be modeled using various UML constructs.
*UML can be used to express the execution of the system’s business logic in those Web-specific elements and technologies.

==Embedded systems==

Software in embedded systems design needs to be looked carefully for software specification and analysis. Unified Modeling Language and extension proposals in the realtime domain can be used for the development of new design flows. UML can be used for specification, design and implementation of modern embedded systems. UML can also be used for modelling the system from functional requirements through executable specifications and for that purpose it is important to be able to model the context for an embedded system – both environmental and user-driven.&lt;ref name="uml for embedded systems"/&gt; 

Some key concepts of UML related to embedded systems:
*UML is not a single language, but a set of notations, syntax and semantics to allow the creation of families of languages for particular applications.
*Extension mechanisms in UML like  profiles, stereotypes, tags, and constraints can be used for particular applications.
*Use-case modelling to describe system environments, user scenarios, and test cases.
*UML has support for object-oriented system specification, design and modelling.
*Growing interest in UML from the embedded systems and realtime community.
*Support for state-machine semantics which can be used for modelling and synthesis.
*UML supports object-based structural decomposition and refinement.

A specific UML profile, called [[MARTE]] for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems, provides some extensions dedicated to the domain.

'''Aurelio Ángel Baldor de la Vega''' (October 22, 1906, [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] – April 2, 1978, [[Miami]]) was a [[Cubans|Cuban]] [[mathematics|mathematician]], educator and lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanet.org/sindical/news/y07/01250701.html Aurelio Baldor, pedagogo cubano] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407034510/http://www.cubanet.org/sindical/news/y07/01250701.html |date=April 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldor is the author of a [[secondary school]] [[algebra]] textbook, titled ''Algebra'', used throughout the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking world and published for the first time in 1941.

He was the youngest child of Daniel and Gertrudis Baldor. He was the founder and director of the Baldor School in the exclusive Vedado section of Havana. In its heyday, the school had 3,500 students and used 23 buses to provide transportation to its students.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In 1959, with the arrival of [[Fidel Castro]]'s communist regime, Aurelio Baldor and his family began experiencing some problems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} [[Raúl Castro]] had intended to arrest Baldor, but [[Camilo Cienfuegos]]&amp;mdash;one of Fidel Castro's own top commanders&amp;mdash;prevented the arrest, as he highly admired and respected Baldor for his accomplishments as an educator.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

After the death of Camilo Cienfuegos approximately one month later in an airplane which disappeared over the sea, Baldor and his family left Cuba and were exiled in [[Mexico]] for a short time, and then they migrated to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. Afterward, they moved on to [[New York (state)|New York]] ([[Brooklyn]]) and [[New Jersey]], where Baldor continued teaching at Saint Peter's College in [[Jersey City]]. He also taught daily classes in mathematics at the now defunct Stevens Academy, in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

He spent much time writing mathematical theorems and exercises. Once a tall and imposing man weighing 100&amp;nbsp;kg (220&amp;nbsp;lbs),{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Baldor slowly began losing weight as his health declined. He died from pulmonary [[emphysema]] in [[Miami]], FL, on April 2, 1978. His seven children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren still reside in Miami.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Other family include Francisco Baldor, Maria Cristina Baldor and Aurelio Baldor's second cousin Teresita Baldor.

Baldor's algebra textbook ''Algebra'' (With Graphics and 6,523 exercises and answers) published by Compañía Cultural Editora y Distribuidora de Textos Americanos, S. A. continues being used to this day in secondary schools throughout [[Latin America]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''DISCUS''', or '''distributed source coding using syndromes''', is a method for [[distributed source coding]]. It is a compression algorithm used to compress [[correlated]] data sources.  The method is designed to achieve the [[Slepian–Wolf coding|Slepian–Wolf bound]] by using [[channel coding|channel codes]].

==History==

DISCUS was invented by researchers S. S.  Pradhan and K. Ramachandran, and first published in their
paper "Distributed source coding using syndromes (DISCUS): design and construction",
published in the  ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'' in 2003.

==Variations==
Many variations of DISCUS are presented in related literature. One such popular scheme is the ''Channel Code Partitioning'' scheme, which is an a-priori scheme, to reach the [[Slepian–Wolf coding|Slepian–Wolf bound]]. Many papers illustrate simulations and experiments on channel code partitioning using the [[turbo codes]], [[Hamming code]]s and [[irregular repeat-accumulate codes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">In [[mathematics]], '''Dedekind sums''' are certain sums of products of a [[sawtooth function]], and are given by a function ''D'' of three integer variables.  Dedekind introduced them to express the [[functional equation]] of the [[Dedekind eta function]]. They have subsequently been much studied in [[number theory]], and have occurred in some problems of [[topology]]. Dedekind sums have a large number functional equations; this article lists only a small fraction of these.

Dedekind sums were introduced by [[Richard Dedekind]] in a commentary on fragment XXVIII of [[Bernhard Riemann]]'s collected papers.

== Definition ==
Define the [[sawtooth function]] &lt;math&gt;(\!( \, )\!) : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as  
:&lt;math&gt;(\!(x)\!)=\begin{cases}
x-\lfloor x\rfloor - 1/2, &amp;\mbox{if }x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Z};\\
0,&amp;\mbox{if }x\in\mathbb{Z}.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

We then let

:''D'' :'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; '''R'''

be defined by

:&lt;math&gt;D(a,b;c)=\sum_{n \bmod c} \left( \!\! \left( \frac{an}{c} \right) \!\! \right)  \left( \!\! \left( \frac{bn}{c} \right) \!\! \right),&lt;/math&gt;

the terms on the right being the '''Dedekind sums'''. For the case ''a''=1, one often writes

:''s''(''b'',''c'') = ''D''(1,''b'';''c'').

==Simple formulae==
Note that ''D'' is symmetric in ''a'' and ''b'', and hence

:&lt;math&gt;D(a,b;c)=D(b,a;c),&lt;/math&gt;

and that, by the oddness of (()),

:''D''(&amp;minus;''a'',''b'';''c'') = &amp;minus;''D''(''a'',''b'';''c''),

:''D''(''a'',''b'';&amp;minus;''c'') = ''D''(''a'',''b'';''c'').

By the periodicity of ''D'' in its first two arguments, the third argument being the length of the period for both,

:''D''(''a'',''b'';''c'')=''D''(''a''+''kc'',''b''+''lc'';''c''), for all integers ''k'',''l''.

If ''d'' is a positive integer, then

:''D''(''ad'',''bd'';''cd'') = ''dD''(''a'',''b'';''c''),

:''D''(''ad'',''bd'';''c'') = ''D''(''a'',''b'';''c''), if (''d'',''c'') = 1,

:''D''(''ad'',''b'';''cd'') = ''D''(''a'',''b'';''c''), if (''d'',''b'') = 1.

There is a proof for the last equality making use of

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \bmod c} \left( \!\!\left( \frac{n+x}{c} \right) \!\!\right)= (\!( x )\!),\qquad\forall x\in\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, ''az'' = 1 (mod ''c'') implies ''D''(''a'',''b'';''c'') = ''D''(1,''bz'';''c'').

==Alternative forms==

If ''b'' and ''c'' are coprime, we may write ''s''(''b'',''c'') as

:&lt;math&gt;s(b,c)=\frac{-1}{c} \sum_\omega
\frac{1} { (1-\omega^b) (1-\omega ) } 
+\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4c},&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum extends over the ''c''-th roots of unity other than 1, i.e. over all &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\omega^c=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega\not=1&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''b'', ''c'' &amp;gt; 0 are coprime, then

:&lt;math&gt;s(b,c)=\frac{1}{4c}\sum_{n=1}^{c-1} 
\cot \left( \frac{\pi n}{c} \right)
\cot \left( \frac{\pi nb}{c} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Reciprocity law==
If ''b'' and ''c'' are coprime positive integers then

:&lt;math&gt;s(b,c)+s(c,b) =\frac{1}{12}\left(\frac{b}{c}+\frac{1}{bc}+\frac{c}{b}\right)-\frac{1}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting this as

:&lt;math&gt;12bc \left( s(b,c) + s(c,b) \right) = b^2 + c^2 -3bc + 1,&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that the number 6''c''&amp;nbsp;''s''(''b'',''c'') is an integer.

If ''k'' = (3, ''c'') then

:&lt;math&gt; 12bc\, s(c,b)=0 \mod kc&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; 12bc\, s(b,c)=b^2+1 \mod kc.&lt;/math&gt;

A relation that is prominent in the theory of the [[Dedekind eta function]] is the following. Let ''q'' = 3, 5, 7 or 13 and let ''n'' = 24/(''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1). Then given integers ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' with ''ad''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''bc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (thus belonging to the [[modular group]]), with ''c'' chosen so that ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kq'' for some integer ''k'' &amp;gt; 0, define
 
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = s(a,c) - \frac{a+d}{12c} - s(a,k) + \frac{a+d}{12k}&lt;/math&gt;

Then one has ''n''δ is an even integer.

==Rademacher's generalization of the reciprocity law==
[[Hans Rademacher]] found the following generalization of the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rademacher | first=Hans | authorlink=Hans Rademacher | title=Generalization of the reciprocity formula for Dedekind sums | journal=[[Duke Mathematical Journal]] | volume=21 | pages=391–397 | year=1954 | zbl=0057.03801 | doi=10.1215/s0012-7094-54-02140-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If ''a'',''b'', and ''c'' are pairwise coprime positive integers, then

:&lt;math&gt;D(a,b;c)+D(b,c;a)+D(c,a;b)=\frac{1}{12}\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{abc}-\frac{1}{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Deductive closure''' is a [[property (philosophy)|property]] of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] (usually the objects in question are [[statement (logic)|statement]]s). A [[set (mathematics)|set]] of objects, &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;, is said to exhibit ''closure'' or to be ''closed'' under a given [[closure operator|operation]], &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt;, provided that for every object, &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;, if &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt;-related to any object, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;, then &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt; is a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter D. Klein]], ''Closure'', ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]] (second edition)&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of statements, a deductive closure is the set of all the statements that can be [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] from a given set of statements.

In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], the set of all true propositions exhibits '''deductive closure''': if set &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; is the set of true propositions, and operation &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt; is [[logical consequence]] (“&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;”), then provided that proposition &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; is a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; is &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt;-related to &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; (i.e., p&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;q), &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; is also a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;.

== Epistemic closure ==
{{main|Epistemic closure}}

In [[epistemology]], many philosophers have and continue to debate whether particular subsets of [[proposition]]s—especially ones ascribing [[knowledge]] or [[Theory of justification|justification]] of a [[belief]] to a subject—are closed under deduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4912">In [[mathematics]], the '''digit sum''' of a given [[integer]] is the [[Addition|sum]] of all its [[numerical digit|digit]]s (e.g. the digit sum of 84001 is calculated as 8+4+0+0+1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;13). Digit sums are most often computed using the [[decimal]] representation of the given number, but they may be calculated in any other [[base (exponentiation)|base]]. Different bases give different digit sums, with the digit sums for binary being on average smaller than those for any other base.&lt;ref name=lebush&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/2304217|first=L. E.|last=Bush|title=An asymptotic formula for the average sum of the digits of integers|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|year=1940|volume=47|issue=3|pages=154–156|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|jstor=2304217}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The digit sum of a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in base &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\lfloor \log_b x\rfloor} \frac{1}{b^n}(x \bmod b^{n + 1} - x \bmod b^n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;S(r,N)&lt;/math&gt; be the digit sum for [[radix]] &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of all non-negative integers less than &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.  For any &lt;math&gt;2 \le r_1 \le r_2&lt;/math&gt; and for sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S(r_1,N) \le S(r_2,N)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=lebush/&gt;

The sum of the decimal digits of the integers 0, 1, 2, ... is given by {{OEIS2C|id=A007953}} in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]]. {{harvtxt|Borwein|Borwein|1992}} use the [[generating function]] of this integer sequence (and of the analogous sequence for binary digit sums) to derive several rapidly converging [[series (mathematics)|series]] with [[rational number|rational]] and [[transcendental number|transcendental]] sums.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/2324993|title=Strange series and high precision fraud|first1=J.

The concept of a decimal digit sum is closely related to, but not the same as, the [[digital root]], which is the result of repeatedly applying the digit sum operation until the remaining value is only a single digit. The digital root of any non-zero integer will be a number in the range 1 to 9, whereas the digit sum can take any value. Digit sums and digital roots can be used for quick [[divisibility rule|divisibility tests]]: a natural number is divisible by 3 or 9 if and only if its digit sum (or digital root) is divisible by 3 or 9, respectively. For divisibility by 9, this test is called the '''rule of nines''' and is the basis of the [[casting out nines]] technique for checking calculations.

Digit sums are also a common ingredient in [[checksum]] algorithms to check the arithmetic operations of early computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.2307/2002859|title=The Logical Design of the Raytheon Computer|first1=R.

The digit sum of the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] representation of a number is known as its [[Hamming weight]] or population count; algorithms for performing this operation have been studied, and it has been included as a built-in operation in some computer architectures and some programming languages. These operations are used in computing applications including [[cryptography]], [[coding theory]], and [[computer chess]].

[[Harshad number]]s are defined in terms of divisibility by their digit sums, and [[Smith number]]s are defined by the equality of their digit sums with the digit sums of their [[integer factorization|prime factorizations]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''Dirichlet conditions''' are [[sufficient condition]]s for a [[real numbers|real]]-valued, [[periodic function]] ''f'' to be equal to the sum of its [[Fourier series]] at each point where ''f'' is [[continuous function|continuous]]. Moreover, the behavior of the Fourier series at points of discontinuity is determined as well (it is the midpoint of the values of the discontinuity). These conditions are named after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

The conditions are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Alan V. Oppenheim|last2= Alan S. Willsky|last3= Syed Hamish Nawab|year= 1997|title= Signals &amp; Systems|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=O9ZHSAAACAAJ&amp;dq=signals+and+systems&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjttNer9KTYAhUHSY8KHczmDu0Q6AEILjAB|publisher= Prentice Hall|isbn= 9780136511755|page= 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
#''f'' must be [[absolutely integrable function|absolutely integrable]] over a period.
#''f'' must be of [[bounded variation]] in any given bounded interval.
#''f'' must have a finite number of [[Classification of discontinuities|discontinuities]] in any given bounded interval, and the discontinuities cannot be infinite.

==Dirichlet's theorem for 1-dimensional Fourier series==

We state Dirichlet's theorem assuming ''f'' is a periodic function of period 2π with Fourier series expansion where

:&lt;math&gt; a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi f(x) e^{-inx}\, dx. &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous statement holds irrespective of what the period of ''f'' is, or which version of the Fourier expansion is chosen (see [[Fourier series]]).
&lt;br&gt;
:'''Dirichlet's theorem:''' If ''f'' satisfies Dirichlet conditions, then for all ''x'', we have that the series obtained by plugging ''x'' into the Fourier series is convergent, and is given by

::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n = -\infty}^\infty a_n e^{inx} = \frac{1}{2}(f(x+) + f(x-)), &lt;/math&gt;

:where the notation

::&lt;math&gt; f(x+) = \lim_{y \to x^+} f(y) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; f(x-) = \lim_{y \to x^-} f(y) &lt;/math&gt;

:denotes the right/left limits of ''f''.

A function satisfying Dirichlet's conditions must have right and left limits at each point of discontinuity, or else the function would need to oscillate at that point, violating the condition on maxima/minima. Note that at any point where ''f'' is continuous,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}(f(x+) + f(x-)) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus Dirichlet's theorem says in particular that under the Dirichlet conditions the Fourier series for ''f'' converges and is equal to ''f'' wherever ''f'' is continuous.

==Biography==
Berlekamp was born in [[Dover, Ohio]]. His family moved to Northern Kentucky, where Berlekamp graduated from Ft. Thomas Highlands high school in Ft. Thomas, Campbell county, Kentucky. While an undergraduate at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), he was a [[Putnam Fellow]] in 1961.  He completed his bachelor's and master's degrees in [[electrical engineering]] in 1962.  Continuing his studies at MIT, he finished his Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1964; his advisors were [[Robert G. Gallager]], [[Peter Elias]], [[Claude Shannon]], and [[John Wozencraft]].  Berlekamp taught electrical engineering at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1964 until 1966, when he became a mathematics researcher at [[Bell Labs]].  In 1971, Berlekamp returned to Berkeley as professor of mathematics and EECS, where he served as the advisor for over twenty doctoral students.  He is now professor emeritus.&lt;ref name=44a /&gt;&lt;ref name=ucb /&gt;&lt;ref name=43a&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=22678 Contributors], ''IEEE Transactions on Information Theory'' '''20''', #3 (May 1974), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he received a Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the [[IEEE Information Theory Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsoc.org/honors/golden-jubilee-awards-for-technological-innovation |title=Golden Jubilee Awards for Technological Innovation |publisher=[[IEEE Information Theory Society]] |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is on the board of directors of [[Gathering 4 Gardner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gathering4gardner.org/ABOUT.html About Gathering 4 Gardner Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507111434/http://gathering4gardner.org/ABOUT.html |date=2016-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlekamp is the inventor of an algorithm to factor polynomials, and is one of the inventors of the [[Welch–Berlekamp algorithm]] and the [[Berlekamp–Massey algorithm]]s, which are used to implement [[Reed–Solomon error correction]].  In the mid-1980s, he was president of [[Cyclotomics, Inc.]], a corporation that developed error-correcting code technology.&lt;ref name=44a /&gt;  With [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy]], he co-authored ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]'', leading to his recognition as one of the founders of [[combinatorial game theory]].  He has studied various games, including [[Dots and Boxes|dots and boxes]], Fox and Geese, and, especially, [[go (game)|Go]].  With David Wolfe, Berlekamp co-authored the book ''Mathematical Go'', which describes methods for analyzing certain classes of Go endgames.

Outside of mathematics and computer science, Berlekamp has also been active in [[money management]].  In 1986, he began information-theoretic studies of commodity and financial futures.  In 1989, Berlekamp purchased the largest interest in a trading company named [[Axcom Trading Advisors]].  After the firm's futures trading algorithms were rewritten, Axcom's [[Medallion Fund]] had a return (in 1990) of 55%, net of all management fees and transaction costs. The fund has subsequently continued to realize annualized returns exceeding 30% under management by [[James Harris Simons]] and his [[Renaissance Technologies]] Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.berkeley.edu/~berlek/fineng.html Financial Engineering], Elwyn Berlekamp's Home Page.

Berlekamp and his wife Jennifer have two daughters and a son and live in [[Piedmont, California]].

A fixed point of a function is a value that, when applied as the input of the function, returns the same value as its output.

In other words: ''fix'', when applied to an arbitrary function ''f'', yields the same result as ''f'' applied to the result of applying ''fix'' to ''f''. It is so named because, by setting &lt;math&gt; x = \textsf{fix}\ f &lt;/math&gt;, it represents a solution to the [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] equation,

: &lt;math&gt; x = f\ x &lt;/math&gt;

The fixed-point combinator ''fix'' therefore satisfies the equation:

: &lt;math&gt; \textsf{fix}\ f = f\ (\textsf{fix}\ f) \ \ \text{   for all } f &lt;/math&gt;

A ''fixed point'' of a function ''f'' is a value that does not change under the application of the function ''f''.

Functions that satisfy the equation for '''fix''' expand as,

: &lt;math&gt; \textsf{fix}\ f = f\ (f\ ( \ldots f\ (\textsf{fix}\ f) \ldots)) &lt;/math&gt;

A particular implementation of '''fix''' is [[Haskell Curry|Curry's]] paradoxical combinator '''Y''', represented in [[lambda calculus]] by

: &lt;math&gt;\textsf{Y} = \lambda f.(\lambda x.f\ (x\ x))\ (\lambda x.f\ (x\ x)) &lt;/math&gt;

In [[functional programming]], the Y combinator can be used to formally define [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive function]]s in a programming language that does not support recursion.

This combinator may be used in implementing [[Curry's paradox]].  The heart of Curry's paradox is that untyped lambda calculus is unsound as a deductive system, and the '''Y''' combinator demonstrates that by allowing an anonymous expression to represent zero, or even many values.  This is inconsistent in mathematical logic.

Applied to a function with one variable the '''Y''' combinator usually does not terminate.  More interesting results are obtained by applying the '''Y''' combinator to functions of two or more variables.  The second variable may be used as a counter, or index.  The resulting function behaves like a ''while'' or a ''for'' loop in an imperative language.

Used in this way the '''Y''' combinator implements simple recursion.  In the lambda calculus it is not possible to refer to the definition of a function in a function body.  Recursion may only be achieved by passing in a function as a parameter.  The '''Y''' combinator demonstrates this style of programming.

==Overview==

The '''Y''' combinator is an implementation of a fixed-point combinator in lambda calculus.  Fixed-point combinators may also be easily defined in other functional and imperative languages.  The implementation in lambda calculus is more difficult due to limitations in lambda calculus.

The fixed combinator may be used in a number of different areas,

* [[mathematics|General mathematics]]
* [[Lambda calculus|Untyped lambda calculus]]
* [[Typed lambda calculus]]
* [[Functional programming]]
* [[Imperative programming]]

Fixed point combinators may be applied to a range of different functions, but normally will not terminate unless there is an extra parameter.  When the function to be fixed refers to its parameter, another call to the function is invoked, so the calculation never gets started.  Instead, the extra parameter is used to trigger the start of the calculation.  

The type of the fixed point is the return type of the function being fixed.  This may be a real or a function or any other type.

In the untyped lambda calculus, the function to apply the fix point combinator to may be expressed using an encoding, like [[Church encoding]].  In this case particular lambda terms (which define functions) are considered as values.  "Running" (beta reducing) the fixed point combinator on the encoding gives a lambda term for the result which may then be interpreted as fixed point value.

Alternately a function may be considered as a lambda term defined purely in lambda calculus.

These different approaches affect how a mathematician and a programmer may regard a fixed point combinator.  A lambda calculus mathematician may see the ''Y'' combinator applied to a function as being an expression satisfying the fixed point equation, and therefore a solution.

In contrast a person only wanting to apply a fixed point combinator to some general programming task may see it only as a means of implementing recursion.

===Values and domains===

Every expression has one value.  This is true in general mathematics and it must be true in lambda calculus.  This means that in lambda calculus, applying a fixed point combinator to a function gives you an expression whose value is the fixed point of the function.

However this is a value in the [[Deductive lambda calculus#Domain of lambda calculus|lambda calculus domain]], it may not correspond to any value in the domain of the function,  so in a practical sense it is not necessarily a fixed point of the function, and only in the lambda calculus domain is it a fixed point of the equation.

For example, consider,
: &lt;math&gt; x^2 = -1 \Rightarrow x = \frac{-1}{x} \Rightarrow f\ x = \frac{-1}{x} \land \textsf{Y}\ f = x&lt;/math&gt;

[[Church encoding#Division|Division]] of [[Church encoding#Signed numbers|Signed numbers]] may be implemented in the Church encoding, so ''f'' may be represented by a lambda term.  This equation has no solution in the real numbers.  But in the domain of the [[complex number]]s ''i'' and ''-i'' are solutions.  This demonstrates that there may be solutions to an equation in another domain.  However the lambda term for the solution for the above equation is weirder than that.  The lambda term &lt;math&gt;Y\ f&lt;/math&gt; represents the state where x could be either ''i'' or ''-i'', as one value.  The information distinguishing these two values has been lost, in the change of domain.

For the lambda calculus mathematician, this is a consequence of the definition of lambda calculus.  For the programmer, it means that the beta reduction of the lambda term will loop forever, never reaching a normal form.

===Function versus implementation===

The fixed-point combinator may be defined in mathematics and then implemented in other languages. General mathematics defines a function based on its [[Extensionality|extensional]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|last=Selinger
|first=Peter
|title=Lecture Notes on Lambda Calculus (PDF)
|url=http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/papers/#lambdanotes.pdf
|pages=6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; That is, two functions are equal if they perform the same mapping. Lambda calculus and programming languages regard function identity as an [[Intensional definition|intensional]] property. A function's identity is based on its implementation.

A lambda calculus function (or term) is an implementation of a mathematical function.  In the lambda calculus there are a number of combinator (implementations) that satisfy the mathematical definition of a fixed-point combinator.

===What is a "combinator"?===

[[Combinatory logic]] is a [[higher-order function]]s theory. A [[combinator]] is a ''closed'' lambda expression, meaning that it has no free variables. The combinators may be combined to direct values to their correct places in the expression without ever naming them as variables.

==Usage==

Usually when applied to functions of one parameter, implementations of the fixed point combinator fail to terminate.  Functions with extra parameters are more interesting.

The Y combinator is an example of what makes the Lambda calculus inconsistent.{{Citation needed|reason=References to a proof that lambda-calcul is inconsistent|date=August 2018}}  So it should be regarded with suspicion.{{Citation needed|reason=If the lambda-calcul is inconsistent it is clear|date=August 2018}}  However it is safe to consider the Y combinator when defined in mathematic logic only.  The definition is,

: &lt;math&gt; \textsf{Y}\ f = f\ (\textsf{Y}\ f) &lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see how ''Y f'' may be applied to one variable.  Applying it to two or more variables requires adding them to the equation,

: &lt;math&gt; \textsf{Y}\ f\ x = f\ (\textsf{Y}\ f)\ x &lt;/math&gt;

This version of the equation must be shown consistent with the previous by the definition for equality of functions,

: &lt;math&gt; (\forall x f\ x = g\ x) \equiv f = g &lt;/math&gt;

This definition allows the two equations for Y to be regarded as equivalent, provided that the domain of ''x'' is well defined.  So if ''f'' has multiple parameters the ''Y f'' may still be regarded as a fixed point, with some restrictions.

===The factorial function===

The factorial function provides a good example of how the fixed point combinator may be applied to functions of two variables.  The result demonstrates simple recursion, as would be implemented in a single loop, in an imperative language.  The definition of numbers used is explained in [[Church encoding]]. The fixed point function is,

: &lt;math&gt; F\ f\ n = (\operatorname{IsZero}\ n)\ 1\ (\operatorname{multiply}\ n\ (f\ (\operatorname{pred}\ n))) &lt;/math&gt;

This gives ''Y F n'' as,

: &lt;math&gt; \textsf{fix}\ F\ n &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; = F\ (\textsf{fix}\ F)\ n &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; = (\operatorname{IsZero}\ n)\ 1\ (\operatorname{multiply}\ n\ ((\textsf{fix}\ F)\ (\operatorname{pred}\ n))) &lt;/math&gt;

Setting &lt;math&gt; \textsf{fix}\ F = \operatorname{fact} &lt;/math&gt; gives,

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{fact}\ n = (\operatorname{IsZero}\ n)\ 1\ (\operatorname{multiply}\ n\ (\operatorname{fact}\ (\operatorname{pred}\ n))) &lt;/math&gt;

This definition puts ''F'' in the role of the body of a loop to be iterated, and is equivalent to the mathematical definition of factorial:

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{fact}\ n = \operatorname{if} n = 0 \operatorname{then} 1 \operatorname{else} n * \operatorname{fact}\ (n - 1) &lt;/math&gt;

==Fixed point combinators in lambda calculus==

The ''Y'' combinator, discovered by [[Haskell Curry|Haskell B. Curry]], is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;Y = \lambda f.(\lambda x.f\ (x\ x))\ (\lambda x.f\ (x\ x))&lt;/math&gt;

[[Beta reduction]] of this gives,

{| cellpadding="0"
| &lt;math&gt;Y\ g&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;= (\lambda f.(\lambda x.f\ (x\ x))\ (\lambda x.f\ (x\ x)))\ g&lt;/math&gt;
|style="padding-left:30px;"| (by definition of ''Y'')
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;= (\lambda x.g\ (x\ x))\ (\lambda x.g\ (x\ x))&lt;/math&gt;
|style="padding-left:30px;"| (by [[β-reduction]] of λf: applied Y to g)
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;= g ((\lambda x.g\ (x\ x))\ (\lambda x.g\ (x\ x)))&lt;/math&gt;
|style="padding-left:30px;"| (by β-reduction of λx: applied left function to right function)
|-
|
| &lt;math&gt;= g\ (Y\ g)&lt;/math&gt;
|style="padding-left:30px;"| (by second equality)
|}

By repeatedly applying this equality we get,
: &lt;math&gt; Y\ g = g\ (Y\ g) = g\ (g\ (Y\ g)) = g\ (\ldots g\ (Y\ g) \ldots) &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the equality above should be thought of as a sequence of multi-step β-reductions from left to right. The lambda term &lt;math&gt;g\ (Y\ g)&lt;/math&gt; may not, in general, β-reduce to the term &lt;math&gt;Y\ g&lt;/math&gt;. One can interpret the equality signs as β-equivalences instead of multi step β-reductions to allow for going in both directions.

===Equivalent definition of a fixed-point combinator===

This fixed-point combinator may be defined as ''y'' in,
: &lt;math&gt;  x = f\ x \land y\ f = x&lt;/math&gt;

An expression for y may be derived using rules from the [[Let expression#Let definition in mathematics|definition of a let expression]].  Firstly using the rule,
:&lt;math&gt; (\exists x E \land F) \iff \operatorname{let} x : E \operatorname{in} F &lt;/math&gt;

gives,
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{let} x = f\ x \operatorname{in} y\ f = x &lt;/math&gt;

Also using,
:&lt;math&gt; x \not \in \operatorname{FV}(E) \land x \in \operatorname{FV}(F) \to \operatorname{let} x : G \operatorname{in} E\ F = E\  (\operatorname{let} x : G \operatorname{in} F)&lt;/math&gt;

gives
:&lt;math&gt; y\ f =  \operatorname{let} x = f\ x \operatorname{in} x &lt;/math&gt;

Then using the [[Deductive lambda calculus#Eta reduction as mathematics|eta reduction]] rule,
: &lt;math&gt;f\ x = y \iff f = \lambda x.y &lt;/math&gt;

gives,
:&lt;math&gt; y = \lambda f.\operatorname{let} x = f\ x \operatorname{in} x &lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation of the Y combinator===

Curry's Y combinator may be readily obtained from the definition of ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;
http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/51246/can-someone-explain-the-y-combinator&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting with,
: &lt;math&gt; \lambda f.\operatorname{let} x = f\ x \operatorname{in} x &lt;/math&gt;

A lambda abstraction does not support reference to the variable name, in the applied expression, so ''x'' must be passed in as a parameter to ''x''.  We can think of this as replacing ''x'' by ''x x'', but formally this is not correct.  Instead defining ''y'' by &lt;math&gt;\forall z, y\ z = x&lt;/math&gt; gives,
: &lt;math&gt; \lambda f.\operatorname{let} y\ z = f\ (y\ z) \operatorname{in} y\ z &lt;/math&gt;

The let expression may be regarded as the definition of the function ''y'', where ''z'' is the parameter.  Instantiation ''z'' as ''y'' in the call gives,
: &lt;math&gt; \lambda f.\operatorname{let} y\ z = f\ (y\ z) \operatorname{in} y\ y &lt;/math&gt;

And because the parameter ''z'' always passes the function ''y''.
: &lt;math&gt; \lambda f.\operatorname{let} y\ z = f\ (z\ z) \operatorname{in} y\ y &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Deductive lambda calculus#Eta reduction as mathematics|eta reduction]] rule,
: &lt;math&gt;f\ x = y \equiv f = \lambda x.y &lt;/math&gt;

gives,
: &lt;math&gt; \lambda f.\operatorname{let} y = \lambda z.f\ (z\ z) \operatorname{in} y\ y &lt;/math&gt;

A [[Let expression#Let definition in mathematics|let expression may be expressed as a lambda abstraction]] using,
:&lt;math&gt; n \not \in FV(E) \to (\operatorname{let} n = E \operatorname{in} L \equiv (\lambda n.L)\ E) &lt;/math&gt;

gives,
: &lt;math&gt; \lambda f.(\lambda y.y\ y)\ (\lambda z.f\ (z\ z)) &lt;/math&gt;

This is possibly the simplest implementation of a fixed point combinator in lambda calculus.  However one beta reduction gives the more symmetrical form of Curry's Y combinator.
: &lt;math&gt; \lambda f.(\lambda z.f\ (z\ z))\ (\lambda z.f\ (z\ z))&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Let expression#Conversion from let to lambda expressions|translating between let and lambda expressions]].

===Other fixed-point combinators===

In untyped lambda calculus fixed-point combinators are not especially rare. In fact there are infinitely many of them.&lt;ref name="bimbo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bimbó|first=Katalin|title=Combinatory Logic: Pure, Applied and Typed|page=48|year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Mayer Goldberg showed that the set of fixed-point combinators of untyped lambda calculus is [[recursively enumerable]].&lt;ref name=gold&gt;Goldberg, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Y'' combinator can be expressed in the [[SKI combinator calculus|SKI-calculus]] as

:&lt;math&gt; Y = S (K (S I I)) (S (S (K S) K) (K (S I I))) &lt;/math&gt;

The simplest fixed point combinator in the SK-calculus, found by [[John Tromp]], is

:&lt;math&gt; Y' = S S K (S (K (S S (S (S S K)))) K) &lt;/math&gt;

although note that it is not in normal form, which is longer. This combinator corresponds to the lambda expression

:&lt;math&gt; Y' = (\lambda x. \lambda y. x y x) (\lambda y. \lambda x. y (x y x)) &lt;/math&gt;

The following fixed-point combinator is simpler than the Y combinator, and β-reduces into the Y combinator; it is sometimes cited as the Y combinator itself:

:&lt;math&gt; X = \lambda f.(\lambda x.x x) (\lambda x.f (x x)) &lt;/math&gt;

Another common fixed point combinator is the Turing fixed-point combinator (named after its discoverer, [[Alan Turing]]):

:&lt;math&gt; \Theta = (\lambda x. \lambda y. (y (x x y))) (\lambda x. \lambda y. (y (x x y))) &lt;/math&gt;

It also has a simple call-by-value form:

:&lt;math&gt; \Theta_{v} = (\lambda x. \lambda y. (y (\lambda z. x x y z))) (\lambda x. \lambda y. (y (\lambda z. x x y z))) &lt;/math&gt;

The analog for [[mutual recursion]] is a ''polyvariadic fix-point combinator'',
&lt;ref&gt;[http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/fixed-point-combinators.html#Poly-variadic Poly-variadic fix-point combinators]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://osdir.com/ml/lang.haskell.cafe/2003-10/msg00211.html Polyvariadic Y in pure Haskell98] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101809/http://osdir.com/ml/lang.haskell.cafe/2003-10/msg00211.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, lang.haskell.cafe, October 28, 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4899113/fixed-point-combinator-for-mutually-recursive-functions Fixed point combinator for mutually recursive functions?]&lt;/ref&gt; which may be denoted Y*.

===Strict fixed point combinator===

The ''Z'' combinator will work in strict languages (also called eager languages, where applicative evaluation order is applied). The ''Z'' combinator has the next argument defined explicitly, preventing the expansion of ''Z'' g in the right hand side of the definition:

: &lt;math&gt;Z g v = g (Z g) v&lt;/math&gt;

and in lambda calculus it is an eta-expansion of the ''Y'' combinator:

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \lambda f.(\lambda x.f (\lambda v.x x v)) (\lambda x.f (\lambda v.x x v))&lt;/math&gt;

=== Non-standard fixed-point combinators ===

In untyped lambda calculus there are terms that have the same [[Böhm tree]] as a fixed-point combinator, that is they have the same infinite extension λx.x (x (x ... )). These are called ''non-standard fixed-point combinators''. Any fixed-point combinator is also a non-standard one, but not all non-standard fixed-point combinators are fixed-point combinators because some of them fail to satisfy the equation that defines the "standard" ones. These strange combinators are called ''strictly non-standard fixed-point combinators''; an example is the following combinator;
: &lt;math&gt; N = B M (B (B M) B) &lt;/math&gt;
where,
: &lt;math&gt; B = \lambda x,y,z.x (y z) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; M = \lambda x.x x &lt;/math&gt;
The set of non-standard fixed-point combinators is not recursively enumerable.&lt;ref name=gold/&gt;

==Implementation in other languages==

Note that the Y combinator is a particular implementation of a fixed point combinator in lambda calculus.  Its structure is determined by the limitations of lambda calculus.  It is not necessary or helpful to use this structure in implementing the fixed point combinator in other languages.

Simple examples of fixed point combinators implemented in some [[programming paradigm]]s are given below.

=== Lazy functional implementation ===

In a language that supports [[lazy evaluation]], like in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], it is possible to define a fixed-point combinator using the defining equation of the fixed-point combinator which is conventionally named &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt;.  Since Haskell has lazy datatypes, this combinator can also be used to define fixed points of data constructors (and not only to implement recursive functions). The definition is given here, followed by some usage examples.

&lt;source lang=Haskell&gt;
 fix :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a
 fix f = f (fix f)                -- Lambda lifted
 -- alternative:
 fix' f = let x = f x in x        -- Lambda dropped
 
 fix (\x -&gt; 9)                    -- this evaluates to 9

 fix (\x -&gt; 3:x)                  -- evaluates to the lazy infinite list [3,3,3,...]

 fact = fix fac                   -- evaluates to the factorial function
   where fac f 0 = 1                      
         fac f x = x * f (x-1)

 fact 5                           -- evaluates to 120
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Strict functional implementation ===

In a strict functional language the argument to ''f'' is expanded beforehand, yielding an infinite call sequence,
: &lt;math&gt;f\ (f ... (f\ (\operatorname{fix}\ f))... )\ x&lt;/math&gt;.

This may be resolved by defining fix with an extra parameter.

&lt;source lang=ocaml&gt;
let rec fix f x = f (fix f) x (* note the extra x; here fix f = \x-&gt; f (fix f) x *)

let factabs fact = function   (* factabs has extra level of lambda abstraction *)
   0 -&gt; 1
 | x -&gt; x * fact (x-1)

let _ = (fix factabs) 5       (* evaluates to "120" *)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Imperative language implementation===

This example is a slightly interpretive implementation of a fixed point combinator.  A class is used to contain the ''fix'' function, called ''fixer''.  The function to be fixed is contained in a class that inherits from fixer.  The ''fix'' function accesses the function to be fixed as a virtual function.  As for the strict functional definition, ''fix'' is explicitly given an extra parameter ''x'', which means that lazy evaluation is not needed.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
template &lt;typename R, typename D&gt;
class fixer
{
public:
    R fix(D x)
    {
        return f(x);
    }
private:
    virtual R f(D) = 0;
};

class fact : public fixer&lt;long, long&gt;
{
    virtual long f(long x)
    {
        if (x == 0)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        return x * fix(x-1);
    }
};

long result = fact().fix(5);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Typing==

In [[polymorphic lambda calculus]] ([[System F]]) a polymorphic fixed-point combinator has type;
: ∀a.(a → a) → a
where ''a'' is a [[type variable]].  That is, ''fix'' takes a function, which maps a → a and uses it to return a value of type a.

In the simply typed lambda calculus extended with [[recursive type]]s, fixed-point operators can be written, but the type of a "useful" fixed-point operator (one whose application always returns) may be restricted.

In the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], the fixed-point combinator Y cannot be assigned a type&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP3610/lectures/Lambda.pdf An Introduction to the Lambda Calculus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408014716/http://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP3610/lectures/Lambda.pdf |date=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because at some point it would deal with the self-application sub-term &lt;math&gt;x~x&lt;/math&gt; by the application rule:

: &lt;math&gt;{\Gamma\vdash x\!:\!t_1 \to t_2\quad\Gamma\vdash x\!:\!t_1}\over{\Gamma\vdash x~x\!:\!t_2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has the infinite type &lt;math&gt;t_1 = t_1\to t_2&lt;/math&gt;. No fixed-point combinator can in fact be typed, in those systems any support for recursion must be explicitly added to the language.

===Type for the Y combinator ===

In programming languages that support [[recursive type]]s, it is possible to type the Y combinator by appropriately accounting for the recursion at the type level. The need to self-apply the variable x can be managed using a type (Rec a), which is defined so as to be isomorphic to (Rec a -&gt; a).

For example, in the following Haskell code, we have &lt;code&gt;In&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; being the names of the two directions of the isomorphism, with types:&lt;ref&gt;Haskell mailing list thread on  [http://groups.google.co.uk/group/fa.haskell/browse_frm/thread/f0a62b6de1416d8b How to define Y combinator in Haskell], 15 Sep 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
In :: (Rec a -&gt; a) -&gt; Rec a
out :: Rec a -&gt; (Rec a -&gt; a)
&lt;/source&gt;

which lets us write:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
newtype Rec a = In { out :: Rec a -&gt; a }

y :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a
y = \f -&gt; (\x -&gt; f (out x x)) (In (\x -&gt; f (out x x)))
&lt;/source&gt;

Or equivalently in OCaml:

&lt;source lang=ocaml&gt;
type 'a recc = In of ('a recc -&gt; 'a)
let out (In x) = x

let y f = (fun x a -&gt; f (out x x) a) (In (fun x a -&gt; f (out x x) a))
&lt;/source&gt;

==General information==

The function for which any input is a fixed point is called the [[identity function]]. Formally:
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (f\ x = x)&lt;/math&gt;

Other functions have the special property that after being applied once, further applications don't have any effect. More formally: 
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x (f\ (f\ x) = f\ x)&lt;/math&gt;

Such functions are called [[idempotent]] (see also [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]]). An example of such a function is the function that returns ''0'' for all even integers, and ''1'' for all odd integers.

Fixed-point combinators do not necessarily exist in more restrictive models of computation. For instance, they do not exist in [[simply typed lambda calculus]].

The Y combinator allows [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] to be defined as a set of [[Production (computer science)|rewrite rule]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Little Lisper|author=[[Daniel P. Friedman]], [[Matthias Felleisen]]|publisher=[[Science Research Associates]]|year=1986|chapter=Chapter 9 - Lambda The Ultimate|page=179}} "In the chapter we have derived a Y-combinator which allows us to write recursive functions of one argument withour using define."&lt;/ref&gt; without requiring native recursion support in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mvanier.livejournal.com/2897.html |title=The Y Combinator (Slight Return) or: How to Succeed at Recursion Without Really Recursing |author=Mike Vanier |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822202348/http://mvanier.livejournal.com/2897.html |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df= }} "More generally, Y gives us a way to get recursion in a programming language that supports first-class functions but that doesn't have recursion built in to it."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[recursive join]] in [[relational databases]] implements a fixed point, by recursively adding records to a set until no more may be added.

In programming languages that support [[anonymous function]]s, fixed-point combinators allow the definition and use of anonymous [[recursion|recursive functions]], i.e. without having to [[Name binding|bind]] such functions to [[identifier]]s. In this setting, the use of fixed-point combinators is sometimes called ''[[anonymous recursion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;This terminology appear to be largely [[mathematical folklore|folklore]], but it does appear in the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12737">In mathematics, the '''Fréchet distance''' is a [[measure of similarity]] between [[curve]]s that takes into account the location and ordering of the points along the curves. It is named after [[Maurice Fréchet]].

==Intuitive definition==

Imagine a man traversing a finite curved path while walking his dog on a leash, with the dog traversing a separate one.  Assume that the dog varies its speed to keep as much slack in her leash as possible: the Fréchet distance between the two curves is the length of the shortest leash sufficient for both to traverse their separate paths.  Note that the definition is symmetric with respect to the two curves—the Frechet distance would be the same if the dog was walking its owner.

==Formal definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]]. A [[curve]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[map (mathematics)|map]] from the [[unit interval]] into &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;A : [0,1] \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;. A [[parametric equation|reparameterization]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous, [[monotonic function|non-decreasing]], [[surjection]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be two given curves in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the '''Fréchet distance''' between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[infimum]] over all reparameterizations &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of the maximum over all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of the distance in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha(t))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt;. In mathematical notation, the Fréchet distance &lt;math&gt;F(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;F(A,B) = \inf_{\alpha, \beta}\,\,\max_{t \in [0,1]} \,\,  \Bigg \{d \Big ( A(\alpha(t)), \, B(\beta(t)) \Big ) \Bigg \}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric (mathematics)|distance function]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

Informally, we can think of the parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as "time". Then, &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha(t))&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the dog and &lt;math&gt;B(\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the dog's owner at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (or vice versa). The length of the leash between them at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between &lt;math&gt;A(\alpha(t))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(\beta(t))&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the infimum over all possible reparametrizations of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to choosing the walk along the given paths where the maximum leash length is minimized. The restriction that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; be non-decreasing means that neither the dog nor its owner can backtrack.

The Fréchet metric takes into account the flow of the two curves because the pairs of points whose distance contributes to the Fréchet distance sweep continuously along their respective curves. This makes the Fréchet distance a better measure of similarity for curves than alternatives, such as the [[Hausdorff distance]], for arbitrary point sets. It is possible for two curves to have small Hausdorff distance but large Fréchet distance.

The Fréchet distance and its variants find application in several problems, from [[morphing]]&lt;ref name="efrat02new"&gt;{{citation

The running time of their algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(mn \cdot \log(mn))&lt;/math&gt; for two polygonal curves with ''m'' and ''n'' segments.

== The free-space diagram ==
[[Image:free-space-diagram.png|thumb|alt=example of a free-space diagram|Free-space diagram of the red and the blue curve. In contrast to the definition in the text, which uses the parameter interval [0,1] for both curves, the curves are parameterized by arc length in this example.]]
An important tool for calculating the Fréchet distance of two curves is the free-space diagram, which was introduced by Alt and Godau.&lt;ref name="alt95frechet"/&gt;
The free-space diagram between two curves for a given distance threshold ε is a two-dimensional region in the parameter space that consist of all point pairs on the two curves at distance at most ε:

&lt;math&gt;D_\varepsilon(A,B) := \{\,(\alpha,\beta)\in[0,1]^2\mid d( A(\alpha), B(\beta))\le\varepsilon \,\}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Fréchet distance &lt;math&gt;F(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is at most ε if and only if the free-space diagram &lt;math&gt;D_\varepsilon(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; contains a path from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, which is monotone both in the horizontal and in the vertical direction.

==Variants==

The '''weak Fréchet distance''' is a variant of the classical Fréchet distance without the requirement that the endpoints move monotonically along their respective curves &amp;mdash; the dog and its owner are allowed to backtrack to keep the leash between them short. Alt and Godau&lt;ref name="alt95frechet"/&gt; describe a simpler algorithm to compute the weak Fréchet distance between polygonal curves, based on computing [[Widest path problem|minimax paths]] in an associated [[grid graph]].

The '''discrete Fréchet distance''', also called the '''coupling distance''', is an approximation of the Fréchet metric for polygonal curves, defined by Eiter and Mannila.&lt;ref name="eiter94discrete"&gt;{{citation

 | title = Computing discrete Fréchet distance
 | url = http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/staff/eiter/et-archive/cdtr9464.pdf
 | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The discrete Fréchet distance considers only positions of the leash where its endpoints are located at vertices of the two polygonal curves and never in the interior of an edge. This special structure allows the discrete Fréchet distance to be computed in polynomial time by an easy dynamic programming algorithm.

When the two curves are embedded in a metric space other than Euclidean space, such as a [[polyhedral terrain]] or some Euclidean space with obstacles, the distance between two points on the curves is most naturally defined as the length of the [[shortest path]] between them. The leash is required to be a [[geodesic]] joining its endpoints. The resulting metric between curves is called the '''geodesic Fréchet distance'''.&lt;ref name="efrat02new" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cook08geodesic"&gt;{{citation

The leash cannot switch discontinuously from one position to another &amp;mdash; in particular, the leash cannot jump over obstacles, and can sweep over a mountain on a terrain only if it is long enough. The motion of the leash describes a [[homotopy]] between the two curves. Chambers ''et al.''&lt;ref name="chambers09homotopic"/&gt; describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the homotopic Fréchet distance between polygonal curves in the Euclidean plane with obstacles.

==Examples==
The Fréchet distance between two concentric circles of radius &lt;math&gt;r_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively is &lt;math&gt;|r_1 - r_2|.&lt;/math&gt;
The longest leash is required when the owner stands still and the dog travels to the opposite side of the circle (&lt;math&gt;r_1 + r_2&lt;/math&gt;), and the shortest leash when both owner and dog walk at a constant angular velocity around the circle (&lt;math&gt;|r_1 - r_2|&lt;/math&gt;).

Similarly to [[SRPT]], the aim of FB is to improve the performance of a system, specifically mean response time. While SRPT is optimal it is more difficult to apply in practice as it requires accurate estimations of the service time of each request. In contrast, FB does not require estimations of service times, making it more practical but also less performing than SRPT.

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[linear algebra]] and [[numerical analysis]], the '''Gram–Schmidt process''' is a method for [[Orthonormal basis|orthonormalising]] a set of [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] in an [[inner product space]], most commonly the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; equipped with the [[standard inner product]]. The Gram–Schmidt process takes a [[finite set|finite]], [[linearly independent]] set ''S'' = {''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} for {{nowrap|''k'' ≤ ''n''}} and generates an [[orthogonal set]] {{nowrap|''S′'' {{=}} {''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} }} that spans the same ''k''-dimensional subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as ''S''.

The method is named after [[Jørgen Pedersen Gram]] and [[Erhard Schmidt]], but [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] had been familiar with it before Gram and Schmidt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheney |first=Ward |last2=Kincaid |first2=David |title=Linear Algebra: Theory and Applications |location=Sudbury, Ma |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |year=2009 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=Gg3Uj1GkHK8C |page=544 }} |isbn=978-0-7637-5020-6 |pages=544, 558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the theory of [[Lie group decompositions]] it is generalized by the [[Iwasawa decomposition]].

The application of the Gram–Schmidt process to the column vectors of a full column [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] yields the [[QR decomposition]] (it is decomposed into an [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] and a [[triangular matrix]]).

== The Gram–Schmidt process  ==
[[File:Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process.gif|frame|The modified Gram-Schmidt process being executed on three linearly independent, non-orthogonal vectors of a basis for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Click on image for details. Modification is explained in the next section of this article.]]

We define the [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}}\,(\mathbf{v}) = {\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\rangle\over\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{u}\rangle}{\mathbf{u}} , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[inner product]] of the vectors '''u''' and '''v''': &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle = \mathbf{u}^\top \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; for vectors on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\rangle = \mathbf{u}^* \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; for vectors on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. This operator projects the vector '''v''' orthogonally onto the line spanned by vector '''u'''. If '''u''' = '''0''', we define &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{proj}_0\,(\mathbf{v}) := 0&lt;/math&gt;. i.e., the projection map &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{proj}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the zero map, sending every vector to the zero vector.

The Gram–Schmidt process then works as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{u}_1 &amp; = \mathbf{v}_1, &amp; \mathbf{e}_1 &amp; = {\mathbf{u}_1 \over \|\mathbf{u}_1\|} \\
\mathbf{u}_2 &amp; = \mathbf{v}_2-\mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_1}\,(\mathbf{v}_2),
&amp; \mathbf{e}_2 &amp; = {\mathbf{u}_2 \over \|\mathbf{u}_2\|} \\
\mathbf{u}_3 &amp; = \mathbf{v}_3-\mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_1}\,(\mathbf{v}_3)-\mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_2}\,(\mathbf{v}_3), &amp; \mathbf{e}_3 &amp; = {\mathbf{u}_3 \over \|\mathbf{u}_3\|} \\
\mathbf{u}_4 &amp; = \mathbf{v}_4-\mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_1}\,(\mathbf{v}_4)-\mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_2}\,(\mathbf{v}_4)-\mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_3}\,(\mathbf{v}_4), &amp; \mathbf{e}_4 &amp; = {\mathbf{u}_4 \over \|\mathbf{u}_4\|} \\
&amp; {}\ \  \vdots &amp; &amp; {}\ \  \vdots \\
\mathbf{u}_k &amp; = \mathbf{v}_k-\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}\mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_j}\,(\mathbf{v}_k), &amp; \mathbf{e}_k &amp; = {\mathbf{u}_k\over \|\mathbf{u}_k \|}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the required system of orthogonal vectors, and the normalized vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; form an [[orthonormal|ortho''normal'']] set. The calculation of the sequence '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is known as ''Gram–Schmidt [[orthogonalization]]'', while the calculation of the sequence '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is known as ''Gram–Schmidt [[orthonormalization]]'' as the vectors are normalized.

To check that these formulas yield an orthogonal sequence, first compute &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; by substituting the above formula for '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: we get zero. Then use this to compute &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{u}_1, \mathbf{u}_3 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; again by substituting the formula for '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: we get zero. The general proof proceeds by [[mathematical induction]].

Geometrically, this method proceeds as follows: to compute '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, it projects '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; orthogonally onto the subspace ''U'' generated by '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the same as the subspace generated by '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;. The vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is then defined to be the difference between '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and this projection, guaranteed to be orthogonal to all of the vectors in the subspace ''U''.

The Gram–Schmidt process also applies to a linearly independent [[countably infinite]] sequence {'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The result is an orthogonal (or orthonormal) sequence {'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that for natural number ''n'':
the algebraic span of '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the same as that of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

If the Gram–Schmidt process is applied to a linearly dependent sequence, it outputs the '''0''' vector on the ''i''th step, assuming that '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a linear combination of {{nowrap|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If an orthonormal basis is to be produced, then the algorithm should test for zero vectors in the output and discard them because no multiple of a zero vector can have a length of 1. The number of vectors output by the algorithm will then be the dimension of the space spanned by the original inputs.

A variant of the Gram–Schmidt process using [[transfinite recursion]] applied to a (possibly uncountably) infinite sequence of vectors &lt;math&gt;(v_\alpha)_{\alpha&lt;\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; yields a set of orthonormal vectors &lt;math&gt;(u_\alpha)_{\alpha&lt;\kappa}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\kappa\leq\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\leq\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Complete space#Completion|completion]] of the span of &lt;math&gt;\lbrace u_\beta : \beta&lt;\min(\alpha,\kappa)\rbrace&lt;/math&gt; is the same as that of &lt;math&gt;\lbrace v_\beta:\beta&lt;\alpha\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, when applied to a (algebraic) basis of a [[Hilbert space]] (or, more generally, a basis of any dense subspace), it yields a (functional-analytic) orthonormal basis. Note that in the general case often the strict inequality &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; holds, even if the starting set was linearly independent, and the span of &lt;math&gt;(u_\alpha)_{\alpha&lt;\kappa}&lt;/math&gt; need not be a subspace of the span of &lt;math&gt;(v_\alpha)_{\alpha&lt;\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; (rather, it's a subspace of its completion).

== Example ==

===Euclidean space===
Consider the following set of vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (with the conventional [[Inner product space#Euclidean space|inner product]])
:&lt;math&gt;S = \left\lbrace\mathbf{v}_1=\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{v}_2=\begin{pmatrix}2 \\2\end{pmatrix}\right\rbrace.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, perform Gram–Schmidt, to obtain an orthogonal set of vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_1=\mathbf{v}_1=\begin{pmatrix}3\\1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_2 = \mathbf{v}_2 - \mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_1} \, (\mathbf{v}_2) = \begin{pmatrix}2\\2\end{pmatrix} - \mathrm{proj}_{({3 \atop 1})} \, ({\begin{pmatrix}2\\2\end{pmatrix})} = \begin{pmatrix}2\\2\end{pmatrix} - \frac 45 \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2/5 \\6/5 \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

We check that the vectors '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are indeed orthogonal:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{u}_1,\mathbf{u}_2\rangle = \left\langle \begin{pmatrix}3\\1\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}-2/5\\6/5\end{pmatrix} \right\rangle = -\frac65 + \frac65 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
noting that if the dot product of two vectors is ''0'' then they are orthogonal.

For non-zero vectors, we can then normalize the vectors by dividing out their sizes as shown above:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1 = {1 \over \sqrt {10}}\begin{pmatrix}3\\1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_2 = {1 \over \sqrt{40 \over 25}} \begin{pmatrix}-2/5\\6/5\end{pmatrix}
 = {1\over\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix}-1\\3\end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Numerical stability ==
When this process is implemented on a computer, the vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_k&lt;/math&gt; are often not quite orthogonal, due to [[round-off error|rounding errors]]. For the Gram–Schmidt process as described above (sometimes referred to as "classical Gram–Schmidt") this loss of orthogonality is particularly bad; therefore, it is said that the (classical) Gram–Schmidt process is [[numerical stability|numerically unstable]].

The Gram–Schmidt process can be stabilized by a small modification; this version is sometimes referred to as '''modified Gram-Schmidt''' or MGS.
This approach gives the same result as the original formula in exact arithmetic and introduces smaller errors in finite-precision arithmetic.
Instead of computing the vector '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_k = \mathbf{v}_k - \mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_1}\,(\mathbf{v}_k) - \mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_2}\,(\mathbf{v}_k) - \cdots - \mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_{k-1}}\,(\mathbf{v}_k), &lt;/math&gt;
it is computed as
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathbf{u}_k^{(1)} &amp;= \mathbf{v}_k - \mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_1}\,(\mathbf{v}_k), \\
\mathbf{u}_k^{(2)} &amp;= \mathbf{u}_k^{(1)} - \mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_2} \, (\mathbf{u}_k^{(1)}), \\
&amp; \,\,\, \vdots \\
\mathbf{u}_k^{(k-2)} &amp;= \mathbf{u}_k^{(k-3)} - \mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_{k-2}} \, (\mathbf{u}_k^{(k-3)}), \\
\mathbf{u}_k^{(k-1)} &amp;= \mathbf{u}_k^{(k-2)} - \mathrm{proj}_{\mathbf{u}_{k-1}} \, (\mathbf{u}_k^{(k-2)}).
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Each step finds a vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_k^{(i)} &lt;/math&gt; orthogonal to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_k^{(i-1)} &lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_k^{(i)} &lt;/math&gt; is also orthogonalized against any errors introduced in computation of  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_k^{(i-1)} &lt;/math&gt;.

This method is used in the previous animation, when the intermediate v'&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; vector is used when orthogonalizing the blue vector v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Algorithm ==
The following MATLAB algorithm implements the stabilized Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization for Euclidean Vectors. The vectors '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; (columns of matrix '''V''', so that '''V(:,j)''' is the jth vector) are replaced by orthonormal vectors (columns of '''U''') which span the same subspace.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=matlab&gt;
    n = size(V,1);
    k = size(V,2);
    U = zeros(n,k);
    U(:,1) = V(:,1)/sqrt(V(:,1)'*V(:,1));
    for i = 2:k
      U(:,i) = V(:,i);
      for j = 1:i-1
        U(:,i) = U(:,i) - ( U(:,i)'*U(:,j) )/( U(:,j)'*U(:,j) )*U(:,j);
      end
      U(:,i) = U(:,i)/sqrt(U(:,i)'*U(:,i));
    end
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The cost of this algorithm is asymptotically O(''nk''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) floating point operations, where ''n'' is the dimensionality of the vectors {{harv|Golub|Van Loan|1996|loc=§5.2.8}}.

== Via Gaussian elimination ==

If the rows {''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} are written as a matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then applying [[Gaussian elimination]] to the augmented matrix &lt;math&gt;[A A^\mathrm{T} | A ]&lt;/math&gt; will produce the orthogonalized vectors in place of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pursell|first1=Lyle|last2=Trimble|first2=S. Y.|title=Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization by Gauss Elimination|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=1 January 1991|volume=98|issue=6|pages=544–549|doi=10.2307/2324877|jstor=2324877}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, taking &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{v}_2=\begin{pmatrix}2 &amp; 2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; as above, we have

:&lt;math&gt;[A A^\mathrm{T} | A ] = \left[\begin{array}{rr|rr} 10 &amp; 8 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\ 8 &amp; 8 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

And reducing this to [[row echelon form]] produces

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{rr|rr} 1 &amp; .8 &amp; .3 &amp; .1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -.25 &amp; .75\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The normalized vectors are then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1 = {1 \over \sqrt {.3^2+.1^2}}\begin{pmatrix}.3 &amp; .1\end{pmatrix} = {1\over\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix}3 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_2 = {1 \over \sqrt{.25^2+.75^2}} \begin{pmatrix}-.25 &amp; .75\end{pmatrix} = {1\over\sqrt{10}} \begin{pmatrix}-1 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

as in the example above.

== Determinant formula ==
The result of the Gram–Schmidt process may be expressed in a non-recursive formula using [[determinant]]s.

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_j = \frac{1}{\sqrt{D_{j-1} D_j}} \begin{vmatrix}
\langle \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle &amp; \dots &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle \\
\langle \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle &amp; \dots &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\langle \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_{j-1} \rangle &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_{j-1} \rangle &amp; \dots &amp;
\langle \mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_{j-1} \rangle \\
\mathbf{v}_1 &amp; \mathbf{v}_2 &amp; \dots &amp; \mathbf{v}_j \end{vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}_j = \frac{1}{D_{j-1} } \begin{vmatrix}
\langle \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle &amp; \dots &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle \\
\langle \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle &amp; \dots &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\langle \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_{j-1} \rangle &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_{j-1} \rangle &amp; \dots &amp;
\langle \mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_{j-1} \rangle \\
\mathbf{v}_1 &amp; \mathbf{v}_2 &amp; \dots &amp; \mathbf{v}_j \end{vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' &lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=1 and, for ''j'' ≥ 1, ''D &lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Gram determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt; D_j = \begin{vmatrix}
\langle \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle &amp; \dots &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_1 \rangle \\
\langle \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle &amp; \dots &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_2 \rangle \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\langle \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_j \rangle &amp; \langle \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_j\rangle &amp; \dots &amp;
\langle \mathbf{v}_j, \mathbf{v}_j \rangle \end{vmatrix}.  &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the expression for '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is a "formal" determinant, i.e. the matrix contains both scalars
and vectors; the meaning of this expression is defined to be the result of a [[Laplace expansion|cofactor expansion]] along
the row of vectors.

The determinant formula for the Gram-Schmidt is computationally slower (exponentially slower) than the recursive algorithms described above;
it is mainly of theoretical interest.

== Alternatives ==
Other orthogonalization algorithms use [[Householder transformation]]s or [[Givens rotation]]s. The algorithms using Householder transformations are more stable than the stabilized Gram–Schmidt process. On the other hand, the Gram–Schmidt process produces the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th orthogonalized vector after the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th iteration, while orthogonalization using [[Householder reflection]]s produces all the vectors only at the end. This makes only the Gram–Schmidt process applicable for [[iterative method]]s like the [[Arnoldi iteration]].

Yet another alternative is motivated by the use of [[Cholesky decomposition]] for [[Ordinary least squares|inverting the matrix of the normal equations in linear least squares]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[full rank|full column rank]] matrix, whose columns need to be orthogonalized. The matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}^{*} \mathbf{V} &lt;/math&gt; is [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] and [[Positive definite matrix|positive definite]], so it can be written as &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{V}^{*} \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{L} \mathbf{L}^{*}, &lt;/math&gt; using the [[Cholesky decomposition]]. The lower triangular matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} &lt;/math&gt; with strictly positive diagonal entries is [[invertible]]. Then columns of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}= \mathbf{V}(\mathbf{L}^{-1})^{*}&lt;/math&gt; are [[orthonormal]] and [[linear span|span]] the same subspace as the columns of the original matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt;. The explicit use of the product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}^{*} \mathbf{V} &lt;/math&gt; makes the algorithm unstable, especially if the product's [[condition number]] is large. Nevertheless, this algorithm is used in practice and implemented in some software packages because of its high efficiency and simplicity.

In [[quantum mechanics]] there are several orthogonalization schemes with characteristics better suited for certain applications than original Gram–Schmidt. Nevertheless, it remains a popular and effective algorithm for even the largest electronic structure calculations.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4534">In [[mathematics]], specifically [[number theory]], '''Granville numbers''' are an extension of the [[perfect number]]s.

==The Granville set==
In 1996, [[Andrew Granville]] proposed the following construction of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="De Koninck (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=De Koninck J-M, Ivić A|title=On a Sum of Divisors Problem|journal=Publications de l'Institut mathématique|year=1996|volume=64|issue=78|pages=9–20|url=http://www.emis.de/journals/PIMB/078/n078p009.pdf|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Let &lt;math&gt;1\in\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;n\in{\mathbb{N}},\;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;n\in{\mathcal{S}}&lt;/math&gt; if:
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d\mid{n},\; d&lt;n,\; d\in\mathcal{S}}d\leq{n}&lt;/math&gt;

A Granville number is an [[element (mathematics)|element]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; for which equality holds i.e. it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors that are also in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. Granville numbers are also called &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-perfect numbers.&lt;ref name="De Koninck 2009"&gt;{{Cite book

  | publisher = AMS Bookstore
  | year = 2009
  | page = 40
  | isbn = 0-8218-4807-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==General properties==

The elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; can be {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;}}-deficient, {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;}}-perfect, or {{math|&lt;var&gt;k&lt;/var&gt;}}-abundant. In particular, [[perfect number|2-perfect numbers]] are a proper subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="De Koninck (1998)" /&gt;

===S-deficient numbers===

Numbers that fulfill the strict form of the inequality in the above definition are known as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-deficient numbers. That is, the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-deficient numbers are the natural numbers for that the sum of their divisors in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is strictly less than themselves:

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d\mid{n},\; d&lt;n,\; d\in\mathcal{S}}d &lt; {n}&lt;/math&gt;

===S-perfect numbers===

Numbers that fulfill equality in the above definition are known as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-perfect numbers.&lt;ref name="De Koninck (1998)" /&gt; That is, the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-perfect numbers are the natural numbers that are equal the sum of their divisors in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. The first few &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-perfect numbers are:

:6, 24, 28, 96, 126, 224, 384, 496, 1536, 1792, 6144, 8128, 14336, ... {{OEIS|A118372}}

Every [[perfect number]] is also &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-perfect.&lt;ref name="De Koninck (1998)" /&gt; However, there are numbers such as 24 which are &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-perfect but not perfect. The only known &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-perfect number with three distinct prime factors is 126 = 2 · 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · 7 .&lt;ref name="De Koninck 2009" /&gt;

===S-abundant numbers===

Numbers that violate the inequality in the above definition are known as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-abundant numbers. That is, the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-abundant numbers are the natural numbers for which the sum of their divisors in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is strictly greater than themselves:

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d\mid{n},\; d&lt;n,\; d\in\mathcal{S}}d &gt; {n}&lt;/math&gt;

They belong to the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. The first few &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-abundant numbers are:

:12, 18, 20, 30, 42, 48, 56, 66, 70, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 102, 104, ... {{OEIS|A181487}}

==Examples==
Every [[deficient number]] and every [[perfect number]] is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; because the restriction of the divisors sum to members of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; either decreases the divisors sum or leaves it unchanged. The first natural number that is not in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest [[abundant number]], which is 12. The next two abundant numbers, 18 and 20, are also not in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. However, the fourth abundant number, 24, is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; because the sum of its proper divisors in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is:

:1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 24

In other words, 24 is abundant but not &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-abundant because 12 is not in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, 24 is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-perfect - it is the smallest number that is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;-perfect but not perfect.

The smallest odd abundant number that is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is 2835, and the smallest pair of consecutive numbers that are not in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; are 5984 and 5985.&lt;ref name="De Koninck (1998)" /&gt;

'''Graph matching''' is the problem of finding a similarity between [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s.&lt;ref name=endikaCh2&gt;Endika Bengoetxea, [http://www.sc.ehu.es/acwbecae/ikerkuntza/these/ "Inexact Graph Matching Using Estimation of Distribution Algorithms"], Ph.
 D., 2002, [http://www.sc.ehu.es/acwbecae/ikerkuntza/these/Ch2.pdf Chapter 2:The graph matching problem] (retrieved June 28, 2017) &lt;/ref&gt;

Graphs are commonly used to encode structural information in many fields, including [[computer vision]] and [[pattern recognition]], and graph matching is an important tool in these areas. &lt;ref name=endikaAbstract&gt;Endika Bengoetxea, Ph.D., [http://www.sc.ehu.es/acwbecae/ikerkuntza/these/ Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; In these areas it is commonly assumed that the comparison is between the ''data graph'' and the ''model graph''.

The case of '''exact graph matching''' is known as the [[graph isomorphism problem]].&lt;ref name=endikaCh2/&gt; The problem of exact matching of a graph to a part of another graph is called [[subgraph isomorphism problem]]. 

The '''inexact graph matching''' refers to matching problems when exact matching is impossible, e.g., when the number of vertices in the two graphs are different. In this case it is required to find the best possible match. For example, in [[image recognition]] applications, the results of [[image segmentation]] in [[image processing]] typically produces data graphs with the numbers of vertices much larger than in the model graphs data expected to match against. In the case of [[attributed graph]]s, even if the numbers of vertices and edges are the same, the matching still may be only inexact. &lt;ref name=endikaCh2/&gt;

Two categories of search methods are the ones based on identification of possible and impossible pairings of vertices between the two graphs and methods which formulate graph matching as an [[optimization problem]].&lt;ref&gt;''Graph-Based Methods in Computer Vision: Developments and Applications'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=V66eBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58 p. 58]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graph edit distance]] is one of [[similarity measure]]s suggested for graph matching.&lt;ref&gt;''Bridging the Gap Between Graph Edit Distance and Kernel Machines'',  [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSthDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= hbxj&gt;Horst Bunke, Xiaoyi Jang, "Graph Matching and Similarity", in: ''Intelligent Systems and Interfaces'', pp. 281-304 (2000) {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4615-4401-2_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A class of algorithms if called error-tolerant graph matching.&lt;ref name= hbxj/&gt;

[[Image:HarmonicNumbers.svg|right|thumb|400px|The harmonic number &lt;math&gt;H_{n,1}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n=\lfloor{x}\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; (red line) with its asymptotic limit &lt;math&gt;\gamma+\ln(x)&lt;/math&gt; (blue line) where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]].]]

In [[mathematics]], the {{mvar|n}}-th '''harmonic number''' is the sum of the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of the first {{mvar|n}} [[natural number]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;H_n= 1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n} =\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Harmonic numbers are related to the [[harmonic mean]] in that the {{mvar|n}}-th harmonic number is also {{mvar|n}} times the reciprocal of the harmonic mean of the first {{mvar|n}} positive integers.

Harmonic numbers have been studied since antiquity and are important in various branches of [[number theory]]. They are sometimes loosely termed [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], are closely related to the [[Riemann zeta function]], and appear in the expressions of various [[special function]]s.

The harmonic numbers roughly approximate the [[natural logarithm|natural logarithm function]]&lt;ref name=ConwayGuy/&gt;{{rp|143}} and thus the associated [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] grows without limit, albeit slowly. In 1737, [[Leonhard Euler]] used the [[Divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes|divergence of the harmonic series]] to provide a new proof of the [[Euclid's theorem|infinity of prime numbers]]. His work was extended into the [[complex plane]] by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1859, leading directly to the celebrated [[Riemann hypothesis]] about the [[Prime number theorem|distribution of prime numbers]].

When the value of a large quantity of items has a [[Zipf's law]] distribution, the total value of the {{mvar|n}} most-valuable items is proportional to the {{mvar|n}}-th harmonic number. This leads to a variety of surprising conclusions regarding the [[long tail]] and [[Andrew Odlyzko#Network value|the theory of network value]].

[[Bertrand's postulate]] entails that, except for the case {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, the harmonic numbers are never integers.&lt;ref name = 'ConcreteMath'&gt;{{Cite book

==Identities involving harmonic numbers==
By definition, the harmonic numbers satisfy the [[recurrence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;H_n = H_{n-1} + \frac{1}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The harmonic numbers are connected to the [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]]:
: &lt;math&gt; H_n = \frac{1}{n!}\left[{n+1 \atop 2}\right]. &lt;/math&gt;

The functions
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(x)=\frac{x^n}{n!}(\log x-H_n)&lt;/math&gt;
satisfy the property
:&lt;math&gt;f_n'(x)=f_{n-1}(x).&lt;/math&gt;
In particular
:&lt;math&gt; f_1(x)=x(\log x-1)&lt;/math&gt;
is an integral of the logarithmic function.

The harmonic numbers satisfy the series identity
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n H_k = (n+1)[H_{n+1} - 1].&lt;/math&gt;

===Identities involving π===

There are several infinite summations involving harmonic numbers and powers of [[π]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sondow, Jonathan and Weisstein, Eric W. "Harmonic Number." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarmonicNumber.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{H_n}{n\cdot 2^n}=\frac{1}{12}\pi ^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{H_n^2}{(n+1)^2}=\frac{11}{360}\pi^4&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{H_n^2}{n^2}=\frac{17}{360}\pi^4&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{H_n}{n^3}=\frac{1}{72}\pi^4&lt;/math&gt;

==Calculation==
An integral representation given by [[Euler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=How Euler Did It|series=MAA Spectrum|first=C. Edward|last=Sandifer|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|year=2007|isbn=9780883855638|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sohHs7ExOsYC&amp;pg=PA206}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; H_n = \int_0^1 \frac{1 - x^n}{1 - x}\,dx. &lt;/math&gt;

The equality above is straightforward by the simple algebraic identity

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1-x^n}{1-x}=1+x+\cdots +x^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the substitution ''x'' = 1−''u'', another expression for ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_n &amp;= \int_0^1 \frac{1 - x^n}{1 - x}\,dx \\
&amp;= \int_0^1\frac{1-(1-u)^n}{u}\,du \\
&amp;= \int_0^1\left[-\sum_{k=1}^n(-1)^{k}\binom nk u^{k-1}\right]\,du \\
&amp;= -\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k}\binom nk \int_0^1u^{k-1}\,du \\
&amp;= -\sum_{k=1}^n(-1)^{k}\frac{1}{k}\binom nk .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


A closed form expression for ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_n &amp;= G_n-(n+1)\left\lfloor\frac{G_n}{n+1}\right\rfloor
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G_n &amp;= \frac{{{n+(n+1)!}\choose{n}}-1}{(n+1)!}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


[[File:Integral Test.svg|thumb|Graph demonstrating a connection between harmonic numbers and the [[natural logarithm]]. The harmonic number ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be interpreted as a [[Riemann sum]] of the integral: &lt;math&gt;\int_1^{n+1} \frac{dx}{x} = \ln(n+1).&lt;/math&gt;]]
The ''n''th harmonic number is about as large as the [[natural logarithm]] of ''n''. The reason is that the sum is approximated by the [[integral]]

: &lt;math&gt;\int_1^n {1 \over x}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

whose value is [[natural logarithm|ln]](''n'').

The values of the sequence ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; - ln(''n'') decrease monotonically towards the [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(H_n - \ln n\right) = \gamma,&lt;/math&gt;

where γ ≈ 0.5772156649 is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]]. The corresponding [[asymptotic expansion]] as {{math|''n'' → +∞}} is

:&lt;math&gt;H_n \sim \ln{n}+\gamma+\frac{1}{2n}-\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{B_{2k}}{2k n^{2k}}=\ln{n}+\gamma+\frac{1}{2n}-\frac{1}{12n^2}+\frac{1}{120n^4}-\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;B_k&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Bernoulli numbers]].

==Generating functions==
A [[generating function]] for the harmonic numbers is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty z^n H_n = \frac {-\ln(1-z)}{1-z},&lt;/math&gt;

where ln(''z'') is the [[natural logarithm]]. An exponential generating function is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac {z^n}{n!} H_n = -e^z \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k} \frac {(-z)^k}{k!} = e^z \mbox {Ein}(z)&lt;/math&gt;

where Ein(''z'') is the entire [[exponential integral]]. Note that

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox {Ein}(z) = \mbox{E}_1(z) + \gamma + \ln z = \Gamma (0,z) + \gamma + \ln z&lt;/math&gt;

where Γ(0, ''z'') is the [[incomplete gamma function]].

== Arithmetic properties ==
The harmonic numbers have several interesting arithmetic properties. It is well-known that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer [[if and only if]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, a result often attributed to Taeisinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC|year=2003|isbn=1-58488-347-2|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=3115|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, using [[P-adic order|2-adic valuation]], it is not difficult to prove that for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt; the numerator of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; is an odd number while the denominator of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; is an even number. More precisely,

:&lt;math&gt;H_n=\frac{1}{2^{\lfloor\log_2(n)\rfloor}}\frac{a_n}{b_n}&lt;/math&gt;

with some odd integers &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;b_n&lt;/math&gt;.

As a consequence of [[Wolstenholme's theorem]], for any prime number &lt;math&gt;p \ge 5&lt;/math&gt; the numerator of &lt;math&gt;H_{p-1}&lt;/math&gt;is divisible by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, Eisenstein&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenstein|first=Ferdinand Gotthold Max|year=1850|title=Eine neue Gattung zahlentheoretischer Funktionen, welche von zwei Elementen ahhängen und durch gewisse lineare Funktional-Gleichungen definirt werden|url=|journal=Berichte Königl. Preuβ. Akad. Wiss. Berlin|volume=15|pages=36–42|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that for all odd prime number &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; it holds &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;H_{(p-1)/2} \equiv -2q_p(2) \pmod p&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q_p(2) = (2^{p-1}  -1)/p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Fermat quotient]], with the consequence that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; divides the numerator of &lt;math&gt;H_{(p-1)/2}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Wieferich prime]].

In 1991, Eswarathasan and Levine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eswarathasan|first=Arulappah|last2=Levine|first2=Eugene|year=1991|title=p-integral harmonic sums|url=|journal=Discrete Mathematics|volume=91|pages=249–257|doi=10.1016/0012-365X(90)90234-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined &lt;math&gt;J(p)&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all positive integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the numerator of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by a prime number &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. They proved that &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\{p-1,p^2-p,p^2-1\}\subseteq J(p)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;for all prime numbers &lt;math&gt;p \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;, and they called ''harmonic'' ''primes'' the primes &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;J(p)&lt;/math&gt; has exactly 3 elements.

Eswarathasan and Levine also conjectured that &lt;math&gt;J(p)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Finite set|finite]] set all primes number &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and that there are infinitely many harmonic primes. Boyd&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=David W.|year=1994|title=A p-adic study of the partial sums of the harmonic series|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.em/1048515811|journal=Experimental Mathematics|volume=3|pages=287–302|via=|doi=10.1080/10586458.1994.10504298}}&lt;/ref&gt; verified that &lt;math&gt;J(p)&lt;/math&gt; is finite for all prime numbers up to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p = 547&lt;/math&gt;, but 83, 127, and 397; and he gave an heuristic suggesting that the [[Natural density|relatively density]] of the harmonic primes in the set of all primes should be &lt;math&gt;1/e&lt;/math&gt;. Sanna&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanna|first=Carlo|year=2016|title=On the p-adic valuation of harmonic numbers|url=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnt.2016.02.020|journal=Journal of Number Theory|volume=166|pages=41–46|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jnt.2016.02.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that &lt;math&gt;J_p&lt;/math&gt; has zero [[Natural density|asymptotic density]], while Bing-Ling Wu and Yong-Gao Chen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yong-Gao|last2=Wu|first2=Bing-Ling|year=2017|title=On certain properties of harmonic numbers|url=http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnt.2016.11.027|journal=Journal of Number Theory|volume=175|pages=66–86|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jnt.2016.11.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that the number of elements of &lt;math&gt;J_p&lt;/math&gt; not exceeding &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;3x^{\frac{2}{3}+\frac1{25 \log p}}&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;x \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
The harmonic numbers appear in several calculation formulas, such as the [[digamma function]]

: &lt;math&gt; \psi(n) = H_{n-1} - \gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

This relation is also frequently used to define the extension of the harmonic numbers to non-integer ''n''. The harmonic numbers are also frequently used to define γ using the limit introduced earlier:

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}{\left(H_n - \ln(n)\right)}, &lt;/math&gt;

although

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \lim_{n \to \infty}{\left(H_n - \ln\left(n+{1 \over 2}\right)\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

converges more quickly.

In 2002, [[Jeffrey Lagarias]] proved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeffrey Lagarias |title=An Elementary Problem Equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis |journal=Amer. Math. Monthly |volume=109 |year=2002 |pages=534–543 |arxiv=math.NT/0008177 |doi=10.2307/2695443}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is equivalent to the statement that

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(n) \le H_n + \ln(H_n)e^{H_n},&lt;/math&gt;

is true for every [[integer]] {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} with strict inequality if {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}; here σ(''n'') denotes the [[divisor function|sum of the divisors]] of ''n''.

The eigenvalues of the nonlocal problem

: &lt;math&gt; \lambda \phi(x) = \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{\phi(x)-\phi(y)}{|x-y|} dy &lt;/math&gt;

are given by &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 2H_n&lt;/math&gt;, where by convention, &lt;math&gt;H_0 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Generalized harmonic numbers===
The '''generalized harmonic number''' of order ''m'' of ''n'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;H_{n,m}=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k^m}.&lt;/math&gt;

The limit as ''n'' tends to infinity is finite if {{math|''m'' &gt; 1}}.

Other notations occasionally used include

:&lt;math&gt;H_{n,m}= H_n^{(m)} = H_m(n).&lt;/math&gt;

The special case of ''m'' = 0 gives &lt;math&gt;H_{n,0}= n&lt;/math&gt;

The special case of ''m'' = 1 is simply called a harmonic number and is frequently written without the ''m'', as

:&lt;math&gt;H_n= \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The smallest natural number ''k'' such that ''k&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' does not divide the denominator of generalized harmonic number ''H''(''k'', ''n'') nor the denominator of alternating generalized harmonic number ''H′''(''k'', ''n'') is, for ''n''=1, 2, ... :
:77, 20, 94556602, 42, 444, 20, 104, 42, 76, 20, 77, 110, 3504, 20, 903, 42, 1107, 20, 104, 42, 77, 20, 2948, 110, 136, 20, 76, 42, 903, 20, 77, 42, 268, 20, 7004, 110, 1752, 20, 19203, 42, 77, 20, 104, 42, 76, 20, 370, 110, 1107, 20, ... {{OEIS|id=A128670}}

In the limit as {{math|''n'' → ∞}} for {{math|''m'' &gt; 1}}, the generalized harmonic number converges to the [[Riemann zeta function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} H_{n,m} = \zeta(m).&lt;/math&gt;

The related sum &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^m&lt;/math&gt; occurs in the study of [[Bernoulli number]]s; the harmonic numbers also appear in the study of [[Stirling number]]s.

Some integrals of generalized harmonic numbers are

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^a H_{x,2} \, dx = a \frac {\pi^2}{6}-H_{a}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^a H_{x,3} \, dx = a A - \frac {1}{2} H_{a,2},&lt;/math&gt; where ''A'' is [[Apéry's constant]], i.e. ''ζ''(3).

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n H_{k,m}=(n+1)H_{n,m}- H_{n,m-1}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for &lt;math&gt;m \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Every generalized harmonic number of order m can be written as a function of harmonic of order m-1 using:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{n,m} = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac {H_{k,m-1}}{k(k+1)} + \frac {H_{n,m-1}}{n} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; for example: &lt;math&gt;H_{4,3} = \frac {H_{1,2}}{1 \cdot 2} + \frac {H_{2,2}}{2 \cdot 3} + \frac {H_{3,2}}{3 \cdot 4} + \frac {H_{4,2}}{4} &lt;/math&gt;

A [[generating function]] for the generalized harmonic numbers is

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty z^n H_{n,m} = \frac {\mathrm{Li}_m(z)}{1-z},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_m(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polylogarithm]], and {{math|{{mabs|''z''}} &lt; 1}}. The generating function given above for {{math|1=''m'' = 1}} is a special case of this formula.

A '''fractional argument for generalized harmonic numbers''' can be introduced as follows:

For every &lt;math&gt;p,q&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; integer, and &lt;math&gt;m&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; integer or not, we have from polygamma functions:
:&lt;math&gt;H_{q/p,m}=\zeta(m)-p^m\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(q+pk)^m}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta(m)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann zeta function]]. The relevant recurrence relation is:
:&lt;math&gt;H_{a,m}=H_{a-1,m}+\frac{1}{a^m}&lt;/math&gt;
Some special values are:
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\frac{1}{4},2}=16-8G-\tfrac{5}{6}\pi^2&lt;/math&gt; where G is [[Catalan's constant]]
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\frac{1}{2},2}=4-\tfrac{\pi^2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\frac{3}{4},2}=8G+\tfrac{16}{9}-\tfrac{5}{6}\pi^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\frac{1}{4},3}=64-27\zeta(3)-\pi^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\frac{1}{2},3}=8-6\zeta(3)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\frac{3}{4},3}={(\tfrac{4}{3})}^3-27\zeta(3)+\pi^3&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiplication formulas===
The [[multiplication theorem]] applies to harmonic numbers. Using [[polygamma]] functions, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;H_{2x}=\frac{1}{2}\left(H_{x}+H_{x-\frac{1}{2}}\right)+\ln{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{3x}=\frac{1}{3}\left(H_{x}+H_{x-\frac{1}{3}}+H_{x-\frac{2}{3}}\right)+\ln{3},&lt;/math&gt;

or, more generally,

:&lt;math&gt;H_{nx}=\frac{1}{n}\left(H_{x}+H_{x-\frac{1}{n}}+H_{x-\frac{2}{n}}+\cdots +H_{x-\frac{n-1}{n}}\right)+\ln{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

For generalized harmonic numbers, we have

:&lt;math&gt;H_{2x,2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\zeta(2)+\frac{1}{2}\left(H_{x,2}+H_{x-\frac{1}{2},2}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{3x,2}=\frac{1}{9}\left(6\zeta(2)+H_{x,2}+H_{x-\frac{1}{3},2}+H_{x-\frac{2}{3},2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann zeta function]].

===Hyperharmonic numbers===

The next generalization was discussed by [[John Horton Conway|J. H. Conway]] and [[Richard K. Guy|R. K. Guy]] in their 1995 book ''[[The Book of Numbers (maths)|The Book of Numbers]]''.&lt;ref name=ConwayGuy/&gt;{{rp|258}} Let

: &lt;math&gt; H_n^{(0)} = \frac1n. &lt;/math&gt;

Then the nth [[hyperharmonic number]] of order ''r'' (''r&gt;0'') is defined recursively as

: &lt;math&gt; H_n^{(r)} = \sum_{k=1}^n H_k^{(r-1)}. &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, &lt;math&gt;H_n^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is the ordinary harmonic number &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Harmonic numbers for real and complex values==
The formulae given above,
:&lt;math&gt;H_x = \int_0^1 \frac{1-t^x}{1-t} \, dt= -\sum_{k=1}^\infty {x \choose k} \frac{(-1)^k}{k}&lt;/math&gt;
are an integral and a series representation for a function that interpolates the harmonic numbers and, via [[analytic continuation]], extends the definition to the complex plane other than the negative integers ''x''. The interpolating function is in fact closely related to the [[digamma function]]

:&lt;math&gt;H_x = \psi(x+1)+\gamma,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} is the digamma, and {{math|''γ''}} is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The integration process may be repeated to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;H_{x,2}=-\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac {(-1)^k}{k} {x \choose k} H_k.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Taylor series]] for the harmonic numbers is
:&lt;math&gt;H_x=\sum_{k=2}^\infty (-1)^{k}\zeta (k)\;x^{k-1}\quad\text{ for } |x| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
which comes from the Taylor series for the digamma function.

=== Alternative, asymptotic formulation ===
When seeking to approximate {{math|''H''{{sub|''x''}}}} for a complex number {{math|''x''}} it turns out that it is effective to first compute {{math|''H''{{sub|''m''}}}} for some large integer {{math|''m''}}, then use that to approximate a value for {{math|''H''{{sub|''m''+''x''}}}}, and then use the recursion relation {{math|1=''H''{{sub|''n''}} = ''H''{{sub|''n''−1}} + 1/''n''}} backwards {{math|''m''}} times, to unwind it to an approximation for {{math|''H''{{sub|''x''}}}}.  Furthermore, this approximation is exact in the limit as {{math|''m''}} goes to infinity.

Specifically, for every integer {{math|''n''}}, we have that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \left[H_m - H_{m+n}\right] = 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;
and we can ask that the formula be obeyed if the arbitrary integer {{math|''n''}} is replaced by an arbitrary complex number {{math|''x''}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \left[H_m - H_{m+x}\right] = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;
Adding {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to both sides gives
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}H_x &amp;= \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \left[H_m - (H_{m+x}-H_x)\right] \\
&amp;= \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \left[\left(\sum_{k=1}^m \frac{1}{k}\right) - \left(\sum_{k=1}^m \frac{1}{x+k}\right) \right] \\
&amp;= \lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^m \left(\frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{x+k}\right) = x \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k(x+k)}\, .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This last expression for {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is well defined for any complex number {{math|''x''}} except the negative integers, which fail because trying to use the recursion relation {{math|1=''H''{{sub|''n''}} = ''H''{{sub|''n''−1}} + 1/''n''}} backwards through the value {{math|1=''n'' = 0}} involves a division by zero. By construction, the function {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the unique function of {{math|''x''}} for which (1) {{math|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, (2) {{math|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''x''−1&lt;/sub&gt; + 1/''x''}} for all complex values {{math|''x''}} except the non-positive integers, and (3) {{math|1=lim&lt;sub&gt;''m''→+∞&lt;/sub&gt; (''H''&lt;sub&gt;''m''+''x''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0}} for all complex values {{math|''x''}}.

Based on this last formula, it can be shown that:
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1H_{x}\,dx = \gamma\,, &lt;/math&gt;
where γ is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]] or, more generally, for every ''n'' we have:
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^nH_{x}\,dx = n\gamma+\ln{(n!)}\, .&lt;/math&gt;

===Special values for fractional arguments===
There are the following special analytic values for fractional arguments between 0 and 1, given by the integral

:&lt;math&gt;H_\alpha = \int_0^1\frac{1-x^\alpha}{1-x}\,dx\, .&lt;/math&gt;

More values may be generated from the recurrence relation

:&lt;math&gt; H_\alpha = H_{\alpha-1}+\frac{1}{\alpha}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

or from the reflection relation

:&lt;math&gt; H_{1-\alpha}-H_\alpha = \pi\cot{(\pi\alpha)}-\frac{1}{\alpha}+\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\, .&lt;/math&gt;

For example:

: &lt;math&gt; H_{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 -2\ln{2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; H_{\frac{1}{3}} = 3-\tfrac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}} -\tfrac{3}{2}\ln{3}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; H_{\frac{2}{3}} = \tfrac{3}{2}(1-\ln{3})+\sqrt{3}\tfrac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; H_{\frac{1}{4}} = 4-\tfrac{\pi}{2} - 3\ln{2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; H_{\frac{3}{4}} = \tfrac{4}{3}-3\ln{2}+\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; H_{\frac{1}{6}} = 6-\tfrac{\pi}{2} \sqrt{3} -2\ln{2} -\tfrac{3}{2} \ln{3}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; H_{\frac{1}{8}} = 8-\tfrac{\pi}{2} - 4\ln{2} - \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left\{\pi + \ln\left(2 + \sqrt{2}\right) - \ln\left(2 - \sqrt{2}\right)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; H_{\frac{1}{12}} = 12-3\left(\ln{2}+\tfrac{\ln{3}}{2}\right)-\pi\left(1+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)+2\sqrt{3}\ln \left (\sqrt{2-\sqrt{3}} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

For positive integers ''p'' and ''q'' with ''p'' &lt; ''q'', we have:
: &lt;math&gt; H_{\frac{p}{q}} = \frac{q}{p} +2\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor\frac{q-1}{2}\rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi pk}{q}\right)\ln\left({\sin \left(\frac{\pi k}{q}\right)}\right)-\frac{\pi}{2}\cot\left(\frac{\pi p}{q}\right)-\ln\left(2q\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation to the Riemann zeta function===
Some derivatives of fractional harmonic numbers are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^n H_x}{dx^n} = (-1)^{n+1}n!\left[\zeta(n+1)-H_{x,n+1}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^n H_{x,2}}{dx^n} = (-1)^{n+1}(n+1)!\left[\zeta(n+2)-H_{x,n+2}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^n H_{x,3}}{dx^n} = (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{2}(n+2)!\left[\zeta(n+3)-H_{x,n+3}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

And using [[Taylor series|Maclaurin series]], we have for ''x'' &lt; 1:

:&lt;math&gt;H_x = \sum_{n=1}^{\infin}(-1)^{n+1}x^n\zeta(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{x,2} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infin}(-1)^{n+1}(n+1)x^n\zeta(n+2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{x,3} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infin}(-1)^{n+1}(n+1)(n+2)x^n\zeta(n+3).&lt;/math&gt;

For fractional arguments between 0 and 1, and for ''a'' &gt; 1:

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\frac{1}{a}} = \frac{1}{a}\left(\zeta(2)-\frac{1}{a}\zeta(3)+\frac{1}{a^2}\zeta(4)-\frac{1}{a^3}\zeta(5)+\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\frac{1}{a}, 2} = \frac{1}{a}\left(2\zeta(3)-\frac{3}{a}\zeta(4)+\frac{4}{a^2}\zeta(5)-\frac{5}{a^3}\zeta(6)+\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\frac{1}{a}, 3} = \frac{1}{2a}\left(2\cdot3\zeta(4)-\frac{3\cdot4}{a}\zeta(5)+\frac{4\cdot5}{a^2}\zeta(6)-\frac{5\cdot6}{a^3}\zeta(7)+\cdots\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The '''history of mathematical notation'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Cajori]]. A History of Mathematical Notations: Two Volumes in One. Cosimo, Inc., Dec 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; includes the commencement, progress, and [[cultural diffusion]] of [[mathematical symbol]]s and the conflict of the methods of notation confronted in a notation's move to popularity or inconspicuousness. [[Mathematical notation]]&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Science, Literature, &amp; Art, Volume 2. Edited by [[William Thomas Brande]], [[George William Cox]]. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=J5tPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA683 683]&lt;/ref&gt; comprises the [[symbol]]s used to write mathematical [[equation]]s and [[formula]]s. Notation generally implies a set of [[well-defined]] representations of quantities and symbols operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Notation.html |title=Notation - from Wolfram MathWorld |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history includes [[Hindu–Arabic numerals]], letters from the [[Roman alphabet|Roman]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[German alphabet|German]] [[alphabet]]s, and a host of symbols invented by mathematicians over the past several centuries.

The development of mathematical notation can be divided in stages.&lt;ref&gt;Diophantos of Alexandria: A Study in the History of Greek Algebra. By Sir Thomas Little Heath. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=ABkPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 77].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics: Its Power and Utility. By Karl J. Smith. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=-0x2JszrkooC&amp;pg=PA86 86].&lt;/ref&gt; The "''[[rhetorical]]''" stage is where calculations are performed by words and no symbols are used.&lt;ref&gt;The Commercial Revolution and the Beginnings of Western Mathematics in Renaissance Florence, 1300–1500. Warren Van Egmond. 1976. Page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The "''[[syncopated]]''" stage is where frequently used operations and quantities are represented by symbolic [[syntax|syntactical]] abbreviations. From ancient times through the post-classical age,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Or the Middle Ages.&lt;/ref&gt; bursts of mathematical creativity were often followed by centuries of stagnation.  As the [[early modern age]] opened and the worldwide spread of knowledge began, written examples of mathematical developments came to light.  The "''symbolic''" stage is where comprehensive systems of notation supersede rhetoric. Beginning in Italy in the 16th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day. This symbolic system was in use by medieval Indian mathematicians and in Europe since the middle of the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Gandz]]. "The Sources of al-Khowarizmi's Algebra"&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued to develop in the [[contemporary era]].

The area of study known as the [[history of mathematics]] is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and, the focus here, the investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past.

==Rhetorical stage==
{{see also|Measurement}}
Although the history commences with that of the [[#Acrophonic and Milesian numeration|Ionian schools]], there is no doubt that those [[Ancient Greek]]s who paid attention to it were largely indebted to the previous investigations of the [[Ancient Egyptian]]s and [[Phoenicia|Ancient Phoenicians]]. Numerical notation's distinctive feature, i.e. symbols having local as well as intrinsic values ([[arithmetic]]), implies a state of [[civilization]] at the period of its invention. Our knowledge of the mathematical attainments of these early peoples, to which this section is devoted, is imperfect and the following brief notes be regarded as a summary of the conclusions which seem most probable, and the history of mathematics begins with the symbolic sections.

Many areas of mathematics began with the study of [[Applied mathematics|real world problems]], before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as [[abstract structure]]s. For example, geometry has its origins in the [[distance|calculation of distances]] and [[area]]s in the real world; algebra started with methods of solving problems in [[arithmetic]].

There can be no doubt that most early peoples which have left records knew something of [[numeration]] and [[mechanics]], and that a few were also acquainted with the elements of [[Surveying|land-surveying]]. In particular, the Egyptians paid attention to geometry and numbers, and the Phoenicians to practical arithmetic, [[book-keeping]], [[navigation]], and land-surveying. The [[Knowledge transfer|results attained by these people seem to have been accessible]], under certain conditions, to travelers. It is probable that the knowledge of the Egyptians and Phoenicians was largely the result of [[observation]] and [[measurement]], and represented the accumulated experience of many ages.

===Beginning of notation===
{{see also|Ancient history|History of writing ancient numbers|History of science in early cultures}}

Written mathematics began with numbers expressed as [[tally marks]], with each tally representing a single unit. The numerical symbols consisted probably of strokes or notches cut in wood or stone, and intelligible alike to all nations.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Such characters, in fact, are preserved with little alteration in the [[Roman notation]], an account of which may be found in [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]]'s Philosophy of Arithmetic.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one notch in a bone represented one animal, or person, or anything else. The peoples with whom the Greeks of Asia Minor (amongst whom notation in western history begins) were likely to have come into frequent contact were those inhabiting the eastern [[littoral]] of the Mediterranean: and Greek tradition uniformly assigned the special development of geometry to the Egyptians, and that of the [[number theory|science of numbers]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Number theory]] is branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the [[Integer|study of the integers]]. Number theorists study [[prime number]]s as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., [[rational number]]s) or defined as generalizations of the [[integer]]s (e.g., [[algebraic integer]]s).&lt;/ref&gt; either to the Egyptians or to the Phoenicians.

The [[Ancient Egyptians]] had a symbolic notation which was the [[numeration by Hieroglyphics]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Americana. By Thomas Gamaliel Bradford. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrRPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 314]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathematical Excursion, Enhanced Edition: Enhanced Webassign Edition By Richard N. Aufmann, Joanne Lockwood, Richard D. Nation, Daniel K. Cleg. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=GTgTnSGMukgC&amp;pg=PA186 186]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Egyptian mathematics]] had a symbol for one, ten, one-hundred, one-thousand, ten-thousand, one-hundred-thousand, and one-million.  Smaller digits were placed on the left of the number, as they are in Hindu–Arabic numerals.  Later, the Egyptians used [[hieratic]] instead of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic]] script to show numbers.  Hieratic was more like cursive and replaced several groups of symbols with individual ones.  For example, the four vertical lines used to represent four were replaced by a single horizontal line.  This is found in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (c. 2000–1800 BC) and the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] (c. 1890 BC).  The system the Egyptians used was discovered and modified by many other civilizations in the Mediterranean.  The Egyptians also had symbols for basic operations: legs going forward represented addition, and legs walking backward to represent subtraction.

The [[Mesopotamians]] had symbols for each power of ten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metu.edu.tr/~beyaz/303/presentations/egyptMesopotamia.pdf Mathematics in Egypt and Mesopotamia]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, they wrote their numbers in almost exactly the same way done in modern times.  Instead of having symbols for each power of ten, they would just put the [[coefficient]] of that number.  Each digit was at separated by only a space, but by the time of [[Alexander the Great]], they had created a symbol that represented zero and was a placeholder.  The Mesopotamians also used a [[sexagesimal]] system, that is base sixty.  It is this system that is used in modern times when measuring time and angles. Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. B. ''A History of Mathematics'', 2nd ed. rev. by [[Uta Merzbach|Uta C. Merzbach]]. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "Mesopotamia" p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Written in [[Cuneiform script]], tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework. The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient [[Sumer]]ians and the system of [[metrology]] from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems.

The majority of Mesopotamian clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics which include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Twin prime|pairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Aaboe | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | title = Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics | year = 1998 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | pages = 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving [[linear equation|linear]] and [[quadratic equation]]s. The Babylonian tablet [[YBC 7289]] gives an approximation of {{radic|2}} accurate to five decimal places. Babylonian mathematics were written using a [[sexagesimal]] (base-60) [[numeral system]]. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of minutes and seconds of arc to denote fractions of a degree. Babylonian advances in mathematics were facilitated by the fact that 60 has many divisors: the reciprocal of any integer which is a multiple of divisors of 60 has a finite expansion in base 60. (In decimal arithmetic, only reciprocals of multiples of 2 and 5 have finite decimal expansions.) Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the [[decimal]] system. They lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.

The history of mathematics cannot with certainty be traced back to any school or period before that of the Ionian Greeks, but the subsequent history may be divided into periods, the distinctions between which are tolerably well marked. Greek mathematics, which originated with the study of geometry, tended from its commencement to be deductive and scientific. Since the fourth century AD, [[Pythagoras]] has commonly been given credit for discovering the [[Pythagorean theorem]], a theorem in geometry that states that in a right-angled triangle the area of the square on the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient mathematical texts are available with the prior mentioned Ancient Egyptians notation and with [[Plimpton 322]] (Babylonian mathematics c. 1900 BC).  The study of mathematics as a subject in its own right begins in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], who coined the term "mathematics" from the ancient Greek ''μάθημα'' (''mathema''), meaning "subject of instruction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heath|title=A Manual of Greek Mathematics|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]]'s influence has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences. He helped to distinguish between [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]] by widening the gap between "arithmetic", now called [[number theory]] and "logistic", now called [[arithmetic]]. [[Greek mathematics]] greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and [[mathematical rigor]] in [[mathematical proof|proofs]]) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas L. Heath, ''A Manual of Greek Mathematics'', Dover, 1963, p. 1: "In the case of mathematics, it is the Greek contribution which it is most essential to know, for it was the Greeks who made mathematics a science."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] is credited with what later would be called the [[law of excluded middle]].

In the historical development of geometry, the steps in the abstraction of geometry were made by the ancient Greeks.

[[Euclid's lemma|Euclid's first theorem]] is a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] that possesses properties of [[prime number]]s. The influential thirteen books cover Euclidean geometry, geometric algebra, and the ancient Greek version of algebraic systems and elementary number theory. It was ubiquitous in the [[Quadrivium]] and is instrumental in the development of logic, mathematics, and science.

[[Diophantus of Alexandria]] was author of a series of books called ''[[Arithmetica]]'',  many of which are now lost. These texts deal with solving [[algebraic equation]]s. [[Boethius]] provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term ''quadrivium'' to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote ''De institutione arithmetica'', a free translation from the Greek of [[Nicomachus]]'s ''Introduction to Arithmetic''; ''De institutione musica'', also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from Euclid's ''Elements''. His works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, John (1981) "The ''De Institutione Arithmetica'' and the ''De Institutione Musica''", pp. 135–54 in Margaret Gibson, ed., ''Boethius: His Life, Thought, and Influence'', (Oxford: Basil Blackwell).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folkerts, Menso, ''"Boethius" Geometrie II'', (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acrophonic and Milesian numeration===

The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] employed [[Attic numeration]],&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics and Measurement By Oswald Ashton Wentworth Dilk. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=AKJZvXOS7n4C&amp;pg=PA14 14]&lt;/ref&gt; which was based on the system of the Egyptians and was later adapted and used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. [[Greek numerals]] one through four were vertical lines, as in the hieroglyphics. The symbol for five was the Greek letter Π (pi), which is the letter of the Greek word for five, ''pente''. Numbers six through nine were ''pente'' with vertical lines next to it. Ten was represented by the letter (Δ) of the word for ten, ''deka'', one hundred by the letter from the word for hundred, etc.

The [[Ionian numeration]] used their entire alphabet including three archaic letters. The numeral notation of the Greeks, though far less convenient than that now in use, was formed on a perfectly regular and scientific plan,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;A dictionary of science, literature and art, ed. by W.T. Brande. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=yo4DAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA683 683]&lt;/ref&gt; and could be used with tolerable effect as an instrument of calculation, to which purpose the Roman system was totally inapplicable. The Greeks divided the twenty-four letters of their alphabet into three classes, and, by adding another symbol to each class, they had characters to represent the units, tens, and hundreds. ([[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]]'s Astronomie Ancienne, t. ii.)

This system appeared in the third century BC, before the letters digamma (Ϝ), koppa (Ϟ), and sampi (Ϡ) became obsolete. When lowercase letters became differentiated from upper case letters, the lower case letters were used as the symbols for notation. Multiples of one thousand were written as the nine numbers with a stroke in front of them: thus one thousand was ",α", two-thousand was ",β", etc. M (for μὐριοι, as in "myriad") was used to multiply numbers by ten thousand. For example, the number 88,888,888 would be written as M,ηωπη*ηωπη&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;Boyer, Carl B. ''A History of Mathematics'', 2nd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mathematical reasoning was almost entirely [[geometry|geometric]] (albeit often used to reason about non-geometric subjects such as [[number theory]]), and hence the Greeks had no interest in [[algebra]]ic symbols.

===Chinese mathematical notation===
{{Main|Suzhou numerals}}
{{see also|Chinese numerals}}
[[File:Huama numerals.svg|thumb|The numbers 0–9 in Chinese huāmǎ (花碼) numerals]]
The Chinese used numerals that look much like the tally system.&lt;ref&gt;The American Mathematical Monthly, Volume 16. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=JggPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA131 131]&lt;/ref&gt;  Numbers one through four were horizontal lines.  Five was an X between two horizontal lines; it looked almost exactly the same as the [[Roman numeral]] for ten. Nowadays, the [[Numerals in Unicode#CJK Suzhou (huāmǎ) numerals|huāmǎ system]] is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.

In the history of the Chinese, there were those who were familiar with the sciences of arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, optics, navigation, and astronomy. [[Mathematics in China]] emerged independently by the 11th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Chinese_overview.html |title=Overview of Chinese mathematics |publisher=Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost certain that the Chinese were acquainted with several geometrical or rather architectural implements;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;such as the [[Ruler|rule]], [[Try square|square]], [[compasses]], [[spirit level|water level]] ([[reed level]]), and [[plumb-bob]].&lt;/ref&gt; with mechanical machines;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;such as the [[wheel]] and [[axle]]&lt;/ref&gt; that they knew of the characteristic property of the magnetic needle; and were aware that astronomical events occurred in cycles. Chinese of that time had made attempts to classify or extend the rules of arithmetic or geometry which they knew, and to explain the causes of the phenomena with which they were acquainted beforehand. The Chinese independently developed very large and [[negative number]]s, [[decimal]]s, a place value decimal system, a [[Binary numeral system|binary system]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[trigonometry]].

[[File:Chounumerals.svg|thumb|Counting rod numerals]]
[[Counting rods|Chinese mathematics]] made early contributions, including a [[place value system]].&lt;ref&gt;George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991, pp.140—148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, ''Universalgeschichte der Zahlen'', Campus, Frankfurt/New York, 1986, pp.428—437&lt;/ref&gt;  The geometrical theorem known to the ancient Chinese were acquainted was applicable in certain cases (namely the ratio of sides).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The area of the square described on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares described on the sides&lt;/ref&gt; It is that geometrical theorems which can be demonstrated in the quasi-experimental way of superposition were also known to them. In arithmetic their knowledge seems to have been confined to the art of calculation by means of the [[swan-pan]], and the power of expressing the results in writing. Our knowledge of the early attainments of the Chinese, slight though it is, is more complete than in the case of most of their contemporaries. It is thus instructive, and serves to illustrate the fact, that it can be known a nation may possess considerable skill in the applied arts with but our knowledge of the later mathematics on which those arts are founded can be scarce. Knowledge of Chinese mathematics before 254 BC is somewhat fragmentary, and even after this date the manuscript traditions are obscure. Dates centuries before the classical period are generally considered conjectural by Chinese scholars unless accompanied by verified archaeological evidence.

As in other early societies the focus was on [[astronomy]] in order to perfect the agricultural [[calendar]], and other practical tasks, and not on establishing [[formal systems]].The [[Chinese Board of Mathematics]] duties were confined to the annual preparation of an almanac, the dates and predictions in which it regulated. Ancient Chinese mathematicians did not develop an axiomatic approach, but made advances in algorithm development and algebra. The achievement of Chinese algebra reached its zenith in the 13th century, when [[Zhu Shijie]] invented method of four unknowns.

As a result of obvious linguistic and geographic barriers, as well as content, Chinese mathematics and that of the mathematics of the ancient Mediterranean world are presumed to have developed more or less independently up to the time when ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' reached its final form, while the ''[[Writings on Reckoning]]'' and ''[[Huainanzi]]'' are roughly contemporary with classical Greek mathematics. Some exchange of ideas across Asia through known cultural exchanges from at least Roman times is likely. Frequently, elements of the mathematics of early societies correspond to rudimentary results found later in branches of modern mathematics such as geometry or [[number theory]]. The [[Pythagorean theorem#History|Pythagorean theorem]] for example, [[Zhoubi Suanjing|has been attested]] to the time of the [[Duke of Zhou]]. Knowledge of [[Pascal's triangle]] has also been shown to have existed in China centuries before [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psupress.psu.edu/books/titles/0-271-01238-2.html |title=Frank J.

===Indian mathematical notation===
Although the origin of our present system of numerical notation is ancient, there is no doubt that it was in use among the Hindus over two thousand years ago. The algebraic notation of the [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematician]], [[Brahmagupta]], was [[History of algebra#Diophantine algebra|syncopated]]. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the [[subtrahend]] (the number to be subtracted), and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms.&lt;ref name="Boyer Brahmagupta Indeterminate equations"&gt;Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "China and India" p. 221. (cf., "he was the first one to give a ''general'' solution of the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. [...] It is greatly to the credit of Brahmagupta that he gave ''all'' integral solutions of the linear Diophantine equation, whereas Diophantus himself had been satisfied to give one particular solution of an indeterminate equation. Inasmuch as Brahmagupta used some of the same examples as Diophantus, we see again the likelihood of Greek influence in India – or the possibility that they both made use of a common source, possibly from Babylonia. It is interesting to note also that the algebra of Brahmagupta, like that of Diophantus, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by juxtaposition, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, as in our fractional notation but without the bar. The operations of multiplication and evolution (the taking of roots), as well as unknown quantities, were represented by abbreviations of appropriate words.")&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, likely evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and was transmitted to the west via Islamic mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, "The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero", Allen Lane/The Penguin Press, London, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html |title="The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India.

====Hindu–Arabic numerals and notations====
{{Main|History of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system}}
[[File:Image-Al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala.jpg|thumb|A page from al-Khwārizmī's ''Algebra'']]
Despite their name, Arabic numerals actually started in India. The reason for this [[misnomer]] is Europeans saw the numerals used in an Arabic book, ''[[Concerning the Hindu Art of Reckoning]]'', by [[al-Khwarizmi|Mohommed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi]]. Al-Khwārizmī wrote several important books on the Hindu–Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', written about 825, along with the work of [[Al-Kindi]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Al-Kindi also introduced [[cryptanalysis]] and [[frequency analysis]].&lt;/ref&gt; were instrumental in spreading [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Indian numerals]] to the West. Al-Khwarizmi did not claim the numerals as Arabic, but over several Latin translations, the fact that the numerals were Indian in origin was lost. The word ''[[algorithm]]'' is derived from the Latinization of Al-Khwārizmī's name, Algoritmi, and the word ''[[algebra]]'' from the title of one of his works, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī hīsāb al-ğabr wa’l-muqābala]]'' (''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing'').

[[Islamic mathematics]] developed and expanded the mathematics known to [[Central Asia]]n civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adolf Yushkevich|A.P. Juschkewitsch]], "Geschichte der Mathematik im Mittelalter", Teubner, Leipzig, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwārizmī gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots,&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "The Arabic Hegemony" p. 230. (cf., "The six cases of equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic equations having positive root. So systematic and exhaustive was al-Khwārizmī's exposition that his readers must have had little difficulty in mastering the solutions.")&lt;/ref&gt; and Al-Khwārizmī was to teach algebra in an [[Elementary algebra|elementary form]] and for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;Gandz and Saloman (1936), ''The sources of Khwarizmi's algebra'', Osiris i, pp. 263–77: "In a sense, Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called "the father of algebra" than Diophantus because Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers".&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwārizmī also discussed the fundamental method of "[[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which al-Khwārizmī originally described as ''al-jabr''.&lt;ref name=Boyer-229&gt;Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989 {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}} (1991 pbk ed. {{ISBN|0-471-54397-7}}). "The Arabic Hegemony" p. 229. (cf.,  "It is not certain just what the terms ''al-jabr'' and ''muqabalah'' mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word ''al-jabr'' presumably meant something like "restoration" or "completion" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word ''muqabalah'' is said to refer to "reduction" or "balancing" - that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.")&lt;/ref&gt; His algebra was also no longer concerned "with a series of [[problem]]s to be resolved, but an [[Expository writing|exposition]] which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study." Al-Khwārizmī also studied an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems."&lt;ref name=Rashed-Armstrong&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Rashed | first1=R. | last2=Armstrong | first2=Angela | year=1994 | title=The Development of Arabic Mathematics | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=0-7923-2565-6 | oclc=29181926 | pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Karaji]], in his treatise ''al-Fakhri'', extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Something close to a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] by [[mathematical induction]] appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the [[binomial theorem]], [[Pascal's triangle]], and the sum of [[integral]] [[Cube (algebra)|cubes]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor J.

Woepcke (1853). ''Extrait du Fakhri, traité d'Algèbre par Abou Bekr Mohammed Ben Alhacan Alkarkhi''. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; praised Al-Karaji for being "the first who introduced the [[theory]] of [[algebra]]ic [[calculus]]." Also in the 10th century, [[Abul Wafa]] translated the works of [[Diophantus]] into Arabic. [[Ibn al-Haytham]] would develop [[analytic geometry]]. Al-Haytham derived the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. Al-Haytham performed an integration in order to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]], and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of [[polynomial]]s up to the [[Quartic polynomial|fourth degree]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;He thus came close to finding a general formula for the [[integral]]s of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any polynomials higher than the fourth degree.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;Victor J. Katz (1995), "Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India", ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''68''' (3): 163–74.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 11th century, [[Omar Khayyam]] would develop [[algebraic geometry]], wrote ''Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;a book about what he perceived as flaws in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], especially the [[parallel postulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote on the general geometric solution to [[cubic equation]]s. [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]] (Nasireddin) made advances in [[spherical trigonometry]]. Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the [[decimal point]] notation to the [[Arabic numerals]].

Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were then [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]], which led to further development of mathematics in medieval Europe. In the 12th century, scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily seeking scientific Arabic texts, including al-Khwārizmī's&lt;ref group="note"&gt;translated into Latin by [[Robert of Chester]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the complete text of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;translated in various versions by [[Adelard of Bath]], [[Herman of Carinthia]], and [[Gerard of Cremona]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Thérèse d'Alverny, "Translations and Translators", pp. 421–62 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beaujouan, "The Transformation of the Quadrivium", pp. 463–87 in Robert L. Benson and Giles Constable, ''Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century'', (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the European books that advocated using the numerals was ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', by Leonardo of Pisa, better known as [[Fibonacci]]. ''Liber Abaci'' is better known for the mathematical problem Fibonacci wrote in it about a population of rabbits.  The growth of the population ended up being a [[Fibonacci sequence]], where a term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

[[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī]] (1412–1482) was the last major medieval [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab algebraist]], who improved on the [[Mathematical notation|algebraic notation]] earlier used by [[Ibn al-Yasamin|Ibn al-Yāsamīn]] in the 12th century{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and, in the [[Maghreb]], by [[Ibn al-Banna]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Qalasadi&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Qalasadi|title= Abu'l Hasan ibn Ali al Qalasadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the syncopated notations of their predecessors, [[Diophantus]] and [[Brahmagupta]], which lacked symbols for [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical operations]],&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C.

"Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 178 (cf., "The chief difference between Diophantine syncopation and the modern algebraic notation is the lack of special symbols for operations and relations, as well as of the exponential notation.")&lt;/ref&gt; al-Qalasadi's algebraic notation was the first to have symbols for these functions and was thus "the first steps toward the introduction of algebraic symbolism."

The study of [[linear algebra]] emerged from the study of [[determinant]]s, which were used to solve systems of [[linear equation]]s. Calculus had two main systems of notation, each created by one of the creators: that developed by [[Isaac Newton]] and the notation developed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]].  Leibniz's is the notation used most often today.  Newton's was simply a dot or dash placed above the function.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, the derivative of the function ''x'' would be written as &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  The second derivative of ''x'' would be written as &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, this notation generally denotes derivatives of physical quantities with respect to time, and is used frequently in the science of [[mechanics]]. Leibniz, on the other hand, used the letter ''d'' as a prefix to indicate differentiation, and introduced the notation representing derivatives as if they were a special type of fraction.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, the derivative of the function ''x'' with respect to the variable ''t'' in Leibniz's notation would be written as &lt;math&gt;{ dx \over dt }&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This notation makes explicit the variable with respect to which the derivative of the function is taken. Leibniz also created the integral symbol.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\int_{-N}^{N} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbol is an [[long s|elongated S]], representing the [[Latin]] word ''Summa'', meaning "sum".  When finding areas under curves, integration is often illustrated by dividing the area into infinitely many tall, thin rectangles, whose areas are added.  Thus, the integral symbol is an elongated s, for sum.

===High division operators and functions===
{{see also|modern age}}
[[Letters of the alphabet]] in this time were to be used as symbols of [[quantity]]; and although much diversity existed with respect to the choice of letters, there were to be several [[Open standard|universally recognized rules]] in the following history.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Here thus in the history of equations the first letters of the alphabet were indicatively known as [[coefficients]], the last letters the [[dict:unknown|unknown term]]s (an  ''[[Unknown known#Unknown knowns|incerti ordinis]]''). In [[algebraic geometry]], again, a similar rule was to be observed, the last letters of the alphabet there denoting the variable or current [[coordinates]]. Certain letters, such as &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, [[etc.]], were by [[consensus gentium|universal consent]] appropriated as symbols of the frequently occurring numbers [[Pi|3.14159 ...]], and [[e (mathematical constant)|2.7182818 ....]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[List of representations of e]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc., and their use in any other acceptation was to be avoided as much as possible.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Letters, too, were to be employed as symbols of operation, and with them other previously mentioned arbitrary operation characters. The letters [[d|&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;]], [[long s|elongated &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;]] were to be appropriated as operative symbols in the [[differential calculus]] and [[integral calculus]], [[Delta (letter)|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;]] and ∑ in the [[calculus of differences]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; In [[Functional (mathematics)|functional notation]], a letter, as a symbol of operation, is combined with another which is regarded as a symbol of [[Quantity#Quantity in mathematics|quantity]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Thus &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Result|mathematical result]] of the performance of the operation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; upon the [[Mathematical object|subject]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If upon this result the same operation were repeated, the new result would be expressed by &lt;math&gt;f[f(x)]&lt;/math&gt;, or more concisely by &lt;math&gt;f^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. The quantity &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; itself regarded as the result of the same operation &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; upon some other function; the proper symbol for which is, by analogy, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} (x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are symbols of [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse operation]]s, the former cancelling the effect of the latter on the subject &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1} (x)&lt;/math&gt; in a similar manner are termed [[inverse function]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1718, Thomas Twinin used the [[Slash (punctuation)|division slash]] ([[Slash (punctuation)|solidus]]), deriving it from the earlier Arabic [[horizontal fraction bar]]. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace]] developed the widely used [[Laplace operator|Laplacian differential operator]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\Delta f(p) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750, [[Gabriel Cramer]] developed "''[[Cramer's Rule]]''" for solving [[linear system]]s.

====Euler and prime notations====
[[File:Euler's signature.png|thumbnail|Leonhard Euler's signature]]
[[Leonhard Euler]] was one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, and also a prolific inventor of canonical notation. [[Contributions of Leonhard Euler to mathematics|His contributions]] include his use of ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' to represent the base of [[natural logarithm]]s.  It is not known exactly why &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; was chosen, but it was probably because the four letters of the alphabet were already commonly used to represent variables and other constants.  Euler used &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to represent [[pi]] consistently.  The use of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; was suggested by [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]], who used it as shorthand for [[perimeter]].  Euler used &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to represent the square root of negative one,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although he earlier used it as an ''infinite number.'' &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Today, the symbol created by [[John Wallis]], &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, is used for infinity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As in, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For [[summation]], Euler used [[sigma]], [[Capital-sigma notation|Σ]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Capital-sigma notation]] uses a symbol that compactly represents summation of many similar terms: the ''summation symbol'', ''[[Sigma|∑]]'', an enlarged form of the upright capital Greek letter [[Sigma (letter)|Sigma]]. This is defined as: &lt;br&gt;{{Equation box 1|indent =:|equation =&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=m}^n a_i = a_m + a_{m+1} + a_{m+2} +\cdots+ a_{n-1} + a_n. &lt;/math&gt;|cellpadding= 6|border = 0|border colour = black|background colour=white}}&lt;br&gt;
Where, ''i'' represents the ''index of summation''; ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an indexed variable representing each successive term in the series; ''m'' is the ''lower bound of summation'', and ''n'' is the ''upper bound of summation''. The ''"i = m"'' under the summation symbol means that the index ''i'' starts out equal to ''m''.  The index, ''i'', is incremented by 1 for each successive term, stopping when ''i'' = ''n''.&lt;/ref&gt; For [[function (mathematics)|functions]], Euler used the notation &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; to represent a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. In 1730, Euler wrote the [[gamma function]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;n!=\int_{0}^{1}(-\ln s)^{n}\,{\rm d}s&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; valid for n &gt; 0.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1736, Euler produces his paper on the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Euler, Leonhard, [http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E053.pdf Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis]&lt;/ref&gt; initiating the study of [[graph theory]].

The [[William Emerson (mathematician)|mathematician, William Emerson]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x_82AAAAMAAJ The elements of geometry]. By William Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; would develop the [[proportionality sign]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;div style="font-size:200%;"&gt;∝&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Proportionality is the [[ratio]] of one quantity to another, especially the ratio of a part compared to a whole. In a mathematical context, a proportion is the statement of equality between two ratios; See [[Proportionality (mathematics)]], the relationship of two variables whose ratio is constant. See also [[aspect ratio]], geometric proportions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YLxHMwEACAAJ The Doctrine of Proportion, Arithmetical and Geometrical. Together with a General Method of Arening by Proportional Quantities]. By William Emerson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mathematical Correspondent. By George Baron. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IXkAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA83 83]&lt;/ref&gt; Much later in the abstract expressions of the value of various proportional phenomena, the [[parts-per notation]] would become useful as a set of pseudo units to describe small values of miscellaneous [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless quantities]]. [[Marquis de Condorcet]], in 1768, advanced the [[partial differential]] sign.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ''[[Curl (mathematics)|curly d]]'' or ''[[Jacobi's delta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1771, [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde]] deduced the importance of topological features when discussing the [[Knot theory|properties of knots]] related to the geometry of position. Between 1772 and 1788, [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] re-formulated the formulas and calculations of Classical "Newtonian" mechanics, called [[Lagrangian mechanics]]. The [[prime symbol]] for derivatives was also made by Lagrange.

====Gauss, Hamilton, and Matrix notations====
At the turn of the 19th century, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] developed the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity sign]] for [[congruence relation]] and, in [[Quadratic reciprocity]], the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integral part]]. Gauss contributed [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of [[complex variable]]s, in [[geometry]], and on the convergence of [[series (mathematics)|series]]. He gave the satisfactory proofs of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and of the [[quadratic reciprocity law]]. Gauss developed the theory of solving linear systems by using [[Gaussian elimination]], which was initially listed as an advancement in [[geodesy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitulli |first=Marie |authorlink= Marie A.

Also in this time, [[Niels Henrik Abel]] and [[Évariste Galois]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Galois theory]] and [[Galois geometry]] is named after him.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted their work on the [[solvability of equations]], linking [[group theory]] and [[Field theory (mathematics)|field theory]].

After the 1800s, [[Christian Kramp]] would promote [[factorial]] notation during his research in generalized factorial function which applied to non-integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Kramp.html |title=Kramp biography |publisher=History.mcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]] introduced the [[set inclusion]] signs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, "subset of" and "superset of"; This would later be redeveloped by [[Ernst Schröder]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] developed [[Dirichlet L-function|Dirichlet ''L''-functions]] to give the proof of [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] and began [[analytic number theory]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A [[number theory|science of numbers]] that uses methods from [[mathematical analysis]] to solve problems about the integers.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, Gauss proved his [[Theorema Egregium]] (''remarkable theorem'' in Latin), establishing property of surfaces. In the 1830s, [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]] developed [[Green's function]]. In 1829. [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]] publishes [[Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum]] with his [[Elliptic function|elliptic]] [[theta function]]s. By 1841, [[Karl Weierstrass]], the "father of modern [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]", elaborated on the concept of [[absolute value]] and the [[determinant of a matrix]].

[[Matrix notation]] would be more fully developed by [[Arthur Cayley]] in his three papers, on subjects which had been suggested by reading the [[Mécanique analytique]]&lt;ref&gt;Mécanique analytique: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8MKAAAAYAAJ Volume 1], [https://books.google.com/books?id=hclDyo8wE44C Volume 2]. By [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Ms. [[Ve Courcier]], 1811.&lt;/ref&gt; of Lagrange and some of the works of Laplace. Cayley defined [[matrix multiplication]] and [[matrix inverse]]s. Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZdQAAAAYAAJ The collected mathematical papers of Arthur Cayley]. Volume 11. Page [https://books.google.com/books?id=tZdQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA243 243].&lt;/ref&gt; thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object. He also realized the connection between matrices and determinants,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1. By Ari Ben-Menahem. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=9tUrarQYhKMC&amp;pg=PA2070 2070].&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote "''There would be many things to say about this theory of matrices which should, it seems to me, precede the theory of determinants''".&lt;ref name="Vitulli, Marie"&gt;[[Marie A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Though his use describes something different from what is now meant by a tensor.

In 1848, [[James Joseph Sylvester]] introduced into [[matrix algebra]] the term [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This is Latin for "womb".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maxwell, Clifford, and Ricci notations====
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumbnail|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]
----
Maxwell's most prominent achievement was to formulate a [[Maxwell's equations|set of equations]] that united previously unrelated observations, experiments, and equations of [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[optics]] into a consistent theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Clerk Maxwell |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/James_Clerk_Maxwell |accessdate=25 March 2013 |publisher=IEEE Global History Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
In 1864 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] reduced all of the then current knowledge of electromagnetism into a linked set of [[differential equation]]s with 20 equations in 20 variables, contained in ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]''.&lt;ref name=ADTEF&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0008 |last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell |title=A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field | url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field.pdf |format=PDF  |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=155 |pages=459–512 |year=1865}} (This article accompanied a December 8, 1864 presentation by Maxwell to the Royal Society.)&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Maxwell's equations]].) The method of calculation which it is necessary to employ was given by Lagrange, and afterwards developed, with some modifications, by [[Hamilton's equations]]. It is usually referred to as [[Hamilton's principle]]; when the equations in the original form are used they are known as [[Lagrange's equations]]. In 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] called a set of real or complex numbers which is closed under the four arithmetic operations a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. In 1873 Maxwell presented ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]''.

In 1878, [[William Kingdon Clifford]] published his [[Elements of Dynamic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Internet Archive|elementsofdynami01clifiala|Books I, II, III (1878)}}; {{Internet Archive|elementsofdynami02clifiala|Book IV (1887)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford developed [[split-biquaternion]]s,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, [[History of quaternions|&lt;math&gt;q = w + xi + yj + zk &lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt; which he called ''algebraic motors''. Clifford obviated quaternion study by separating the [[dot product]] and [[cross product]] of two vectors from the complete quaternion notation.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Clifford intersected algebra with Hamilton's quaternions by replacing [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s rule ''e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 by the rule ''e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1. For more details, see [[exterior algebra]].&lt;/ref&gt; This approach made [[vector calculus]] available to engineers and others working in [[three dimensions]] and [[skeptical]] of the [[Phase (waves)|lead–lag effect]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See: [[Phasor]], [[Group (mathematics)]], [[Signal velocity]], [[Polyphase system]], [[Harmonic oscillator]], and [[RLC series circuit]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Four-dimensional space|fourth dimension]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Or the concept of a fourth spatial dimension. See also: [[Spacetime]], the unification of time and space as a four-dimensional [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]]; and, [[Minkowski space]], the mathematical setting for special relativity.&lt;/ref&gt;  The common [[vector notation]]s are used when working with vectors which are [[vector (geometric)|spatial]] or more abstract members of [[vector space]]s, while [[angle notation]] (or [[phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] notation) is a notation used in [[electronics]].

In 1881, [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a "domain of rationality", which is a [[field extension]] of the [[Field of rationals|field of rational numbers]] in modern terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Galois Theory | volume=106 | series=Pure and Applied Mathematics | first=David A. | last=Cox | edition=2nd | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2012 | isbn=1118218426 | page=348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hüseyin Tevfik Paşa|tr}} wrote the book titled "Linear Algebra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journals.istanbul.edu.tr/tr/index.php/oba/article/download/9103/8452 |title=TÜBİTAK ULAKBİM DergiPark |publisher=Journals.istanbul.edu.tr |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/linearalgebra00tevfgoog |title=Linear Algebra : Hussein Tevfik : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Kelvin]]'s  [[Aether theories|aetheric]] [[atomic theory|atom theory]] (1860s) led [[Peter Guthrie Tait]], in 1885, to publish a [[topology|topological]] table of knots with up to ten crossings known as the [[Tait conjectures]].

[[:openlibrary:books/OL16587658M/Formulario mathematico|OpenLibrary OL16587658M]].&lt;/ref&gt;  an effort to digest mathematics into terse text based on special symbols. He would provide a definition of a [[vector space]] and [[linear map]]. He would also introduce the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection sign]], the [[union sign]], the [[membership sign]] (is an element of), and [[existential quantifier]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This raises questions of the [[existence theorem|pure existence theorems]].&lt;/ref&gt; (there exists). Peano would pass to [[Bertrand Russell]] his work in 1900 at a Paris conference; it so impressed Russell that Russell too was taken with the drive to render mathematics more concisely. The result was [[Principia Mathematica]] written with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. This treatise marks a watershed in modern literature where symbol became dominant.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Peano's ''Formulario Mathematico'', though less popular than Russell's work, continued through five editions. The fifth appeared in 1908 and included 4200 formulas and theorems.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ricci-Curbastro and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] popularized the [[tensor index notation]] around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Méthodes de calcul différentiel absolu et leurs applications|last=Ricci|first=Gregorio|author-link=Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro|last2=Levi-Civita|first2=Tullio|journal=Mathematische Annalen|publisher=Springer|volume=54|issue=1–2|date=March 1900|pages=125–201|doi=10.1007/BF01454201|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u21237446l22rgg7/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of this period, [[Felix Klein]]'s "[[Erlangen program]]" identified the underlying theme of various geometries, defining each of them as the study of [[Invariant (mathematics)|properties invariant]] under a given group of [[Symmetry|symmetries]]. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and [[abstract algebra]]. [[Georg Cantor]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Inventor of [[set theory]]&lt;/ref&gt; would introduce the [[Aleph number|aleph symbol]] for [[cardinal number]]s of transfinite sets.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Transfinite arithmetic'' is the generalization of [[elementary arithmetic]] to [[infinity|infinite]] quantities like [[infinite sets]]; See [[Transfinite number]]s, [[Transfinite induction]], and [[Transfinite interpolation]]. See also [[Ordinal arithmetic]].&lt;/ref&gt; His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number|aleph]]) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter ω ([[omega]]). This notation is still in use today in [[ordinal notation]] of a finite sequence of symbols from a finite alphabet which names an [[ordinal number]] according to some scheme which gives meaning to the language. [[Cantor's theorem|His theory]] created a [[Controversy over Cantor's theory|great deal of controversy]]. Cantor would, in his study of [[Fourier series]], consider point sets in [[Euclidean space]].

After the turn of the 20th century, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] would in [[physical chemistry]] introduce [[middle dot]] for [[dot product]] and the [[multiplication sign]] for [[cross product]]s. He would also supply notation for the scalar and vector products, which was introduced in ''[[Vector Analysis (Gibbs/Wilson)|Vector Analysis]]''. In 1904, [[Ernst Zermelo]] promotes [[axiom of choice]] and his proof of the [[well-ordering theorem]].&lt;ref name="Zermelo, 1904"&gt;{{cite journal| first=Ernst| last=Zermelo| year=1904| url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/en/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=28526 |format=reprint|title=Beweis, dass jede Menge wohlgeordnet werden kann| journal=Mathematische Annalen| volume=59| issue=4| pages=514–16|doi=10.1007/BF01445300}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bertrand Russell would shortly afterward introduce [[logical disjunction]] ([[Logical disjunction|OR]]) in 1906.

Also in 1908, [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed "definite" property and the first [[axiomatic set theory]], [[Zermelo set theory]]. In 1910 [[Ernst Steinitz]] published the influential paper ''Algebraic Theory of Fields''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;(German: Algebraische Theorie der Körper)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this paper Steinitz axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field theoretic concepts like [[prime field]], [[perfect field]] and the [[transcendence degree]] of a [[field extension]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Steinmetz would publish [https://archive.org/details/theoryandcalcul12steigoog ''Theory and Calculation of Transient Electric Phenomena and Oscillations''].

[[File:Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer - restoration.jpg|thumbnail|Albert Einstein in 1921]]
[[Albert Einstein]], in 1916, introduced the [[Einstein notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The indices range over [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|{1, 2, 3}|}},&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y = \sum_{i=1}^3 c_i x^i = c_1 x^1 + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt; y = c_i x^i \,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upper indices are not [[Exponentiation|exponents]] but are indices of coordinates, [[coefficient]]s or [[basis vector]]s.&lt;br&gt;
See also:  [[Ricci calculus]]&lt;/ref&gt; which summed over a set of [[index notation|indexed terms]] in a formula, thus exerting notational brevity. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] would create the [[contour integral]] sign in 1917. Also in 1917, [[Dimitry Mirimanoff]] proposes [[axiom of regularity]]. In 1919, [[Theodor Kaluza]] would solve [[general relativity]] equations using [[Five-dimensional space|five dimensions]], the results would have electromagnetic equations emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1918). Pg 966.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be published in 1921 in "Zum Unitätsproblem der Physik".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/sitzungsberichte1921preussi Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1918)]

In 1933, [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] introduces the ''[[Kolmogorov axioms]]''. In 1937, [[Bruno de Finetti]] deduced the "[[Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)|operational subjective]]" [[concept]].

====Mathematical symbolism====
{{see also|Category theory|Model theory|Table of logic symbols|Logic alphabet}}
Mathematical abstraction began as a process of extracting the underlying [[essence]] of a mathematical concept,&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Ash. A Primer of Abstract Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, Jan 1, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary. Edited by Edward Thomas Roe, Le Roy Hooker, Thomas W. Handford. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=KhQLAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 34]&lt;/ref&gt; removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected,&lt;ref&gt;The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume 1. By Sir Isaac Newton, John Machin. Pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent [[phenomena]]. Two abstract areas of modern mathematics are [[category theory]] and [[model theory]]. Bertrand Russell,&lt;ref&gt;In The Scientific Outlook (1931)&lt;/ref&gt; said, "''Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say''". Though, one can substituted mathematics for real world objects, and wander off through equation after equation, and can build a concept structure which has no relation to reality.&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics simplified and made attractive: or, The laws of motion explained. By Thomas Fisher. Pg 15. (cf. ''But an abstraction not founded upon, and not consonant with [[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]] and ''([[Logical truth|Logical]])'' [[Truth]], would be a [[falsity]], an [[insanity]].'')&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symbolic logic]] studies the purely formal properties of strings of symbols.  The interest in this area springs from two sources.  First, the notation used in symbolic logic can be seen as representing the words used in [[philosophical logic]].  Second, the rules for manipulating symbols found in symbolic logic can be implemented on a [[computer|computing machine]]. Symbolic logic is usually divided into two subfields, [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]].  Other logics of interest include [[temporal logic]], [[modal logic]] and [[fuzzy logic]]. The area of symbolic logic called [[propositional logic]], also called ''propositional calculus'', studies the properties of sentences formed from [[logical constant|constants]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Here a [[logical constant]] is a symbol in symbolic logic that has the same meaning in all models, such as the symbol "=" for "equals".&lt;br&gt;A ''constant'', in a mathematical context, is a [[Mathematical constant|number that arises naturally in mathematics]], such as π or e;  Such [[constant (mathematics)|mathematics constant]] value do not change. It can mean polynomial [[constant term]]  (the term of degree 0) or the [[constant of integration]], a free parameter arising in integration.&lt;br&gt; Related, the [[physical constant]] are a physical quantity generally believed to be universal and unchanging. [[Constant (programming)|Programming constants]] are a values that, unlike a variable, cannot be reassociated with a different value.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[logical operator]]s. The corresponding logical operations are known, respectively, as [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[logical disjunction|disjunction]], [[material conditional]], [[biconditional]], and [[negation]].  These operators are denoted as [[reserved word|keywords]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Though not an [[index term]], keywords are terms that represent information. A keyword is a word with special meaning (this is a semantic definition), while syntactically these are [[terminal symbol]]s in the phrase grammar. See [[reserved word]] for the related concept.&lt;/ref&gt; and by symbolic notation.

Some of the introduced mathematical logic notation during this time included the set of symbols used in [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]. This was created by [[George Boole]] in 1854. Boole himself did not see logic as a branch of mathematics, but it has come to be encompassed anyway. Symbols found in Boolean algebra include &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; (AND), &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; (OR), and &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; (''not'').  With these symbols, and letters to represent different [[truth value]]s, one can make logical statements such as &lt;math&gt;a\lor\lnot a=1&lt;/math&gt;, that is "(''a'' is true OR ''a'' is ''not'' true) is true", meaning it is true that ''a'' is either true or not true (i.e. false). Boolean algebra has many practical uses as it is, but it also was the start of what would be a large set of symbols to be used in logic.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most of these symbols can be found in [[propositional calculus]], a [[formal system]] described as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}\ (\Alpha,\ \Omega,\ \Zeta,\ \Iota)&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\Alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the set of elements, such as the ''a'' in the example with Boolean algebra above.  &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the set that contains the subsets that contain operations, such as &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\Zeta&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[inference rules]], which are the rules dictating how inferences may be logically made, and &lt;math&gt;\Iota&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[axioms]]. See also: [[Propositional calculus#propcalc table|Basic and Derived Argument Forms]].&lt;/ref&gt; Predicate logic, originally called ''predicate calculus'', expands on propositional logic by the introduction of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Usually denoted by ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', or other lowercase letters&lt;br&gt;
Here a symbols that represents a quantity in a mathematical expression, a [[Variable (mathematics)|mathematical variable]] as used in many sciences.&lt;br&gt;
Variables can be symbolic name associated with a value and whose associated value may be changed, known in computer science as a [[Variable (computer science)|variable reference]]. A ''variable'' can also be the [[operationalization|operationalized]] way in which the attribute is represented for further [[data processing]] (e.g., a logical set of attributes). See also: [[Dependent and independent variables]] in statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; and by sentences containing variables, called [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Usually denoted by an uppercase letter followed by a list of variables, such as P(''x'') or Q(''y'',''z'')&lt;br&gt;
Here a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|mathematical logic predicate]], a fundamental concept in first-order logic. [[Predicate (grammar)|Grammatical predicates]] are grammatical components of a sentence.&lt;br&gt;
Related is the [[syntactic predicate]] in parser technology which are guidelines for the parser process. In computer programming, a [[branch predication]] allows a choice to execute or not to execute a given instruction based on the content of a machine register.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, predicate logic allows [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Representing ALL and EXISTS&lt;/ref&gt; With these [[logic symbol]]s and additional [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s from predicate logic,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;e.g. ∃ for "there exists" and ∀ for "for all"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] [[Argumentation theory#Mathematical argumentation|can be made]] that are [[Absurdity|irrationally artificial]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[Dialetheism]], [[Contradiction]], and [[Paradox]]&lt;/ref&gt; but syntactical.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Related, [[dict:facetious|facetious]] [[abstract nonsense]] describes certain kinds of arguments and methods related to category theory which resembles comical [[Non sequitur (literary device)|literary non sequitur devices]] (not [[Non sequitur (logic)|illogical non sequiturs]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gödel incompleteness notation====
{{see also|Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem}}

{{rquote|right|To every [[Omega-consistent|ω-consistent]] recursive class κ of ''formulae'' there correspond recursive ''class signs r'', such that neither ''v'' Gen ''r'' nor Neg (''v'' Gen ''r'') belongs to Flg (κ) (where ''v'' is the ''free variable'' of ''r'').| Kurt Gödel&lt;ref&gt;Proposition VI, ''[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems|On Formally Undecidable Propositions in ''Principia Mathematica'' and Related Systems I]]'' (1931)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
While proving his [[incompleteness theorems]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] shows that [[Hilbert's program]] to find a complete and consistent set of [[axiom]]s for all [[mathematics]] is impossible, giving a contested negative answer to [[Hilbert's second problem]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Gödel]] created an alternative to the symbols normally used in logic.  He used [[Gödel number]]s, which were numbers that represented operations with set numbers, and variables with the prime numbers greater than 10.  With Gödel numbers, logic statements can be broken down into a number sequence.  Gödel then took this one step farther, taking the ''n'' prime numbers and putting them to the power of the numbers in the sequence.  These numbers were then multiplied together to get the final product, giving every logic statement its own number.&lt;ref&gt;Casti, John L. ''5 Golden Rules''. New York: MJF Books, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, take the statement "There exists a number ''x'' such that it is not ''y''".  Using the symbols of propositional calculus, this would become:  &lt;math&gt;(\exists x)(x=\lnot y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
If the Gödel numbers replace the symbols, it becomes:&lt;math&gt;\{8, 4, 11, 9, 8, 11, 5, 1, 13, 9\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; There are ten numbers, so the ten prime numbers are found and these are: &lt;math&gt;\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; Then, the Gödel numbers are made the powers of the respective primes and multiplied, giving: &lt;math&gt;2^8\times3^4\times5^{11}\times7^9\times11^8\times13^{11}\times17^5\times19^1\times23^{13}\times29^9&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt; The resulting number is approximately &lt;math&gt;3.096262735\times10^{78}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary notation and topics===
{{see also|Contemporary era}}

====Early 20th-century notation====
Abstraction of notation is an ongoing process and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. Various [[set notation]]s would be developed for fundamental object [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. Around 1924, [[David Hilbert]] and [[Richard Courant]] published "[[Methoden der mathematischen Physik|Methods of mathematical physics. Partial differential equations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gr. ''Methoden Der Mathematischen Physik''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Oskar Klein]] and [[Walter Gordon (physicist)|Walter Gordon]] proposed the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] to describe relativistic particles.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Klein–Gordon equation is:&lt;br&gt;{{Equation box 1|indent =:|equation =&lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \psi - \nabla^2 \psi + \frac {m^2 c^2}{\hbar^2} \psi = 0. &lt;/math&gt; |cellpadding= 6|border = 0|border colour = black|background colour=white}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first formulation of a [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] describing radiation and matter interaction is due to [[Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac]], who, during 1920, was first able to compute the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an [[atom]].&lt;ref name=dirac&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; physicists came to believe that, in principle, it would be possible to perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles.

In 1931, [[Alexandru Proca]] developed the [[Proca equation]] ([[Euler–Lagrange equation]])&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is,&lt;br&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on the internal consistency of the theory itself. With no solution for this problem known at the time, it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between [[special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].

In the 1930s, the double-struck capital Z for integer number sets was created by [[Edmund Landau]]. [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] created the double-struck capital Q for rational number sets. In 1935, Gerhard Gentzen made [[universal quantifier]]s. In 1936, [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]] is stated by [[Alfred Tarski]] and proved.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The theorem applies more generally to any sufficiently strong formal system, showing that truth in the standard model of the system cannot be defined within the system.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] proposes the [[constructible universe]] in the paper "''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1077160/ The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum-Hypothesis]''". [[André Weil]] and [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] would develop the [[empty set]] sign in 1939. That same year, [[Nathan Jacobson]] would coin the double-struck capital C for [[complex number]] sets.

Around the 1930s, [[Voigt notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Named to honor Voigt's 1898 work.&lt;/ref&gt; would be developed for [[multilinear algebra]] as a way to represent a [[symmetric tensor]] by reducing its order. [[Schoenflies notation|Schönflies notation]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Named after [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]]&lt;/ref&gt; became one of two conventions used to describe [[point group]]s (the other being [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]]). Also in this time, [[van der Waerden notation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spinoranalyse|author=Van der Waerden B.L.|journal=Nachr. Ges. Wiss.

[[Arend Heyting]] would introduce [[Heyting algebra]] and [[Heyting arithmetic]].

The arrow, e.g., →, was developed for [[function notation]] in 1936 by [[Øystein Ore]] to denote images of specific elements.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See [[Galois connection]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Oystein Ore would also write "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl_6BPp7S0AC Number Theory and Its History]".&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1940, it took its present form, e.g., ''f: X → Y'', through the work of [[Witold Hurewicz]]. [[Werner Heisenberg]], in 1941, proposed the [[S-matrix theory]] of particle interactions.

[[File:Diracb.jpg|thumbnail|[[Paul Dirac]], pictured here, made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and [[quantum electrodynamics]].]]
[[Bra–ket notation]] ([[Dirac notation]]) is a standard notation for describing [[quantum state]]s, composed of [[bracket|angle brackets]] and [[vertical bar]]s. It can also be used to denote abstract [[vector space|vectors]] and [[linear functional]]s. It is so called because the [[inner product]] (or [[dot product]] on a complex vector space) of two states is denoted by a {{langle}}bra|ket{{rangle}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of a left part, ⟨''φ''|, and a right part, |''ψ''⟩.

Bra–ket notation is widespread in [[quantum mechanics]]: almost every phenomenon that is explained using quantum mechanics—including a large portion of [[modern physics]]—is usually explained with the help of bra–ket notation. The notation establishes an encoded abstract representation-independence, producing a versatile specific representation (e.g., ''x'', or ''p'', or [[eigenfunction]] base) without much [[dict:ado|ado]], or excessive reliance on, the [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] of the [[linear space]]s involved. The overlap expression ⟨''φ''|''ψ''⟩  is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the [[Quantum state|state]] ''[[ψ]]'' to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state ''[[Φ#Use as a symbol|ϕ]]''.

In 1948, [[Valentine Bargmann]] and [[Eugene Wigner]] proposed the [[relativistic wave equations|relativistic]] [[Bargmann–Wigner equations]] to describe [[free particle]]s and the equations are in the form of multi-component [[spinor field]] [[wavefunction]]s. In 1950, [[W. V. D. Hodge|William Vallance Douglas Hodge]] presented "[[Hodge conjecture|The topological invariants of algebraic varieties]]" at the Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians. Between 1954 and 1957, [[Eugenio Calabi]] worked on the [[Calabi conjecture]] for [[Kähler metric]]s and the development of [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]s. In 1957, [[Tullio Regge]] formulated the mathematical property of potential scattering in the [[Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That the scattering amplitude can be thought of as an analytic function of the angular momentum, and that the position of the poles determine power-law growth rates of the amplitude in the purely mathematical region of large values of the cosine of the scattering angle.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Mandelstam]], along with Regge, did the initial development of the [[Regge theory]] of strong interaction phenomenology. In 1958, [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Richard Feynman]], along with [[George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]], deduced the [[chiral|chiral structures]] of the [[weak interaction]] in physics. [[Geoffrey Chew]], along with others, would promote matrix notation for the [[strong interaction]], and the associated [[Bootstrapping (physics)|bootstrap principle]], in 1960. In the 1960s, [[set-builder notation]] was developed for describing a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] by stating the properties that its members must satisfy. Also in the 1960s, tensors are abstracted within [[category theory]] by means of the concept of [[monoidal category]]. Later, [[multi-index notation]] eliminates conventional notions used in [[multivariable calculus]], [[partial differential equation]]s, and the theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], by abstracting the concept of an integer [[index notation|index]] to an ordered [[tuple]] of indices.

In the modern mathematics of [[special relativity]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[Wave|wave theory]], the [[d'Alembert operator]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;That is, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\Box&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also known as the [[d'Alembertian]] or [[wave operator]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]] of [[Minkowski space]]. The [[Levi-Civita symbol]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also known as, "[[permutation symbol]]" (see: [[permutation]]), "[[antisymmetric symbol]]" (see: [[Self-complementary graph|antisymmetric]]), or "[[alternating symbol]]"&lt;/ref&gt; is used in [[tensor calculus]].

After the full [[Lorentz covariance]] formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics, [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Richard Feynman]] were jointly awarded with a [[Nobel prize in physics]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=nobel65&gt;{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1965 | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their contributions, and those of [[Freeman Dyson]], were about covariant and [[gauge invariant]] formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]. Feynman's mathematical technique, based on his [[Feynman diagram|diagrams]], initially seemed very different from the field-theoretic, [[Operator (physics)|operator]]-based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but [[Freeman Dyson]] later showed that the two approaches were equivalent. [[Renormalization]], the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through [[integral]]s, has subsequently become one of the fundamental aspects of [[quantum field theory]] and has come to be seen as a criterion for a theory's general acceptability. Quantum electrodynamics has served as the model and template for subsequent quantum field theories. [[Peter Higgs]], [[Jeffrey Goldstone]], and others, [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Abdus Salam]] independently showed how the [[weak nuclear force]] and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single [[electroweak force]]. In the late 1960s, the [[particle zoo]] was composed of the then known [[elementary particle]]s before the discovery of [[quarks]].

The Higgs mechanism is believed to give rise to the [[mass]]es of all the [[elementary particle]]s in the Standard Model.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the electroweak theory became widely accepted and Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg shared the 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for discovering it. The theory of the [[strong interaction]], to which many contributed, acquired its modern form around 1973–74. With the establishment of [[quantum chromodynamics]], a finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles, which allowed for the establishment of a "[[Standard Model|standard model]]" based on the mathematics of [[Gauge theory|gauge invariance]], which successfully described all forces except for gravity, and which remains generally accepted within the domain to which it is designed to be applied. In the late 1970s, [[William Thurston]] introduced [[hyperbolic geometry]] into the [[Knot theory|study of knots]] with the [[geometrization conjecture|hyperbolization theorem]]. The [[orbifold notation]] system, invented by Thurston, has been developed for representing types of [[symmetry groups]] in two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature. In 1978, [[Shing-Tung Yau]] deduced that the [[Calabi conjecture]] have [[Ricci-flat manifold|Ricci flat]] metrics. In 1979, [[Daniel Friedan]] showed that the equations of motions of [[string theory]] are abstractions of [[Einstein equations]] of [[General Relativity]].

The [[first superstring revolution]] is composed of mathematical equations developed between 1984 and 1986. In 1984, [[Vaughan Jones]] deduced the [[Jones polynomial]] and subsequent contributions from [[Edward Witten]], [[Maxim Kontsevich]], and others, revealed deep connections between knot theory and mathematical methods in [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum field theory. According to [[string theory]], all particles in the "particle zoo" have a common ancestor, namely a [[String (physics)|vibrating string]]. In 1985, [[Philip Candelas]], [[Gary Horowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~gary/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Strominger]], and Edward Witten would publish "Vacuum configurations for superstrings"&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Physics B 258: 46–74, {{Bibcode|1985NuPhB.258...46C}}, {{doi|10.1016/0550-3213(85)90602-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[tetrad formalism]] ([[tetrad (index notation)|tetrad index notation]]) would be introduced as an approach to [[general relativity]] that replaces the choice of a [[coordinate basis]] by the less restrictive choice of a local basis for the tangent bundle.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A locally defined set of four linearly independent [[vector field]]s called a [[Tetrad (general relativity)|tetrad]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=De Felice|first1=F.|last2=Clarke|first2=C.J.S. |title=Relativity on Curved Manifolds| year=1990|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Roger Penrose]] would propose [[Penrose graphical notation]] ([[tensor diagram notation]]) as a, usually handwritten, visual depiction of [[multilinear function]]s or [[tensor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds" by V. G. Turaev (1994), page 71&lt;/ref&gt; Penrose would also introduce [[abstract index notation]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;His usage of the Einstein summation was in order to offset the inconvenience in describing [[tensor contraction|contractions]] and [[covariant derivative|covariant differentiation]] in modern abstract tensor notation, while maintaining explicit [[covariance]] of the expressions involved.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Edward Witten suggested [[M-theory]] and subsequently used it to explain some observed [[Duality (mathematics)|dualities]], initiating the [[second superstring revolution]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also: [[String theory landscape]] and [[Swampland (physics)|Swampland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John H Conway 2005 (cropped).jpg|thumb|John H Conway, prolific mathematician of notation.]]
[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] would further various notations, including the [[Conway chained arrow notation]], the [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation of knot theory]], and the [[Conway polyhedron notation]]. The [[Coxeter notation]] system classifies symmetry groups, describing the angles between with fundamental reflections of a [[Coxeter group]]. It uses a bracketed notation, with modifiers to indicate certain subgroups.  The notation is named after [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]] more comprehensively defined it.

In 1962, [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] developed an integral part notation that became known as [[Iverson Notation]] for manipulating arrays that he taught to his students, and described in his book ''[[A Programming Language]]''. In 1970, [[Edgar F. Codd|E.F. Codd]] proposed [[relational algebra]] as a [[relational model|relational model of data]] for [[database query language]]s.  In 1971, [[Stephen Cook]] publishes "[[P versus NP problem|The complexity of theorem proving procedures]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|year=1971|chapter=The complexity of theorem proving procedures|chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=805047|title=Proceedings of the Third Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|pages=151–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s within [[computer architecture]], [[Quote notation]] was developed for a representing number system of [[rational number]]s. Also in this decade, the [[Z notation]] (just like the [[APL (programming language)|APL language]], long before it) uses many non-[[ASCII]] symbols, the specification includes suggestions for rendering the Z notation symbols in [[ASCII]] and in [[LaTeX]]. There are presently various [[C mathematical functions]] (Math.h) and [[numerical libraries]]. They are [[Library (computing)|libraries]] used in [[software development]] for performing [[numerical analysis|numerical]] calculations. These calculations can be handled by [[symbolic execution]]s; analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute.

In the history of mathematical notation, ideographic symbol notation has come full circle with the rise of computer visualization systems. The notations can be applied to abstract visualizations, such as for rendering some projections of a [[Calabi-Yau]] [[manifold]]. Examples of [[Information visualization|abstract visualization]] which properly belong to the mathematical imagination can be found in [[computer graphics]]. The need for such models abounds, for example, when the measures for the subject of study are actually [[random variable]]s and not really ordinary [[mathematical function]]s.

'''Illuminationist''' or '''''ishraqi''''' philosophy is a type of [[Islamic philosophy]] introduced by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] in the twelfth century CE.

==History==
Influenced by [[Avicennism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], the [[Persia]]n&lt;ref&gt;John Walbridge, “The leaven of the ancients: Suhrawardī and the heritage of the Greeks”, State University of New York Press, 1999.  Excerpt: “Suhrawardi, a 12th-century Persian philosopher, was a key figure in the transition of Islamic thought from the neo-Aristotelianism of Avicenna to the mystically oriented philosophy of later centuries.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, “The need for a sacred science”, SUNY Press, 1993.  Pg 158: “Persian philosopher Suhrawardi refers in fact to this land as na-kuja abad,  which in Persian means literally utopia.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Kapstein, University of Chicago Press, 2004, "The presence of light: divine radiance and religious experience", University of Chicago Press, 2004. pg 285:"..the light of lights in the system of the Persian philosopher Suhrawardi"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hossein Ziai. ''Illuminationsim or Illuminationist philosophy, first introduced in the 12th century as a complete, reconstructed system distinct both from the Peripatetic philosophy of Avicenna and from theological philosophy.'' in: Encyclopaedia Iranica.

Kamal, Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy, p.12, Ashgate Publishing Inc., 136 pp., 2006, {{ISBN|0-7546-5271-8}} (see p.12)&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155&amp;ndash;1191), who left over 50 writings in Persian and Arabic, founded the school of Illumination. He developed a version of illuminationism ([[Persian language|Persian]] حكمت اشراق ''hikmat-i ishrāq'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: حكمة الإشراق ''ḥikmat al-ishrāq''). The Persian and Islamic school draws on ancient [[Iranian philosophy|Iranian philosophical]] disciplines,&lt;ref&gt;Henry Corbin. The Voyage and the Messenger. Iran and Philosophy. Containing previous unpublished articles and lectures from 1948 to 1976. North Atlantic Books. Berkeley, California. 1998. {{ISBN|1-55643-269-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Corbin. The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism. Omega Publications, New York. 1994. {{ISBN|0-930872-48-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Avicennism ([[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]’s [[early Islamic philosophy]]), [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] thought (modified by Ibn Sina), and the original ideas of Suhrawardi.

In his ''Philosophy of Illumination'', Suhrawardi argued that light operates at all levels and hierarchies of reality (PI, 97.7&amp;ndash;98.11). Light produces immaterial and substantial lights, including immaterial intellects ([[angel]]s), human and animal souls, and even 'dusky substances', such as bodies.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy of Illumination'' 77.1&amp;ndash;78.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Suhrawardi's metaphysics is based on two principles.  The first is a form of the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The second principle is Aristotle's principle that an [[actual infinity]] is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy of Illumination'' 87.1&amp;ndash;89.8&lt;/ref&gt;

None of Suhrawardi's works were translated into Latin, and so he remained unknown in the [[Latin West]], although his work continued to be studied in the Islamic East.&lt;ref&gt;Marcotte, Roxanne, "Suhrawardi", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/suhrawardi/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Hosein Nasr]], Suhrawardi was unknown to the west until he was translated to western languages by contemporary thinkers such as [[Henry Corbin]], and he remains largely unknown even in countries within the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hosein Nasr|1997|p=55|three muslin sages}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suhrawardi tried to present a new perspective on questions like those of existence. He not only caused peripatetic philosophers to confront such new questions but also gave new life to the body of philosophy after Avicenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=86|Islamic philosophy from its origin to the present}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to John Walbridge, Suhrawardi's critiques of [[Peripatetic philosophy]] could be counted as an important turning point for his successors. Although Suhravardi was first a pioneer of Peripatetic philosophy, he later became a Platonist following a mystical experience. He is also counted as one who revived the ancient wisdom in Persia by his philosophy of illumination. His followers, such as Shahrzouri and [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] tried to continue the way of their teacher. Suhrewardi makes a distinction between two approaches in the philosophy of illumination: one approach is discursive and another is intuitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walbridge in Adamson| and Taylor|2005|pp=201–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Bernoulli''' (also known as '''Jean''' or '''John'''; {{OldStyleDate|6 August|1667|27 July}} – 1 January 1748) was a Swiss mathematician and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the [[Bernoulli family]]. He is known for his contributions to [[infinitesimal calculus]] and educating [[Leonhard Euler]] in the pupil's youth.

==Early life and education==
Johann was born in [[Basel]], the son of Nicolaus Bernoulli, an [[apothecary]], and his wife, Margaretha Schonauer, and began studying medicine at [[University of Basel|Basel University]].  His father desired that he study business so that he might take over the family spice trade, but Johann Bernoulli did not like business and convinced his father to allow him to study medicine instead.  However, Johann Bernoulli did not enjoy medicine either and began studying mathematics on the side with his older brother [[Jacob Bernoulli|Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanford |first=Vera |title=A Short History of Mathematics |publisher=Read Books |origyear=1958 |year=2008 |isbn=1-4097-2710-6 |oclc=607532308 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Johann Bernoulli's education at [[Basel University]] the Bernoulli brothers worked together spending much of their time studying the newly discovered [[infinitesimal calculus]].  They were among the first mathematicians to not only study and understand calculus but to apply it to various problems.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bernoulli Family'', by H. Bernhard, Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, (1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult life==
After graduating from Basel University Johann Bernoulli moved to teach [[differential equations]].  Later, in 1694, he married Dorothea Falkner and soon after accepted a position as the professor of mathematics at the [[University of Groningen]].  At the request of his father-in-law, Johann Bernoulli began the voyage back to his home town of [[Basel]] in 1705.  Just after setting out on the journey he learned of his brother's death to [[tuberculosis]].  Johann Bernoulli had planned on becoming the professor of Greek at Basel University upon returning but instead was able to take over as professor of mathematics, his older brother's former position.  As a student of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s calculus, Johann Bernoulli sided with him in 1713 in the [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy|Newton–Leibniz debate]] over who deserved credit for the discovery of calculus.  Johann Bernoulli defended Leibniz by showing that he had solved certain problems with his methods that Newton had failed to solve.  Johann Bernoulli also promoted Descartes' [[Mechanical explanations of gravitation#Vortex|vortex theory]] over [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's theory of gravitation]]. This ultimately delayed acceptance of Newton's theory in [[continental Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joachim O. |last=Fleckenstein |title=Johann und Jakob Bernoulli |publisher=Birkhäuser |origyear=1949 |year=1977 |isbn=3764308486 |language=German |oclc=4062356 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leibniz - Opere. Lettere e carteggi, 1745 - 1359735 F.jpeg|thumb|left|''Commercium philosophicum et mathematicum'' (1745), a collection of letters between [[Leibnitz]] and Bernoulli.]]

In 1724, Johann Bernoulli entered a competition sponsored by the French [[Académie Royale des Sciences]], which posed the question:

:What are the laws according to which a perfectly hard body, put into motion, moves another body of the same nature either at rest or in motion, and which it encounters either in a [[vacuum]] or in a [[Plenum chamber|plenum]]?

In defending a view previously espoused by Leibniz, he found himself postulating an infinite external force required to make the body elastic by overcoming the infinite internal force making the body hard. In consequence, he was disqualified for the prize, which was won by [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]]. However, Bernoulli's paper was subsequently accepted in 1726 when the Académie considered papers regarding elastic bodies, for which the prize was awarded to Pierre Mazière. Bernoulli received an honourable mention in both competitions.

==Private life==
Although Jacob and Johann Bernoulli worked together before Johann graduated from Basel University, shortly after this, the two developed a jealous and competitive relationship.  Johann was jealous of Jacob's position and the two often attempted to outdo each other.  After Jacob's death Johann's jealousy shifted toward his own talented son, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel]]. In 1738 the father–son duo nearly simultaneously published separate works on [[hydrodynamics]].  Johann Bernoulli attempted to take precedence over his son by purposely and falsely predating his work two years prior to his son's.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=tIRBzdTWwyUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Johann+Bernoulli+Hydrodynamics+antedate+1732&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=9uf97reZZCUC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=Johann+Bernoulli+predating+1732&lt;/ref&gt;

Johann married Dorothea Falkner, daughter of an Alderman of Basel. He was the father of [[Nicolaus II Bernoulli]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]] and [[Johann II Bernoulli]] and uncle of [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]].

The Bernoulli brothers often worked on the same problems, but not without friction. Their most bitter dispute concerned finding the equation for the path followed by a particle from one point to another in the shortest time, if the particle is acted upon by gravity alone, a problem originally discussed by Galileo. In 1697 Jacob offered a reward for its solution. Accepting the challenge, Johann proposed the cycloid, the path of a point on a moving wheel, pointing out at the same time the relation this curve bears to the path described by a ray of light passing through strata of variable density. A protracted, bitter dispute then arose when Jacob challenged the solution and proposed his own. The dispute marked the origin of a new discipline, the calculus of variations.

==L'Hôpital controversy==
Bernoulli was hired by [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital]] for tutoring in mathematics. Bernoulli and l'Hôpital signed a contract which gave l'Hôpital the right to use Bernoulli's discoveries as he pleased. L'Hôpital authored the first textbook on [[infinitesimal calculus]], ''[[Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes]]'' in 1696, which mainly consisted of the work of Bernoulli, including what is now known as [[l'Hôpital's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Eli Maor |first=Eli |last=Maor |title=e: The Story of a Number |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |year=1998 |isbn=0-691-05854-7 |page=116 |oclc=29310868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coolidge |first=Julian Lowell |title=The mathematics of great amateurs |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1990 |pages=154–163 |isbn=0-19-853939-8 |oclc=20418646 |edition=2nd |origyear=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D.

Subsequently, in letters to Leibniz, Varignon and others, Bernoulli complained that he had not received enough credit for his contributions, in spite of the fact that l'Hôpital acknowledged fully his debt in the preface of his book:

{{quote|Je reconnais devoir beaucoup aux lumières de MM. Bernoulli, surtout à celles du jeune (Jean) présentement professeur à Groningue. Je me suis servi sans façon de leurs découvertes et de celles de M. Leibniz. C'est pourquoi je consens qu'ils en revendiquent tout ce qu'il leur plaira, me contentant de ce qu'ils voudront bien me laisser.}}

{{quote|I recognize I owe much to the insights of the Messrs. Bernoulli, especially to those of the young (John), currently a professor in Groningen. I did unceremoniously use their discoveries, as well as those of Mr. Leibniz.  For this reason I consent that they claim as much credit as they please, and will content myself with what they will agree to leave me.}}

'''John von Neumann''' ({{IPAc-en|v|ɒ|n|_|ˈ|n|ɔɪ|m|ə|n}}; {{lang-hu|Neumann János Lajos}}, {{IPA-hu|ˈnɒjmɒn ˈjaːnoʃ ˈlɒjoʃ|pron}}; December 28, 1903&amp;nbsp;– February 8, 1957) was a Hungarian-American [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[computer scientist]], and [[polymath]]. He made major contributions to a number of fields, including [[mathematics]] ([[foundations of mathematics]], [[functional analysis]], [[ergodic theory]], [[representation theory]], [[operator algebras]], [[geometry]], [[topology]], and [[numerical analysis]]), [[physics]] ([[quantum mechanics]], [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]], and [[quantum statistical mechanics]]), [[economics]] ([[game theory]]), [[computing]] ([[Von Neumann architecture]], [[linear programming]], [[Von Neumann universal constructor|self-replicating machines]], [[stochastic computing]]), and [[statistics]].

Von Neumann was generally regarded as the foremost mathematician of his time{{sfn|Rèdei|1999|p=3}} and said to be "the last representative of the great mathematicians".{{sfn|Dieudonné |2008|p=90}}  He was a pioneer of the application of [[operator theory]] to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]], the universal constructor and the [[Computer|digital computer]]. He published over 150 papers in his life: about 60 in pure mathematics, 20 in physics, and 60 in applied mathematics, the remainder being on special mathematical subjects or non-mathematical ones.{{sfn|Doran|von_Neumann|Stone|Kadison|2004|p=8}} His last work, an unfinished manuscript written while in hospital, was later published in book form as ''[[The Computer and the Brain]]''.

His analysis of the structure of [[self-replication]] preceded the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]]. In a short list of facts about his life he submitted to the [[National Academy of Sciences]], he stated, "The part of my work I consider most essential is that on quantum mechanics, which developed in Göttingen in 1926, and subsequently in Berlin in 1927–1929. Also, my work on various forms of operator theory, Berlin 1930 and Princeton 1935–1939; on the ergodic theorem, Princeton, 1931–1932."

During [[World War II]], von Neumann worked on the [[Manhattan Project]]; he developed the mathematical models that were behind the [[explosive lens]]es used in the [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], and later as one of its commissioners. He was a consultant to a number of organizations, including the [[United States Air Force]], the Army's [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]], the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]], and the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].  Von Neumann, theoretical physicist [[Edward Teller]], mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]] and others worked out key steps in the [[nuclear physics]] involved in [[Thermonuclear fusion|thermonuclear]] reactions and the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]].

== Early life and education ==
=== Family background ===
Von Neumann was born Neumann János Lajos to a wealthy, acculturated and non-observant [[Jewish]] family (in Hungarian the family name comes first. His given names equate to John Louis in English). His [[Jewish name|Hebrew name]] was Yonah. Von Neumann was born in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]], which was then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{sfn|Doran|von_Neumann|Stone|Kadison|2004|p=1}}&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |last=Myhrvold |first=Nathan |date=March 21, 1999 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,21839,00.html |title=John von Neumann |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Blair|1957|p=104}} He was the eldest of three brothers; his two younger siblings were Mihály (English: Michael von Neumann; 1907–1989) and Miklós (Nicholas Vonneumann, 1911–2011).{{sfn|Dyson|1998|p=xxi}}  His father, Neumann Miksa (Max von Neumann, 1873–1928) was a banker, who held a [[doctor of law|doctorate in law]]. He had moved to Budapest from [[Pécs]] at the end of the 1880s.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=38–42}} Miksa's father and grandfather were both born in Ond (now part of the town of [[Szerencs]]), [[Zemplén County]], northern Hungary. John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann);{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=37–38}} her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=39}} Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest; von Neumann's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=44–45}}

In 1913, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] elevated his father to the nobility for his service to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation ''Margittai'', meaning of Margitta (today [[Marghita]], [[Romania]]). The family had no connection with the town; the appellation was chosen in reference to Margaret, as was that chosen coat of arms depicting three [[Argyranthemum|marguerites]]. Neumann János became margittai Neumann János (John Neumann de Margitta), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=57–58}}

=== Child prodigy ===
Von Neumann was a [[child prodigy]].  When he was 6 years old, he could divide two 8-digit numbers in his head {{sfn|Henderson|2007|p=30}}{{sfn|Schneider|Gersting|Brinkman|2015|p=28}} and could converse in [[Ancient Greek]]. When the 6-year-old von Neumann caught his mother staring aimlessly, he asked her, "What are you calculating?"{{sfn|Mitchell|2009|p=124}}

Children did not begin formal schooling in Hungary until they were ten years of age; governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages in addition to Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=46–47}} By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with [[differential calculus|differential]] and [[integral calculus]],&lt;ref name="Halmos"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Halmos, P. R.|title=The Legend of von Neumann|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume= 80|issue= 4|pages=382–394|jstor=2319080|doi=10.2307/2319080|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was particularly interested in history. He read his way through [[Wilhelm Oncken]]'s 46-volume ''Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen''.{{sfn|Blair|1957|p=90}} A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=52}}

Von Neumann entered the Lutheran [[Fasori Gimnázium|Fasori Evangélikus Gimnázium]] in 1911. This was one of the best schools in Budapest and was part of a brilliant education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. Despite being run by the Lutheran Church, the school was predominately Jewish in its student body.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=64–65}} The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, which included [[Theodore von Kármán]] (b. 1881), [[George de Hevesy]] (b. 1885), [[Leó Szilárd]] (b. 1898), [[Dennis Gabor]] (b. 1900), [[Eugene Wigner]] (b. 1902), [[Edward Teller]] (b. 1908), and [[Paul Erdős]] (b. 1913).{{sfn|Doran|von_Neumann|Stone|Kadison|2004|p=3}} Collectively, they were sometimes known as "[[The Martians (scientists)|The Martians]]".{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=32–33}} Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=70–71}} When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1963, replied that von Neumann was the only genius.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=32}}

Although Max insisted von Neumann attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an [[aptitude]]. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst [[Gábor Szegő]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=70–71}} On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears.{{sfn|Glimm|Impagliazzo|Singer|1990|p=5}} Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems that Szegő posed in calculus are sketched out on his father's stationery and are still on display at the von Neumann archive in Budapest.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=70–71}} By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of [[ordinal number#Von Neumann definition of ordinals|ordinal numbers]], which superseded [[Georg Cantor]]'s definition.{{sfn|Nasar|2001|p=81}} At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, von Neumann sat for and won the Eötvös Prize, a national prize for mathematics.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=84}}

=== University studies ===

There were few academic positions in Hungary for mathematicians, and those jobs that did exist were not well-paid. Von Neumann's father wanted John to follow him into industry and thereby invest his time in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics. In fact, his father requested [[Theodore von Kármán]] to persuade his son not to take mathematics as his major.&lt;ref&gt;von Kármán, T., &amp; Edson, L. (1967). The wind and beyond. Little, Brown &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path was to become a [[chemical engineer]]. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year, non-degree course in chemistry at the [[University of Berlin]], after which he sat for the entrance exam to the prestigious [[ETH Zurich]],{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=85–87}} which he passed in September 1923.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=97}} At the same time, von Neumann also entered [[Eötvös Loránd University|Pázmány Péter University]] in Budapest,&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Ed Regis (author)|last=Regis |first=Ed|title=Johnny Jiggles the Planet|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D91239F93BA35752C1A964958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 8, 1992|accessdate=February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] candidate in [[mathematics]]. For his thesis, he chose to produce an [[axiomatization]] of Cantor's [[set theory]].&lt;ref name="Neumann1928"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Neumann|first1=J. |title=Die Axiomatisierung der Mengenlehre|journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|volume=27|issue=1|year=1928|pages=669–752|issn=0025-5874|doi=10.1007/BF01171122|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=86–87}}  He graduated as a chemical engineer from ETH Zurich in 1926 (although Wigner says that von Neumann was never very attached to that subject),&lt;ref name="Eugene Paul Wigner 2013 page 128"&gt;''The Collected Works of Eugene Paul Wigner: Historical, Philosophical, and Socio-Political Papers. Historical and Biographical Reflections and Syntheses'', By Eugene Paul Wigner, (Springer 2013), page 128&lt;/ref&gt; and passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. in mathematics simultaneously, of which [[Eugene Wigner]] wrote, "Evidently a Ph.D. thesis and examination did not constitute an appreciable effort."&lt;ref name="Eugene Paul Wigner 2013 page 128"/&gt;    He then went to the [[University of Göttingen]] on a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to study mathematics under [[David Hilbert]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=98–99}}

== Early career and private life ==
[[File:NeumannVonMargitta.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Excerpt from the university calendars for 1928 and 1928/29 of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin]] announcing Neumann's lectures on axiomatic set theory and mathematical logic, new work in quantum mechanics and special functions of mathematical physics.]]
Von Neumann's [[habilitation]] was completed on December 13, 1927, and he started his lectures as a ''[[privatdozent]]'' at the University of Berlin in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashagen |first=Ulf|title=Die Habilitation von John von Neumann an der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin: Urteile über einen ungarisch-jüdischen Mathematiker in Deutschland im Jahr 1927|journal=[[Historia Mathematica]] | volume = 37 |issue=2|pages=242–280|date=2010 |ref=harv |doi=10.1016/j.hm.2009.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; being the youngest person ever elected ''privatdozent'' in its history in any subject.&lt;ref&gt;''The History Of Game Theory, Volume 1: From the Beginnings to 1945'', By Mary-Ann Dimand, Robert W Dimand, (Routledge, 2002), page 129&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1927, von Neumann had published twelve major papers in mathematics, and by the end of 1929, thirty-two papers, at a rate of nearly one major paper per month.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=145}} His reputed powers of memorization and recall allowed him to quickly memorize the pages of telephone directories, and recite the names, addresses and numbers therein.{{sfn|Blair|1957|p=90}} In 1929, he briefly became a ''privatdozent'' at the [[University of Hamburg]], where the prospects of becoming a tenured professor were better,{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=143–144}} but in October of that year a better offer presented itself when he was invited to [[Princeton University]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=155–157}}

On New Year's Day in 1930, von Neumann married Marietta Kövesi, who had studied economics at Budapest University.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=155–157}} Von Neumann and Marietta had one child, a daughter, [[Marina von Neumann Whitman|Marina]], born in 1935. As of 2017, she is a distinguished professor of business administration and public policy at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fordschool.umich.edu/faculty/marina-whitman |title=Marina Whitman |publisher=The Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan |accessdate=January 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in 1937. In October 1938, von Neumann married [[Klara Dan von Neumann|Klara Dan]], whom he had met during his last trips back to Budapest prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=170–174}}

Prior to his marriage to Marietta, von Neumann was baptized a Catholic in 1930.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;{{cite web |first=S. |last=Bochner |title=John von Neumann; A Biographical Memoir |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/von-neumann-john.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |year=1958|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Von Neumann's father, Max, had died in 1929. None of the family had converted to Christianity while Max was alive, but all did afterward.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=43, 157}}

In 1933, he was offered a lifetime professorship on the faculty of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in New Jersey when that institution's plan to appoint [[Hermann Weyl]] fell through.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=167–168}} He remained a mathematics professor there until his death, although he had announced his intention to resign and become a professor at large at the [[University of California]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=371}} His mother, brothers and in-laws followed von Neumann to the United States in 1939.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=195–196}} Von Neumann [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] his first name to John, keeping the German-aristocratic surname of von Neumann. His brothers changed theirs to "Neumann" and "Vonneumann".{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=57–58}} Von Neumann became a [[Naturalization#United States|naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1937, and immediately tried to become a [[lieutenant]] in the United States Army's [[Officers Reserve Corps]]. He passed the exams easily, but was ultimately rejected because of his age.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=190–195}} His prewar analysis of how France would stand up to Germany is often quoted: "Oh, France won't matter."{{sfn|Ulam|1983|p=70}}

Klara and John von Neumann were socially active within the local academic community.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=170–171}} His white [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]] house at 26 Westcott Road was one of the largest private residences in Princeton.{{sfn|Regis|1987|p=103}} He took great care of his clothing and would always wear formal suits. He once wore a three-piece pinstripe when he rode down the [[Grand Canyon]] astride a mule.&lt;ref name="whitman"/&gt; Hilbert is reported to have asked "Pray, who is the candidate's tailor?" at von Neumann's 1926 doctoral exam, as he had never seen such beautiful evening clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/books/review/turings-cathedral-by-george-dyson.html?nl=books&amp;emc=booksupdateema4_20120504|title=Unleashing the Power|date=May 4, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|last=Poundstone |first=William }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann held a lifelong passion for ancient history, being renowned for his prodigious historical knowledge. A professor of [[Byzantine history]] at Princeton once said that von Neumann had greater expertise in the field than he did.&lt;ref name="Life Magazine 1957, pages 89-104"&gt;Blair, pp. 89–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann liked to eat and drink; his wife, Klara, said that he could count everything except calories.

Von Neumann's closest friend in the United States was mathematician [[Stanislaw Ulam]]. A later friend of Ulam's, [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], wrote, "They would spend hours on end gossiping and giggling, swapping Jewish jokes, and drifting in and out of mathematical talk." When von Neumann was dying in the hospital, every time Ulam visited, he came prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer him up.{{sfn|Rota|1989|pp=26–27}} He believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively, and he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved and know the answer immediately upon waking up.{{sfn|Blair|1957|p=94}} Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more aural.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=75}}

=== Set theory ===
{{See also|Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory}}

The axiomatization of mathematics, on the model of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', had reached new levels of rigour and breadth at the end of the 19th century, particularly in arithmetic, thanks to the [[Peano axioms|axiom schema]] of [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and in geometry, thanks to [[Hilbert's axioms]].{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}} But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on [[naive set theory]] suffered a setback due to [[Russell's paradox]] (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves).{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=104–105}} The problem of an adequate axiomatization of [[set theory]] was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by [[Ernst Zermelo]] and [[Abraham Fraenkel]]. [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the ''[[axiom of regularity|axiom of foundation]]'' and the notion of ''[[Class (set theory)|class]].''{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}}

The axiom of foundation proposed that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the ''method of [[inner model]]s'', which later became an essential instrument in set theory.{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}}

The second approach to the problem of sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of [[Class (set theory)|class]], and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a ''proper class'' is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a ''proper class'' and not a set.{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}}

With this contribution of von Neumann, the axiomatic system of the theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms that could be used to prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of [[Königsberg]], in which [[Kurt Gödel]] announced his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|first theorem of incompleteness]]: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.{{sfn|von Neumann|2005|p=123}}

Less than a month later, von Neumann, who had participated at the Congress, communicated to Gödel an interesting consequence of his theorem: that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency.{{sfn|von Neumann|2005|p=123}} However, Gödel had already discovered this consequence, now known as his [[second incompleteness theorem]], and he sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems.{{sfn|Dawson|1997|p=70}} Von Neumann acknowledged Gödel's priority in his next letter.{{sfn|von Neumann|2005|p=124}} He never thought much of "the American system of claiming personal priority for everything."{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=182}}

=== Ergodic theory ===
In a series of articles that were published in 1932, von Neumann made foundational contributions to [[ergodic theory]], a branch of mathematics that involves the states of [[dynamical systems]] with an [[invariant measure]].&lt;ref&gt;Two famous papers are: {{cite journal|first=John|last=von Neumann|title=Proof of the Quasi-ergodic Hypothesis|year=1932|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|volume=18|pages=70–82|doi=10.1073/pnas.18.1.70|pmid=16577432|issue=1|pmc=1076162|bibcode=1932PNAS...18...70N }}.

Wiss.|volume=91|pages=261–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 1932 papers on ergodic theory, [[Paul Halmos]] writes that even "if von Neumann had never done anything else, they would have been sufficient to guarantee him mathematical immortality".&lt;ref name="measure"/&gt; By then von Neumann had already written his famous articles on [[operator theory]], and the application of this work was instrumental in the [[Ergodic theory#Mean ergodic theorem|von Neumann mean ergodic theorem]].&lt;ref name="measure"/&gt;

=== Operator theory ===
{{Main|Von Neumann algebra}}

Von Neumann introduced the study of rings of operators, through the von Neumann algebras. A von Neumann algebra is a [[*-algebra]] of [[bounded operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]] that is closed in the weak operator topology and contains the [[Identity function|identity operator]].{{sfn|Petz|Redi|1995|pp=163–181}} The [[von Neumann bicommutant theorem]] shows that the analytic definition is equivalent to a purely algebraic definition as being equal to the bicommutant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/restricted/jones.pdf |title=Von Neumann Algebras |accessdate=January 6, 2016 |publisher=Princeton University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann embarked in 1936, with the partial collaboration of [[Francis Joseph Murray|F.J. Murray]], on the general study of [[von Neumann algebra|factors]] classification of von Neumann algebras. The six major papers in which he developed that theory between 1936 and 1940  "rank among the masterpieces of analysis in the twentieth century".{{sfn|Dieudonné |2008|p=90}} The [[direct integral]] was later introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ucla.edu/~brh6/DirectIntegral.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702001911/http://www.math.ucla.edu/~brh6/DirectIntegral.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-02 |title=Direct Integrals of Hilbert Spaces and von Neumann Algebras |accessdate=January 6, 2016 |publisher=University of California at Los Angeles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measure theory ===
{{See also|Lifting theory}}

In [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], the "problem of measure" for an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional Euclidean space {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} may be stated as: "does there exist a positive, normalized, invariant, and additive set function on the class of all subsets of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}?"&lt;ref name="measure"/&gt; The work of [[Felix Hausdorff]] and [[Stefan Banach]] had implied that the problem of measure has a positive solution if {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} or {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} and a negative solution (because of the [[Banach–Tarski paradox]]) in all other cases. Von Neumann's work argued that the "problem is essentially group-theoretic in character":&lt;ref name="measure"/&gt; the existence of a measure could be determined by looking at the properties of the [[transformation group]] of the given space. The positive solution for spaces of dimension at most two, and the negative solution for higher dimensions, comes from the fact that the [[Euclidean group]] is a [[solvable group]] for dimension at most two, and is not solvable for higher dimensions. "Thus, according to von Neumann, it is the change of group that makes a difference, not the change of space."&lt;ref name="measure"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Von Neumann on measure and ergodic theory|author=[[Paul Halmos|Halmos, Paul R.]]|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|Bull.

In a number of von Neumann's papers, the methods of argument he employed are considered even more significant than the results. In anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition, and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of functions.&lt;ref name=VanHove&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Léon Van Hove|last=Van Hove|first1=Léon|title=Von Neumann's Contributions to Quantum Theory|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]|date=1958|volume=64|issue=3|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183522374 |pages=95–99|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1958-10206-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, he used the [[Haar measure|Haar theorem]] in the solution of [[Hilbert's fifth problem]] in the case of compact groups.&lt;ref name="measure"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J.|last=von Neumann|title=Die Einfuhrung Analytischer Parameter in Topologischen Gruppen|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=34|issue=1|series=2|year=1933|pages=170–179|doi=10.2307/1968347|jstor=1968347}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, he was awarded the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]] for his work in analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/pabrowse?purl=bocher-prize#year=1938 |title=AMS Bôcher Prize |publisher=AMS |date=January 5, 2016 |access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geometry ===

Von Neumann founded the field of [[continuous geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation | last1=Neumann | first1=John von| author1-link=John von Neumann | title=Examples of continuous geometries | jstor=86391 | doi=10.1073/pnas.22.2.101 | jfm=62.0648.03 | year=1936b | journal=Proc.

In mathematics, continuous geometry is a substitute of complex [[projective geometry]], where instead of the dimension of a subspace being in a discrete set 0, 1, ..., ''n'', it can be an element of the unit interval [0,1]. Earlier, [[Karl Menger|Menger]] and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex [[projective geometry]] in terms of the properties of its lattice of linear subspaces. Von Neumann, following his work on rings of operators, weakened those axioms to describe a broader class of lattices, the continuous geometries.
While the dimensions of the subspaces of projective geometries are a discrete set (the non-negative integers), the dimensions of the elements of a continuous geometry can range continuously across the unit interval [0,1]. Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of [[von Neumann algebra]]s with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the [[hyperfinite type II factor]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=140}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John |last=von Neumann|doi=10.1007/BF01782352|title= Zur Algebra der Funktionaloperationen und Theorie der normalen Operatoren|language=German |journal= [[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=102 |issue=1 |year=1930|pages= 370–427|bibcode=1930MatAn.102..685E}}. The original paper on von Neumann algebras.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lattice theory ===
Between 1937 and 1939, von Neumann worked on [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]], the theory of [[partially ordered set]]s in which every two elements have a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound. [[Garrett Birkhoff]] writes: "John von Neumann's brilliant mind blazed over lattice theory like a meteor".&lt;ref name="Garrett Birkhoff 1958, page 50-6"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1958-64-03/S0002-9904-1958-10192-5/S0002-9904-1958-10192-5.pdf|last=Birkhoff |first=Garrett |authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff |title=Von Neumann and lattice theory|journal= [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=64|issue=3|isbn=0-8218-1025-1|year=1958|pages= 50–56|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1958-10192-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann provided an abstract exploration of dimension in completed [[Complemented lattice|complemented]] [[Modular lattice|modular]] topological lattices (properties that arise in the [[Linear subspace#Lattice of subspaces|lattices of subspaces]] of [[inner product space]]s): "Dimension is determined, up to a positive linear transformation, by the following two properties. It is conserved by perspective mappings ("perspectivities") and ordered by inclusion. The deepest part of the proof concerns the equivalence of perspectivity with "projectivity by decomposition"—of which a corollary is the transitivity of perspectivity."&lt;ref name="Garrett Birkhoff 1958, page 50-6"/&gt;

Additionally, "[I]n the general case, von Neumann proved the following basic representation theorem. Any complemented modular lattice {{mvar|L}} having a "basis" of {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}} pairwise perspective elements, is isomorphic with the lattice {{math|ℛ(''R'')}} of all principal [[Ideal (ring theory)|right-ideals]] of a suitable [[Von Neumann regular ring|regular ring]] {{mvar|R}}. This conclusion is the culmination of 140 pages of brilliant and incisive algebra involving entirely novel axioms. Anyone wishing to get an unforgettable impression of the razor edge of von Neumann's mind, need merely try to pursue this chain of exact reasoning for himself—realizing that often five pages of it were written down before breakfast, seated at a living room writing-table in a bathrobe."&lt;ref name="Garrett Birkhoff 1958, page 50-6"/&gt;

=== Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics ===
{{See also|von Neumann entropy|Quantum mutual information|Measurement in quantum mechanics#von Neumann measurement scheme|label 4 = von Neumann measurement scheme|Wave function collapse}}
{{Quantum mechanics}}

Von Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for [[quantum mechanics]], known as the [[Dirac–von Neumann axioms]], with his 1932 work ''[[Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics]]''.&lt;ref name=VanHove/&gt; After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as [[linear operators]] acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=139–141}}

The ''physics'' of quantum mechanics was thereby reduced to the ''mathematics'' of Hilbert spaces and linear operators acting on them. For example, the [[uncertainty principle]], according to which the determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa, is translated into the ''non-commutativity'' of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=139–141}} When Heisenberg was informed von Neumann had clarified the difference between an unbounded operator that was a [[self-adjoint operator]] and one that was merely symmetric, Heisenberg replied "Eh? What is the difference?"{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=142}}

Von Neumann's abstract treatment permitted him also to confront the foundational issue of determinism versus non-determinism, and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics could not possibly be averages of an underlying set of determined "hidden variables," as in classical statistical mechanics. In 1935, [[Grete Hermann]] published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Grete |last=Hermann |authorlink=Grete Hermann |title=Die naturphilosophischen Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik |journal =[[Naturwissenschaften]] |volume=23 |number=42 |pages=718&amp;ndash;721 |year=1935 |doi=10.1007/BF01491142|bibcode=1935NW.....23..718H }} English translation in {{cite book|last=Hermann |first=Grete |title=Grete Hermann &amp;mdash; Between physics and philosophy |editor-first1=Elise |editor-last1=Crull |editor-first2=Guido |editor-last2=Bacciagaluppi |publisher=Springer |year=2016 |pages=239&amp;ndash;278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermann's work was largely ignored until after [[John S. Bell]] made essentially the same argument in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John S. |last=Bell |authorlink=John S. Bell |title=On the problem of hidden variables in quantum mechanics |journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] |volume=38 |pages=447&amp;ndash;452 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.38.447|bibcode=1966RvMP...38..447B }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010, [[Jeffrey Bub]] argued that Bell had misconstrued von Neumann's proof, and pointed out that the proof, though not valid for all [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variable theories]], does rule out a well-defined and important subset. Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation, and that von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Von Neumann's 'No Hidden Variables' Proof: A Re-Appraisal|year=2010|last1=Bub|first1=Jeffrey|journal=[[Foundations of Physics]] | volume=40 | issue=9–10 | pages=1333–1340 |bibcode=2010FoPh...40.1333B |doi=10.1007/s10701-010-9480-9 |arxiv=1006.0499}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of Bub's argument is, in turn, disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|title=Homer nodded: von Neumann's surprising oversight |year=2018 |eprint=1805.10311 |last1=Mermin |first1=N. David |last2=Schack |first2=Rüdiger |author-link1=N. David Mermin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, [[Gleason's theorem|Gleason's Theorem]] of 1957 fills the gaps in von Neumann's approach.

Von Neumann's proof inaugurated a line of research that ultimately led, through the work of Bell in 1964 on [[Bell's theorem]], and the experiments of [[Alain Aspect]] in 1982, to the demonstration that quantum physics either requires a ''notion of reality'' substantially different from that of classical physics, or must include [[quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] in apparent violation of special relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=37 |issue=4 |year=2006 |pages=577–616 |title=Philosophy enters the optics laboratory: Bell's theorem and its first experimental tests (1965–1982) |first=Olival Jr. |last=Freire |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2005.12.003 |bibcode=2006SHPMP..37..577F |arxiv=physics/0508180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a chapter of ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', von Neumann deeply analyzed the so-called [[measurement problem]]. He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the universal [[wave function collapse|wave function]]. Since something "outside the calculation" was needed to collapse the wave function, von Neumann concluded that the collapse was caused by the consciousness of the experimenter (although this view was accepted by Eugene Wigner,&lt;ref name="Wigner"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1119/1.1973829| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1169–1170| last = Wigner| first = Eugene| author2 = Henry Margenau| title = Remarks on the Mind Body Question, in Symmetries and Reflections, Scientific Essays| journal = American Journal of Physics| date = December 1967| bibcode = 1967AmJPh..35.1169W}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation]] never gained acceptance amongst the majority of physicists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M. |last1=Schlosshauer |first2=J.|last2= Koer |first3=A. |last3=Zeilinger |title=A Snapshot of Foundational Attitudes Toward Quantum Mechanics |year=2013 |pages=222–230 |volume=44 |issue=3 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |arxiv=1301.1069 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004|bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though theories of quantum mechanics continue to evolve to this day, there is a basic framework for the mathematical formalism of problems in quantum mechanics which underlies the majority of approaches and can be traced back to the mathematical formalisms and techniques first used by von Neumann. In other words, discussions about [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of the theory]], and extensions to it, are now mostly conducted on the basis of shared assumptions about the mathematical foundations.&lt;ref name=VanHove/&gt;

==== Von Neumann Entropy ====

Von Neumann entropy is extensively used in different forms ([[conditional entropy|conditional entropies]], [[relative entropy|relative entropies]], etc.) in the framework of [[quantum information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nielsen|first=Michael A. and Isaac Chuang|title=Quantum computation and quantum information|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-521-63503-5|pages=700|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entanglement measures are based upon some quantity directly related to the von Neumann entropy.   Given a [[statistical ensemble]] of quantum mechanical systems with the [[density matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, it is given by &lt;math&gt; S(\rho) = -\operatorname{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho). \, &lt;/math&gt; Many of the same entropy measures in classical information theory can also be generalized to the quantum case, such as [http://www.mi.ras.ru/~holevo/eindex.html Holevo entropy] and the [[conditional quantum entropy]].

==== Quantum mutual information ====

Quantum information theory is largely concerned with the interpretation and uses of von Neumann entropy. The von Neumann entropy is the cornerstone in the development of quantum information theory, while the [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] applies to classical information theory. This is considered a historical anomaly, as it might have been expected that Shannon entropy was discovered prior to Von Neuman entropy, given the latter's more widespread application to quantum information theory. However, the historical reverse occurred. Von Neumann first discovered von Neumann entropy, and applied it to questions of statistical physics. Decades later, Shannon developed an information-theoretic formula for use in classical information theory, and asked von Neumann what to call it, with von Neumman telling him to call it Shannon entropy, as it was a special case of von Neumann entropy.&lt;ref&gt;Quantum Information Theory, By Mark M. Wilde, (Cambridge University Press 2013), page 252&lt;/ref&gt;

The density matrix  is an alternative way in which to represent the state of a quantum system, which could otherwise be represented using the wavefunction. The density matrix allows the solution of certain time-dependent problems in [[quantum mechanics]].

The [[Measurement in quantum mechanics#von Neumann measurement scheme|von Neumann measurement scheme]], the ancestor of quantum [[decoherence]] theory, represents measurements projectively by taking into account the measuring apparatus which is also treated as a quantum object. The 'projective measurement' scheme introduced by von Neumann, led to the development of quantum decoherence theories.&lt;ref&gt;''Dualism, Platonism and Voluntarism: Explorations at the Quantum, Microscopic, Mesoscopic and Symbolic Neural Levels'', (Cambridge Scholars 2016), page 215&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum logic ===
{{Main|Quantum logic}}
Von Neumann first proposed a quantum logic in his 1932 treatise ''[[Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics]]'', where he noted that projections on a [[Hilbert space]] can be viewed as propositions about physical observables. The field of quantum logic was subsequently inaugurated, in a famous paper of 1936 by von Neumann and Garrett Birkhoff, the first work ever to introduce quantum logics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gabbay|first1=Dov M.|authorlink1=Dov Gabbay|last2=Woods|first2=John |title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&amp;pg=PA205|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-054939-2|pages=205–2017|chapter=The History of Quantum Logic}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a [[propositional calculus]] substantially different from all classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics. The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, the need for the new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (''e.g.'', one horizontally and the other vertically), and therefore, ''[[A fortiori argument|a fortiori]]'', it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added ''in between'' the other two, the photons will, indeed, pass through. This experimental fact is translatable into logic as the ''non-commutativity'' of conjunction &lt;math&gt;(A\land B)\ne (B\land A)&lt;/math&gt;. It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of classical logic, &lt;math&gt;P\lor(Q\land R)=(P\lor Q)\land(P\lor R)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P\land (Q\lor R)=(P\land Q)\lor(P\land R)&lt;/math&gt;, are not valid for quantum theory.&lt;ref name="quantum logic"/&gt;

The reason for this is that a quantum disjunction, unlike the case for classical disjunction, can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is, in turn, attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case, in quantum mechanics, that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate. This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (spin angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., ''x'' and ''y'') results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state '''ɸ''' of a certain electron verifies the proposition "the spin of the electron in the ''x'' direction is positive." By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction ''y'' will be completely indeterminate for '''ɸ'''. Hence, '''ɸ''' can verify neither the proposition "the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive" nor
the proposition "the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative." Nevertheless, the disjunction of the propositions "the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive or the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative" must be true for '''ɸ'''.
In the case of distribution, it is therefore possible to have a situation in which ''&lt;math&gt;A \land (B\lor C)= A\land 1 = A&lt;/math&gt;'', while &lt;math&gt;(A\land B)\lor (A\land C)=0\lor 0=0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="quantum logic"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics |first=Garrett |last=Birkhoff |authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff |first2=John |last2=von Neumann |journal=Annals of Mathematics |volume=37 |issue=4 |date=October 1936 |pages=823–843 |doi=10.2307/1968621 |jstor=1968621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Hilary Putnam]] writes, von Neumann replaced classical logic with a logic constructed in [[orthomodular lattice]]s (isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert space of a given physical system).&lt;ref name="Putnam1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Putnam|first=Hilary |authorlink=Hilary Putnam|title=Philosophical Papers: Volume 3, Realism and Reason|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAjfSA3ir3kC|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31394-0|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Game theory ===
Von Neumann founded the field of [[game theory]] as a mathematical discipline.&lt;ref name="KuhnTucker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhn|first= H. W.|authorlink=Harold W. Kuhn|last2=Tucker|first2= A. W.|authorlink2=Albert W. Tucker|title=John von Neumann's work in the theory of games and mathematical economics|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1958|volume=64 (Part 2)|issue=3|pages=100–122|mr=0096572|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1958-10209-8|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.320.2987&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann proved his [[Minimax#Minimax theorem|minimax theorem]] in 1928. This theorem establishes that in [[zero-sum game]]s with [[perfect information]] (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far), there exists a pair of [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss.&lt;ref name="Game Theory"&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Neumann |first=J: |title=Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele |language=German  |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume=100 |issue=1928 |pages=295–320 |doi=10.1007/bf01448847|year=1928 |bibcode=1928MatAn.100...32C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such strategies, which minimize the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players, publishing this result in his 1944 ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]]). Morgenstern wrote a paper on game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a front-page story.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] methods, especially [[convex set]]s and [[topology|topological]] [[fixed-point theorem]], rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the [[Maxima and minima|maximum]]-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.&lt;ref name="KuhnTucker"/&gt;

Independently, [[Leonid Kantorovich]]'s functional analytic work on mathematical economics also focused attention on optimization theory, non-differentiability, and [[Riesz space|vector lattices]]. Von Neumann's functional-analytic techniques—the use of [[Dual space|duality pairings]] of real [[vector space]]s to represent prices and quantities, the use of [[Supporting hyperplane|supporting]] and [[Hyperplane separation theorem|separating hyperplanes]] and convex sets, and fixed-point theory—have been the primary tools of mathematical economics ever since.{{sfn|Blume|2008}}

=== Mathematical economics ===
Von Neumann raised the intellectual and mathematical level of economics in several influential publications. For his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]].&lt;ref name=KuhnTucker/&gt; Von Neumann's model of an expanding economy considered the [[Eigendecomposition of a matrix#Generalized eigenvalue problem|matrix pencil]]&amp;nbsp;'' '''A'''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;λ'''B''''' with nonnegative matrices&amp;nbsp;'''A''' and '''B'''; von Neumann sought [[probability vector|probability]] [[generalized eigenvector|vectors]]&amp;nbsp;''p'' and&amp;nbsp;''q'' and a positive number&amp;nbsp;''λ'' that would solve the [[complementarity theory|complementarity]] equation
:&lt;math&gt;p^T (A - \lambda B) q = 0&lt;/math&gt;
along with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency. In this model, the ([[transpose]]d) probability vector ''p'' represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the "intensity" at which the production process would run. The unique solution ''λ'' represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the [[economic growth|rate of growth]] of the economy; the rate of growth equals the [[interest rate]].&lt;ref&gt;For this problem to have a unique solution, it suffices that the nonnegative matrices&amp;nbsp;'''A''' and&amp;nbsp;'''B''' satisfy an [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|irreducibility condition]], generalizing that of the [[Perron–Frobenius theorem]] of nonnegative matrices, which considers the (simplified) [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue problem]]
: '''A''' − λ '''I''' ''q'' = 0,
where the nonnegative matrix''&amp;nbsp;'''A''''' must be square and where the [[diagonal matrix]]''&amp;nbsp;'''I''' ''is the [[identity matrix]]. Von Neumann's irreducibility condition was called the "whales and [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wranglers]]" hypothesis by [[D. G. Champernowne|David Champernowne]], who provided a verbal and economic commentary on the English translation of von Neumann's article. Von Neumann's hypothesis implied that every economic process used a positive amount of every economic good. Weaker "irreducibility" conditions were given by [[David Gale]] and by [[John George Kemeny|John Kemeny]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]], and [[Gerald L. Thompson]] in the 1950s and then by Stephen M. Robinson in the&amp;nbsp;1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Morgenstern|Thompson|1976||pages=xviii, 277}}

Von Neumann's results have been viewed as a special case of [[linear programming]], where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices. The study of von Neumann's model of an expanding economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics.{{sfn|Rockafellar|1970|pp=i, 74}}{{sfn|Rockafellar|1974|pp=351–378}}{{sfn|Ye|1997|pp=277–299}} This paper has been called the greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, [[Linear inequality|linear inequalities]], [[Linear programming#Complementary slackness|complementary slackness]], and [[Duality (optimization)|saddlepoint duality]]. In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last1=Bruckmann|editor-first1=Gerhart|editor-last2=Weber|editor-first2=Wilhelm|date=September 21, 1971|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-24667-2|title=Contributions to von Neumann's Growth Model|series=Proceedings of a Conference Organized by the Institute for Advanced Studies Vienna, Austria, July 6 and 7, 1970|publisher=Springer–Verlag|isbn=978-3-662-22738-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--The lasting importance of the work on general equilibria and the methodology of fixed point theorems is underscored by the awarding of [[Nobel prize]]s in 1972 to [[Kenneth Arrow]], in 1983 to [[Gérard Debreu]], and in 1994 to [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] who used fixed point theorems to establish equilibria for [[non-cooperative game]]s and for [[bargaining problem]]s in his Ph.D. thesis. Arrow and Debreu also used linear programming, as did Nobel laureates [[Tjalling Koopmans]], [[Leonid Kantorovich]], [[Wassily Leontief]], [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Robert Dorfman]], [[Robert Solow]], and [[Leonid Hurwicz]].
--&gt;
Von Neumann's famous 9-page paper started life as a talk at Princeton and then became a paper in German, which was eventually translated into English. His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows: When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest, and so did the economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]], and they hit it off. Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist [[Léon Walras]]. Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them, for example, replacing equations by inequalities. He noticed that Walras's [[General Equilibrium Theory]] and [[Walras' Law]], which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce the absurd result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product. He replaced the equations by inequalities, introduced dynamic equilibria, among other things, and eventually produced the paper.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=250–253}}

=== Linear programming ===
Building on his results on matrix games and on his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after [[George Dantzig]] described his work in a few minutes, when an impatient von Neumann asked him to get to the point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.&lt;ref name="George B 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dantzig | first1 = George |last2=Thapa |first2=Mukund N. | title = Linear Programming : 2: Theory and Extensions | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]| location = New York, NY | year = 2003| isbn = 1-4419-3140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, von Neumann suggested a new method of [[linear programming]], using the homogeneous linear system of [[Paul Gordan|Gordan]] (1873), which was later popularized by [[Karmarkar's algorithm]]. Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative [[least squares]] subproblem with a convexity constraint ([[Projection (linear algebra)#Orthogonal projections|projecting]] the zero-vector onto the [[convex hull]] of the active [[simplex]]). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first [[interior point method]] of linear programming.&lt;ref name="George B 2003"/&gt;

=== Mathematical statistics ===
Von Neumann made fundamental contributions to [[mathematical statistics]]. In 1941, he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically [[Normal distribution|normally]] distributed variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=von Neumann, John|year=1941|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177731677|title=Distribution of the ratio of the mean square successive difference to the variance|journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]|volume=12|pages=367–395|jstor=2235951|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177731677|issue=4|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the [[Durbin–Watson statistic]]&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Durbin, J.|author2= Watson, G. S.|year=1950|title=Testing for Serial Correlation in Least Squares Regression, I|journal=[[Biometrika]]|volume=37|pages=409–428|pmid=14801065|issue=3–4|doi=10.2307/2332391}}&lt;/ref&gt; for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order [[Autoregressive model|autoregression]].&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Subsequently, [[Denis Sargan]] and [[Alok Bhargava]] extended the results for testing if the errors on a regression model follow a Gaussian [[random walk]] (''i.e.'', possess a [[unit root]]) against the alternative that they are a stationary first order autoregression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sargan, J.D. |author2=Bhargava, Alok |year=1983|jstor=1912252 |title=Testing residuals from least squares regression for being generated by the Gaussian random walk|journal=[[Econometrica]]|volume=51|pages=153–174|doi=10.2307/1912252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluid dynamics ===
Von Neumann made fundamental contributions in exploration of problems in numerical hydrodynamics. For example, with [[Robert D. Richtmyer]] he developed an algorithm defining ''artificial [[viscosity]]'' that improved the understanding of [[shock wave]]s. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of ''artificial viscosity'' smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Method for the Numerical Calculation of Hydrodynamic Shocks |last=von Neumann |first=J. |last2=Richtmyer |first2=R.

By Donald E. Carlucci, Sidney S. Jacobson, (CRC Press, 26 Aug 2013), page 523&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mastery of mathematics ===
Stan Ulam, who knew von Neumann well, described his mastery of mathematics this way: "Most mathematicians know one method. For example, [[Norbert Wiener]] had mastered [[Fourier transform]]s. Some mathematicians have mastered two methods and might really impress someone who knows only one of them. John von Neumann had mastered three methods." He went on to explain that the three methods were:
* A facility with the symbolic manipulation of linear operators;
* An intuitive feeling for the logical structure of any new mathematical theory;
* An intuitive feeling for the combinatorial superstructure of new theories.{{sfn|Ulam|1983|p=96}}
Edward Teller wrote that "Nobody knows all science, not even von Neumann did. But as for mathematics, he contributed to every part of it except number theory and topology. That is, I think, something unique."{{sfn|Dyson|1998|p=77}}

Von Neumann was asked to write an essay for the layman describing what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that there is always the danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Von_Neumann_Part_1.html |title=Von Neumann: The Mathematician |publisher=MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive |access-date=December 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Von_Neumann_Part_2.html |title=Von Neumann: The Mathematician, Part 2 |publisher=MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive |access-date=December 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|von Neumann|1947|pp=180–196}}

== Nuclear weapons ==
[[File:John von Neumann ID badge.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Von Neumann's wartime [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] ID badge photo]]

=== Manhattan Project ===
Beginning in the late 1930s, von Neumann developed an expertise in [[explosion]]s—phenomena that are difficult to model mathematically. During this period, von Neumann was the leading authority of the mathematics of [[shaped charge]]s. This led him to a large number of military consultancies, primarily for the Navy, which in turn led to his involvement in the [[Manhattan Project]]. The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project's secret research facilities at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in a remote part of New Mexico.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Von Neumann made his principal contribution to the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] in the concept and design of the [[nuclear weapon design|explosive lenses]] that were needed to compress the [[plutonium]] core of the [[Fat Man]] weapon that was later dropped on [[Nagasaki]]. While von Neumann did not originate the "[[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion]]" concept, he was one of its most persistent proponents, encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues, who felt such a design to be unworkable. He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of "assembly".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130–133, 157–159}}

When it turned out that there would not be enough [[uranium-235]] to make more than one bomb, the implosive lens project was greatly expanded and von Neumann's idea was implemented. Implosion was the only method that could be used with the [[plutonium-239]] that was available from the [[Hanford Site]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=239–245}} He established the design of the [[explosive lens]]es required, but there remained concerns about "edge effects" and imperfections in the explosives.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=295}} His calculations showed that implosion would work if it did not depart by more than 5% from spherical symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html |title=Section 8.0 The First Nuclear Weapons |publisher=Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions  |first=Carey |last=Sublette |accessdate=January 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of failed attempts with models, this was achieved by [[George Kistiakowsky]], and the construction of the Trinity bomb was completed in July 1945.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=320–327}}

In a visit to Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the pressure increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, it was determined that the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=209}}{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=184}}

[[File:Implosion bomb animated.gif|thumb|left|Implosion mechanism]]
Von Neumann, four other scientists, and various military personnel were included in the target selection committee that was responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and Nagasaki as the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first targets of the atomic bomb]]. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital [[Kyoto]], which had been spared the [[Air raids on Japan|bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities]], was von Neumann's first choice,{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=242–245}} a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General [[Leslie Groves]]. However, this target was dismissed by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]].{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=268–276}}

On July 16, 1945, von Neumann and numerous other Manhattan Project personnel were eyewitnesses to the first test of an atomic bomb detonation, which was code-named [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]. The event was conducted as a test of the implosion method device, at the [[Alamogordo Bombing Range|bombing range]] near [[Alamogordo Army Airfield]], {{convert|35|mi}} southeast of [[Socorro, New Mexico]]. Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to {{convert|5|ktonTNT|lk=on}} but [[Enrico Fermi]] produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered. The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=371–372}} It was in von Neumann's 1944 papers that the expression "kilotons" appeared for the first time.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=205}} After the war, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had "known sin". Von Neumann's response was that "sometimes someone confesses a sin in order to take credit for it."{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=245}}

Von Neumann continued unperturbed in his work and became, along with Edward Teller, one of those who sustained the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb project]]. He collaborated with [[Klaus Fuchs]] on further development of the bomb, and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on "Improvement in Methods and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy", which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate [[nuclear fusion]].{{sfn|Herken|2002|pages=171, 374}} The Fuchs–von Neumann patent used [[radiation implosion]], but not in the same way as is used in what became the final hydrogen bomb design, the [[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Teller–Ulam design]]. Their work was, however, incorporated into the "George" shot of [[Operation Greenhouse]], which was instructive in testing out concepts that went into the final design.&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Jeremy|title=John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs: an Unlikely Collaboration|journal=Physics in Perspective|volume=12|pages=36–50|year=2010|doi=10.1007/s00016-009-0001-1|bibcode = 2010PhP....12...36B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fuchs–von Neumann work was passed on to the Soviet Union by Fuchs as part of his [[nuclear espionage]], but it was not used in the Soviets' own, independent development of the Teller–Ulam design. The historian [[Jeremy Bernstein]] has pointed out that ironically, "John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs, produced a brilliant invention in 1946 that could have changed the whole course of the development of the hydrogen bomb, but was not fully understood until after the bomb had been successfully made."&lt;ref name="Bernstein2010"/&gt;

For his wartime services, von Neumann was awarded the [[Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award]] in July 1946, and the [[Medal for Merit]] in October 1946.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=208}}

=== Atomic Energy Commission ===
In 1950, von Neumann became a consultant to the [[Weapons Systems Evaluation Group]] (WSEG),{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=350–351}} whose function was to advise the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] on the development and use of new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Weapons' Values to be Appraised|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wBIzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ufUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=weapons-systems-evaluation-group&amp;pg=7379%2C6398588|date=December 15, 1948|newspaper=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]|accessdate=January 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became an adviser to the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] (AFSWP), which was responsible for the military aspects on nuclear weapons. Over the following two years, he became a consultant to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), a member of the influential [[General Advisory Committee]] of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], a consultant to the newly established [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], and a member of the [[Scientific Advisory Group]] of the [[United States Air Force]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=350–351}}

In 1955, von Neumann became a commissioner of the AEC. He accepted this position and used it to further the production of compact [[hydrogen bomb]]s suitable for [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of [[tritium]] and [[lithium 6]] needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate-range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, which turned out to be the case.{{sfn|Heims|1980|p=276}}{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=367–369}} Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing]], at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead.&lt;ref name="Halmos"/&gt;

Shortly before his death from cancer, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, which would sometimes meet in his home. Its purpose was to decide on the feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The [[SM-65 Atlas]] passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=359–365}}

=== Mutual assured destruction ===
[[File:Redwing Mohawk 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Operation Redwing]] nuclear test in July 1956]]
Von Neumann is credited with developing the equilibrium strategy of [[mutual assured destruction]] (MAD). He also "moved heaven and earth" to bring MAD about. His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR, and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the [[CIA]] interviewed German rocket scientists who were allowed to return to Germany, and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA. The Russians considered that bombers would soon be vulnerable, and they shared von Neumann's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the [[ne plus ultra]] of weapons; they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world, without necessarily using them.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=362–363}} He was afraid of a "missile gap" and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets:
*He modified the ENIAC by making it programmable and then wrote programs for it to do the H-bomb calculations verifying that the Teller-Ulam design was feasible and to develop it further.
*Through the Atomic Energy Commission, he promoted the development of a compact H-bomb that would fit in an ICBM.
*He personally interceded to speed up the production of lithium-6 and tritium needed for the compact bombs.
*He caused several separate missile projects to be started, because he felt that competition combined with collaboration got the best results.{{sfn|Heims|1980|pp=258–260}}
Von Neumann's assessment that the Soviets had a lead in missile technology, considered pessimistic at the time, was soon proven correct in the [[Sputnik crisis]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=362–364}}

Von Neumann entered government service primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the United States would triumph over totalitarianism from [[Nazism]], [[Fascism]] and [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communism]].&lt;ref name="whitman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://256.com/gray/docs/misc/conversation_with_marina_whitman.shtml |title=Conversation with Marina Whitman |publisher=Gray Watson (256.com) |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |ref=whiteman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428125353/http://256.com/gray/docs/misc/conversation_with_marina_whitman.shtml |archivedate=April 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee hearing he described his political ideology as "violently [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], and much more militaristic than the norm". He was quoted in 1950 remarking, "If you say why not bomb [the Soviets] tomorrow, I say, why not today? If you say today at five o'clock, I say why not one o'clock?"{{sfn|Blair|1957|p=96}}

On February 15, 1956, von Neumann was presented with the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. His citation read:

== Computing ==
[[File:Merge sort animation2.gif|thumb|Merge sort animation. The sorted elements are represented by dots.]]
Von Neumann was a founding figure in [[computing]].{{sfn|Goldstine|1980|pp=167–178}} [[Donald Knuth]] cites von Neumann as the inventor, in 1945, of the [[merge sort]] algorithm, in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged.{{sfn|Knuth|1998|p=159}}&lt;ref name="Papers J.

Von Neumann wrote the 23 pages long sorting program for the [[EDVAC]] in ink. On the first page, traces of the phrase "TOP SECRET", which was written in pencil and later erased, can still be seen.&lt;ref name="Papers J. Neumann Computing Computer Theory. 1987, pp. 89-95"/&gt; He also worked on the philosophy of [[artificial intelligence]] with [[Alan Turing]] when the latter visited Princeton in the 1930s.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=183–184}}

Von Neumann's hydrogen bomb work was played out in the realm of computing, where he and Stanisław Ulam developed simulations on von Neumann's digital computers for the hydrodynamic computations. During this time he contributed to the development of the [[Monte Carlo method]], which allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using [[Algorithmically random sequence|random numbers]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=334–335}} His algorithm for simulating a [[fair coin]] with a biased coin is used in the "software whitening" stage of some [[hardware random number generator]]s.&lt;ref name="digits"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Because using lists of "truly" random numbers was extremely slow, von Neumann developed a form of making [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandom numbers]], using the [[middle-square method]]. Though this method has been criticized as crude, von Neumann was aware of this: he justified it as being faster than any other method at his disposal, writing that "Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin."&lt;ref name="nbsams"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann also noted that when this method went awry it did so obviously, unlike other methods which could be subtly incorrect.&lt;ref name="nbsams"/&gt;

While consulting for the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] on the EDVAC project, von Neumann wrote an incomplete ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]''. The paper, whose premature distribution nullified the patent claims of EDVAC designers [[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John Mauchly]], described a [[computer architecture]] in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer's memory in the same address space. This architecture is the basis of most modern computer designs, unlike the earliest computers that were "programmed" using a separate memory device such as a [[paper tape]] or [[plugboard]]. Although the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called [[von Neumann architecture]] as a result of von Neumann's paper, the architecture was based on the work of Eckert and Mauchly, inventors of the [[ENIAC]] computer at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="ENIAC museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/mauchly/jwm9.html |title=John W. Mauchly and the Development of the ENIAC Computer |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |access-date=January 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John von Neumann consulted for the Army's [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]], most notably on the ENIAC project,{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=279–283}} as a member of its Scientific Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The electronics of the new ENIAC ran at one-sixth the speed, but this in no way degraded the ENIAC's performance, since it was still entirely [[I/O bound]]. Complicated programs could be developed and [[Debugging|debugged]] in days rather than the weeks required for plugboarding the old ENIAC. Some of von Neumann's early computer programs have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;

The next computer that von Neumann designed was the [[IAS machine]] at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He arranged its financing, and the components were designed and built at the [[Sarnoff Corporation|RCA Research Laboratory]] nearby. John von Neumann recommended that the [[IBM 701]], nicknamed ''the defense computer'', include a magnetic drum. It was a faster version of the IAS machine and formed the basis for the commercially successful IBM 704.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Cellular automata, DNA and the universal constructor ===

Von Neumann's rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of [[self-replication]] (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.{{sfnb|Rocha|2015|pp=25–27}}

Von Neumann created the field of [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper.
 
The detailed proposal for a physical non-biological self-replicating system was first put forward in lectures Von Neumann delivered in 1948 and 1949, when he first only proposed a [[kinematic]] self-reproducing automaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=von Neumann| first=John| year=1966| title=The Theory of Self-reproducing Automata| editor= A.

He went on to instead develop a more abstract model self-replicator based on his original concept of [[cellular automata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/2.1.3.htm |title=2.1.3 The Cellular Automaton (CA) Model of Machine Replication |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the concept of the [[Von Neumann universal constructor]] based on the [[von Neumann cellular automaton]] was fleshed out in his posthumously published lectures ''Theory of Self Reproducing Automata''.&lt;ref name=TSRA&gt;

Ulam and von Neumann created a method for calculating liquid motion in the 1950s. The driving concept of the method was to consider a liquid as a group of discrete units and calculate the motion of each based on its neighbors' behaviors.&lt;ref name=bialynick-8&gt;{{Harvnb|Bialynicki-Birula, Bialynicka-Birula|2004|p=8|ref=bialynick}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Ulam's lattice network, [[Von Neumann cellular automata|von Neumann's cellular automata]] are two-dimensional, with his self-replicator implemented algorithmically. The result was a [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal copier and constructor]] working within a cellular automaton with a small neighborhood (only those cells that touch are neighbors; for von Neumann's cellular automata, only [[orthogonal]] cells), and with 29 states per cell.&lt;ref name=wolfram-876&gt;{{Harvnb|Wolfram|2002|p=876|ref=wolfram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Neumann gave an existence proof that a particular pattern would make infinite copies of itself within the given cellular universe by designing a 200,000 cell configuration that could do so.&lt;ref name=wolfram-876/&gt; 

{{quote box|quote = [T]here exists a critical size below which the process of synthesis is degenerative, but above which the phenomenon of synthesis, if properly arranged, can become explosive, in other words, where syntheses of automata can proceed in such a manner that each automaton will produce other automata which are more complex and of higher potentialities than itself.|von Neumann, 1948&lt;ref name="TSRA"/&gt;}}

Von Neumann addressed the evolutionary growth of complexity amongst his self-replicating machines.&lt;ref name=McMullin2000&gt;{{Citation|journal=Artificial Life|last=McMullin|first=B.|year=2000|title=John von Neumann and the Evolutionary Growth of Complexity: Looking Backwards, Looking Forwards...|volume=6|issue=4|pages=347–361|url=http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~alife/bmcm-alj-2000/|doi=10.1162/106454600300103674|pmid=11348586}}&lt;/ref&gt; His "proof-of-principle" designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable ("universal") constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-replicators, spanning a wide range of complexity, interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be "machines", as conventionally understood. Von Neumman considers the potential for conflict between his self-reproducing machines, stating that "our models lead to such conflict situations",&lt;ref name="Autonomous Systems 1992 page 236"&gt;''Toward a Practice of Autonomous Systems: Proceedings of the First European Conference on Artificial Life'', Francisco J. Varela, Paul Bourgine, (MIT Press 1992), page 236&lt;/ref&gt; indicating it as a field of further study.&lt;ref name="TSRA"/&gt;{{rp|147}}

The [[cybernetics]] movement highlighted the question of what it takes for self-reproduction to occur autonomously, and in 1952, John von Neumann designed an elaborate 2D [[cellular automaton]] that would automatically make a copy of its initial configuration of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1179|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[von Neumann neighborhood]], in which each cell in a two-dimensional grid has the four orthogonally adjacent grid cells as neighbors, continues to be used for other cellular automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire [[natural satellite|moon]] or [[asteroid belt]] would be by using [[self-replicating spacecraft]], taking advantage of their [[exponential growth]].&lt;ref&gt;

Von Neumann's interest in weather systems and meteorological prediction led him to propose manipulating the environment by spreading colorants on the [[polar ice cap]]s to enhance absorption of solar radiation (by reducing the [[albedo]]),{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=332}}{{sfn|Heims|1980|pp=236–247}} thereby inducing [[global warming]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=332}}{{sfn|Heims|1980|pp=236–247}} Von Neumann was a scientist to propose the theory of [[global warming]], noting that the Earth was only {{convert|6|F-change|C-change}} colder during the [[last glacial period]], he said that the burning of coal and oil would result in "a general warming of the Earth by about one degree Fahrenheit."{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=16}}

== Cognitive abilities ==
Other mathematicians were stunned by von Neumann's ability to instantaneously perform complex operations in his head.{{sfn|Goldstine|1980|pp=171}} As a six-year-old, he could divide two eight-digit numbers in his head.&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, William, ''Prisoner's Dilemma'', New York: Doubleday 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  When he was sent at the age of 15 to study advanced calculus under analyst [[Gábor Szegő]], Szegő was so astounded with the boy's talent in mathematics that he was brought to tears on their first meeting.{{sfn|Glimm|Impagliazzo|Singer|1990|p=5}}

Nobel Laureate [[Hans Bethe]] said "I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's does not indicate a species superior to that of man".{{sfn|Blair|1957|p=90}} Seeing von Neumann's mind at work, Eugene Wigner wrote,  "one had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch."{{sfn|Wigner|Mehra|Wightman|1995|p=129}} [[Paul Halmos]] states that "von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring."&lt;ref name="Halmos"/&gt; [[Israel Halperin]] said: "Keeping up with him was&amp;nbsp;... impossible.

When [[George Dantzig]] brought von Neumann an unsolved problem in linear programming "as I would to an ordinary mortal", on which there had been no published literature, he was astonished when von Neumann said "Oh, that!", before offhandedly giving a lecture of over an hour, explaining how to solve the problem using the hitherto unconceived [[Linear programming#Duality|theory of duality]].{{sfn|Mirowski|2002|p=258}}

[[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim]] described von Neumann as the "fastest mind I ever met",{{sfn|Goldstine|1980|pp=171}} and [[Jacob Bronowski]] wrote "He was the cleverest man I ever knew, without exception. He was a genius."{{sfn|Bronowski|1974|p=433}} [[George Pólya]], whose lectures at [[ETH Zürich]] von Neumann attended as a student, said "Johnny was the only student I was ever afraid of. If in the course of a lecture I stated an unsolved problem, the chances were he'd come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper."{{sfn|Petković|2009|p=157}} [[Eugene Wigner]] writes: "'Jancsi,' I might say, 'Is angular momentum always an integer of ''h''?'

Halmos recounts a story told by [[Nicholas Metropolis]], concerning the speed of von Neumann's calculations, when somebody asked von Neumann to solve the famous fly puzzle:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TwoTrainsPuzzle.html |title=Fly Puzzle (Two Trains Puzzle) |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=February 15, 2014 |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Two bicyclists start 20 miles apart and head toward each other, each going at a steady rate of 10 mph. At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one, then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels. Question: what total distance did the fly cover? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first, southbound, leg of the trip, then on the second, northbound, leg, then on the third, etc., etc., and, finally, to sum the [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] so obtained.

The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start, so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles.

When the question was put to von Neumann, he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: "Oh, you must have heard the trick before!" "What trick?" asked von Neumann, "All I did was sum the geometric series."&lt;ref name="Halmos"/&gt;}}

Eugene Wigner told a similar story, only with a swallow instead of a fly, and says it was [[Max Born]] who posed the question to von Neumann in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John von Neumann – A Documentary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTS9O0CoVng&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1006|publisher=The Mathematical Association of American|accessdate=22 February 2016|pages=16m46s–19m04s|date=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Neumann was also noted for his [[eidetic memory]] (sometimes called photographic memory). [[Herman Goldstine]] wrote: 

{{quote|One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall. As far as I could tell, von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim; moreover, he could do it years later without hesitation. He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English. On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' started. Whereupon, without any pause, he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes.{{sfn|Goldstine|1980|pp=167}}}}

Von Neumann was reportedly able to memorize the pages of telephone directories. He entertained friends by asking them to randomly call out page numbers; he then recited the names, addresses and numbers therein.{{sfn|Blair|1957|p=90}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ias.edu/von-neumann John von Neumann: Life, Work, and Legacy] Institute of Advanced Study, Princeton&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical legacy ==

"It seems fair to say that if the influence of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived," wrote Miklós Rédei in ''John von Neumann: Selected Letters''.{{sfn|von Neumann|2005|p=7}} [[James Glimm]] wrote: "he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics".{{sfn|Glimm|Impagliazzo|Singer|1990|p=vii}} The mathematician [[Jean Dieudonné]] said that von Neumann "may have been the last representative of a once-flourishing and numerous group, the great mathematicians who were equally at home in pure and applied mathematics and who throughout their careers maintained a steady production in both directions",{{sfn|Dieudonné |2008|p=90}} while [[Peter Lax]] described him as possessing the "most scintillating intellect of this century".{{sfn|Glimm|Impagliazzo|Singer|1990|p=7}} In the foreword of Miklós Rédei's ''Selected Letters'', Peter Lax wrote, "To gain a measure of von Neumann's achievements, consider that had he lived a normal span of years, he would certainly have been a recipient of a Nobel Prize in economics. And if there were Nobel Prizes in computer science and mathematics, he would have been honored by these, too. So the writer of these letters should be thought of as a triple Nobel laureate or, possibly, a {{frac|3|1|2}}-fold winner, for his work in physics, in particular, quantum mechanics".{{sfn|von Neumann|2005|p=xiii}}

== Illness and death ==
[[File:John von neumann tomb 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Von Neumann's gravestone]]
In 1955, von Neumann was diagnosed with what was either [[Bone tumor|bone]] or [[pancreatic cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;While there is a general agreement that the initially discovered bone tumour was a secondary growth, sources differ as to the location of the primary cancer. While Macrae gives it as pancreatic, the ''Life'' magazine article says it was prostate.&lt;/ref&gt; He was not able to accept the proximity of his own demise, and the shadow of impending death instilled great fear in him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Read |first=Colin |title=The Portfolio Theorists: von Neumann, Savage, Arrow and Markowitz |series=Great Minds in Finance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZd9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 |accessdate=September 29, 2017 |year=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0230274143 |page=65 |quote=When von Neumann realised he was incurably ill his logic forced him to realise that he would cease to exist... [a] fate which appeared to him unavoidable but unacceptable.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invited a Roman Catholic priest, Father Anselm Strittmatter, [[Order of Saint Benedict|O.S.B.]], to visit him for consultation.&lt;ref name="Halmos"/&gt; Von Neumann reportedly said, "So long as there is the possibility of eternal damnation for nonbelievers it is more logical to be a believer at the end", essentially saying that [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] had a point, referring to [[Pascal's Wager]]. He had earlier confided to his mother, "There probably has to be a God. Many things are easier to explain if there is than if there isn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macrae|1992|page=379}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thornes2003&gt;{{harvnb|Dransfield|Dransfield|2003|p=124}} "He was brought up in a Hungary in which anti-Semitism was commonplace, but the family were not overly religious, and for most of his adult years von Neumann held agnostic beliefs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ayoub|2004|p=170}} "On the other hand, von Neumann, giving in to Pascal's wager on his death bed, received extreme unction."&lt;/ref&gt; Father Strittmatter administered the [[last rites]] to him.&lt;ref name="Halmos"/&gt; Some of von Neumann's friends (such as [[Abraham Pais]] and Oskar Morgenstern) said they had always believed him to be "completely agnostic".&lt;ref name=Thornes2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pais|2006|p=109}} "He had been completely agnostic for as long as I had known him. As far as I could see this act did not agree with the attitudes and thoughts he had harbored for nearly all his life."&lt;/ref&gt; Of this deathbed conversion, Morgenstern told Heims, "He was of course completely agnostic all his life, and then he suddenly turned Catholic—it doesn't agree with anything whatsoever in his attitude, outlook and thinking when he was healthy."{{sfn|Poundstone|1993|p=194}} Father Strittmatter recalled that even after his conversion, von Neumann did not receive much peace or comfort from it, as he still remained terrified of death.{{sfn|Poundstone|1993|p=194}}

Von Neumann was on his deathbed when he entertained his brother by reciting by heart and word-for-word the first few lines of each page of [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']].{{sfn|Blair|1957|p=104}} He died at age 53 on February 8, 1957, at the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], under military security lest he reveal military secrets while heavily medicated. He was buried at [[Princeton Cemetery]] in Princeton, [[Mercer County, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=380}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The graph is commonly known as the [[Gray graph]].

==Early life and education==
Marion Gray was born in [[Ayr]], Scotland on 26 March 1902 to Marion (née Cameron) and James Gray. She attended Ayr Grammar School (1907–1913) and [[Ayr Academy]] (1913–1919). In 1919 she entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] where she graduated in 1922 with a first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy. She continued on at the University for a further two years as a post doctoral student in mathematics where she was supervised by [[E.T. Whittaker]]. She joined the [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] where she presented several of her papers including 'The equation of telegraphy' and 'The equation of conduction of heat'. She was elected to the Committee of the Society in November 1923 and continued as a member throughout her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Gray_Marion.html|title=Gray_Marion biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 she travelled to the United States under the assistance of both a British graduates scholarship and a [[Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland#Carnegie Scholarships|Carnegie scholarship]] to attend [[Bryn Mawr College]], Pennsylvania from where she gained a PhD under the supervision of [[Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=5890|title=Anna Wheeler - The Mathematics Genealogy Project|website=www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research topic was 'A boundary value problem of ordinary self-adjoint differential equations with singularities'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.de/books?id=IRbOAwAAQBAJ | isbn=978-0-8218-4376-5 | first1 = Judy | last1 = Green | author1-link = Judy Green (mathematician) | first2 = Jeanne | last2 = LaDuke | author2-link = Jeanne LaDuke | title=Pioneering Women in American Mathematics &amp;mdash; The Pre-1940 PhD's | location= | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]], The [[London Mathematical Society]] | series=History of Mathematics | volume=34 | year = 2009 | page = 186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving her doctorate Gray returned to Edinburgh to take a post of university assistant in natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. She held the post for one year before going to London where she was an assistant in mathematics at [[Imperial College]] for three years.

==Employment and the Gray graph==
[[File:Gray graph.svg|thumb|The [[Gray graph]], arranged to show its construction from a 3d grid]]
In 1930 she was appointed to the post of assistant engineer at the Department of Development and Research of the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] in New York. While working there she discovered an unusual [[cubic graph|cubic]] [[semi-symmetric graph]] graph with 54 vertices, representing the 27 points and 27 lines in a 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;3 three-dimensional grid, with an edge for each pair of a point and a line that meet each other. Here, "cubic" means that each vertex is the endpoint of three edges, and "semi-symmetric" means that every two edges are symmetric to each other but the same is not true for the vertices. This graph is the smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graph. Thinking it was a theoretical discovery without practical application Gray did not publish her findings. Thirty-six years later, I. Z. Bouwer rediscovered and described the graph and explained how it could answer questions regarding types of symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | journal = Bulletin of the Canadian Mathematical Society
 | volume = 11 | pages = 533–535 | year = 1968
 | doi = 10.4153/CMB-1968-063-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The graph is commonly known as the Gray graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Gray joined Bell Telephone Laboratories and remained with the company for a further 30 years until her retirement.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate = 14 July 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as her own research articles Gray compiled many reviews of publications on mathematical physics and served on the US Government-related committee which produced the [[Abramowitz and Stegun|Handbook of Mathematical Functions]]. She remained an active member of various professional mathematical societies throughout her career.

Gray was known for her support of junior colleagues. One wrote of the time he was working in Bell Laboratories in 1957, 'In [my calculation], I was helped by a little old lady, Marion Gray, one of Bell's finest mathematicians at that time.’

==Later life==
After her retirement in 1967 Gray moved back to Edinburgh where she died in 1979 aged 77 years.

==Recognition==
Gray was included in the [[National Library of Scotland]]'s display "Celebrating Scottish women of science" which ran from 1 March to 30 April 2013.&lt;ref name="NLS Women of Science"&gt;{{cite web|title='Celebrating Scottish women of science|url=http://www.nls.uk/exhibitions/treasures/women-of-science|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: Let  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be [[Banach space]]. A [[Biorthogonal polynomial|biorthogonal]] system &lt;math&gt;\{x_\alpha ; f_\alpha\}_{x \isin \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Markusevich basis if
:: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\text{span}}\{x_\alpha \} = X&lt;/math&gt;
: and
:: &lt;math&gt;\{ f_\alpha \}_{x \isin \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; separates the points in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Every [[Schauder basis]] of a Banach space is also a Markuschevich basis; the reverse is not true in general. An example of a Markushevich basis that is not a Schauder basis can be the set

: &lt;math&gt;\{e^{2 i \pi n t}\}_{n \isin \mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt;

in the space &lt;math&gt;\tilde{C}[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of complex continuous functions in [0,1] whose values at 0 and 1 are equal, with the [[Uniform norm|sup norm]]. It is an open problem  whether or not every separable Banach space admits a Markushevich basis with &lt;math&gt;\|x_\alpha\|=\|f_\alpha\|=1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20857">'''Method ringing''' (also known as '''scientific ringing''') is a form of [[change ringing]] in which the ringers commit to memory the rules for generating each change of sequence, and pairs of [[bell (instrument)|bells]] are affected. This creates a form of bell music which is continually changing, but which cannot be discerned as a conventional [[melody]].  It is a way of sounding continually changing mathematical [[permutations]].

It is distinct from [[call changes]], where the ringers are instructed how to generate each new change by calls from a conductor, and normally only two adjacent bells swap their position at each change.

In method ringing, the ringers are guided from permutation to permutation by following the rules of a ''method.''  The underlying [[mathematics|mathematical]] basis is intimately linked to [[group theory]]. The basic building block of method ringing is [[Plain hunt]].

The first method, [[Grandsire]],  was designed around 1650, probably by Robert Roan who became master of the [[Ancient Society of College Youths|College Youths]] [[change ringing]] society in 1652.&lt;ref&gt;Change Ringing – The History of an English Art. Vol 1, P56. General Editor J Sanderson.&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the method on five bells appeared in print in 1668 in ''Tintinnalogia'', ([[Fabian Stedman]] with Richard Duckworth) and ''Campanalogia'' (1677 – written solely by Stedman) which are the first two publications on the subject.

The practice originated in [[England]] and remains most popular there today; in addition to bells in [[Bell tower|church towers]], it is also often performed on [[handbell]]s.

==Fundamentals==

===Plain hunt===
{{Main|Plain hunt}}

In method ringing, plain hunt is the simplest form of generating changing permutations in a continuous fashion, and is a fundamental building-block of change ringing methods.
It consists of a plain undeviating course of a bell between the first and last places in the striking order, with two strikes in the first and last position to enable a turn-around.
Thus each bell moves one position at each succeeding change, unless they reach the first or last position, when they remain there for two changes then proceed to the other end of the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, "Learning plain hunt" retrieved 20.3.2017 [https://cccbr.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/index.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

This simple rule can be extended to any number of bells.

===Grandsire===
[[File:Grandsire doubles.png|thumb|The "plain course" of Grandsire Doubles; 30 changes]]
{{main|Grandsire}}
Plain hunting is limited to a small number of possible different changes, which is numerically equal to twice the number of bells that are hunting. However, by introducing deviations from the plain hunt, by causing some of the bells to change their relationship to the others, change ringing "methods" were developed. These allow a large range of possible different changes to be rung; even to the extent of the full factorial sequence of changes.

Grandsire, the oldest change ringing method is based on a simple deviation to the [[plain hunt]] when the treble (bell No.1) is first in the sequence or it is said to "lead". The treble is known as the "hunt bell" because it hunts continuously without ever deviating from the path. The diagram for the plain course is shown here.

The Grandsire variation on the plain hunt on odd numbers adds a second hunt bell, which is "coursing" the treble: that is, the second hunt bell takes its place at the front of the change immediately after the treble. The single deviation away from hunting for the rest of the bells now takes place as the two hunt bells change places at the front of the lead.

Furthermore, because there are two hunt bells, not the second bell but the third remains in place:
 13254 – Treble leads
 12345
 21354 – The second hunt bell, No.2 in this case, leads after the treble. It is coursing it. 
 23145

This forces a dodge on the other bells in 4/5 positions. After this the bells immediately return to the plain hunt pattern until the next treble lead.

This rule can now be extended to any number of odd bells in changes, making Grandsire an easily extendable method. The hunt bell is changed many times during such ringing to enable the full factorial number of changes to be achieved.

===Plain Bob===
[[Image:Plain-bob-minor 2.png|200px|right|thumb|The plain course of Plain Bob Minor – 60 changes. For clarity the bottom row is repeated at the top of the next column. The course of the treble (No.1) is blue, and is plain hunt. Others change their pattern when No. 1 is first.]]

"Plain Bob" is one of the oldest change ringing and simplest of these, first named "Grandsire Bob". It has the added flexibility over Grandsire of being able to expand logically to both odd and even numbers of bells; also, The deviations when a plain course is extended with "calls", are much simpler,

A "plain course" of plain bob minor is shown in diagrammatic form, which has the characteristics;
#all bells plain hunt, until the treble bell is first, when depending where they are in the pattern, they; 
#perform "Dodges" in the 3–4 position 
#or perform dodges in the 5–6 positions, 
#or sit for two blows if they are just above the treble, then go first again.

The red bell track shows the order of "works", which are deviations from the plain hunt.
#3/4 down dodge
#5/6 down dodge
#5/6 up dodge
#3/4 up dodge
#make 2nds place.
And then it repeats. Each bells starts at a different place in this cyclical order. 
A dodge means just that; two bells dodge round each other, thus changing their relationship to the treble, and giving rise to different changes.

The plain bob pattern can be extended beyond the constraints of the plain course, to the full unique 720 changes possible ( this is factorial 6 on 6 bells, which is 1×2×3×4×5×6 = 720 changes). To do this, at set points in the sequences one of the ringers, called the "conductor" calls out commands such as "bob" or "single", which introduce further variations. The conductor follows a "composition" which they have to commit to memory. This enables the other ringers to produce large numbers of unique changes without memorising huge quantities of data, without any written prompts.

Ringers can also ring different methods, with different "works" – so there is a huge variety of ways of ringing method changes.

{{Listen|filename=Bob Minor, Synthesised Bell Sounds.ogg|title=Plain Bob Minor|description=Plain Bob Minor played using synthesised bell sounds. The bells start ringing rounds followed by a plain course of Plain Bob Minor (60 of the 720 changes that are possible on six bells) and finish in rounds again.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

==Key points==

===Numbering the bells===
The highest bell in pitch is known as the ''treble'' and the lowest the ''tenor''. The majority of bell towers have the ring of bells (or ropes) going clockwise from the treble. For convenience, the bells are referred to by number, with the treble being number 1 and the other bells numbered by their pitch (2, 3, 4, etc.) sequentially down the scale.  The bells are usually tuned to a [[diatonic]] major [[musical scale|scale]], with the tenor bell being the tonic (or key) note of the scale.

===Ringing rounds and changes===
The simplest way to use a set of bells is ringing ''rounds'', which is sounding the bells repeatedly in sequence from treble to tenor: 1, 2, 3, etc.. (Musicians will recognise this as a portion of a descending scale.) Ringers typically start with rounds and then begin to vary the bells' order, moving on to a series of distinct ''rows''. Each row (or ''change'') is a specific permutation of the bells (for example 123456 or 531246)—that is to say, it includes each bell rung once and only once, the difference from row to row being the order in which the bells follow one another. [[Plain hunt]] is the simplest way of creating bell permutations, or changes.

===Obtaining the maximum unique changes===
Since permutations are involved, it is natural that for some people the ultimate theoretical goal of change ringing is to ring the bells in every possible permutation; this is called an ''extent'' (in the past this was sometimes referred to as a ''full peal''). For a method on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bells, there are &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; (read [[factorial]]) possible permutations, a number which quickly grows as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; increases. For example, while on six bells there are 720 permutations, on 8 bells there are 40,320; furthermore, 10! = 3,628,800, and 12! = 479,001,600.

===Key rules of valid method ringing===
===="Truth" of a ringing method====
Estimating two seconds for each change (a reasonable pace), we find that while an extent on 6 bells can be accomplished in half an hour, a full peal on 8 bells should take nearly twenty-two and a half hours and one on 12 bells would take over thirty years! Naturally, then, except in towers with only a few bells, ringers typically can only ring a subset of the available permutations. But the key stricture of an extent, uniqueness (any row may only be rung once), is considered essential. This is called ''truth''; to repeat any row would make the performance ''false''.

====Allowable position changes====
Another key limitation keeps a given bell from moving up or back more than a single place from row to row; if it rings (for instance) fourth in one row, in the next row it can only ring third, fourth, or fifth. Thus from row to row each bell either keeps its place or swaps places with one of its neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Ringers sometimes experiment with ignoring this rule, making a "jump change."&lt;/ref&gt; This rule has its origins in the physical reality of tower bells: a bell, swinging through a complete revolution with every row, has considerable [[inertia]] and the ringer has only a limited ability to accelerate or retard its cycle.

====Start and finish with "rounds".====
A third key rule mandates ''rounds'' as the start and end of all ringing. So to summarize: any performance must start out from rounds, visit a number of other rows (whether all possible permutations or just a subset thereof) but only once each, and then return safely to rounds, all the while making only small neighbour-swaps from row to row. These rules dramatically limit the options open to a method-maker.

For example, consider a tower with four bells. An extent includes 4[[factorial|!]] = 24 changes and there are, naturally, 24! possible orders in which to ring each change once, which is about 6.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;. But once we limit ourselves to neighbour-swaps and to starting and ending with rounds, only 10,792 possible extents remain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.ubc.ca/~holroyd/minimus.html Minimus extents]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason for methods===
It is to navigate this complex terrain that various ''methods'' have been developed; they allow the ringers to plot their course ahead of time without needing to memorize it all (an impossible task) or to read it off a numbingly repetitive list of numbers. Instead, by combining a pattern short and simple enough for ringers to memorize with a few regular breaking points where simple variations can be introduced, a robust [[algorithm]] is formed. This is the essence of method ringing.

===Lead===
A lead is part of the plain course.  It commences when the method starts and lasts until the treble gets back to the same place.  In the diagram of ''Plain Bob Minor'' shown, the lead starts when the treble rings in second place and lasts until the treble has rung twice at lead.  It is common practice in diagrams to draw a line under the lead end to assist in understanding the method.  Most methods have a plain course consisting of a number of leads where the pattern is the same, but different bells are in differing places.  In the diagram given, the number 4 bell rings the same pattern as the number 2, but one lead earlier.

In ''principles'' (where the treble does the same work as other bells and is affected by calls) the definition of a lead can become more complex.

===Calls and compositions===

[[File:Grandsire bobs and singles.png|thumb|Showing the effects of bobs and singles]]
To obtain more changes than available in the plain course, a ''conductor'' makes a ''call'' directing the ringers to make a slight variation in the course. (The most common calls are called ''bobs'' and ''singles''.) These variations usually last only one change, but cause two or more ringers to swap their paths, whereupon they continue with the normal pattern. By introducing such calls appropriately, repetition can be avoided, with the peal remaining ''true'' over a large number of changes. For example, an extent in a minor method is 720 (6!) changes, so would require 12 repetitions of the plain course shown.

To know when to make calls and which ones to make, a conductor follows a plan called a ''composition'' which he or someone else devised; if properly constructed it will ensure a true performance of the desired length. Today [[computers]] make checking a composition's truth easy; but the process once involved a mix of mathematics and laborious row-by-row checking.

Probably the greatest composer &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Unassuming Genius|last=Davies|first=Michael B|publisher=The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers|year=2007|isbn=0-900271-88-4|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 20th century was [[Albert J Pitman]], who composed over a hundred &lt;ref&gt;email from Alan Glover, CCCBR Librarian 29-07-2016&lt;/ref&gt; peals between 1910 and 1965, entirely by hand. None of his compositions was then, nor since, discovered to be false.

===Place Notation (shorthand)===
[[File:Place notation.png|thumb|Place notation in English-style change ringing]]
As well as writing out the changes longhand (as in the accompanying illustration of Plain Bob Minor) there is a shorthand called ''Place Notation''.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, R G T : Place Notation: Central Council of Church Bell Ringers : 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  For each row in which all bells change place, such as the first change, use an "x" or a "-".  In rows where one or more bells stay in place write down the ''place numbers'' which do not change, so that the second row is written "16".  Plain Bob Minor is therefore x16x16x16x16x16x12.

Many methods are symmetrical, and so only the first half lead is given, along with possibly the lead end.  Plain Bob Minor is thus: x16x16x16 le:12.  Where two changes consisting of numbers follow each other, use a dot to separate them.  Plain Bob Doubles (i.e. on 5 bells) is: 5.1.5.1.5 le:125, or if written at full length 5.1.5.1.5.1.5.1.5.125.

==Method names==
Methods are generally referred to by an official name assigned to them by the [[Central Council of Church Bell Ringers]]; such names have three standard parts: the method's name proper, its ''class'', and its ''stage''.

The name proper is the method's personal name. The oldest methods have long-established names; but new methods are constantly being devised and rung, and the Central Council generally allows each to be named by the band which first rings a peal in it. Most often these methods end up with a place name, such as the band's village; but people's names and still more fanciful inventions are not uncommon.

The ''class'' describes the method, putting it in some established category of methods that work in similar ways. Methods in the simplest category omit this second name and use a simple two-part name.

The ''stage'' indicates the number of bells, using unique terminology:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break|gap=2em}}
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Bells
! Stage name
|-
| 3
| Singles
|-
| 5
| Doubles
|-
| 7
| Triples
|-
| 9

|-
| 6
| Minor
|-
| 8
| Major
|-
| 10
| Royal
|-
| 12
| Maximus
|}
{{col-end}}

As can be seen, there are different naming systems for even- and odd-bell stages. The odd-bell stage names refer to the number of possible swaps that can be made from row to row; in ''caters'' and ''cinques'' can be seen the [[French language|French]] numbers ''quatre'' and ''cinq'' while the stage name for three-bell ringing is indeed "singles". Higher odd-bell stages follow the same pattern (''sextuples'', ''septuples'', etc.) while higher even-bell stages have more prosaic names: ''fourteen'', ''sixteen'', etc.).

Note that the names refer to the number of bells being permuted, which is not necessarily the same as the number being rung: for it is typical to ring triples methods not on seven bells but on eight, with the tenor ''covering'': only the seven highest bells permute; the eighth and lowest bell is simply rung last in every row. So likewise with caters, usually rung on ten bells, and other higher odd-bell stages.

Put together, this system gives method names sound that is evocative, musical, and quaint: ''Kent Treble Bob Major'', ''Grandsire Caters'', ''Erin Triples'', ''Chartres Delight Royal'', ''Percy's Tea Strainer Treble Place Major'', ''Titanic Cinques'' and so forth.

=="Performances"==
A short composition, lasting perhaps only a few hundred changes, is called a ''touch'', which got its name from the 16th-century expression a "touch" of music, meaning "a brief piece of instrumental music".;&lt;ref&gt;''Change ringing – the history of an English Art''. Vol 2, W T Cook &amp; Cyril A Wratten. Pub Central Council of Church Bell Ringers.  P6&lt;/ref&gt; However many ringers look forward to the greater challenge of a ''quarter peal'' (about 1,250 changes) or a ''[[peal]]'' (about 5,000 changes), which is referred to as a "Performance".

This number derives from the great 17th-century quest to ring a full extent on seven bells; 7 [[factorial]] is 5,040. Sturdier bellframes and more clearly understood methods make the task easier today; but a peal still needs about 3 hours of labour and concentration.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Most ringers follow the definition of a peal as regulated by the Central Council. This requires a minimum of only 5,000 changes where major or a higher stage is being rung; but demands at least the full 5,040 changes on lower stages. For triples, this ensures at least a full extent; for lower stages a full extent falls well short of the goal and ringers must complete several full extents to reach 5,040 (working out mathematically to at least 7 extents on six bells, at least 42 on five, or at least 210 on four; three-bell peals are not recognised by the Central Council).&lt;ref&gt;In addition to several consecutive full extents, when attempting a peal on six or fewer bells the central council also permits "round blocks of two or more extents in which each of the possible rows at that stage occurs the same number of times"&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify as a peal, the ringing must meet a number of other key criteria. Among other things, each bell must be rung continuously by the same person; a ringing band cannot swap in a person to give ringers an occasional break. Likewise the ringing must be done entirely from memory; ringers cannot consult the method's blue line nor can the conductor (who must be one of the ringers) have a written reminder of the composition.

More commonly rung is the quarter peal, typically consisting of 1,260 changes and typically taking 45 minutes to ring. Half peals are more rarely rung, but have been known. One example is in Buckfast Abbey in Devon, where there are two half peal boards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7622">In [[mathematic]]s an '''operand''' is the object of a [[mathematical operation]], i.e. it is the object or quantity that is operated on.&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example ==
The following [[arithmetic]] expression shows an example of operators and operands:

:&lt;math&gt;3 + 6 = 9&lt;/math&gt;

In the above example, '+' is the symbol for the operation called [[addition]]. 

The '''operand''' '3' is one of the inputs (quantities) followed by the addition [[Operator_(mathematics)|operator]], and the operand '6' is the other input necessary for the operation.

The result of the operation is 9. (The number '9' is also called the sum of the augend 3 and the addend 6.)

An operand, then, is also referred to as "one of the inputs (quantities) for an operation".

==Notation==

===Expressions as operands===
Operands may be complex, and may consist of expressions also made up of operators with operands.

:&lt;math&gt;(3 + 5) \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expression '(3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5)' is the first operand for the multiplication operator and '2' the second. The operand '(3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5)' is an expression in itself, which contains an addition operator, with the operands '3' and '5'.

===Order of operations===
{{See also|Order of operations}}
Rules of precedence affect which values form operands for which operators:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publish.aps.org/files/styleguide-pr.pdf |title=Physical Review Style and Notation Guide |publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|accessdate=5 August 2012|at=Section IV&amp;ndash;E&amp;ndash;2&amp;ndash;e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;3 + 5 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

In the above expression, the multiplication operator has the higher precedence than the addition operator, so the multiplication operator has operands of '5' and '2'. The addition operator has operands of '3' and '5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2'.

===Positioning of operands===
Depending on the [[mathematical notation]] being used the position of an operator in relation to its operand(s) may vary. In everyday usage [[infix notation]] is the most common,&lt;ref name="Infix, Postfix and Prefix"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs212/fix.html | title=The Implementation and Power of Programming Languages | accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however other notations also exist, such as the [[prefix notation|prefix]] and [[postfix notation|postfix]] notations. These alternate notations are most common within [[computer science]].

Below is a comparison of three different notations — all represent an addition of the numbers '1' and '2'

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2&lt;/math&gt; (infix notation)

:&lt;math&gt;+\;1\;2&lt;/math&gt; (prefix notation)

:&lt;math&gt;1\;2\;+&lt;/math&gt; (postfix notation)

===Infix notation and the order of operation===
{{main|Order of operations}}

In a mathematical expression, the order of operation is carried out from left to right. Start with the left most value and seek the first operation to be carried out in accordance with the order specified above (i.e., start with parentheses and end with the addition/subtraction group). For example, in the expression

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - (2 + 2^2)&lt;/math&gt;,

the first operation to be acted upon is any and all expressions found inside a parenthesis. So beginning at the left and moving to the right, find the first (and in this case, the only) parenthesis, that is, (2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Within the parenthesis itself is found the expression 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reader is required to find the value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; before going any further. The value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 4. Having found this value, the remaining expression looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - (2 + 4)&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to calculate the value of expression inside the parenthesis itself, that is, (2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6. Our expression now looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 2^2 - 6&lt;/math&gt;

Having calculated the parenthetical part of the expression, we start over again beginning with the left most value and move right. The next order of operation (according to the rules) is exponents. Start at the left most value, that is, 4, and scan your eyes to the right and search for the first exponent you come across. The first (and only) expression we come across that is expressed with an exponent is 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  We find the value of 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 4. What we have left is the expression

:&lt;math&gt;4 \times 4 - 6&lt;/math&gt;.

The next order of operation is multiplication. 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4 is 16. Now our expression looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;16 - 6&lt;/math&gt;

The next order of operation according to the rules is division. However, there is no division operator sign (÷) in the expression, 16&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;6. So we move on to the next order of operation, i.e., addition and subtraction, which have the same precedence and are done left to right.

:&lt;math&gt;16 - 6 = 10&lt;/math&gt;. 

So the correct value for our original expression, 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), is 10. 

It is important to carry out the order of operation in accordance with rules set by convention. If the reader evaluates an expression but does not follow the correct order of operation, the reader will come forth with a different value. The different value will be the incorrect value because the order of operation was not followed. The reader will arrive at the correct value for the expression if and only if each operation is carried out in the proper order.

===Arity===
The number of operands of an operator is called its [[arity]].&lt;ref name="Hazewinkel2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michiel Hazewinkel]]|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, Supplement III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47YC2h295JUC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-0198-7|page=3}}: "Each connective has associated with it a natural number, called its ''rank'', or ''arity''."&lt;/ref&gt; Based on arity, operators are classified as nullary (no operands), [[unary operation|unary]] (1 operand), [[binary operation|binary]] (2 operands), [[ternary operation|ternary]] (3 operands) etc.

==Computer science==
In computer [[programming language]]s, the definitions of [[operator (programming)|operator]] and '''operand''' are almost the same as in mathematics.

In computing, an '''operand''' is the part of a computer instruction which specifies what data is to be manipulated or operated on, while at the same time representing the data itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author =Nell Dale and John Lewis
  |title = Computer Science Illuminated, 5th Edition
  |year = 2012
  |publisher = Jones and Bartlett
  |ISBN =978-1449672843
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A computer instruction describes an operation such as add or multiply X, while the operand (or operands, as there can be more than one) specify on which X to operate as well as the value of X.

Additionally, in [[assembly language]], an '''operand''' is a value (an argument) on which the [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]], named by [[mnemonic]], operates.  The operand may be a [[processor register]], a [[memory address]], a literal constant, or a label.  A simple example (in the [[x86]] architecture) is
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="asm"&gt;
MOV DS, AX
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
where the value in register operand &lt;code&gt;AX&lt;/code&gt; is to be moved (&lt;code&gt;[[MOV (x86 instruction)|MOV]]&lt;/code&gt;) into register &lt;code&gt;DS&lt;/code&gt;. Depending on the [[instruction set|instruction]], there may be zero, one, two, or more operands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1439">In [[mathematics]], the '''Parry–Sullivan invariant''' (or '''Parry–Sullivan number''') is a numerical quantity of interest in the study of [[incidence matrix|incidence matrices]] in [[graph theory]], and of certain one-dimensional [[dynamical systems]]. It provides a partial classification of non-trivial irreducible incidence matrices.

It is named after the English mathematician [[Bill Parry (mathematician)|Bill Parry]] and the American mathematician [[Dennis Sullivan]], who introduced the invariant in a joint paper published in the journal [[Topology (journal)|''Topology'']] in 1975.

==Definition==

Let ''A'' be an ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' incidence matrix. Then the '''Parry–Sullivan number''' of ''A'' is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PS} (A) = \det (I - A), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''I'' denotes the ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' identity matrix.

==Properties==

It can be shown that, for nontrivial irreducible incidence matrices, flow equivalence is completely determined by the Parry–Sullivan number and the [[Bowen–Franks group]].

[[Image:Penrose-dreieck.svg|thumb|192px|Penrose triangle]]
[[File:Penrose-triangle-4color-rotation.gif|thumb|A rotating penrose triangle model to show illusion]]
The '''Penrose triangle''', also known as the '''Penrose tribar,''' or the '''impossible tribar''',&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, T. "The Impossible Tribar." The Joy of Mathematics. San Carlos, CA: Wide World Publ./Tetra, p. 13, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; is a triangular [[impossible object]]. It was first created by the Swedish artist [[Oscar Reutersvärd]] in 1934. The psychiatrist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his [[mathematician]] son [[Roger Penrose]] independently devised and popularized it in the 1950s, describing it as "impossibility in its purest form". It is featured prominently in the works of artist [[M. C. Escher]], whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it.

==Impossible object==
The tribar appears to be a [[solid]] object, made of three straight beams of square cross-section which meet pairwise at right angles at the vertices of the [[triangle]] they form. The beams may be broken, forming cubes or cuboids.

[[File:Perth Impossible Triangle.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Impossible triangle sculpture as an [[optical illusion]], East Perth, Western Australia]]
This combination of properties cannot be realized by any three-dimensional object in ordinary [[Euclidean space]].  Such an object can exist in certain Euclidean [[3-manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Francis|first=George|title=A topological picturebook|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=1988|ISBN=0-387-96426-6}}  In the chapter on the Penrose tribar, Francis attributes this observation to [[John Stillwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;  There also exist three-dimensional solid shapes each of which, when viewed from a certain angle, appears the same as the 2-dimensional depiction of the Penrose triangle on this page (such as – for example – the adjacent image depicting a sculpture in [[Perth]], [[Australia]]).  The term "Penrose triangle" can refer to the 2-dimensional depiction or the impossible object itself.

[[M.C. Escher]]'s [[lithograph]] ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'' (1961) depicts a watercourse that flows in a zigzag along the long sides of two elongated Penrose triangles, so that it ends up two stories higher than it began. The resulting waterfall, forming the short sides of both triangles, drives a [[water wheel]]. Escher helpfully points out that in order to keep the wheel turning some water must occasionally be added to compensate for [[evaporation]].

[[File:Penrosetrianglemodel.jpg|thumb|A 3D-printed version of the Reutersvard Triangle illusion]]
[[Image:LargeTribarGotschuchenAustria.JPG|thumb|200px|Impossible Triangle sculpture, Gotschuchen, Austria]]
If a line is traced around the Penrose triangle, a 4-loop [[Möbius strip]] is formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=Mathematical Games, August 1978 A Möbius band has a finite thickness, and so it is actually a twisted prism|publisher=SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, A DIVISION OF NATURE AMERICA, INC.|year=1978|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although the tribar is named one of the impossible objects, there exist many more that fit into the same category. Other impossible objects include the [[impossible trident|devil's fork]], the [http://brainden.com/images/elephant-big.gif dancing elephant], and [http://brainden.com/images/impossible-arch-big.jpg impossible arch].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BrainDen.com – Impossible Objects|url = http://brainden.com/impossible-objects.htm|website = BrainDen.com|access-date = 2016-02-09|first = Jan|last = Adamovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Penrose polygons==
While it is possible to construct analogies to the Penrose triangle with other shapes and regular polygons to create a Penrose polygon, the visual effect is not as striking, and as the sides increase, the object seems merely to be warped or twisted.

A '''phase portrait''' is a geometric representation of the trajectories of a [[dynamical system]] in the [[phase plane]]. Each set of initial conditions is represented by a different curve, or point.

Phase portraits are an invaluable tool in studying dynamical systems. They consist of a [[plot (graphics)|plot]] of typical trajectories in the [[state space]]. This reveals information such as whether an [[attractor]], a [[repellor]] or [[limit cycle]] is present for the chosen parameter value. The concept of [[topological conjugacy|topological equivalence]] is important in classifying the behaviour of systems by specifying when two different phase portraits represent the same qualitative dynamic behavior. An attractor is a stable point which is also called 'sink'. The repellor is considered as an unstable point, which is also known as 'source'.  

A phase portrait graph of a dynamical system depicts the system's trajectories (with arrows) and stable steady states (with dots) and unstable steady states (with circles) in a state space. The axes are of state variables.

==Examples==
*[[Simple pendulum]], see picture (right).
*Simple [[harmonic oscillator]] where the phase portrait is made up of ellipses centred at the origin, which is a fixed point.
*[[Van der Pol oscillator]] see picture (bottom right).
* [[Complex_quadratic_polynomial#Parameter_plane|Parameter plane (c-plane)]] and [[Mandelbrot set]]

== Phase Portraits to Visualize Behavior of Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations ==
A phase portrait represents the directional behavior of a system of ODEs. The phase portrait can indicate the stability of the system. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Haynes Miller, and Arthur Mattuck.

{{ProbabilityTopics}}
'''[[Probability]] and [[Statistics]]''' or also called '''[[Statistics]] and [[Probability]]''' are two related but separate [[academic discipline]]s. [[Statistical analysis]] often uses [[probability distribution]]s, and the two topics are often studied together. However, [[probability theory]] contains much that is mostly of [[mathematics|mathematical]] interest and not directly relevant to statistics. Moreover, many topics in statistics are independent of probability theory. {{dubious|date=July 2014}}

The  polynomials are given in terms of [[basic hypergeometric function]]s and the [[Pochhammer symbol]] by 
:&lt;math&gt;p_n(q^{-x}+q^{x+1}cd;a,b,c,d;q) = {}_4\phi_3\left[\begin{matrix} q^{-n} &amp;abq^{n+1}&amp;q^{-x}&amp;q^{x+1}cd\\
aq&amp;bdq&amp;cq\\ \end{matrix};q;q\right]&lt;/math&gt;
They are sometimes given with changes of variables as
:&lt;math&gt;W_n(x;a,b,c,N;q) = {}_4\phi_3\left[\begin{matrix} q^{-n} &amp;abq^{n+1}&amp;q^{-x}&amp;cq^{x-n}\\
aq&amp;bcq&amp;q^{-N}\\ \end{matrix};q;q\right]&lt;/math&gt;

He is best known for his [[Bott periodicity theorem]], the [[Morse–Bott function]]s which he used in this context, and the [[Borel–Bott–Weil theorem]].

==Early life==
Bott was born in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], the son of Margit Kovács and Rudolph Bott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6gRAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Raoul%20Bott%22%20Margit%20Kovacs&amp;dq=%22Raoul%20Bott%22%20Margit%20Kovacs&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Notable Twentieth-century Scientists: A-E|first1=Emily J.|last1=McMurray|first2=Jane Kelly|last2=Kosek|first3=Roger M.|last3=Valade|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Gale Research|accessdate=28 October 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was of Austrian descent, and his mother was  of Hungarian Jewish descent; Bott was raised a Catholic by his mother and stepfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bott.html|title=Bott biography|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/notices/200605/fea-bott-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bott grew up in [[Czechoslovakia]] and spent his working life in the [[United States]]. His family emigrated to [[Canada]] in 1938, and subsequently he served in the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Army]] in [[Europe]] during [[World War II]].

==Career==
Bott later went to college at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], where he studied [[electrical engineering]]. He then earned a [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1949. His thesis, titled ''Electrical Network Theory'', was written under the direction of Richard Duffin. Afterward, he began teaching at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]]. Bott continued his study at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage/b?page=12|title=Community of Scholars |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310034202/http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/frontpage/b?page=12 |archive-date=2013-03-10 |publisher=[[Institute for Advanced Study]]|author=|date=|website=ias.edu|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a professor at [[Harvard University]] from 1959 to 1999. In 2005 Bott died of [[cancer]] in [[San Diego]].

With  [[Richard Duffin]] at Carnegie Mellon, Bott studied existence of [[electronic filter]]s corresponding to given  [[positive-real function]]s.  In 1949 they proved&lt;ref&gt;[[John H. Hubbard]] (2010) "The Bott-Duffin Synthesis of Electrical Circuits", pp 33 to 40 in ''A Celebration of the Mathematical Legacy of Raoul Bott'', P. Robert Kotiuga editor, CRM Proceedings and Lecture Notes #50, [[American Mathematical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;  a fundamental theorem of [[network synthesis filters|filter synthesis]]. Duffin and Bott extended earlier work by [[Otto Brune]] that requisite functions of [[complex frequency]] ''s'' could be realized by a [[passive filter|passive network]] of [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s. The proof, relying on [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the sum of the [[degree of a polynomial|degrees of the polynomials]] in the numerator and denominator of the rational function, was published in [[Journal of Applied Physics]], volume 20, page 816.
In his 2000 interview&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Allyn, "Interview with Raoul Bott", [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] 48 (2001), no. 4, 374–382.&lt;/ref&gt; with Allyn Jackson of the [[American Mathematical Society]], he explained that he sees "networks as discrete versions of harmonic theory", so his experience with [[network synthesis filters#Driving point impedance|network synthesis]] and [[electronic filter topology]] introduced him to algebraic topology.

Bott met [[Arnold S. Shapiro]] at the IAS and they worked together.
He studied the [[homotopy theory]] of [[Lie group]]s, using methods from [[Morse theory]], leading to the [[Bott periodicity theorem]] (1957). In the course of this work, he introduced [[Morse–Bott function]]s, an important generalization of [[Morse function]]s.

This led to his role as collaborator over many years with [[Michael Atiyah]], initially via the part played by periodicity in [[K-theory]]. Bott made important contributions towards the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem|index theorem]], especially in formulating related [[fixed-point theorem]]s, in particular the so-called '[[Woods Hole fixed-point theorem]]', a combination of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] and [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]] (it is named after [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], the site of a conference at which collective discussion formulated it).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whoi.edu/science/MPC/dept/meetings/atiyah_bott_35.html]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The major Atiyah–Bott papers on what is now the [[Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem]] were written in the years up to 1968; they collaborated further in recovering in contemporary language [[Ivan Petrovsky]] on [[Petrovsky lacuna]]s of [[hyperbolic partial differential equation]]s, prompted by [[Lars Gårding]]. In the 1980s, Atiyah and Bott investigated [[gauge theory]], using the [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills equations]] on a Riemann surface to obtain topological information about the [[moduli space]]s of stable bundles on Riemann surfaces. In 1983 he spoke to the Canadian Mathematical Society in a talk he called "A topologist marvels at Physics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. Bott |year=1985 |title=On some recent interactions between mathematics and physics |journal=[[Canadian Mathematical Bulletin]] |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=129–164 |doi=10.4153/CMB-1985-016-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also well known in connection with the [[Borel–Bott–Weil theorem]] on representation theory of Lie groups via holomorphic [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] and their cohomology groups; and for work on [[foliation]]s.

He introduced [[Bott–Samelson varieties]] and the [[Bott residue formula]] for complex manifolds and the [[Bott cannibalistic class]].

==Awards==
In 1964, he was awarded the [[Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry]] by the [[American Mathematical Society]]. In 1983, he was awarded the [[Jeffery–Williams Prize]] by the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]]. In 1987, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=49|title=The President's National Medal of Science: Recipient Details - NSF - National Science Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he received the [[Wolf Prize]]. In 2005, he was elected an Overseas Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]].

==Students==
Bott had 35 Ph.D. students, including [[Stephen Smale]], [[Lawrence Conlon]], [[Daniel Quillen]], [[Peter Landweber]], [[Robert MacPherson (mathematician)|Robert MacPherson]], [[Robert W. Brooks]], [[Robin Forman]], [[András Szenes]], and [[Kevin Corlette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=7583|title=Raoul Bott - The Mathematics Genealogy Project|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[retirement]], individuals stop working and no longer get employment earnings, and enter a phase of their lives, where they rely on the [[assets]] they have accumulated, to supply money for their spending needs for the rest of their lives.  '''Retirement spend-down''', or '''withdrawal rate''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Retirement Savings: Choosing a Withdrawal Rate That Is Sustainable|url = http://www.aaii.com/journal/article/retirement-savings-choosing-a-withdrawal-rate-that-is-sustainable|website = www.aaii.com|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Retirement Rules: Rethinking a 4% Withdrawal Rate|url = http://online.barrons.com/articles/retirement-rules-time-to-rethink-a-4-withdrawal-rate-1428722900|accessdate = 2015-06-05|first = Reshma|last = Kapadia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Much To Withdraw From Retirement Savings|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2013/06/10/how-much-to-withdraw-from-retirement-savings/|accessdate = 2015-06-05|first = Next|last = Avenue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4% withdrawal rate in retirement unrealistic in real world, researchers say|url = http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20140227/FREE/140229880/4-withdrawal-rate-in-retirement-unrealistic-in-real-world|website = www.investmentnews.com|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How much can I withdraw in retirement? {{!}} Vanguard|url = https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/retirement/withdrawal-in-retirement-tool|website = personal.vanguard.com|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the strategy a retiree follows to spend, decumulate or withdraw assets during retirement.

[[Retirement planning]] aims to prepare individuals for retirement spend-down, because the different spend-down approaches available to retirees depend on the decisions they make during their working years.  [[Actuaries]] and [[financial planner]]s are experts on this topic.

== Importance ==
More than 10,000 [[Post-World War II baby boom]]ers will retire in the United States every day between now and 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infre.org/|title=International Foundation for Retirement Education (InFRE)|publisher=Infre.org|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This represents the majority of the more than 78 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964.  74% of these people are expected to be alive in 2030, which highlights that most of them will live for many years beyond retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seniorcitizens.com/Baby_Boomers|title=seniorcitizens.com|publisher=Seniorcitizens.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 2000, 1 in every 14 people was age 65 or older. By the year 2050, more than 1 in 6 people are projected to be at least 65 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-economics-080213-041304|title=Financing Old Age Dependency|publisher=Annual Review of Economics |volume=6 |doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080213-041304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following statistics emphasize the importance of a well-planned retirement spend-down strategy for these people:

*87% of workers do not feel very confident about having enough money to retire comfortably.&lt;ref name="ebri.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebri.org/pdf/briefspdf/EBRI_IB_4-2009_RCS1.pdf|format=PDF|title=The 2009 Retirement Confidence Survey: Economy Drives Confidence to Record Lows; Many Looking to Work Longer |publisher=Ebri.org|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*80% of retirees do not feel very confident about maintaining financial security throughout their remaining lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.aarp.org/yourmoney/retirement/articles/for_many_retiring_will_mean_tighter_belts.html|title=Daily News - Articles &amp; Info on Health, Money, Social Security, Medicare, Politics - Bulletin Today|work=AARP|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*49% of workers over age 55 have less than $50,000 of [[savings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebri.org/pdf/FFE119.16April09.Final.pdf|format=PDF|title=How Much Have American Workers Saved for Retirement? |publisher=Ebri.org|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*25% of workers have not saved at all for retirement.&lt;ref name="ebri.org"/&gt;
*35% of workers are not currently saving for retirement.&lt;ref name="ebri.org"/&gt;
*56% of workers have not tried to calculate their income needs in retirement.&lt;ref name="ebri.org"/&gt;

== Longevity risk ==
{{main|Longevity risk}}
Individuals each have their own retirement aspirations, but all retirees face [[longevity risk]] – the risk of outliving their assets.  This can spell financial disaster.  Avoiding this risk is therefore a baseline goal that any successful retirement spend-down strategy addresses. Generally, longevity risk is greatest for low and middle income individuals.

The probabilities of a 65-year-old living to various ages are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Retirement Income Challenges |publisher=New York Life Investment Management |date=2009 |url=http://www.nylim.com/mainstayfunds/0,2058,20_12007218,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604090422/http://www.nylim.com/mainstayfunds/0,2058,20_12007218,00.html |archivedate=June 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longevity risk is largely underestimated.  Most retirees do not expect to live beyond age 85, let alone into their 90s.  A 2007 study of recently retired individuals asked them to rank the following risks in order of the level of concern they present:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/spending-investing-retirement.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715150152/http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/spending-investing-retirement.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2007 |title=Spending and Investing in Retirement: Is there a Strategy? |publisher=Society of Actuaries, LIMRA |first=Mathew |last=Greenwald |first2=Sally A. |last2=Bryck |first3=Eric T. |last3=Sondergeld |location=U.S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Health care]] costs
*Inflation
*[[Investment]] risk
*Maintaining lifestyle
*Need for long-term care
*Outliving assets (longevity risk)
 
Longevity risk was ranked as the least concerning of these risks.

== Withdrawal rate ==
{{further|William Bengen|Trinity study}}
A portion of retirement income often comes from savings; colloquially, "tapping into the [[wikt:nest egg|Nest Egg]]". These present a number of variables:
* how savings are invested (e.g., cash, stocks, bonds, real estate), and how this changes over time
* inflation during retirement
* how quickly savings are spent – the ''withdrawal rate''
Often, investments will change through retirement, becoming more conservative as one ages, but often continuing to hold risky investments, in the hope of investment gains. A number of approaches exist in [[target date fund]]s, for instance.

A common [[rule of thumb]] for withdrawal rate is 4%, based on 20th century American investment returns, and first articulated in {{harvtxt|Bengen|1994}},&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0523/investing-retirement-bill-bengen-savings-spending-solution.html |title=The Retirement Spending Solution |first=William P. |last=Barrett |date=May 4, 2011 |magazine=Forbes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231001943/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0523/investing-retirement-bill-bengen-savings-spending-solution.html/ |archivedate=December 31, 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one conclusion of the [[Trinity study]] (1998). This particular rule and approach have been heavily criticized, as have the methods of both sources, with critics arguing that withdrawal rates should vary with investment style (which they do in Bengen) and returns, and that this ignores the risk of emergencies and rising expenses (e.g., medical or long-term care). Others question the suitability of matching relatively fixed expenses with risky investment assets.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

New dynamic adjustment methods for retirement withdrawal rates have been developed after Bengen's 4% withdrawal rate was proposed: constant inflation-adjusted spending, Bengen's floor-and-ceiling rule, and Guyton and Klinger's decision rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = New Math for Retirees and the 4% Withdrawal Rule |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/your-money/some-new-math-for-the-4-percent-retirement-rule.html |newspaper = The New York Times |date = May 8, 2015 |issn = 0362-4331 |first = Tara Siegel |last = Bernard |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113072703/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/your-money/some-new-math-for-the-4-percent-retirement-rule.html |archivedate=January 13, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A more dynamic approach to spending for investors in retirement |url = http://www.vanguard.com/pdf/icrmda.pdf |publisher=The Vanguard Group |first=Colleen M. |last=Jaconetti |last2=Kinniry |first2=Francis M.

To decide a withdrawal rate, history shows the maximum sustainable inflation-adjusted withdrawal rate over rolling 30-year periods for three hypothetical stock and bond portfolios from 1926–2014. Stocks are represented by the S&amp;P 500 Index, bonds by an index of five-year U.S. Treasury bonds.   During the best 30-year period withdrawal rates of 10%  annually could be used with a 100% success rate. The worst 30-year period had a maximum withdrawal rate of 3.5%.  A  4% withdrawal rate survived most 30 year periods.  The higher the stock allocation the higher rate of success. A portfolio of 75% stocks is more volatile but had higher maximum withdrawal rates.   Starting with  a withdrawal rate near 4% and a minimum 50% equity allocation in retirement gave a higher probability of success in historical 30 year periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What History Says About Safe Retirement-Withdrawal Rates|url = http://www.morningstar.com/cover/videocenter.aspx?id=733605 |publisher=Morningstar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204221647/http://www.morningstar.com/cover/videocenter.aspx?id=733605 |archivedate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |first=Timothy |last=Strauts |date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources of retirement income ==
Individuals may receive retirement income from a variety of sources:

*Personal savings and interest
*Retirement savings plans (i.e., [[individual retirement account|individual retirement account (United States)]], [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan|Registered Retirement Savings Plan (Canada)]])
*[[Defined contribution plan]]s (i.e., [[401(k)]], [[403(b)]], SIMPLE, [[457(b)]], etc.)
*[[Defined benefit pension plan]]s
*[[Social Insurance]] (i.e., [[Canada Pension Plan]], [[Old Age Security|Old Age Security (Canada)]], [[National Insurance|National Insurance (United Kingdom)]], [[Social Security (United States)]])
*Rental income
*Annuities
*Dividends
*Sale of assets to provide income

Each has unique risk, eligibility, tax, timing, form of payment, and distribution considerations that should be integrated into a retirement spend-down strategy.

== Modeling retirement spend-down: traditional approach ==
Traditional retirement spend-down approaches generally take the form of a gap analysis.  Essentially, these tools collect a variety of input variables from an individual and use them to project the likelihood that the individual will meet specified retirement goals.  They model the shortfall or surplus between the individual's retirement income and expected spending needs to identify whether the individual has adequate resources to retire at a particular age.  Depending on their sophistication, they may be [[stochastic]] (often incorporating [[Monte Carlo simulation]]) or deterministic.

''Standard input variables''

*Current age
*Expected retirement date or age
*[[Life expectancy]]
*Current savings
*Savings rate
*Current salary
*Salary increase rate
*[[Tax rate]]
*[[Inflation rate]]
*[[Rate of return]] on investments
*Expected retirement expenses

''Additional input variables that can enhance model sophistication''

*Marital status
*Spouse's age
*Spouse's assets
*Health status
*Medical expense inflation
*Estimated social security benefit
*Estimated benefits from employer sponsored plans
*[[Asset class]] weights comprising personal savings
*Detailed expected retirement expenses
*Value of home and [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] balance
*[[Life insurance]] holdings
*Expected post-retirement part-time income

''Output''

*Shortfall or surplus

There are three primary approaches utilized to estimate an individual's spending needs in retirement:
*Income replacement ratios: financial experts generally suggest that individuals need at least 70% of their pre-retirement income to maintain their standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/financial_planning/sessionseven/can_you_afford_to_retire.html|title=Save Money, Avoid Scams and Get Financial Advice - AARP|work=AARP|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This approach is criticized from the standpoint that expenses, such as those related to health care, are not stable over time.
*[[Consumption smoothing]]: under this approach individuals develop a target expenditure pattern, generally far before retirement, that is intended to remain level throughout their lives.  Proponents argue that individuals often spend conservatively earlier in their lives and could increase their overall utility and living standard by smoothing their consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-perspective-retirement.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620024746/http://www.soa.org/files/pdf/research-perspective-retirement.pdf|date=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Direct expense modeling: with the help of financial experts, individuals attempt to estimate future expenses directly, using projections of inflation, health care costs, and other variables to provide a framework for the analysis.

== Adverse impact of market downturn and lower interest rates ==
Market volatility can have a significant impact on both a worker's retirement preparedness and a retiree's retirement spend-down strategy.  The [[global financial crisis of 2008&amp;ndash;2009]] provides an example. American workers lost an estimated $2 trillion in retirement savings during this time frame.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebri.org/pdf/WSJ_Emp-Bens-Supp_02Apr09.pdf|format=PDF|title=Tough Responsibilities in a Tough Era|publisher=Ebri.org|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 54% of workers lost confidence in their ability to retire comfortably due the direct impact of the market turmoil on their retirement savings.&lt;ref name="ebri.org"/&gt;

[[Asset allocation]] contributed significantly to these issues. Basic investment principles recommend that individuals reduce their [[equity investment]] exposure as they approach retirement. Studies show, however, that 43% of 401(k) participants had equity exposure in excess of 70% at the beginning of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebri.org/pdf/briefspdf/EBRI_IB_2-2009_Crisis-Impct.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Impact of the Recent Financial Crisis on 401(k) Account Balances|publisher=Ebri.org|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] [[financial economist]]s have argued that durably low interest rates in most G20 countries will have an adverse impact on the underfunding condition of pension funds as "without returns that outstrip inflation, pension investors face the real value of their savings declining rather than ratcheting up over the next few years" &lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|author=M. Nicolas J. Firzli quoted in Sinead Cruise |title= 'Zero Return World Squeezes Retirement Plans' |url= https://www.cnbc.com/id/48484139 |work=Reuters with CNBC |date= Aug 4, 2012|accessdate=5  Aug 2012| location=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1982 until 2011, most Western economies experienced a period of low inflation combined with relatively high returns on investments across all [[asset class]]es including government bonds. This brought a certain sense of complacency amongst some pension [[actuarial]] consultants and [[regulator (economics)|regulator]]s, making it seem reasonable to use optimistic economic assumptions to calculate the [[present value]] of future pension liabilities.

The potentially long-lasting collapse in returns on [[government bond]]s is taking place against the backdrop of a protracted fall in returns for other core-assets such as [[blue chip (stock market)|blue chip]] [[stock]]s, and, more importantly, a silent demographic shock. Factoring in the corresponding [[longevity risk]], pension [[Insurance premium|premiums]] could be raised significantly while [[disposable income]]s stagnate and employees work longer years before retiring.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

== Coping with retirement spend-down challenges ==
Longevity risk becomes more of a concern for individuals when their retirement savings are depleted by asset losses.  Following the market downturn of 2008–09, 61% of working baby boomers are concerned about outliving their retirement assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whymetlife.com/trends/downloads/MetLife_EBTS09.pdf|format=PDF|title=Findings from the national survey of employers and employees|publisher=Whymetlife.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Traditional spend-down approaches generally recommend three ways they can attempt to address this risk:

*Save more (spend less)
*Invest more aggressively
*Lower their standard of living

Saving more and investing more aggressively are difficult strategies for many individuals to implement due to constraints imposed by current expenses or an aversion to increased risk.  Most individuals also are averse to lowering their standard of living.  The closer individuals are to retirement, the more drastic these measures must be for them to have a significant impact on the individuals' retirement savings or spend-down strategies.

== Postponing retirement ==
Individuals tend to have significantly more control over their retirement ages than they do over their savings rates, asset returns, or expenses. As a result, postponing retirement can be an attractive option for individuals looking to enhance their retirement preparedness or recover from investment losses. The relative impact that delaying retirement can have on an individual's retirement spend-down is dependent upon specific circumstances, but research has shown that delaying retirement from age 62 to age 66 can increase an average worker's retirement income by 33%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crr.bc.edu/images/stories/myths_and_realities.pdf?phpMyAdmin=43ac483c4de9t51d9eb41] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Postponing retirement minimizes the probability of running out of retirement savings in several ways:

*Additional returns are earned on savings that otherwise would be paid out as retirement income
*Additional savings are accumulated from a longer wage-earning period
*The post-retirement period is shortened
*Other sources of retirement income increase in value (Social Security, defined contribution plans, defined benefit pension plans)

Studies show that nearly half of all workers expect to delay their retirement because they have accumulated fewer retirement assets than they had planned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Much of this is attributable to the market downturn of 2008&amp;ndash;2009. Various unforeseen circumstances cause nearly half of all workers to retire earlier than they intend.&lt;ref name="ebri.org"/&gt; In many cases, these individuals intend to work part-time during retirement.  Again, however, statistics show that this is far less common than intentions would suggest.&lt;ref name="ebri.org"/&gt;

== Modeling retirement spend-down: alternative approach ==
The appeal of retirement age flexibility is the focal point of an [[actuarial]] approach to retirement spend-down that has spawned in response to the surge of baby boomers approaching retirement.  The approach is based on a [[supply and demand]] model where supply and demand represent the following, which vary across different retirement ages:

*Supply = the number of post-retirement years an individual's financial resources are expected to cover
*Demand = the number of post-retirement years an individual is expected to live

Under this approach, individuals can specify a desired probability of retirement spend-down success.  Unlike traditional spend-down approaches, retirement age is an output.  It is identified by the intersection of the supply and demand curves.  This framework allows individuals to quantify the impact of any adjustments to their financial circumstances on their optimal retirement age.

== Similarity to individual asset/liability modeling ==
Most approaches to retirement spend-down can be likened to individual [[asset/liability modeling]].  Regardless of the strategy employed, they seek to ensure that individuals' assets available for retirement are sufficient to fund their post-retirement [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and expenses. This is elaborated in [[dedicated portfolio theory]].

'''SKEW''' is the [[ticker symbol]] for the '''CBOE Skew Index''', a measure of the perceived [[tail risk]] of the distribution of [[S&amp;P 500]] [[rate of return|investment returns]] over a 30-day horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cboe.com/products/vix-index-volatility/volatility-indicators/skew|author=Chicago Board Options Exchange|title=Introduction to CBOE SKEW Index|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The index values are calculated and published by the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] (CBOE) based on current S&amp;P 500 [[option (finance)|options]] market data.

SKEW is similar to the [[VIX]] index, but instead of measuring [[implied volatility]] based on a [[normal distribution]], measures an implied risk of future returns realizing [[outlier]] behavior. The index model defines such an outlier as two or more [[standard deviations]] below the mean, which would characterize a [[black swan theory|black swan]] event or [[market crash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/3467846-skew-index-predictive-s-and-p-500|title=Is The SKEW Index Predictive For The S&amp;P 500?|author=John Abbink|quote=SKEW ...  indicates the degree to which the median return is expected to differ from the mean, and the extent to which the distribution will include more and/or more extreme outliers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The index value typically reflects trading activity of portfolio managers hedging tail risk with options, to protect portfolios from a large, sudden decline in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/options/2016/02/options-skew-below-surface-74973|title=Volatility Update: Options Skew Requires Look Below the Surface|author=Frederic Ruffy|date=18 February 2016|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A SKEW value of 100 indicates the options market perceives a low risk of outlier returns; values increasing above 100 reflect an increased perception of risk for future outlier event(s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2797">In mathematics, '''Schreier's lemma''' is a [[theorem]] in [[group theory]] used in the [[Schreier–Sims algorithm]] and also for finding a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] of a [[subgroup]]. 

==Definition==

Suppose &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a [[subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, which is finitely generated with generating set  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, that is, ''G'' = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \langle S\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. 

Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a right [[Transversal (combinatorics)|transversal]] of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is (the image of) a [[Section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the quotient map &lt;math&gt;G \to H\backslash G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H\backslash G&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of '''right cosets''' of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

We make the definition that given &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the chosen representative in the transversal &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the coset &lt;math&gt;Hg&lt;/math&gt;, that is, 
:&lt;math&gt;g\in H\overline{g}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is generated by the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{rs(\overline{rs})^{-1}|r\in R, s\in S\}&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==
Let us establish the evident fact that the group '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = '''Z'''/3'''Z''' is indeed cyclic. Via [[Cayley's theorem]], '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a subgroup of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Now,
: &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}_3=\{ e, (1\ 2\ 3), (1\ 3\ 2) \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;S_3= \{ e, (1\ 2), (1\ 3), (2\ 3), (1\ 2\ 3), (1\ 3\ 2) \}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the identity permutation. Note ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\langle&lt;/math&gt;{ ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=(1 2), ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 2 3) }&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has just two cosets, '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; \ '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, so we select the transversal { ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e'', ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=(1 2) }, and we have 
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
t_1s_1 = (1\ 2),&amp;\quad\text{so}\quad&amp;\overline{t_1s_1} = (1\ 2)\\
t_1s_2 = (1\ 2\ 3) ,&amp;\quad\text{so}\quad&amp; \overline{t_1s_2} = e\\
t_2s_1 = e         ,&amp;\quad\text{so}\quad&amp; \overline{t_2s_1} = e\\
t_2s_2 = (2\ 3) ,&amp;\quad\text{so}\quad&amp; \overline{t_2s_2} = (1\ 2). \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, 
: &lt;math&gt;t_1s_1\overline{t_1s_1}^{-1} = e&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t_1s_2\overline{t_1s_2}^{-1} = (1\ 2\ 3)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t_2s_1\overline{t_2s_1}^{-1} = e &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t_2s_2\overline{t_2s_2}^{-1} = (1\ 2\ 3).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, by Schreier's subgroup lemma, { e, (1 2 3) } generates '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but having the identity in the generating set is redundant, so we can remove it to obtain another generating set for '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, { (1 2 3) } (as expected).

'''Single-shot multi-contrast x-ray imaging''' is an efficient and a robust x-ray imaging technique which is used to obtain three different and complimentary information, i.e. absorption, scattering, and [[phase-contrast X-ray imaging|phase contrast]] from a single exposure of x-rays on a detector subsequently utilizing [[Fourier analysis|Fourier analysis/technique]]. Absorption is mainly due to the attenuation and [[Compton scattering]] from the object, while phase contrast corresponds to phase shift of x-rays.

The technique obtain images from the biological and non-biological objects. The research purposes include radiography, scattering imaging, differential phase contrast, and diffraction imaging. It is also possible to adjust and modify the experiment based on what information is of most importance. Almost every application that utilize this technique have the same approach, mathematics and science behind it such as the experimental setup,complementary information and [[Fourier analysis]].

Single-shot multi-contrast x-ray imaging gained its importance recently in contrast to [https://www.univie.ac.at/qfp/research/matterwave/talbotlau/index.html Talbot–Lau interferometer] because of the less optical element such as [[diffraction grating]]s being used under it and hence obtaining every information digitally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10214">[[File:Rectrangular parallelepiped.png|thumb|150px|[[Rectangular parallelepiped]]. The line through segment AD and the line through segment B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;B are skew lines because they are not in the same plane.]]
[[File:Nested hyperboloids.png|thumb|300px|A [[fiber bundle|fibration]] of [[projective space]] by skew lines on nested [[hyperboloid]]s.]]
In [[three-dimensional geometry]], '''skew lines''' are two [[Line (geometry)|line]]s that do not [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] and are not [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]]. A simple example of a pair of skew lines is the pair of lines through opposite edges of a [[regular tetrahedron]].  Two lines that both lie in the same plane must either cross each other or be parallel, so skew lines can exist only in three or more [[dimension]]s. Two lines are skew if and only if they are not [[coplanar]].

== General position ==
If four points are chosen at random [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]] within a unit [[cube]], they will [[almost surely]] define a pair of skew lines. After the first three points have been chosen, the fourth point will define a non-skew line if, and only if, it is coplanar with the first three points. However, the plane through the first three points forms a subset of measure zero of the cube, and the probability that the fourth point lies on this plane is zero. If it does not, the lines defined by the points will be skew.

Similarly, in three-dimensional space a very small perturbation of any two parallel or intersecting lines will almost certainly turn them into skew lines. Therefore, any four points in [[general position]] always form skew lines.

In this sense, skew lines are the "usual" case, and parallel or intersecting lines are special cases.

==Formulas==
===Testing for skewness===
If each line in a pair of skew lines is defined by two [[Point (geometry)|point]]s that it passes through, then these four points must not be coplanar, so they must be the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of a [[tetrahedron]] of nonzero [[volume]]. Conversely, any two pairs of points defining a tetrahedron of nonzero volume also define a pair of skew lines. Therefore, a test of whether two pairs of points define skew lines is to apply the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of its four vertices. Denoting one point as the 1×3 vector {{math|'''a'''}} whose three elements are the point's three coordinate values, and likewise denoting {{math|'''b'''}}, {{math|'''c'''}}, and {{math|'''d'''}} for the other points, we can check if the line through {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} is skew to the line through {{math|'''c'''}} and {{math|'''d'''}} by seeing if the tetrahedron volume formula gives a non-zero result:

:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{1}{6}\left|\det\left[\begin{matrix}\mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b} \\ \mathbf{b}-\mathbf{c} \\ \mathbf{c}-\mathbf{d} \end{matrix}\right]\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

===Distance===
To calculate the distance between two skew lines the lines may be expressed using vectors:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{a} + \lambda \mathbf{b};&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{c} + \mu \mathbf{d}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the 1×3 vector {{math|'''x'''}} represents an arbitrary point on the line through particular point {{math|'''a'''}} with {{math|'''b'''}} representing the direction of the line and with the value of the real number &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; determining where the point is on the line, and similarly for arbitrary point {{math|'''y'''}} on the line through particular point {{math|'''c'''}} in direction {{math|'''d'''}}.

The [[cross product]] of '''b''' and '''d''' is perpendicular to the lines, as is the [[unit vector]]

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} = \frac{\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}}{|\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}|} &lt;/math&gt;
The distance between the lines is then&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=Line-LineDistance|title= Line-Line Distance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; d = |\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a})|.&lt;/math&gt;

(if |'''b''' × '''d'''| is zero the lines are parallel and this method cannot be used).

=== Nearest Points ===
Expressing the two lines as vectors:

Line 1: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}=\mathbf{p_1}+t_1\mathbf{d_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Line 2: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_2}=\mathbf{p_2}+t_2\mathbf{d_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[cross product]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d_2}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to the lines.

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n}= \mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The plane formed by the translations of Line 2 along &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; contains the point &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p_2}&lt;/math&gt; and is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n_2}= \mathbf{d_2} \times (\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2})&lt;/math&gt;.



Therefore, the intersecting point of Line 1 with the above-mentioned plane, which is also the point on Line 1 that is nearest to Line 2 is given by

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{c_1}=\mathbf{p_1}+ \frac{(\mathbf{p_2}-\mathbf{p_1})\cdot\mathbf{n_2}}{\mathbf{d_1}\cdot\mathbf{n_2}} \mathbf{d_1}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the point on Line 2 nearest to Line 1 is given by (where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n_1}= \mathbf{d_1} \times (\mathbf{d_2} \times \mathbf{d_1})&lt;/math&gt;




&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{c_2}=\mathbf{p_2}+ \frac{(\mathbf{p_1}-\mathbf{p_2})\cdot\mathbf{n_1}}{\mathbf{d_2}\cdot\mathbf{n_1}} \mathbf{d_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{c_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{c_2}&lt;/math&gt; form the shortest line segment joining Line 1 and Line 2.

==More than two lines==
===Configurations===
A ''configuration'' of skew lines is a set of lines in which all pairs are skew. Two configurations are said to be ''isotopic'' if it is possible to continuously transform one configuration into the other, maintaining throughout the transformation the invariant that all pairs of lines remain skew. Any two configurations of two lines are easily seen to be isotopic, and configurations of the same number of lines in dimensions higher than three are always isotopic, but there exist multiple non-isotopic configurations of three or more lines in three dimensions {{harv|Viro|Viro|1990}}. The number of nonisotopic configurations of ''n'' lines in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, starting at ''n'' = 1, is
:1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 19, 74, ... {{OEIS|id=A110887}}.

===Ruled surfaces===
If one rotates a line ''L'' around another line ''M'' skew but not perpendicular to it, the [[surface of revolution]] swept out by ''L'' is a [[hyperboloid of one sheet]]. For instance, the three hyperboloids visible in the illustration can be formed in this way by rotating a line ''L'' around the central white vertical line ''M''. The copies of ''L'' within this surface form a [[regulus (geometry)|regulus]]; the hyperboloid also contains a second family of lines that are also skew to ''M'' at the same distance as ''L'' from it but with the opposite angle that form the opposite regulus. The two reguli display the hyperboloid as a [[ruled surface]].

An [[affine transformation]] of this ruled surface produces a surface which in general has an elliptical cross-section rather than the circular cross-section produced by rotating L around L'; such surfaces are also called hyperboloids of one sheet, and again are ruled by  two families of mutually skew lines.  A third type of ruled surface is the [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]. Like the hyperboloid of one sheet, the hyperbolic paraboloid has two families of skew lines; in each of the two families the lines are parallel to a common plane although not to each other.  Any three skew lines in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; lie on exactly one ruled surface of one of these types {{harv|Hilbert|Cohn-Vossen|1952}}.

===Gallucci's theorem===
If three skew lines all meet three other skew lines, any transversal of the first set of three meets any transversal of the second set.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. S. M. Coxeter]] (1969) ''Introduction to Geometry'', 2nd edition, page 257, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Gallucci (1906) "Studio della figua delle otto rette e sue applicazioni alla geometria del tetraedro ed alla teoria della configurazioni", ''Rendiconto dell’Accademia della Scienza fisiche e matematiche'' (3) 12: 49–79&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skew flats in higher dimensions ==
In higher-dimensional space, a [[Flat (geometry)|flat]] of dimension ''k'' is referred to as a ''k''-flat. Thus, a line may also be called a 1-flat.

Generalizing the concept of ''skew lines'' to ''d''-dimensional space, an ''i''-flat and a ''j''-flat may be '''skew''' if 
{{math|''i'' + ''j'' &amp;lt; ''d''}}. As with lines in 3-space, skew flats are those that are neither parallel nor intersect.

In [[affine geometry|affine ''d''-space]], two flats of any dimension may be parallel.
However, in [[projective geometry|projective space]], parallelism does not exist; two flats must either intersect or be skew.
Let {{math|''I''}} be the set of points on an ''i''-flat, and let {{math|''J''}} be the set of points on a ''j''-flat.
In projective ''d''-space, if {{math|''i'' + ''j'' ≥ ''d''}} then the intersection of {{math|''I''}} and {{math|''J''}} must contain a (''i''+''j''&amp;minus;''d'')-flat. (A ''0''-flat is a point.)

In either geometry, if {{math|''I''}} and {{math|''J''}} intersect at a ''k''-flat, for {{math|''k'' ≥ 0}}, then the points of {{math|''I'' ∪ ''J''}} determine a (''i''+''j''&amp;minus;''k'')-flat.

[[Image:Tutte polynomial and chromatic polynomial of the Bull graph.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^4+x^3+x^2y&lt;/math&gt; is the Tutte polynomial of the [[bull graph]]. The red line shows the intersection with the plane &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;, equivalent to the chromatic polynomial.]]

The '''Tutte polynomial''', also called the '''dichromate''' or the '''Tutte–Whitney polynomial''', is a [[graph polynomial]]. It is a [[polynomial]] in two variables which plays an important role in [[graph theory]]. It is defined for every [[undirected graph]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and contains information about how the graph is connected. It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;T_G&lt;/math&gt;.

The importance of this polynomial stems from the information it contains about &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Though originally studied in [[algebraic graph theory]] as a generalisation of counting problems related to [[graph coloring]] and [[nowhere-zero flow]], it contains several famous other specialisations from other sciences such as the [[Jones polynomial]] from [[knot theory]] and the partition functions of the [[Potts model]] from [[statistical physics]]. It is also the source of several central [[computational problem]]s in [[theoretical computer science]].

The Tutte polynomial has several equivalent definitions. It is equivalent to Whitney’s '''rank polynomial''', Tutte’s own '''dichromatic polynomial''' and Fortuin–Kasteleyn’s '''random cluster model''' under simple transformations. It is essentially a [[generating function]] for the number of edge sets of a given size and connected components, with immediate generalisations to [[matroid]]s. It is also the most general [[graph invariant]] that can be defined by a deletion–contraction recurrence. Several textbooks about graph theory and matroid theory devote entire chapters to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bollobás|1998|loc=chapter 10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biggs|1993|loc=chapter 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Godsil|Royle|2004|loc=chap. 15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Definition.''' For an undirected graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; one may define the '''Tutte polynomial''' as

:&lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)=\sum\nolimits_{A\subseteq E} (x-1)^{k(A)-k(E)}(y-1)^{k(A)+|A|-|V|},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k(A)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s of the graph &lt;math&gt;(V,A)&lt;/math&gt;. In this definition it is clear that &lt;math&gt;T_G&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined and a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same definition can be given using slightly different notation by letting &lt;math&gt;r(A)=|V|-k(A)&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[rank (graph theory)|rank]] of the graph &lt;math&gt;(V,A)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the '''Whitney rank generating function''' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;R_G(u,v)=\sum\nolimits_{A\subseteq E} u^{r(E)-r(A)} v^{|A|-r(A)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The two functions are equivalent under a simple change of variables:

:&lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)=R_G(x-1,y-1).&lt;/math&gt;

Tutte’s '''dichromatic polynomial''' &lt;math&gt;Q_G&lt;/math&gt; is the result of another simple transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)=(x-1)^{-k(G)} Q_G(x-1,y-1).&lt;/math&gt;

Tutte’s original definition of &lt;math&gt;T_G&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent but less easily stated. For connected &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; we set

:&lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)=\sum\nolimits_{i,j} t_{ij} x^iy^j,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of [[Spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning tree]]s of ''internal activity'' &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and ''external activity'' &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.

A third definition uses a '''deletion–contraction recurrence'''. The [[edge contraction]] &lt;math&gt;G/uv&lt;/math&gt; of graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the graph obtained by merging the vertices &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and removing the edge &lt;math&gt;uv&lt;/math&gt;. We write &lt;math&gt;G - uv&lt;/math&gt; for the graph where the edge &lt;math&gt;uv&lt;/math&gt; is merely removed. Then the Tutte polynomial is defined by the recurrence relation

:&lt;math&gt;T_G= T_{G-e}+T_{G/e},&lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is neither a [[Loop (graph theory)|loop]] nor a [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridge]], with base case

:&lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)= x^i y^j, &lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; bridges and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; loops and no other edges. Especially, &lt;math&gt;T_G=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; contains no edges.

The '''random cluster model''' from statistical mechanics due to {{harvtxt|Fortuin|Kasteleyn|1972}} provides yet another equivalent definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sokal|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;Z_G(q,w)=\sum\nolimits_{F\subseteq E}q^{k(F)}w^{|F|}&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;T_G&lt;/math&gt; under the transformation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sokal|2005|loc=eq. (2.26)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_G(x, y)=(x-1)^{-k(E)}(y-1)^{-|V|} \cdot Z_G\Big((x-1)(y-1),\; y-1\Big).&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties===
The Tutte polynomial factors into connected components: If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the union of disjoint graphs &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H'&lt;/math&gt; then
: &lt;math&gt;T_G= T_H \cdot T_{H'}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is planar and &lt;math&gt;G^*&lt;/math&gt; denotes its [[dual graph]] then

: &lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)= T_{G^*} (y,x)&lt;/math&gt;

Especially, the chromatic polynomial of a planar graph is the flow polynomial of its dual.

===Examples===
Isomorphic graphs have the same Tutte polynomial, but the converse is not true. For example, the Tutte polynomial of every tree on &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; edges is &lt;math&gt;x^m&lt;/math&gt;.

Tutte polynomials are often given in tabular form by listing the coefficients &lt;math&gt;t_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x^iy^j&lt;/math&gt; in row &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and column &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the Tutte polynomial of the [[Petersen graph]],

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
36 x &amp;+ 120 x^2 + 180 x^3 + 170x^4+114x^5 + 56x^6 +21 x^7 + 6x^8 + x^9 \\
&amp;+ 36y +84 y^2 + 75 y^3 +35 y^4 + 9y^5+y^6 \\
&amp;+ 168xy + 240x^2y +170x^3y +70 x^4y + 12x^5 y \\
&amp;+ 171xy^2+105 x^2y^2 + 30x^3y^2 \\
&amp;+ 65xy^3 +15x^2y^3 \\
&amp;+10xy^4,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==History==
[[W. T. Tutte]]’s interest in the [[deletion–contraction formula]] started in his undergraduate days at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], originally motivated by [[perfect rectangle]]s and [[Spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning tree]]s. He often applied the formula in his research and “wondered if there were other interesting [[graph invariant|functions of graphs, invariant under isomorphism]], with similar recursion formulae.”&lt;ref name="Tutte-2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Tutte|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. M. Foster]] had already observed that the [[chromatic polynomial]] is one such function, and Tutte began to discover more. His original terminology for graph invariants that satisfy the deletion–contraction recursion was ''W-function'', and ''V-function'' if multiplicative over components. Tutte writes, “Playing with my ''W-functions'' I obtained a two-variable polynomial from which either the chromatic polynomial or the flow-polynomial could be obtained by setting one of the variables equal to zero, and adjusting signs.”&lt;ref name="Tutte-2004"/&gt; Tutte called this function the ''dichromate'', as he saw it as a generalization of the chromatic polynomial to two variables, but it is usually referred to as the Tutte polynomial.  In Tutte’s words, “This may be unfair to [[Hassler Whitney]] who knew and used analogous coefficients without bothering to affix them to two variables.” (There is “notable confusion”&lt;ref&gt;Welsh.&lt;/ref&gt; about the terms ''dichromate'' and ''dichromatic polynomial'', introduced by Tutte in different paper, and which differ only slightly.) The generalisation of the Tutte polynomial to matroids was first published by Crapo, though it appears already in Tutte’s thesis.&lt;ref name="Farr 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Farr|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of the work in [[algebraic graph theory]], Potts began studying the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of certain models in [[statistical mechanics]] in 1952. The work by Fortuin and Kasteleyn&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fortuin|Kasteleyn|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[random cluster model]], a generalisation of the [[Potts model]], provided a unifying expression that showed the relation to the Tutte polynomial.&lt;ref name="Farr 2007"/&gt;

== Specialisations==
At various points and lines of the &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;-plane, the Tutte polynomial evaluates to quantities that have been studied in their own right in diverse fields of mathematics and physics. Part of the appeal of the Tutte polynomial comes from the unifying framework it provides for analysing these quantities.

===Chromatic polynomial===
{{Main|Chromatic polynomial}}

[[Image:Chromatic in the Tutte plane.jpg|thumb|right|The chromatic polynomial drawn in the Tutte plane]]

At &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt;, the Tutte polynomial specialises to the chromatic polynomial,

:&lt;math&gt;\chi_G(\lambda) = (-1)^{|V|-k(G)} \lambda^{k(G)} T_G(1-\lambda,0),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k(G)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of connected components of ''G''.

For integer λ the value of chromatic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; equals the number of [[vertex colouring]]s of ''G'' using a set of λ colours. It is clear that &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on the set of colours. What is less clear is that it is the evaluation at λ of a polynomial with integer coefficients.  To see this, we observe:
# If ''G'' has ''n'' vertices and no edges, then &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(\lambda) = \lambda^n&lt;/math&gt;.
# If ''G'' contains a loop (a single edge connecting a vertex to itself), then &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(\lambda) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# If ''e'' is an edge which is not a loop, then
::&lt;math&gt;\chi_G(\lambda) = \chi_{G\setminus e}(\lambda) - \chi_{G/e}(\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

The three conditions above enable us to calculate &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, by applying a sequence of edge deletions and contractions; but they give no guarantee that a different sequence of deletions and contractions will lead to the same value. The guarantee comes from the fact that &lt;math&gt;\chi_G(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; counts something, independently of the recurrence. In particular,

:&lt;math&gt;T_G(2,0) = (-1)^{|V|} \chi_G(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

gives the number of acyclic orientations.

===Jones polynomial===
{{Main|Jones polynomial}}

[[Image:Jones in the Tutte plane.jpg|thumb|right|The Jones polynomial drawn in the Tutte plane]]

Along the hyperbola &lt;math&gt;xy=1&lt;/math&gt;, the Tutte polynomial of a planar graph specialises to the [[Jones polynomial]] of an associated [[alternating knot]].

===Individual points===

====(2,1)====
&lt;math&gt;T_G(2,1)&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of [[tree (graph theory)|forest]]s, i.e., the number of acyclic edge subsets.

====(1,1)====
&lt;math&gt;T_G(1,1)&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of spanning forests (edge subsets without cycles and the same number of connected components as ''G'').  If the graph is connected, &lt;math&gt;T_G(1,1)&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of spanning trees.

====(1,2)====
&lt;math&gt;T_G(1,2)&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of spanning subgraphs (edge subsets with the same number of connected components as ''G'').

====(2,0)====
&lt;math&gt;T_G(2,0)&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of [[acyclic orientation]]s of ''G''.&lt;ref name="Welsh-1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Welsh|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====(0,2)====
&lt;math&gt;T_G(0,2)&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of [[Robbins theorem|strongly connected orientations]] of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Las Vergnas|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====(0,−2)====
If ''G'' is a 4-regular graph, then 
:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^{|V|+k(G)}T_G(0,-2)&lt;/math&gt; 
counts the number of [[Eulerian orientation]]s of ''G''. Here &lt;math&gt;k(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of connected components of ''G''.&lt;ref name="Welsh-1999"/&gt;

====(3,3)====
If ''G'' is the ''m''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''n'' [[grid graph]], then &lt;math&gt;2 T_G(3,3)&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of ways to tile a rectangle of width 4''m'' and height 4''n'' with [[tetromino|T-tetrominoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Korn|Pak|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Korn|Pak|2003}} for combinatorial interpretations of many other points.&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''G'' is a [[planar graph]], then &lt;math&gt;2 T_G(3,3)&lt;/math&gt; equals the sum over weighted Eulerian orientations in a [[medial graph]] of ''G'', where the weight of an orientation is 2 to the number of saddle vertices of the orientation (that is, the number of vertices with incident edges cyclicly ordered "in, out, in out").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Las Vergnas|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potts and Ising models===
{{Main|Ising model|Potts model}}

[[Image:Potts and Ising in the Tutte plane.jpg|thumb|right|The partition functions for the Ising model and the 3- and 4-state Potts models drawn in the Tutte plane.]]

Define the hyperbola in the ''xy''−plane:

:&lt;math&gt; H_2: \quad (x-1)(y-1)=2,&lt;/math&gt;

the Tutte polynomial specialises to the partition function, &lt;math&gt;Z(\cdot),&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Ising model]] studied in [[statistical physics]]. Specifically, along the hyperbola &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; the two are related by the equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welsh|1993|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z(G) = 2\left(e^{-\alpha}\right)^{|E| - r(E)} \left(4 \sinh \alpha \right )^{r(E)}  T_G \left (\coth \alpha, e^{2 \alpha} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

In particular,

:&lt;math&gt;(\coth \alpha - 1) \left(e^{2 \alpha} - 1 \right ) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

for all complex α.

More generally, if for any positive integer ''q'', we define the hyperbola:

:&lt;math&gt;H_q: \quad (x-1)(y-1)=q,&lt;/math&gt;

then the Tutte polynomial specialises to the partition function of the ''q''-state [[Potts model]]. Various physical quantities analysed in the framework of the Potts model translate to specific parts of the &lt;math&gt;H_q&lt;/math&gt;.

===Flow polynomial===
{{Main|Nowhere-zero flow}}

[[Image:Flow in the Tutte plane.jpg|thumb|right|The flow polynomial drawn in the Tutte plane]]

At &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, the Tutte polynomial specialises to the flow polynomial studied in combinatorics. For a connected and undirected graph ''G'' and integer ''k'', a nowhere-zero ''k''-flow is an assignment of “flow” values &lt;math&gt;1,2,\dots,k-1&lt;/math&gt; to the edges of an arbitrary orientation of ''G'' such that the total flow entering and leaving each vertex is congruent modulo ''k''. The flow polynomial &lt;math&gt;C_G(k)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of nowhere-zero ''k''-flows. This value is intimately connected with the chromatic polynomial, in fact, if ''G'' is a [[planar graph]], the chromatic polynomial of ''G'' is equivalent to the flow polynomial of its [[dual graph]] &lt;math&gt;G^*&lt;/math&gt; in the sense that

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem (Tutte).'''

:&lt;math&gt;C_G(k)=k^{-1} \chi_{G^*}(k).&lt;/math&gt;

The connection to the Tutte polynomial is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;C_G(k)= (-1)^{|E|-|V|+k(G)} T_G(0,1-k).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reliability polynomial===
{{Main|Connectivity (graph theory)}}

[[Image:Reliability in the Tutte plane.jpg|thumb|right|The reliability polynomial drawn in the Tutte plane]]

At &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;, the Tutte polynomial specialises to the all-terminal reliability polynomial studied in network theory. For a connected graph ''G'' remove every edge with probability ''p''; this models a network subject to random edge failures. Then the reliability polynomial is a function &lt;math&gt;R_G(p)&lt;/math&gt;, a polynomial in ''p'', that gives the probability that every pair of vertices in ''G'' remains connected after the edges fail. The connection to the Tutte polynomial is given by

:&lt;math&gt;R_G(p) = (1-p)^{|V|-k(G)} p^{|E|-|V|+k(G)} T_G \left (1, \tfrac{1}{p} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Dichromatic polynomial===
Tutte also defined a closer 2-variable generalization of the chromatic polynomial, the '''dichromatic polynomial''' of a graph.  This is

:&lt;math&gt;Q_G(u,v) = \sum\nolimits_{A \subseteq E} u^{k(A)} v^{|A|-|V|+k(A)},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] of the spanning subgraph (''V'',''A'').  This is related to the '''corank-nullity polynomial''' by

:&lt;math&gt;Q_G(u,v) = u^{k(G)} \, R_G(u,v).&lt;/math&gt;

The dichromatic polynomial does not generalize to matroids because ''k''(''A'') is not a matroid property: different graphs with the same matroid can have different numbers of connected components.

==Related polynomials==

===Martin polynomial===
{{main|Martin polynomial}}
The Martin polynomial &lt;math&gt;m_{\vec{G}}(x)&lt;/math&gt; of an oriented 4-regular graph &lt;math&gt;\vec{G}&lt;/math&gt; was defined by Pierre Martin in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that if ''G'' is a plane graph and &lt;math&gt;\vec{G}_m&lt;/math&gt; is its [[Medial graph#Directed medial graph|directed medial graph]], then

:&lt;math&gt;T_G(x,x) = m_{\vec{G}_m}(x).&lt;/math&gt;

==Algorithms==

===Deletion–contraction===
[[Image:deletion-contraction.svg|thumb|right|300px|The deletion–contraction algorithm applied to the [[diamond graph]]. Red edges are deleted in the left child and contracted in the right child. The resulting polynomial is the sum of the monomials at the leaves, &lt;math&gt;x^3+2x^2 +y^2+2xy+x+y&lt;/math&gt;. Based on {{harvtxt|Welsh|Merino|2000}}.]]

The deletion–contraction recurrence for the Tutte polynomial,
: &lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)= T_{G \setminus e}(x,y) + T_{G/e}(x,y), \qquad e \text{ not a loop nor a bridge.} &lt;/math&gt;
immediately yields a recursive algorithm for computing it: choose any such edge ''e'' and repeatedly apply the formula until all edges are either loops or bridges; the resulting base cases at the bottom of the evaluation are easy to compute.

Within a polynomial factor, the running time ''t'' of this algorithm can be expressed in terms of the number of vertices ''n'' and the number of edges ''m'' of the graph,
:&lt;math&gt;t(n+m)= t(n+m-1) + t(n+m-2),&lt;/math&gt;
a recurrence relation that scales as the [[Fibonacci numbers]] with solution&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilf|1986|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; t(n+m)= \left (\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \right )^{n+m} = O \left (1.6180^{n+m} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

The analysis can be improved to within a polynomial factor of the number &lt;math&gt;\tau(G)&lt;/math&gt; of [[spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning trees]] of the input graph.&lt;ref name="Sekine 1995"&gt;{{harvnb|Sekine|Imai|Tani|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For sparse graphs with &lt;math&gt;m=O(n)&lt;/math&gt; this running time is &lt;math&gt;O(\exp(n))&lt;/math&gt;. For regular graphs of degree ''k'', the number of spanning trees can be bounded by

:&lt;math&gt;\tau(G) = O \left (\nu_k^n n^{-1} \log n \right ),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_k = \frac{(k-1)^{k-1}}{(k^2-2k)^{\frac{k}{2}-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

so the deletion–contraction algorithm runs within a polynomial factor of this bound. For example:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chung|Yau|1999}}, following {{harvnb|Björklund|Husfeldt|Kaski|Koivisto|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_5 \approx 4.4066.&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, [[graph isomorphism]] testing is used to avoid some recursive calls. This approach works well for graphs that are quite sparse and exhibit many symmetries; the performance of the algorithm depends on the heuristic used to pick the edge ''e''.&lt;ref name="Sekine 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haggard|Pearce|Royle|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pearce|Haggard|Royle|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaussian elimination===
In some restricted instances, the Tutte polynomial can be computed in polynomial time, ultimately because [[Gaussian elimination]] efficiently computes the matrix operations [[determinant]] and [[Pfaffian]]. These algorithms are themselves important results from [[algebraic graph theory]] and [[statistical mechanics]].

&lt;math&gt;T_G(1,1)&lt;/math&gt; equals the number &lt;math&gt;\tau(G)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Spanning tree (mathematics)|spanning tree]]s of a connected graph. This is
computable in polynomial time as the [[determinant]] of a maximal principal submatrix of the [[Laplacian matrix]] of ''G'', an early result in algebraic graph theory known as [[Kirchhoff’s Matrix–Tree theorem]]. Likewise, the dimension of the bicycle space at &lt;math&gt;T_G(-1,-1)&lt;/math&gt; can be computed in polynomial time by Gaussian elimination.

For planar graphs, the partition function of the Ising model, i.e., the Tutte polynomial at the hyperbola &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, can be expressed as a Pfaffian and computed efficiently via the [[FKT algorithm]]. This idea was developed by [[Michael Fisher|Fisher]], [[Pieter Kasteleyn|Kasteleyn]], and [[Harold Neville Vazeille Temperley|Temperley]] to compute the number of [[domino tiling|dimer]] covers of a planar [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice model]].

===Markov chain Monte Carlo===
Using a [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] method, the Tutte polynomial can be arbitrarily well approximated along the positive branch of &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, equivalently, the partition function of the ferromagnetic Ising model. This exploits the close connection between the Ising model and the problem of counting [[Matching (graph theory)|matchings]] in a graph. The idea behind this celebrated result of Jerrum and Sinclair&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerrum|Sinclair|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is to set up a [[Markov chain]] whose states are the matchings of the input graph. The transitions are defined by choosing edges at random and modifying the matching accordingly. The resulting Markov chain is rapidly mixing and leads to “sufficiently random” matchings, which can be used to recover the partition function using random sampling. The resulting algorithm is a [[fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme]] (fpras).

==Computational complexity==
Several computational problems are associated with the Tutte polynomial. The most straightforward one is
;Input
:A graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;
;Output
:The coefficients of &lt;math&gt;T_G&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, the output allows evaluating &lt;math&gt;T_G(-2,0)&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to counting the number of 3-colourings of ''G''. This latter question is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]], even when restricted to the family of [[planar graph]]s, so the problem of computing the coefficients of the Tutte polynomial for a given graph is [[Sharp-P-hard|#P-hard]] even for planar graphs.

Much more attention has been given to the family of problems called Tutte&lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; defined for every complex pair &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;:
;Input
:A graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;
;Output
:The value of &lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
The hardness of these problems varies with the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Exact computation===
[[Image:Tractable points of the Tutte polynomial in the real plane.svg|thumb|300px|right|
  The Tutte plane.
  Every point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; in the real plane corresponds to a computational problem &lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.
  At any red point, the problem is polynomial-time computable;
  at any blue point, the problem is #P-hard in general, but polynomial-time computable for planar graphs; and
  at any point in the white regions, the problem is #P-hard even for bipartite planar graphs.
]]
If both ''x'' and ''y'' are non-negative integers, the problem &lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; belongs to [[Sharp-P|#P]]. For general integer pairs, the Tutte polynomial contains negative terms, which places the problem in the complexity class [[GapP]], the closure of [[Sharp-P|#P]] under subtraction. To accommodate rational coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, one can define a rational analogue of [[Sharp-P|#P]].&lt;ref name="Goldberg-Jerrum-2008"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldberg|Jerrum|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The computational complexity of exactly computing &lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; falls into one of two classes for any &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. The problem is #P-hard unless &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; lies on the hyperbola &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; or is one of the points

:&lt;math&gt;\left \{ (1,1), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,0), (i,-i), (-i,i), \left(j,j^2 \right), \left(j^2,j \right) \right \}, \qquad j = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

in which cases it is computable in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaeger|Vertigan|Welsh|1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the problem is restricted to the class of planar graphs, the points on the hyperbola &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; become polynomial-time computable as well. All other points remain #P-hard, even for bipartite planar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vertigan|Welsh|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper on the dichotomy for planar graphs, Vertigan claims (in his conclusion) that the same result holds when further restricted to graphs with vertex degree at most three, save for the point &lt;math&gt;T_G(0,-2)&lt;/math&gt;, which counts nowhere-zero '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-flows and is computable in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vertigan|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These results contain several notable special cases. For example, the problem of computing the partition function of the Ising model is #P-hard in general, even though celebrated algorithms of Onsager and Fisher solve it for planar lattices. Also, the Jones polynomial is #P-hard to compute. Finally, computing the number of four-colourings of a planar graph is #P-complete, even though the decision problem is trivial by the [[four color theorem|four colour theorem]]. In contrast, it is easy to see that counting the number of three-colourings for planar graphs is #P-complete because the decision problem is known to be NP-complete via a [[parsimonious reduction]].

===Approximation===
The question which points admit a good approximation algorithm has been very well studied. Apart from the points that can be computed exactly in polynomial time, the only approximation algorithm known for &lt;math&gt;T_G(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is Jerrum and Sinclair’s FPRAS, which works for points on the “Ising” hyperbola &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; for ''y'' &gt; 0. If the input graphs are restricted to dense instances, with degree &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n)&lt;/math&gt;, there is an FPRAS if ''x'' ≥ 1, ''y'' ≥ 1.&lt;ref&gt;For the case ''x'' ≥ 1 and ''y'' = 1, see {{harvnb|Annan|1994}}. For the case ''x'' ≥ 1 and ''y'' &gt; 1, see {{harvnb|Alon|Frieze|Welsh|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the situation is not as well understood as for exact computation, large areas of the plane are known to be hard to approximate.&lt;ref name="Goldberg-Jerrum-2008" /&gt;

In [[Riemannian geometry]], the '''unit tangent bundle''' of a [[Riemannian manifold]] (''M'', ''g''), denoted by T&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''M'', UT(''M'') or simply UT''M'', is the unit sphere bundle for the [[tangent bundle]] T(''M''). It is a [[fiber bundle]] over ''M'' whose fiber at each point is the [[unit sphere]] in the tangent bundle:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{UT} (M) := \coprod_{x \in M} \left\{ v \in \mathrm{T}_{x} (M) \left| g_x(v,v) = 1 \right. \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

where T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') denotes the [[tangent space]] to ''M'' at ''x''. Thus, elements of UT(''M'') are pairs (''x'', ''v''), where ''x'' is some point of the manifold and ''v'' is some tangent direction (of unit length) to the manifold at ''x''. The unit tangent bundle is equipped with a natural [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]

:&lt;math&gt;\pi : \mathrm{UT} (M) \to M,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi : (x, v) \mapsto x,&lt;/math&gt;

which takes each point of the bundle to its base point.  The fiber ''π''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') over each point ''x'' ∈ ''M'' is an (''n''&amp;minus;1)-[[hypersphere|sphere]] '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the dimension of ''M''.  The unit tangent bundle is therefore a [[fiber bundle#Sphere bundles|sphere bundle]] over ''M'' with fiber '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The definition of unit sphere bundle can easily accommodate [[Finsler manifold]]s as well.  Specifically, if ''M'' is a manifold equipped with a Finsler metric ''F''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;T''M''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', then the unit sphere bundle is the subbundle of the tangent bundle whose fiber at ''x'' is the indicatrix of ''F'':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{UT}_x (M) = \left\{ v \in \mathrm{T}_{x} (M) \left| F(v) = 1 \right. \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''M'' is an infinite-dimensional manifold (for example, a [[Banach manifold|Banach]], [[Fréchet manifold|Fréchet]] or [[Hilbert manifold]]), then UT(''M'') can still be thought of as the unit sphere bundle for the tangent bundle T(''M''), but the fiber ''π''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') over ''x'' is then the infinite-dimensional unit sphere in the tangent space.

==Structures==
The unit tangent bundle carries a variety of differential geometric structures.  The metric on ''M'' induces a [[contact structure]] on UT''M''.  This is given in terms of a [[tautological one-form]], defined at a point ''u'' of UT''M'' (a unit tangent vector of ''M'') by
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_u(v) = g(u,\pi_* v)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\pi_*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] along π of the vector ''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;T&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;UT''M''.  

Geometrically, this contact structure can be regarded as the distribution of (2''n''&amp;minus;2)-planes which, at the unit vector ''u'', is the pullback of the orthogonal complement of ''u'' in the tangent space of ''M''.  This is a contact structure, for the fiber of UT''M'' is obviously an integral manifold (the vertical bundle is everywhere in the kernel of θ), and the remaining tangent directions are filled out by moving up the fiber of UT''M''.  Thus the maximal integral manifold of θ is (an open set of) ''M'' itself.

On a Finsler manifold, the contact form is defined by the analogous formula
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_u(v) = g_u(u,\pi_*v)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; is the fundamental tensor (the [[Hessian matrix|hessian]] of the Finsler metric).  Geometrically, the associated distribution of hyperplanes at the point ''u''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;UT&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' is the inverse image under π&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; of the tangent hyperplane to the unit sphere in T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' at ''u''.

The [[volume form]] θ∧''d''θ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; defines a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on ''M'', known as the '''kinematic measure''', or '''Liouville measure''', that is invariant under the [[geodesic#Geodesic flow|geodesic flow]] of ''M''.  As a [[Radon measure]], the kinematic measure μ is defined on compactly supported continuous functions ''ƒ'' on UT''M'' by
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{UTM} f\,d\mu = \int_M dV(p) \int_{UT_pM} \left.f\right|_{UT_pM}\,d\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;
where d''V'' is the [[volume element]] on ''M'', and μ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard rotationally-invariant [[Borel measure]] on the Euclidean sphere UT&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''.

The [[Levi-Civita connection]] of ''M'' gives rise to a splitting of the tangent bundle
:&lt;math&gt;T(UTM) = H\oplus V&lt;/math&gt;
into a vertical space ''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;kerπ&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;  and horizontal space ''H'' on which π&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[linear isomorphism]] at each point of UT''M''.  This splitting induces a metric on UT''M'' by declaring that this splitting be an orthogonal direct sum, and defining the metric on ''H'' by the pullback:
:&lt;math&gt;g_H(v,w) = g(v,w),\quad v,w\in H&lt;/math&gt;
and defining the metric on ''V'' as the induced metric from the embedding of the fiber UT&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' into the [[Euclidean space]] T&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''.  Equipped with this metric and contact form, UT''M'' becomes a [[Sasakian manifold]].

'''Variance risk premium''' is a [[phenomenon]] on the [[variance swap]] market, of the variance swap strike being greater than the realized variance on average. For most trades, the buyer of variance ends up with a loss on the trade, while the seller profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The variance risk premium can be naively justified by taking into account the large negative convexity of a short variance position; variance during rare times of crisis can be 50-100 times that of normal market conditions.

Using insurance as an [[analogy]], the variance buyer typically pays a premium to be able to receive the large positive payoff of a variance swap in times of market turmoil, to "insure" against this.

==Analysis==
The variance risk premium can also be analysed from the perspective of asset allocation. Carr and Wu (2007) examines whether the excess returns of selling or buying variance swaps can be explained using common factor models such as the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM model]] and the [[Fama–French three-factor model|Fama-French factors]], which include returns of different segments of stocks on the market. Despite the intuitive connection between stock price volatility and stock price, none of these models are able to strongly explain the excess returns on variance swaps. This implies that there is another factor that is unrelated to stock prices that affects how much, on average, one will pay to enter into a variance swap contract. This suggests that investors are willing to pay extra money to enter into variance because they dislike variance, not just because it is anti-correlated with stock prices, but on its own right. This leads to many considering variance as an asset class in and of itself.

In the years before the [[2008 financial crisis]], selling variance on a rolling basis was a popular trade among hedge funds and other institutional investors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12625">In [[mathematics]], '''point-free geometry''' is a [[geometry]] whose primitive [[ontology|ontological]] notion is ''region'' rather than [[point (geometry)|point]]. Two [[axiomatic system]]s are set out below, one grounded in [[mereology]], the other in [[mereotopology]] and known as ''connection theory''. A point can mark a space or objects.

==Motivation==
Point-free geometry was first formulated in [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] (1919, 1920), not as a theory of [[geometry]] or of [[spacetime]], but of "events" and of an "extension relation" between events. Whitehead's purposes were as much philosophical as scientific and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;See Kneebone (1963), chpt. 13.5, for a gentle introduction to Whitehead's theory. Also see Lucas (2000), chpt. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead did not set out his theories in a manner that would satisfy present-day canons of formality. The two formal [[first order theory|first order theories]] described in this entry were devised by others in order to clarify and refine Whitehead's theories. The [[domain of discourse|domain]] for both theories consists of "regions." All unquantified variables in this entry should be taken as tacitly [[Quantification (logic)|universally quantified]]; hence all axioms should be taken as universal closures. No axiom requires more than three quantified variables; hence a translation of first order theories into [[relation algebra]] is possible. Each set of axioms has but four [[existential quantifier]]s.

==Inclusion-based point-free geometry ([[mereology]])==
The axioms '''G1-G7''' are, but for numbering, those of Def. 2.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008) (see also Gerla (1995)). The identifiers of the form '''WPn''', included in the verbal description of each axiom, refer to the corresponding axiom in Simons (1987: 83).

The fundamental primitive [[binary relation]] is ''Inclusion'', denoted by [[infix]] "&amp;le;". (''Inclusion'' corresponds to the binary ''Parthood'' relation that is a standard feature of all mereological theories.) The intuitive meaning of ''x''&amp;le;''y'' is "''x'' is part of ''y''." Assuming that [[identity function|identity]], denoted by infix "=", is part of the background logic, the [[binary relation]] ''Proper Part'', denoted by infix "&lt;", is defined as:

&lt;math&gt; x&lt;y \leftrightarrow (x\le y \and x \not = y).&lt;/math&gt;

The axioms are:
*Inclusion [[partial order|partially orders]] the [[domain of discourse|domain]].
:'''G1.'''  &lt;math&gt;x\le x.&lt;/math&gt;      ([[reflexive relation|reflexive]])
:'''G2.''' &lt;math&gt;(x\le z \and z\le y) \rightarrow x\le y.&lt;/math&gt;   ([[transitive relation|transitive]]) '''WP4'''.
:'''G3.''' &lt;math&gt;(x\le y \and  y\le x) \rightarrow x = y.&lt;/math&gt;   ([[antisymmetric relation|anti-symmetric]])

*Given any two regions, there exists a region that includes both of them. '''WP6'''.
:'''G4.''' &lt;math&gt;\exists z[x\le z\and y\le z].&lt;/math&gt;

*Proper Part [[dense order|densely orders]] the [[domain of discourse|domain]]. '''WP5'''.
:'''G5.''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y\rightarrow\exists z [x&lt;z&lt;y].&lt;/math&gt;

*Both [[atomic (order theory)|atomic regions]] and a [[mereology|universal region]] do not exist. Hence the [[domain of discourse|domain]] has neither an upper nor a lower bound. '''WP2'''.
:'''G6.''' &lt;math&gt;\exists yz[y&lt;x \and x&lt;z].&lt;/math&gt;

* Proper Parts Principle. If all the proper parts of ''x'' are proper parts of ''y'', then ''x'' is included in ''y''. '''WP3'''. 
:'''G7.''' &lt;math&gt;\forall z[z&lt;x \rightarrow z&lt;y] \rightarrow x\le y.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[model theory|model]] of '''G1–G7''' is an ''inclusion space''.

'''Definition''' (Gerla and Miranda 2008: Def. 4.1). Given some inclusion space, an '''abstractive class''' is a class ''G'' of regions such that ''G'' is [[total order|totally ordered]] by Inclusion. Moreover, there does not exist a region included in all of the regions included in ''G''.

Intuitively, an abstractive class defines a geometrical entity whose dimensionality is less than that of the inclusion space. For example, if the inclusion space is the [[Euclidean plane]], then the corresponding abstractive classes are [[point (geometry)|point]]s and [[line (geometry)|line]]s.

Inclusion-based point-free geometry (henceforth "point-free geometry") is essentially an axiomatization of Simons's (1987: 83) system '''W.''' In turn, '''W''' formalizes a theory in Whitehead (1919) whose axioms are not made explicit. Point-free geometry is '''W''' with this defect repaired. Simons (1987) did not repair this defect, instead proposing in a footnote that the reader do so as an exercise. The primitive relation of '''W''' is Proper Part, a [[strict partial order]]. The theory&lt;ref&gt;Kneebone (1963), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; of Whitehead (1919) has a single primitive binary relation ''K'' defined as ''xKy'' &amp;harr; ''y''&lt;''x''. Hence ''K'' is the [[converse relation|converse]] of Proper Part. Simons's '''WP1''' asserts that Proper Part is [[irreflexive]] and so corresponds to '''G1'''. '''G3''' establishes that inclusion, unlike Proper Part, is [[Antisymmetric relation|anti-symmetric]].

Point-free geometry is closely related to a [[List of first-order theories|dense linear order]] '''D''', whose axioms are '''G1-3''', '''G5''', and the totality axiom &lt;math&gt; x \le y \or y \le x.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Stoll, R. R., 1963. ''Set Theory and Logic''. Dover reprint, 1979. P. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence inclusion-based point-free geometry would be a proper extension of '''D''' (namely '''D'''&amp;cup;{'''G4''', '''G6''', '''G7'''}), were it not that the '''D''' relation "&amp;le;" is a [[total order]].

==Connection theory==
In his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'', [[A. N. Whitehead]] proposed a different approach, one inspired by De Laguna (1922). Whitehead took as primitive the [[topological]] notion of "contact" between two regions, resulting in a primitive "connection relation" between events. Connection theory '''C''' is a [[first order theory]] that distills the first 12 of the 31 assumptions in chpt. 2 of ''[[Process and Reality]]'' into 6 axioms, '''C1-C6'''. '''C''' is a proper fragment of the theories proposed in Clarke (1981), who noted their [[mereology|mereological]] character. Theories that, like '''C''', feature both inclusion and [[topology|topological]] primitives, are called [[mereotopology|mereotopologies]].

'''C''' has one primitive [[relation (mathematics)|relation]], binary "connection," denoted by the [[prefix]]ed [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate letter]] ''C''. That ''x'' is included in ''y'' can now be defined as ''x''&amp;le;''y'' &amp;harr; &amp;forall;z[''Czx''&amp;rarr;''Czy'']. Unlike the case with inclusion spaces, connection theory enables defining "non-tangential" inclusion,&lt;ref&gt;Presumably this is Casati and Varzi's (1999) "Internal Part" predicate, IP''xy'' &amp;harr; (x&amp;le;y)&amp;and;(C''zx''&amp;rarr;&amp;exist;''v''[''v''&amp;le;''z'' &amp;and; ''v''&amp;le;''y'']. This definition combines their (4.8) and (3.1).&lt;/ref&gt; a total order that enables the construction of abstractive classes. Gerla and Miranda (2008) argue that only thus can mereotopology unambiguously define a [[Point (geometry)|point]].

The axioms '''C1-C6''' below are, but for numbering, those of Def. 3.1 in Gerla and Miranda (2008).

*''C'' is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. '''C.1.'''
:'''C1. '''&lt;math&gt; \ Cxx.&lt;/math&gt;

*''C'' is [[symmetric]]. '''C.2.'''
:'''C2.'''  &lt;math&gt;Cxy\rightarrow Cyx.&lt;/math&gt;

*''C'' is [[extensionality|extensional]]. '''C.11.'''
:'''C3.'''   &lt;math&gt;\forall z[Czx \leftrightarrow Czy] \rightarrow x = y.&lt;/math&gt;

* All regions have proper parts, so that '''C''' is an [[atomic (order theory)|atomless]] theory. '''P.9.'''
:'''C4.'''    &lt;math&gt;\exists y[y&lt;x].&lt;/math&gt;

*Given any two regions, there is a region connected to both of them.
:'''C5.'''   &lt;math&gt;\exists z[Czx\and Czy].&lt;/math&gt;

*All regions have at least two unconnected parts. '''C.14.'''
:'''C6.'''   &lt;math&gt;\exists yz[(y\le x)\and (z\le x)\and\neg Cyz].&lt;/math&gt;

A model of '''C''' is a ''connection space''.

Following the verbal description of each axiom is the identifier of the corresponding axiom in Casati and Varzi (1999). Their system '''SMT''' (''strong mereotopology'') consists of '''C1-C3''', and is essentially due to Clarke (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Grzegorczyk (1960) proposed a similar theory, whose motivation was primarily [[topology|topological]].&lt;/ref&gt; Any [[mereotopology]] can be made [[atomic (order theory)|atomless]] by invoking '''C4''', without risking paradox or triviality. Hence '''C''' extends the atomless variant of '''SMT''' by means of the axioms '''C5''' and '''C6''', suggested by chpt. 2 of ''[[Process and Reality]]''. For an advanced and detailed discussion of systems related to '''C''', see Roeper (1997).

Biacino and Gerla (1991) showed that every [[model theory|model]] of Clarke's theory is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and models of such algebras cannot distinguish connection from overlap. It is doubtful whether either fact is faithful to Whitehead's intent.

&lt;!-- {{redirect|{0}|0 (disambiguation)}} --&gt;

[[Image:Terminal and initial object.svg|thumb|right|[[Morphism]]s to and from the zero object]]
In [[algebra]], the '''zero object''' of a given [[algebraic structure]] is, in the sense explained below, the simplest object of such structure. As a [[set (mathematics)|set]] it is a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]], and as a [[Magma (mathematics)|magma]] has a [[trivial group|trivial]] structure, which is also an [[abelian group]]. The aforementioned abelian group structure is usually identified as [[addition]], and the only element is called [[zero]], so the object itself is typically denoted as {{math|{0}{{void}}}}. One often refers to ''the'' trivial object (of a specified [[category (mathematics)|category]]) since every trivial object is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to any other (under a unique isomorphism).

Instances of the zero object include, but are not limited to the following:
* As a [[group (mathematics)|group]], the '''trivial group'''.
* As a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], the '''trivial ring'''.
* As an [[algebra over a field]] or [[algebra over a ring]], the '''trivial algebra'''.
* As a [[module (mathematics)|module]] (over a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|R}}), the '''zero module'''. The term '''trivial module''' is also used, although it may ambiguous, as a ''trivial G-module'' is a [[G-module]] with a trivial action.
* As a [[vector space]] (over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|R}}), the '''zero vector space''', '''zero-dimensional vector space'''  or just '''zero space'''.
These objects are described jointly not only based on the common singleton and trivial group structure, but also because of [[#Properties|shared category-theoretical properties]].

{{anchor|Module}}In the last three cases the [[scalar multiplication]] by an element of the base ring (or field) is defined as:
: {{math|1= ''κ''0 = 0 }}, where {{math|''κ'' ∈ ''R''}}.
The most general of them, the zero module, is a [[finitely-generated module]] with an [[empty set|empty]] generating set.

{{anchor|Algebra}}{{anchor|Ring}}For structures requiring the multiplication structure inside the zero object, such as the trivial ring, there is only one possible, {{math|1=0 × 0 = 0}}, because there are no non-zero elements. This structure is [[associativity|associative]] and [[commutative]]. A ring {{mvar|R}} which has both an additive and multiplicative identity is trivial if and only if {{math|1=1 = 0}}, since this equality implies that for all {{mvar|r}} within {{mvar|R}}, 
:&lt;math&gt;r = r \times 1 = r \times 0 = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
In this case it is possible to define [[division by zero]], since the single element is its own multiplicative inverse. Some properties of {{math|{0}{{void}}}} depend on exact definition of the multiplicative identity; see the section [[#Unital structures|Unital structures]] below.

Any trivial algebra is also a trivial ring. A trivial [[algebra over a field]] is simultaneously a zero vector space considered [[#Vector space|below]]. Over a [[commutative ring]], a trivial [[algebra over a ring|algebra]] is simultaneously a zero module.

The trivial ring is an example of a [[Rng (algebra)#Rng of square zero|rng of square zero]]. A trivial algebra is an example of a [[Algebra over a field#Zero algebra|zero algebra]].

The zero-dimensional {{visible anchor|vector space}} is an especially ubiquitous example of a zero object, a [[vector space]] over a field with an empty [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. It therefore has [[dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] zero. It is also a trivial group over [[addition]], and a ''trivial module'' [[#Module|mentioned above]].

The trivial ring, zero module and zero vector space are [[zero object]]s of the corresponding [[category (mathematics)|categories]], namely &lt;span class="nounderlines"&gt;'''[[Category of pseudo-rings|Rng]]''', [[Category of modules|{{mvar|R}}-'''Mod''']] and [[Category of vector spaces|'''Vect'''&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|R}}&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;.

The zero object, by definition, must be a terminal object, which means that a [[morphism]]&amp;nbsp;{{math|''A'' → {0}{{void}}}} must exist and be unique for an arbitrary object&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|A}}. This morphism maps any element of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|A}} to&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}}.

The zero object, also by definition, must be an initial object, which means that a morphism&amp;nbsp;{{math|{0} → ''A''}} must exist and be unique for an arbitrary object&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|A}}. This morphism maps {{math|0}}, the only element of&amp;nbsp;{{math|{0}{{void}}}}, to the zero element&amp;nbsp;{{math|0 ∈ ''A''}}, called the [[zero vector]] in vector spaces. This map is a [[monomorphism]], and hence its image is isomorphic to&amp;nbsp;{{math|{0}{{void}}}}. For modules and vector spaces, this [[subset]]&amp;nbsp;{{math|{0} ⊂ ''A''}} is the only empty-generated [[submodule]] (or 0-dimensional [[linear subspace]]) in each module (or vector space)&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|A}}.

=== Unital structures ===&lt;!-- linked from the lede --&gt;
The {{math|{0}{{void}}}} object is a [[terminal object]] of any algebraic structure where it exists, like it was described for examples above. But its existence and, if it exists, the property to be an [[initial object]] (and hence, a ''zero object'' in the [[category theory|category-theoretical]] sense) depend on exact definition of the [[multiplicative identity]]&amp;nbsp;1 in a specified structure.

If the definition of&amp;nbsp;{{math|1}} requires that {{math|1 ≠ 0}}, then the {{math|{0}{{void}}}} object cannot exist because it may contain only one element. In particular, the zero ring is not a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. If mathematicians sometimes talk about a [[field with one element]], this abstract and somewhat mysterious mathematical object is not a field.

In categories where the multiplicative identity must be preserved by morphisms, but can equal to zero, the {{math|{0}{{void}}}} object can exist. But not as initial object because identity-preserving morphisms from {{math|{0}{{void}}}} to any object where {{math|1 ≠ 0}} do not exist. For example, in the [[category of rings]] '''Ring''' the ring of [[integer]]s&amp;nbsp;'''Z''' is the initial object, not&amp;nbsp;{{math|{0}{{void}}}}.

If an algebraic structure requires the multiplicative identity, but does not require neither its preserving by morphisms nor {{math|1 ≠ 0}}, then zero morphisms exist and the situation is not different from non-unital structures considered in the previous section.

== Notation ==
Zero vector spaces and zero modules are usually denoted by {{math|0}} (instead of {{math|{0}{{void}}}}). This is always the case when they occur in an [[exact sequence]].
