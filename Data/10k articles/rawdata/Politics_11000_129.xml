:''This article refers to a publicity stunt. For the Napoleonic military campaign, see [[Hundred Days]]. For the final offensive of World War I, see [[Hundred Days Offensive]].''

The '''100 Days Campaign''' was set up in 2008 by [[Amnesty International]] to demonstrate President-elect [[Barack Obama]]’s commitment to [[human rights]]. Amnesty International called for certain concrete steps in Obama's first 100 days in office that would demonstrate a genuine commitment to bringing the [[United States]] into line with its international obligations.

The three main ideas behind the 100 Days campaign were as follows:
* The planned date and closure of [[Guantanamo Bay]];
* The issuance of an executive order banning torture and other ill-treatment, as defined under international law;
* To ensure that an independent commission to investigate abuses committed by the [[U.S. government]] in its "[[war on terror]]" was set up.

These demands are part of a [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR51/117/2008/en checklist]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR51/117/2008/en |title=USA: Counter Terror with Justice: A checklist for the next US President &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of actions Amnesty International has asked the new U.S. President to take during the first 100 days in office.

==Presence of Campaign In Washington D.C.==
As part of the 100 Days Campaign, to remind President Obama of his promise to close Guantanamo bay, Amnesty International held a series of vigils from 11 am to 1 pm, Monday through Friday, at many different venues around [[Washington D.C.]], throughout the first 100 days of President Obama's first term of presidency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7973">In 2010, a paper titled "The nature of the relationship between personality traits and political attitudes" claimed to find a strong positive correlation between [[conservatism]] and [[psychoticism]]. This error was repeated in subsequent papers by the same authors; however, around 2015, the authors acknowledged the correlation is actually negative rather than positive, and began issuing corrections.

==Background==
Many studies have found significant correlations between [[personality traits]] and political attitudes. For example, conscientiousness appears to correlate with conservatism, and openness correlates with a liberal ideology.&lt;ref name=sa&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zaraska|first1=Marta|title=The Genes of Left and Right|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-genes-of-left-and-right/|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=Scientific American Mind|date=1 May 2016|pages=9–10|language=en|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind0516-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have used these correlations to argue that differences in personality traits are a strong causal factor in determining what political attitudes people align themselves with; others have argued this is the wrong casual analysis. In this latter view, the correlation instead arises due to a third factor which causes both the statistical differences in personality traits and the statistical differences in political attitudes.&lt;ref name=sa /&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=Why It Took Social Science Years to Correct a Simple Error About ‘Psychoticism’|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/07/why-it-took-social-science-years-to-correct-a-simple-error-about-psychoticism.html|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=[[New York Magazine]]|date=14 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 paper==
In 2010, Brad Verhulst, [[Peter K. Hatemi]], and Nicholas G. Martin published a paper in ''[[Personality and Individual Differences]]'' arguing for the "third factor" explanation. In the course of their analysis, they calculated various correlations between various personality traits and various political attitudes. Among these published calculations was a correlation of +0.5 between psychoticism and conservative religious attitudes and a correlation of +0.6 between psychoticism and conservative sexual attitudes.&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhulst|first1=Brad|last2=Hatemi|first2=Peter K.|last3=Martin|first3=Nicholas G.|title=The nature of the relationship between personality traits and political attitudes|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=September 2010|volume=49|issue=4|pages=306–316|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these two calculations, among others, were erroneous; the actual calculated correlations should have been negative.&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt;&lt;ref name=newyorker /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhulst|first1=Brad|last2=Hatemi|first2=Peter K.|last3=Martin|first3=Nicholas G.|title=Corrigendum to “The nature of the relationship between personality traits and political attitudes” [Personal. Individ. Differ. 49 (2010): 306–316]|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=September 2016|volume=99|pages=378–379|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2016.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the actual sign of the correlation was irrelevant to the 2010 paper's primary thesis, the error created difficulties for subsequent scientists exploring other facets of the correlation, for whom the direction of the correlation was relevant.&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt;

==Subsequent events==
Verhulst and Hatemi made the same mistake in a 2012 ''[[American Journal of Political Science]]'' (AJPS) publication that used a different set of data. By one count, this 2012 paper would later be cited 45 times.&lt;ref name=watch&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservative political beliefs not linked to psychotic traits, as study claimed - Retraction Watch|url=http://retractionwatch.com/2016/06/07/conservative-political-beliefs-not-linked-to-psychotic-traits/|website=[[Retraction Watch]]|accessdate=2 November 2017|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Steven G. Ludeke, a Ph.D. psychology student, spotted that the direction of the claimed correlation in the 2010 and 2012 papers contradicted both prior research and common sense; a positive correlation would mean that compared to liberals, conservatives are more drug-friendly, care less about cleanliness, and disdain society’s strictures. Ludeke correctly hypothesized that the sign of the correlation was reversed. Ludeke's thesis advisor, Colin DeYoung, had met Hatemi before; DeYoung initiated correspondence with Hatemi on July 27, 2012 to report the error and to request access to the datasets. Hatemi disputed that an error occurred but initially seemed receptive to sharing the data. However, despite repeated attempts in 2012 and 2013, Ludeke and DeYoung were unable to gain access to the data of the 2010 and 2012 papers. In 2013, Hatemi and Verhulst submitted a paper to AJPS that contained the same mistaken sign-reversed correlation. Ludeke was one of the anonymous reviewers; Ludeke reiterated his criticism that the sign of the correlation was flipped. The paper was rejected by AJPS; however, in 2015, Hatemi and Verhulst published the paper in PlosOne, an open-data journal.&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt;

Around 2015, Ludeke and DeYoung submitted a paper for publication to the [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] (JSPS) debunking Hatemi and Verhulst's claim; Hatemi was chosen as a reviewer. According to Ludeke and DeYoung, this triggered Hatemi and Verhulst to "race" to submit corrections to the all the journals that published the error. The JSPS and other journals then rejected the Ludeke and DeYoung paper, possibly in part because the corrections had already been issued.&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt;

Following the corrections, some right-wing media outlets embraced the finding that liberalism correlates with psychoticism; the [[New York Post]] wrote that "Science says liberals, not conservatives, are psychotic".&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite news|last1=Konnikova|first1=Maria|title=Politics and Personality: Most of What You Read Is Malarkey|url=https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/politics-and-personality-most-of-what-you-read-is-malarkey|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Science says liberals, not conservatives, are psychotic|url=https://nypost.com/2016/06/09/science-says-liberal-beliefs-are-linked-to-pyschotic-traits/|accessdate=2 November 2017|work=[[New York Post]]|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as [[New York Magazine]] pointed out, "psychoticism, in this case, doesn’t mean [[psychotic]] in the everyday sense of the word."&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt;

In 2016, Ludeke and DeYoung published a less critical version of their paper in ''Personality and Individual Differences''. Hatemi and Verhulst published a response, titled "Correcting Honest Errors Versus Incorrectly Portraying Them: Responding to Ludeke and Rasmussen", in the same journal. "Correcting" stated that "longstanding published literature... already identified a positive correlation between conservatism and Psychoticism"; however, three of the four non-book citations given by "Correcting" to support this claim explicitly reported a ''negative'' correlation.&lt;ref name=nymag /&gt;

Hatemi and Verhulst ascribed the error to the specific codebook used for the project, which inverted the [[Coding (social sciences)|codes]] for statements that counted towards psychoticism and the statements that counted against psychoticism in the surveys. Verhulst stated he didn't know whether the error originated from the authors or from the group that conducted the surveys, saying "I don’t know where it happened, all I know is it happened. It’s our fault for not figuring it out before."&lt;ref name=watch /&gt;

'''Proposition 36''', also titled '''A Change in the "Three Strikes Law" Initiative''', was a [[California ballot measure]] that was passed in November 2012 to modify California’s [[Three Strikes Law]] (passed in 1994). The latter law punishes habitual offenders by establishing sentence escalation for crimes that were classified as "strikes", and requires a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 to life for a "third-strike offense."

Proposition 36 adjusted the law so that, in order to be classified as a third strike, the offense must be a "serious or violent felony". This serious or violent clause does not apply to defendants previously convicted of rape, murder or child molestation. Additionally, the initiative added a provision in the [[California Penal Code]] that establishes a review process of sentences for people currently serving life sentences as a result of a nonviolent or non-serious third-strike offenses; it allowed courts to provide shorter sentences or release.

Supporters of the proposition included [[Steve Cooley]], the LA district attorney at the time, George Soros, and the [[NAACP]].&lt;ref name=fix3strikes&gt;{{cite web|title=Fix Three Strikes - Endorsements|url=http://www.fixthreestrikes.com/endorsements|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents included Henry T. Nicholas, the author of California's Victims Bill of Rights, the California Police Chiefs’ Association, and the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation.&lt;ref name=save3strikes&gt;{{cite web|title=Save Three Strikes - Endorsements |url=http://www.savethreestrikes.com/endorsements.php |accessdate=26 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103181514/http://www.savethreestrikes.com/endorsements.php |archivedate=January 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposition was passed on November 6, 2012, with 8,575,619 people (69.3%) voting Yes and 3,798,218 people (30.7%) voting No.&lt;ref name=stateofvote&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement of Vote |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/sov-complete.pdf |publisher=State of California |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224021529/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/sov-complete.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed by a majority of voters in every county.

==Background to Three Strikes Law==
Proposition 36 was predated by two major trends since the late 20th century: rapidly increasing incarceration rates and the expansion of the private prison industry. Beginning in the late 1970s, President [[Richard Nixon]] announced the "[[war on drugs]]," which led to 'tough on crime' policies by a range of politicians. Changes included mandatory minimum sentencing, harsh penalties barring inmates from being granted parole or probation, and stricter punishments for drug users both in and out of the prison.&lt;ref name=ACLU&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=David|title=Banking on Bondage: Private Prisons and Mass Incarceration|journal=American Civil Liberties Union|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither party wanted to appear "soft on crime", and criminalization of minor offenses continued, resulting in high rates of incarceration. In response to but surpassing the growing numbers of inmates, the private prison industry expanded nearly 1600% between 1990-2009.

By 2011, private prison companies were responsible for about 6% of state prisoners and 16% of federal prisoners.&lt;ref name=ACLU&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=David|title=Banking on Bondage: Private Prisons and Mass Incarceration|journal=American Civil Liberties Union|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corrections Corporation of America]] (CCA), for example, in 2011 owned and operated 66 facilities, and it earned $1.7 billion in revenue. The rate of private prison expansion far outpaced the rate of overall growth in incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Suevon|title=By the Numbers: The U.S.'s Growing For-Profit Detention Industry|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/by-the-numbers-the-u.s.s-growing-for-profit-detention-industry|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, the two largest prison companies derived from 45 to 50% of their revenues from federal contracts and had incentives to keep prisons full.

As a result of the continuing war on crime in the 1990s, numerous states passed what are known as Three Strikes laws. Between December 1993 and January 1996, twenty-four states passed such laws, which were designed to punish repeat felons. Under these laws, criminals convicted of a second felony must receive a sentence twice as harsh as a first-time offender. A criminal convicted of a third felony, regardless of its violence or severity, is to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of 25 years to life imprisonment. These laws limited the judges’ ability to exercise discretion when sentencing repeat criminals and required lengthy sentences even for non-violent crimes. Poor [[people of color]] have been disproportionately affected by the high rate of incarceration for even relatively minor offenses. In 2016 the United States had 5% of the population in the world and 25% of the world's prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by President [[Barack Obama]], opening of ''[[13th (film)|13th]]'' (2016), a documentary directed by [[Ava DuVernay]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Three Strike Law was passed in Washington State, with overwhelming support from the voters. Its passage was attributed to public outrage over the murder of Diane Ballasiotes, who was kidnapped, raped, and brutally stabbed by Gene Kane Jr., an escapee from Seattle work-release. Similar outrage in California arose over the murders of Kim Reynolds and Polly Klaas, both of whom were killed by repeat felons. California also passed a three strike law.&lt;ref name="Psychology Public Support"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyler|first=Tom R.|title=Three Strikes and You Are Out, but Why? The Psychology of Public Support for Punishing Rule Breakers|url=http://www.rethinking.org.nz/images/newsletter%20PDF/Issue%2068/01%20%20Three%20Strikes%20and%20Public%20Punitiveness.pdf|publisher=National Criminal Justice|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-strikes laws were representative of prevailing public dissatisfaction with the states’ policies regarding repeat offenders. Studies suggest that public concern is related to fears about threat related to crime, a threat repeatedly emphasized by politicians seeking support for re-election, and a belief that courts were not dealing with it adequately. Most people have a fear of crime that does not realistically relate to their risk. Psychologists Zimring and Hawkins suggest that people are motivated to protect themselves and their communities from threats and thus support severe punishment.&lt;ref name="Psychology Public Support" /&gt; Also, people are motivated to punish criminals because rule-breaking behavior poses a threat to the moral cohesion of society; punishment reasserts social value and the obligation to obey social rules.&lt;ref name="Psychology Public Support" /&gt;

==Studies of effects of Three Strikes Law==
Since Three Strikes has gone into effect in California, a number of studies have examined the effects of the law on sentencing patterns and crime levels. Overall, results from these studies have been mixed, with some concluding that Three Strikes has reduced crime rates, while others arguing it has had little impact if any.

A 1994 study by analyst Peter Greenwood and colleagues at RAND assessed potential effects of the proposed law.&lt;ref name=greenwood1994&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenwood|first=Peter W. |title=Three Strikes and You're Out: Estimated benefits and costs of California's new mandatory-sentencing law|date=1994|publisher=RAND|location=Santa Monica, CA|isbn=978-0-8330-1597-6|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR509.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relying mostly on projected data from statistical models, the authors predicted that three strikes could result in up to a 28% reduction in serious or violent crime, but questioned whether or not the public would be willing to fully fund the bill’s estimated cost of $5.5 billion to support a much larger prison population serving lengthy sentences.

A study published in 2001 by Franklin Zimring and colleagues assessed the effects over several years of implementing the law and reached a more negative conclusion about its efficacy.&lt;ref name=zimring2001&gt;{{cite book|last=Zimring|first=Franklin E.|title=Punishment and Democracy: Three Strikes and You're Out in California|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-517117-4 |author2=Hawkins, Gordon |author3=Kamin, Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Zimring examined samples of felony arrests from three major California cities between 1993 and 1995, and found that the group targeted by Three Strikes, namely people who had committed one or more serious or violent offenses, accounted for 10% of the total crime prior to the law’s enactment; they did not differ significantly from the average criminal population. In terms of the law's effects, the study found that second-strike offenders were more likely to be punished, as well as to receive a longer average prison sentence than before, while third- strike offenders were sentenced to lengthier punishments.&lt;ref name=zimring2001 /&gt; The authors conclude that Three Strikes could not be solely responsible for the large drop in aggregated California crime rates over the 1990s. This trend began before Three Strikes was enacted and continued at roughly the same rate of reduction afterward.&lt;ref name=zimring2001 /&gt; Zimring argues that the law had only a weak deterrent effect on crime at best.

A 2002 study conducted by Joanna Shepherd claimed that both of the above studies underestimate the deterrent effect of the law because they examined only what she calls "partial deterrence" effects of three strikes: that is, deterring of those criminals committing a third strike.&lt;ref name=shepherd2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shepherd|first=Joanna M.|title=Fear of the First Strike: The Full Deterrent Effect of California's Two- and Three-Strikes Legislation|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|date=January 2002|volume=31|issue=1|pages=159–201|doi=10.1086/324660|jstor=10.1086/324660}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that if this was the case, the expected result would be a small general decrease in all felonies, as any felony can qualify for a third-strike offense. Using statistical regression models, Shepard found that the result was a stronger decrease in serious or violent felonies that qualify for first and second strikes; she concluded that the Three Strikes law deterred the general criminal population as well.&lt;ref name=shepherd2002 /&gt;  She attributed the deterrence of nearly 400,000 crimes, the vast majority of which are burglaries, to the law in its first two years of enactment.&lt;ref name=shepherd2002 /&gt;

A 2001 study by criminologists Marvell and Moody found that homicide rates increased following the passage of Three Strikes Law. The authors argued that criminals, even when committing relatively minor crimes, were more motivated after the law to murder victims, witnesses, or law enforcement personnel in order to avoid apprehension and the mandatory harsh sentences. They found that the law would increase the total number of homicides in states enforcing three strikes laws by approximately 17%.&lt;ref name="Police Murder"&gt;{{cite web|last=Guffey|first=James E.|title=Three-Strikes Laws and Police Officer Murders: Do the Data Indicate a Correlation?|url=https://kucampus.kaplan.edu/documentstore/docs09/pdf/picj/vol4/issue1/PICJ_V4N2_Guffey_9_26.pdf|publisher=Professional Issues in Criminal Justice|accessdate=27 April 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2012 by John Sutton focused more on the law’s effects on sentencing and imprisonment.&lt;ref name=sutton2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutton|first=John R.|title=Symbol and Substance: Effects of California's Three Strikes Law on Felony Sentencing|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|date=March 2013|volume=47|issue=1|pages=37–72|doi=10.1111/lasr.12001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutton evaluated whether or not probability and severity of sentencing increased under Three Strikes, whether or not average sentencing uncertainty declined, and whether or not race played a significant role in sentencing before and after Three Strikes. He concluded that Three Strikes did increase the number of prison sentences and their average length in California. However, he also found that there is "no evidence of systematic prosecutorial manipulation" as a result of Three Strikes sentencing.&lt;ref name=sutton2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutton|first=John R.|title=Symbol and Substance: Effects of California's Three Strikes Law on Felony Sentencing|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|date=March 2013|volume=47|issue=1|pages=37–72|doi=10.1111/lasr.12001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of race, Sutton found that black defendants were more likely to receive longer sentences under Three Strikes, but did not find other race-related effects of Three Strikes.&lt;ref name=sutton2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutton|first=John R.|title=Symbol and Substance: Effects of California's Three Strikes Law on Felony Sentencing|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|date=March 2013|volume=47|issue=1|pages=37–72|doi=10.1111/lasr.12001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He highlights the singular nature of this finding as worthy of further study.

==Criticisms of Three Strikes Law and movement towards Proposition 36==
Despite Proposition 184’s easy passage, by the early 2000s many California citizens were beginning to consider reforming the law. Some common criticisms of the law include it resulting in [[prison overcrowding]], inconsistent application of the law across the state, increasing costs of funding the growing prison population, and disillusion with particular applications of Three Strikes Law to minor offenses.

===Immediate overcrowding of prisons and dramatic increases in prison funding===
Within the first four years of the implementation of Three Strikes Law, 40,511 people were convicted under the laws in California. The rapidly growing inmate population resulted in an additional $1 billion spent on adult corrections in four years, from approximately $3 billion to over $4 billion. According to the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]], the budget for fiscal year 2011-2012 has increased to $6.4 billion.&lt;ref name="Budget detail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enacted Budget - Enacted Budget Detail|url=http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2011-12-EN/Enacted/agencies.html|publisher=California Department of Finance|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with the AB900, the ballot that was signed into law in May 2007 granting $7.4 billion for prison expansion, taxpayers will shell out an average of $315,000 per bed for the projects.&lt;ref name="Spending on new prions"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lagos|first=Marisa|title=California Spending Billions to Build New Prisons|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/California-spending-billions-to-build-new-prisons-2335352.php#page-2|publisher=SFGate|accessdate=27 April 2014|date=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California specifically, citizens are concerned over the billions of dollars spent by the state legislature on prison construction in the past few years, including $500 million via SB 1022 and $1.2 billion through AB 900. A number of anti-prison organizations have developed. Among them is California United for a Responsible Budget (CURB). As a broad-based coalition of more than 40 organizations, CURB seeks to "curb" prison spending by reducing the number of people in prison and the number of prisons in the state. The group works to provide resources and broader exposure in the field of prison divestment and to increase the outreach possibilities to the prison abolition movement.&lt;ref name=CURB&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Emily|title=Budget Battle: Stop $500 million in jail construction money!|url=http://curbprisonspending.org/?p=4107|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clogging of courts ===
Under the Three Strikes Laws, there were more than 7,400 second and third-strike cases filed statewide at the end of August 1994.&lt;ref name="three strikes you are out"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Strikes and You're Out Law|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/analysis_1995/3strikes.html|publisher=LAO Publication|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, more than 90% of the defendants would plea bargain for more lenient sentence or dismissal of other charges. However, knowing the consequence of having three strikes, in 1995 plea bargaining with guilty pleas dropped to a frequency of 14% of defendants with second-strike cases and 6% of defendants with third-strike cases.&lt;ref name="three strikes you are out"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Strikes and You're Out Law|url=http://www.lao.ca.gov/analysis_1995/3strikes.html|publisher=LAO Publication|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the significant decrease in plea bargaining, prosecutors and public defenders face a high volume of jury trials, which are more expensive and which slow other business in the courts.

===Inconsistent implementation===
Instead of an uniformity of ruling, counties throughout California evaluate the seriousness of crime differently. In 1996, San Francisco County announced that the county would no longer pursue third-strike conviction against drug cases and non-violent felonies, as it had found juries unwilling to convict in such cases given the harsh consequences.&lt;ref name="Geographic Disparity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joshua|first=Bowers|title='Integrity of the Game is Everything': The Problem of Geographic|publisher=New York University Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, prosecutors in San Diego County were willing to pursue Three Strikes conviction for any felonies. San Diego has sent more three-strike defendants to prison than any other county with a comparable violent crime rate.&lt;ref name="Geographic Disparity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joshua|first=Bowers|title='Integrity of the Game is Everything': The Problem of Geographic|publisher=New York University Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ewing v. California''===
{{Main article|Ewing v. California}}

In 2003, Gary Ewing was sentenced 25 years to life in prison after he committed his third felony, stealing three golf clubs from a local shop in California&lt;ref name=ewing&gt;{{cite web|title=EWING v. CALIFORNIA|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-6978.ZS.html|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under California law, certain offenses known as "wobblers" may be classified as either misdemeanors or felonies. The court refused to exercise its discretion to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor for Ewing, which triggered the Three Strikes Law. Ewing appealed, saying that his sentence was grossly disproportionate to the crime under the Eighth Amendment, but the US Supreme Court affirmed the court's ruling in ''[[Ewing v. California]]''.&lt;ref name=ewing&gt;{{cite web|title=EWING v. CALIFORNIA|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-6978.ZS.html|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harsh sentence and later ruling for a crime of shoplifting not only shocked many people but was also questioned by some judges. This controversial case can be seen to have led to getting Proposition 66 on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrus|first=Richard|title=Which Crime Is It - The Role of Proportionality in Recidivist Sentencing after Ewing v. California|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/byujpl19&amp;div=11&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#285|publisher=BYU Journal of Public Law|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposition 66===
In 2004, Proposition 66 was placed on the California ballot. Proposition 66 would limit felonies that trigger the second and third strike applications to violent or serious crimes and would increase penalties for child molesters. Supporters believed that it restored the original purpose of the Three Strikes Law to keep dangerous criminals in prison and off the streets.&lt;ref name="Prop 66"&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 66 - Limitation on Three Strikes Laws|url=http://igs.berkeley.edu/library/elections/proposition-66|publisher=Institute of Governmental Studies|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposition 66 was backed by Citizens Against Violent Crime, a California political action committee, and Sacramento businessman Jerry Keenan, whose son was serving time for manslaughter in a car accident. But, voters rejected proposition 66 with 52.7% no votes, reportedly due to fear that as many as 26,000 inmates would be released to the streets if it were passed.&lt;ref name="Prop 66"&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 66 - Limitation on Three Strikes Laws|url=http://igs.berkeley.edu/library/elections/proposition-66|publisher=Institute of Governmental Studies|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and opposition for Prop 36, 2012==

===Support===
Proponents argued that Proposition 36 would remove "draconian" standards of doling out punishment for third felonies that are neither serious nor violent.&lt;ref name=Yeson36&gt;{{Cite news|title=Yes on Proposition 36|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/26/opinion/la-ed-end-prop36-20120926|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed that the proposition presents rather modest reforms that would eliminate overly harsh sentencing of minor felonies, while keeping serious career criminals behind bars. They noted that repeat offenders would continue to serve longer sentences under Proposition 36.&lt;ref name=Yeson36/&gt; Supporters rejected opponents’ claims that Prop 36 would lead to a flood of career criminals into the streets. They said that fewer than 3,000 inmates statewide were eligible to petition for resentencing, and that many of these had already served long sentences, making them older and less likely to return to crime (which is committed primarily by younger people).&lt;ref name=Yeson36/&gt;

Supporters noted the proposition could save California more than $100 million per year in prison costs and reduce overcrowding of prisons.&lt;ref name=voterorg&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 36 Three Strikes Law. Repeat Felony Offenders. Penalties State of California|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2012/11/06/ca/state/prop/36/|publisher=League of Women Voters of California Education Fund|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major supporters included District Attorneys Steve Cooley, George Gascon and Jeffrey F Rosen, Mike Romano, the NAACP, and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name=bp36&gt;{{cite web|title=California Proposition 36, Changes in the "Three Strikes" Law (2012)|url=http://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_36,_Changes_in_the_%22Three_Strikes%22_Law_(2012|publisher=Ballotpedia|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
Opponents of Prop 36 argued that the Three Strikes Law was widely popular at its passage, was successful in keeping dangerous criminals off the streets, and reduced crime rates in the past two decades.&lt;ref name=noon36&gt;{{cite web|last=Lieberstein|first=Gary|title=The three-strikes law is working as intended: "No" on Proposition 36|url=http://napavalleyregister.com/news/opinion/mailbag/the-three-strikes-law-is-working-as-intended-no-on/article_10c02f76-0e9c-11e2-baa8-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=Napa Valley Register|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: This link has not been proved by studies.) They dismissed claims that its passage would reduce overcrowding, noting that those inmates serving 25-life under Three Strikes Law made up 6.6 percent of the prison population, while those serving a life sentence with a third non-serious, non-violent felony comprise only 3.5 percent of the entire population.&lt;ref name=noon36 /&gt; Opponents contended that Proposition 36 creates a "one size fits all" approach that strips judges of their discretion in Three Strikes cases.&lt;ref name=noon36 /&gt; They said that savings of money should not be at the expense of public safety or the state’s commitment to being tough on crime. The opposition said that Prop 36 was unnecessary, as the original bill had safeguards that allowed individual judges to assign sentences in accordance with each criminal’s background and local standards.&lt;ref name=noon36 /&gt; Major opponents includes Mike Reynolds, who drafted the Three Strikes Law, Keith Royal, and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=bp36&gt;{{cite web|title=California Proposition 36, Changes in the "Three Strikes" Law (2012)|url=http://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_36,_Changes_in_the_%22Three_Strikes%22_Law_(2012|publisher=Ballotpedia|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage==
The proposition was passed on November 6, 2012, with 8,575,619 people (69.3%) voting Yes and 3,798,218 people (30.7%) voting No.&lt;ref name=bp36 /&gt; It passed by a majority in all counties of the state. It was most strongly supported in San Francisco (84.5%), Marin (83.2%), and Alameda (78.6%) counties. Madera county passed it with a slight majority of 52%.&lt;ref name=stateofvote&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement of Vote |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/sov-complete.pdf |publisher=State of California |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224021529/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/sov-complete.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Due to its relatively recent passage, a thorough analysis of its implementation and effects has yet to be conducted. However, Stanford Law Three Strikes Project at [[Stanford Law School]] and the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund]] compiled a preliminary report of the progress of Proposition 36 in October 2013.&lt;ref name=progressr&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress Report: Three Strikes Reform (Proposition 36)|url=http://www.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/child-page/441702/doc/slspublic/Three%20Strikes%20Reform%20Report.pdf|publisher=Stanford Law School and NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report said that more than 1,000 prisoners had been released as a direct result of Three Strikes reform.&lt;ref name=progressr /&gt; The report also found that Proposition had already saved California $10–13 million, and projected up to $1 billion in savings in the next ten years.&lt;ref name=progressr /&gt; The report found the recidivism rate of released third strikers to be 2%, a rate dramatically lower than the statewide average of 16% of past inmates committing new crimes within 90 days of release.&lt;ref name=progressr /&gt; More than 2,000 additional inmates were awaiting resentencing review. The urgency with which county courts have reviewed these petitions has varied widely: San Bernardino has reviewed 73% of eligible petitions and Los Angeles has completed review of 19%.&lt;ref name=progressr /&gt; Of the petitions filed, 66% are pending, 32% have been granted, and 2% have been denied.&lt;ref name=progressr /&gt; The very low denial rate of release suggests that judges and prosecutors have concluded that a majority of the third strikers qualifying for review under Proposition 36 do not pose a threat to society.

That portion of Proposition 36 relating to sentencing of current repeat felons convicted of a nonviolent, non-serious third felony has been implemented statewide. Such individuals have been sentenced to twice the length of a sentence of a criminal convicted of that crime as a first offense.

===Problems of implementation===
Halfway through the two-year period allotted for court review of inmate petitions, more than two-thirds of such petitions have yet to be reviewed.&lt;ref name=progressr /&gt; The inconsistencies of implementation of Proposition 36 related to currently imprisoned populations is also problematic. The report also stresses the difficulties faced by released Third Strikers in re-entry to society. Unlike all other prisoners released from California jails, they are ineligible for state and county support, jobs, housing, and drug treatment.&lt;ref name=progressr /&gt; Some inmates have been released without warning to their families or authorities, and without qualifying for parole, probation, or any other form of state-sponsored assistance in returning to society.&lt;ref name=progressr /&gt;

Other critics complain that inadequate prosecutorial resources and attorney’s intent upon denying or delaying resentencing to eligible inmates are also serious impediments to full implementation.&lt;ref name=mills&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=David|author2=Michael Romano|title=The Passage and Implementation of the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012|journal=Federal Sentencing Reporter|date=April 2013|volume=25|issue=4|pages=265–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7858">The '''Alliance Colony''' was a Jewish agricultural community that was founded  on May 10, 1882, in [[Pittsgrove Township, New Jersey|Pittsgrove Township]], in [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem County]], [[New Jersey]], United States. It was named after the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] of [[Paris]] and was funded by the [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]] of [[New York City|New York]] and [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopedia.com - ALLIANCE"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1265&amp;letter=A&amp;search=alliance%20colony JewishEncyclopedia.com - ALLIANCE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and The [[Maurice de Hirsch|Baron De Hirsch]] Fund.

== History ==
Following the assassination of [[Tsar Alexander II]], numerous [[pogrom]]s targeting [[Russian Jews]] prompted many families to move emigrate. Many began their lives in America in tenements on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]]. As the numbers of Jewish people in America increased there was a strong desire to leave the confinement and crowded conditions in the cities. Some Jewish thinkers and community leaders proclaimed that recent Jewish immigrants ought "to become tillers of the soil and thus shake off the accusation that we were petty mercenaries living upon the toil of others."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Newman, Andy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/22/nyregion/the-last-of-the-jewish-farmgirls.html "The Last of the Jewish Farmgirls"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 22, 2005. Accessed July 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; They settled in communities across the country, but many wished to continue living in predominately Jewish areas. These immigrants recognized that self-sufficiency would be paramount to their survival, which led them into agriculture.  Alliance was founded by a core group of 43 settlers but many more followed and, by the end of the first summer, there were 60-70 families living in the colony.

The land that was settled consisted of {{convert|40|acre|m2}} per family on farmland that needed to be cleared and farmed. The immigrant colony members had little knowledge of agriculture and had difficulty farming the sandy [[South Jersey]] soil but received training from their neighbors. The HIAS paid workers weekly during the period in which land was cleared. Initially, Alliance was also supported by local politicians who arranged for 1,000+ army tents for the community for shelter until permanent housing could be built.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, Ellen. ''Jewish Agricultural Societies in New Jersey, 1882-1920''. [[Syracuse University Press]], Syracuse: 1995. 90-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community makeup ==
The Alliance Colony was primarily a farming community but also included various craftsmen, such as cabinetmaking, blacksmithing and masonry. Eventually a clothing factory was established, which is still in existence.

In 1901, there were 151 adults at Alliance and 345 children, 27 of whom were married.  There were 78 farms worth $135,250. The community owned {{convert|1886|acre|km2}} of land, of which 1,354 were cleared.&lt;ref&gt;Brandes, Joseph. ''Immigrants to Freedom: Jewish Communities in Rural New Jersey since 1882''. [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], Philadelphia: 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alliance focused on education, building several well recognized schools as well as four synagogues--at least one of which still is in operation--as well as a Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopedia.com - ALLIANCE" /&gt;

Prominent Americans from Alliance Colony include [[Gilbert Seldes]], born January 3, 1893, writer and cultural critic, and his older brother [[George Seldes]], born November 16, 1890, an investigative journalist and media critic. Joseph Perskie become the first Jewish justice to serve on the New Jersey Supreme Court, and the Bayuk brothers went on to found the [[Phillies (cigar)|Phillies Cigar company]].&lt;ref name=Israelowitz&gt;{{cite book|last=Israelowitz|first=Oscar|title=Jewish New Jersey in Vintage Photographs|year=2006|publisher=Israelowitz Publishing|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=1-878741-59-4|page=113|url=http://www.israelowitzpublishing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
All of the Jewish Agricultural Societies of the late 19th century and early 20th century have faded away.

Remnants of Alliance Colony exist today, the cemetery is still in use for the Jewish communities in Cumberland and Salem Counties and is well maintained, the home of Moses Bayuk, the founder of the colony is still standing and there are plans to turn the property into a cultural center and museum.

The last known survivor of the Alliance Colony, Lillian Greenblatt Braun, celebrated her 100th birthday in 2005.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;  She died on October 20, 2015 at the age of 110.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thedailyjournal/obituary.aspx?n=lillian-braun&amp;pid=176182860&amp;fhid=15592]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish Federation of Cumberland, Gloucester &amp; Salem Counties is currently working on building a Jewish Heritage Center on the property to commemorate the community's history, the history of Jews in America and their participation in [[farming]].&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, Kevin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/23colnj.html "Preserving the History of a Colony"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 23, 2007. Accessed July 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The old ''Tifereth Israel'' synagogue, built in vernacular style in 1889 and disused in 1996, is  one of the few [[Oldest synagogues in the United States|surviving 19th-century synagogues]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Mark. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_jewish_history/v084/84.1gordon_tab01.html "Rediscovering Jewish Infrastructure: Update on United States Nineteenth Century Synagogues"], ''American Jewish History'', 84.1 (1996), pp. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, William Levin, a descendant of Moses Bayuk, and his wife Malya Levin, publicly launched the Alliance Community Reboot project (also known as ACRe), in an effort to renew the agricultural life of the old Alliance Colony. They began a collaboration with local Jewish farmer [[Nathan Kleinman]] of the [[Experimental Farm Network]], who planted various heritage grains and other heirloom plants on one of the fields owned by the Levins, close to the old ''Tifereth Israel'' synagogue. They plan to expand operations over the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/kevin_riordan/a-new-generation-of-jewish-farmers-see-a-fertile-future-in-south-jersey-20170725.html?mobi=true&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Labor Party (NSW)''', commonly known as '''[[Lang Labor]]''', was a political group arising from a major breakaway from the [[Australian Labor Party]] in [[New South Wales]] that operated from 1931 to 1936, when the two groups were reconciled.

==History==
Following the start of the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1931|1931 Labor split]], with the support of the state party, the Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], repudiated the [[Premiers' Plan]] agreed by a meeting of the [[Premiers of the Australian states]] in June 1931 for the economic management of the [[Great Depression in Australia]] and announced a policy of foreign debt repudiation, known as the "Lang Plan", and imposed a moratorium on the New South Wales government's overseas loans. This was contrary to the policy of the federal Labor government led by [[James Scullin]]. As a result, Lang's supporters, led by [[Jack Beasley]] and [[Eddie Ward]], were expelled from the federal [[Caucus]].

This led to a split between the Federal and State executives of the Labor party. In 1931 Lang's supporters in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voted with the [[United Australia Party]] Opposition to bring down the Scullin Labor government and force an early election. At the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 federal elections]], the Lang-controlled New South Wales Branch ran candidates as the Australian Labor Party (New South Wales), but they were generally known as Lang Labor candidates. Supporters of the federal party (led in New South Wales by [[Ted Theodore]] and [[Ben Chifley]]) were known as [[Federal Labor Party (NSW)|Federal Labor]] candidates.

The elections resulted in a landslide defeat for Federal Labor, but most of the Lang members had ultra-safe working class seats and survived, although Ward was narrowly defeated in [[Division of East Sydney|East Sydney]], before returning at the [[East Sydney by-election, 1932|1932 East Sydney by-election]]. Lang Labor won four seats, while nationwide the ALP retained only 14 seats after the loss of 32 seats, and won only three seats in New South Wales. Theodore and Chifley were both defeated ending Theodore's political career. 

Lang Labor significantly increased its total vote, and won nine seats, at the [[Australian federal election, 1934|1934 federal election]], which saw the ALP win only one seat in New South Wales ([[Division of Newcastle|Newcastle]]).

In September 1935, [[John Curtin]] succeeded Scullin as Federal Labor leader and in February 1936 he brought about a reconciliation with the New South Wales Branch, resulting in Labor running as a single party throughout the nation at the [[Australian federal election, 1937|1937 federal election]]. Though Labor remained in opposition after the election, the party's competitiveness was restored with a large increase to their vote and seats held, becoming the largest single party in the House of Representatives on both votes and seats, and successfully positioning the party to form government a year after the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]]. Furthermore the ALP would enjoy their greatest House of Representatives victory both in terms of proportion of seats and their strongest national two-party vote at the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 federal election]] and additionally their first successful federal re-election attempt at the [[Australian federal election, 1946|1946 federal election]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4648">'''Benjamin Franklin Feinberg''' (October 23, 1888 – February 6, 1959) was an American lawyer and politician from [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was [[Majority Leader of the New York State Senate|Temporary President of the New York State Senate]] from 1944 to 1949.

==Life==
He was born on October 23, 1888, in [[Malone (village), New York|Malone]], [[Franklin County, New York]]. Later he lived in [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]].

He was a member of the [[New York State Senate]] from 1933 to 1949, sitting in the [[156th New York State Legislature|156th]], [[157th New York State Legislature|157th]], [[158th New York State Legislature|158th]], [[159th New York State Legislature|159th]], [[160th New York State Legislature|160th]], [[161st New York State Legislature|161st]], [[162nd New York State Legislature|162nd]], [[163rd New York State Legislature|163rd]], [[164th New York State Legislature|164th]], [[165th New York State Legislature|165th]], [[166th New York State Legislature|166th]] and [[167th New York State Legislature]]s; and was Temporary President from 1944 to 1949.

He was a delegate to the [[New York State Constitutional Convention]] of 1938. He was an alternate delegate to the [[1940 Republican National Convention]], and a delegate to the [[1944 Republican National Convention|1944]] and [[1948 Republican National Convention]]s.

==Feniberg Law==
In 1949, he sponsored the [[Feinberg Bill]], an act to purge [[Communist]] and [[fellow traveler]] teachers from the State public-school system.&lt;ref&gt;The Feinberg Law. (1949). The New Republic, 121(24), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill required the Regents of the State School Board to draw up a list of all subversive organizations. Membership in such organizations was sufficient grounds for summary removal. Although the law focused on organisational membership, in its implementation it would delve into people’s reading preferences, social activities, rallies attended, petitions signed, and beliefs on current political issues.&lt;ref&gt;Smolla, R. (2011). Academic Freedom and the Living Constitution. In The Constitution Goes to College (p. The Constitution Goes to College, Chapter 002). NYU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The regents were also empowered to dismiss school employees for the "utterance of any treasonable or seditious word...or the doing of any treasonable or seditious act..." regardless of their affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;Heins, Marjorie. “The Board of Education and the Feinberg Law.” Priests of Our Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge, NYU Press, 2013, pp. 69–86. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qfmg6.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Law was struck down in 1967 as unconstitutional in its violations of individual liberties.&lt;ref&gt;'End of the Feinberg Law'. ''New York Times'', January 26, 1967, Page 32, New York edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
On March 30, 1949, Feinberg was appointed Chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission, and remained in office until 1958.

==Legacy and death==
Feinberg was instrumental in the founding of the [[State University of New York]],{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and the Library at [[SUNY Plattsburgh]] is named after him.

He died on February 6, 1959, in [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]], of [[kidney]] disease.

The '''Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act''' ('''CISPA''' {{USBill|112|HR|3523}} (112th Congress), {{USBill|113|HR|624}} (113th Congress), {{USBill|114|HR|234}} (114th Congress)) was a proposed law in the United States which would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies. The stated aim of the bill is to help the U.S. government investigate cyber threats and ensure the security of networks against cyberattacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=HR 3523 as reported to the House Rules Committee | url=http://www.rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228035632/http://www.rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf | archivedate=February 28, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 a version of CISPA was hidden in the total federal budget.

CISPA had garnered favor from corporations and lobbying groups such as [[Microsoft]], [[Facebook]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[IBM]], and the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], which look on it as a simple and effective means of sharing important cyber threat information with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=CISPA: Who’s for it, who’s against it and how it could affect you | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/cispa-whos-for-it-whos-against-it-and-how-it-could-affect-you/2012/04/27/gIQA5ur0lT_story.html | author=Hayley Tsukayama | newspaper=[[Washington Post]] | date=April 27, 2012 | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has however been criticized by advocates of [[Internet privacy]] and [[civil liberties]], such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], [[Fight for the Future]], and [[Avaaz.org]], as well as various [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups including the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], TechFreedom, [[FreedomWorks]], [[Americans for Limited Government]], [[Liberty Coalition]], and the [[American Conservative Union]]. Those groups argue CISPA contains too few limits on how and when the government may monitor a private individual’s Internet browsing information. Additionally, they fear that such new powers could be used to spy on the general public rather than to pursue malicious hackers.&lt;ref name="techdirt1"&gt;{{cite web | last=Masnick  | first=Mike  | url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120402/04425118325/forget-sopa-you-should-be-worried-about-this-cybersecurity-bill.shtml  | title=Forget SOPA, You Should Be Worried About This Cybersecurity Bill  | publisher=Techdirt  | date=April 2, 2012  | accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://techland.time.com/2012/04/19/5-reasons-the-cispa-cybersecurity-bill-should-be-tossed/ 5 Reasons the CISPA Cybersecurity Bill Should Be Tossed] Time Techland, By Matt Peckham&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
CISPA is an amendment to the [[National Security Act of 1947]], which does not currently contain provisions pertaining to cybercrime. It adds provisions to the Act describing cyber threat intelligence as "information in the possession of an element of the intelligence community directly pertaining to a vulnerability of, or threat to, a system or network of a government or private entity, including information pertaining to the protection of a system or network from either "efforts to degrade, disrupt, or destroy such system or network".&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/CyberBillDiscussion113011.pdf H.R. 3523 Discussion Draft] - U.S. House of Representatives - November 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CISPA requires the Director of National Intelligence to establish procedures to allow [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] elements to share cyber threat intelligence with private-sector entities and encourage the sharing of such intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CRS report on CISPA | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03523:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; | publisher=Congressional Research Service | accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kominsky|first=Mitchell|date=February 2014|title=The Current Landscape of Cybersecurity Policy: Legislative Issues in the 113th Congress|url=http://harvardnsj.org/2014/02/the-current-landscape-of-cybersecurity-policy-legislative-issues-in-the-113th-congress/|journal=Harvard Law School National Security Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 16, 2012, press release, the [[United States House Select Committee on Intelligence|House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] announced the approval of several amendments to CISPA, including the addition of a new provision "to permit federal lawsuits against the government for any violation of restrictions placed on the government’s use of voluntarily shared information, including the important privacy and civil liberties protections contained in the bill," the inclusion of an anti-tasking provision to "explicitly prohibit the government from conditioning its sharing of cyber threat intelligence on the sharing of private sector information with the government", and the prevention of the government from using the information for "any other lawful purpose unless the government already has a significant cybersecurity or national security purpose in using the information". Relevant provisions were also clarified to "focus on the fact that the bill is designed to protect against unauthorized access to networks or systems, including unauthorized access aimed at stealing private or government information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Discussion Draft HR 3523 | url=http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/bill-status-update-hr-3523 | publisher=[[United States House Select Committee on Intelligence]] | accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, already collected cyberthreat data can also be used to investigate "the imminent threat of bodily harm to an individual" or "the exploitation of a minor," bringing the bill into line with existing law codified by the [[Patriot Act]] and the PROTECT Our Children Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/s1738|title=PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008 (2008; 110th Congress S. 1738) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which these two conditions already allow for protected entities to share data voluntarily with the United States government, law enforcement agencies, and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].

==Recent developments==
Bill sponsors [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]] and [[Dutch Ruppersberger]], the chairman and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, respectively, said on April 25, 2012, that the Obama administration's opposition is mostly based on the lack of critical infrastructure regulation, something outside of the jurisdiction of the Intelligence committee; they have also since introduced a package of amendments to the legislation that, "address nearly every single one of the criticisms leveled by the Administration, particularly those regarding privacy and civil liberties of Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Albanesius | first=Chloe | title=White House Threatens to Veto CISPA | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403549,00.asp | publisher=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the opposition the bill has experienced, the co-sponsors are planning to amend the bill to address many of the concerns of its opponents—including limiting its scope to a narrower definition of cyber-threats, and stating that the "theft of intellectual property" refers to the theft of [[research and development]]. In addition, there will now be penalties if private companies or the government uses data from CISPA for purposes "unrelated to cyberthreats".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/new-cispa-amendments-expected-but-the-fight-will-go-on/ New CISPA amendments expected - but the fight will go on] - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/cispa-and-sopa-like-apples-and-oranges-say-chief-co-sponsors/ CISPA and SOPA like 'apples and oranges,' say chief co-sponsors] - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sharan Bradford Franklin, of the [[Constitution Project]] states, "Although we appreciate the Intelligence Committee's efforts to improve the bill and willingness to engage in a dialogue with privacy advocates, the changes in its most current draft do not come close to addressing the civil liberties threats posed by the bill, and some of the proposals would actually make CISPA worse. Therefore, Congress should not pass CISPA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-lacks-protections-for-individual-rights | title=CISPA Lacks Protections for Individual Rights | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainey Reitman, of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] states, "To date, the authors of the bill have been unresponsive to these criticisms, offering amendments that are largely cosmetic. Dismissing the grave concerns about how this bill could undermine the core privacy rights of everyday Internet users, Rep. Mike Rogers characterized the growing protests against CISPA as 'turbulence' and vowed to push for a floor vote without radical changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-is-dangerously-vague | title=CISPA Is Dangerously Vague | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kendall Burman of the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] states, "The authors of CISPA have made some positive changes recently. Unfortunately, none of the changes gets to the heart of the privacy concerns that Internet users and advocacy groups have expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-not-the-right-way-to-achieve-cybersecurity | title=CISPA Not the Right Way to Achieve Cybersecurity | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Office of Management and Budget]] of the Executive Office of the President of the United States released a statement strongly opposing the current bill and recommending to veto it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saphr3523r_20120425.pdf Statement of Administration Policy - H.R. 3523 - Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act] - Office of Management and Budget, April 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2012, the House of Representatives passed CISPA.

On February 13, 2013, United States Representative Mike Rogers reintroduced the CISPA bill in the 113th Congress as H.R. 624.&lt;ref name=CISPA-reintroduced/&gt;

On April 18, 2013, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 624.&lt;ref name=Final-Vote-Results/&gt; The Senate has reportedly refused to vote on the measure and is drafting competing legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Smith | first=Gerry | title=Senate Won't Vote On CISPA, Deals Blow To Controversial Cyber Bill | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/cispa-cyber-bill_n_3158221.html | accessdate=April 29, 2013 | newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior attempts for U.S. cybersecurity bills==
Since legislation must pass the House and the Senate within the same Congress, anything introduced during the [[112th United States Congress|112th]] or earlier Congresses has to pass both chambers again.

===Senate===

[[File:Statue of Dharmabhakta.jpg|thumb|right|A bust of Late Martyr Dharma Bhakta Mathema built in memory of him.]]

Martyr (Sahid) '''Dharma Bhakta Mathema''' (1908 – 24 January 1941) is one of the revered freedom fighters of Nepal, who sacrificed his life in struggle for freedom against hereditary prime ministership of the [[Rana dynasty]]. He was a professional wrestler and [[body builder]] as well as a founding member of [[Nepal Praja Parishad|Praja Parishad]] party of [[Nepal]]. He was hanged during the freedom movement, and he is duly recognized as one of the four [[martyrs of Nepal]]. His statue is found, along with other three martyrs, in the Martyr's Gate (Sahid Gate) memorial in [[Kathmandu]]. A school is also established on his name 'Shahid Dharma Bhakta School (SDB)' currently located in Nakkhu, [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]], [[Nepal]] by her daughter Renu Devi which runs the classes from [[montessori]] to grade 10 (School Leaving Certificate). He is also said to have introduced modern body building techniques in Nepal. 

==Early life==
Dharma Bhakta Mathema was born of a [[Newar]] family in [[Kathmandu]] in 1908 (1965 BS). His father Adi Bhakta Mathema held a government office as a ''subba'' during the Rana rule. He often went to India to purchase things for the Ranas. He met learned men in India and understood the importance of education. He received his basic education in Sanatan Madhyamik Vidhyalaya in Darjeeling, after which he went to the [[Scottish Church College]] in [[Calcutta]] to get an Intermediate in 
Arts (I.A.) degree.

==Bodybuilding==
Dharma Bhakta was thin and unhealthy during his childhood, which caused other children to tease and bully him. To put an end to all that, he joined a [[gym]] while in [[Calcutta]]. Constant physical exercise rapidly improved his health. He so excelled in bodybuilding that he was announced as "Shree Bengal" (which literally means "Mr. Bengal") in an all Bengal bodybuilding contest.

After graduating with an I.A. degree from Scottish Church College, he married Uttaradevi from [[Biratnagar]]. He returned to Kathmandu and established a gym at his aunt Yamkumari Ray's house. Many youths of Kathmandu were attracted by the novelty of the gym. The gym attracted not only the commoners but also the Rana family and the police forces too. Once a troop of German soldiers had come to Nepal for a visit. He showed his body building tricks and exercises to them in the presence of [[Juddha Shumsher]]. His proficiency easily won their hearts. 

Once during the [[Ghode Jatra]] festival, he showed his bodybuilding 
prowess to the people in the presence of [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]] and the Rana family in Tundikhel. He made different bodybuilding poses and performed many test of strength. For instance, he put a long rod on his back and told three to four persons on each side of the rod to hang. He was then jumping and lifting with those people. In another instance he lied down on the ground and told a person to hammer his chest with a hammer. People were amazed that he was unharmed. People could not believe that a man could be so strong. [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]] was also greatly impressed by his feat, so much so such that he was appointed as a physical instructor to the king.

==Political activity==
Besides bodybuilding, he was actively interested in politics. At that time the struggle for the independence from the [[British Raj]] was gaining momentum in India. While in India Dharma Bhakta had met [[Chittaranjan Das]] and had joined in the struggle for Indian independence. He wanted to establish a political party and settle in India itself. But for some reason he dropped that plan and returned to Kathmandu with an ardent desire for freedom from the [[Rana dynasty|Rana regime]]. Tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution characterized Rana rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Angela|title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Lal |first=C.

In those days, [[Juddha Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Juddha Shamsher]] was the prime minister of Nepal, who ruled with an iron fist. All political parties were banned. Dharma Bhakta met Dashrath Chand in Kathmandu in 1990 BS and in 1936 AD, a political party Praja Parishad was founded in the house of Dharma Bhakta. The founders were [[Tanka Prasad Acharya]], Jiwan Raj Sharma, Ramhari Sharma, Dharma Bhakta and [[Dashrath Chand]]. His connection with [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuwan]] as a physical instructor allowed him to act as a go-between the king and the Praja Parishad. He conveyed every activity of the Praja parishad to the King. However discovery of his political activities prompted Juddha Shamsher to exile his father Adi Bhakta Mathema.

==Death==
One day, a secret meeting of Praja Parishad was held in Lainchaur which was also attended by King Tribhuwan. The information of this meeting reached Juddha Shamsher, which led to the arrest of many of the members of Praja Parishad including, Dharma Bhakta were arrested. Since three of the founding members of Praja Parishad were of Brahmin caste, and hence were exempt from death penalty, they were duly humiliated and exile. As for Dashrath Chand and Dharma Bhakta, their caste could not provide a shield against the ruthlessness of a tyrant. Both of them were given death penalty. On 24 January 1941 (Magh 12, 1997 BS), Dharma Bhakta was hanged till death at Shifal, Kathmandu, at midnight.

The book included transcriptions of theatre workshops held by Fo and Rame as well as two new translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DARIO FO AND FRANCA RAME THEATRE WORKSHOPS At Riverside Studios, London|url=http://www.rednotes.net/projects/fo-rame-workshops/|website=Red Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery translated three Fo plays published in the collection which followed his 1997 award of the Nobel Prize in Literature: ''Misterro Buffo'', ''Accidental Death of an Anarchist'', and ''One was Nude and One Wore Tails''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1997|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1997/fo-bibl.html|website=Nobelprize.org|access-date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism==
After translating for the English edition of [[Le Monde diplomatique]] for several years, Emery also began writing for the paper on topics such as music, culture, poetry, and Middle Eastern politics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mondediplo.com/_Ed-Emery_|title=Ed Emery archive|website=Le Monde Diplomatique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
From 2000-2015 Emery organised the annual Hydra Rebetiko Gathering devoted to Greek rebetiko urban blues music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydra conferences|url=http://www.doctor-dark.webspace.virginmedia.com/rebetiko/hydra.html|website=Rebetiko, some notes by the Walrus}}&lt;/ref&gt; He works particularly on Greek, Arabic and Kurdish music, with a particular focus on migrant musicians in Calais and Dunkirk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking Freely: Ed Emery on Music and Free Expression|url=https://www.freewordcentre.com/blog/2013/05/speaking-freely-ed-emery-on-music-and-free-expression/|website=Free Word|last=Sedgman|first=Sam|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ed Emery on dancing for Kobane|url=http://mondediplo.com/2015/04/17podcast|website=Le Monde Diplo|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work on maqamic music and on medieval Arabic and Hebrew music is reflected in ongoing conferences organised by The Free University, of which he is the founder and sole member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreeuniversity.net/muwashshah/|title=The Muwashshah Conference|website=The Free University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCboORgWFUnKdX8LERpRnurA|title=Maqam Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==
In 2000 he set up The Free University, an international conference-based network of colleagues researching a variety of topics. Under the umbrella of that university, and in conjunction with the History Department of the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)]] he is the organiser of a number of international animal conferences on the history and future prospects of quadruped cultures around the world: for example, the Donkey Conference, the Camel Conference, the Elephant Conference and the War Horses of the World conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Donkey Conference|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/history/conferences/donkey-conference/|access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/camelconference2015/|title=The Camel Conference|access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Elephant Conference|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/elephant-conference-2016/|access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=War Horses Conference|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/history/conferences/war-horses-conference-2014/|access-date=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he was appointed Research Associate at the Centre for Migration and Diaspora Studies at SOAS. As a co-author, he has been collected by libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n94057334/ |title=Emery, Ed |publisher=worldcat.org |access-date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">'''''Epistrategos''''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπιστράτηγος}}, "over-[[strategos|general]]"; {{lang-la|epistrategus}}) was a senior military and administrative office in [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was retained during the subsequent [[Roman Egypt|Roman period]] as well.

Under Ptolemaic rule, a Greek ''[[strategos]]'' was appointed to each of the Egyptian [[nome (Egypt)|nome]]s, originally as garrison commander for the Greek troops, but soon eclipsing the [[nomarch]] and assuming administrative duties as well. Gradually, a number of nomes began being placed under the authority of a single ''strategos'', and under [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] ({{reign|283|246 BC}}), the office of ''epistrategos'' of the "''Chora''" (i.e. the interior country) was established, with authority over the other ''strategoi'' in the entirety of Egypt beyond the capital, [[Alexandria]]. Later, a second ''epistrategos'' was created for the [[Thebaid]]. As with most of the Ptolemaic system, the office was retained after the Roman takeover in 30 BC, with a layer of Roman officials under the [[augustal prefect]] grafted onto the existing administrative structure. The office remained important, although it apparently lost any military responsibility; very soon, it came to be held by [[Roman citizens]] of [[Equestrian order|equestrian]] status. Reflecting the Roman division of Egypt in three broad areas (the [[Nile Delta]] area or [[Lower Egypt]], Middle Egypt or [[Heptanomis]], and the Thebaid), during the Roman era there were three or four ''epistrategoi'', as there were often two holders of the office in Lower Egypt, one for the east and one for the west.

'''F. Wolfgang Schnell''' (* 18 May 1913 in [[Bad Oeynhausen]]; † 29 December 2006 in [[Stuttgart]]) was a German professor of applied genetics and plant breeding. He belonged to the most prominent scientists in his field during the second half of the 20th century.

==Curriculum vitae==
F. Wolfgang Schnell attended high school (Gymnasium) in [[Celle]], [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], and [[Leipzig]]. After having passed the final examinations (Abitur) in 1931 he served his apprenticeship in agriculture on a farm near [[Hamburg]] (1932–1934). Thereafter he studied agricultural sciences in Berlin, Munich, and Göttingen (1935–1939). Military service (1939–1945) and captivity (1945–1948) interrupted his scientific career for almost ten years. In 1949 he received a doctoral degree in agricultural economics at the [[University of Göttingen]]. He then changed the subject and attended a two-year training course in plant breeding at the [[Max-Planck-Institute]] (MPIZ) in Voldagsen (later Cologne). In 1952 he got an appointment at an MPIZ branch station in Scharnhorst close to Hannover. There he was responsible for the cross-pollinated cereals maize (Zea mays) and rye (Secale cereale). He focussed upon the general principles of plant breeding methodology and the genetic foundations of heterosis. In 1958 he spent six months at the [[North Carolina State University]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] (hosted by CC Cockerham, RE Comstock, and HF Robinson) and visited several other leading US universities. These visits greatly stimulated his research since he became acquainted with cutting edge research in statistics, quantitative genetics, and breeding methodology. Five years later, he earned his ''Habilitation'' degree at the University of Göttingen, qualifying him to work as a university professor. In the same year (1963) he was appointed full professor and director of the newly established Institute of [[Plant Breeding]] at the [[University of Hohenheim]] (Stuttgart, Germany). There he headed the Chair of Applied Genetics and Plant Breeding until his retirement in 1981. During most of this time he also acted as director, later as a major scientific advisor, of the Hohenheim State Plant Breeding Institute (Landessaatzuchtanstalt).

==Research achievements==
Already Schnell's early  research at Scharnhorst received great national and international recognition. He significantly contributed to progress in the biometrical, [[population genetic]], and quantitative genetic foundations of modern plant breeding. His greatest achievements were an extension of the linkage theory to an arbitrary number of loci and the derivation of formulae for the genetic covariance between relatives in the presence of arbitrary linkage and epistasis. The genuine impact of these two breakthroughs only became apparent about five decades later with the advent of affordable high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies. In addition, Schnell extended the theory of selection for quantitative traits to multiple stages and developed models for assessing the influence of epistasis on heterosis. Last but not least, he modernized the design and analysis of plant breeding field experiments by implementing new statistical tools and electronic data processing technologies.

Schnell's breeding activities were mainly directed to the two open-pollinated cereals [[rye]] and [[maize]]. In rye he started a systematic search for cytoplasmic male sterility in backcross generations of crosses between European and ''exotic'' rye accessions. This program was continued by HH Geiger and in 1984 lead to the first listed hybrid rye varieties worldwide. In maize Schnell developed early-maturing flint and dent line gene pools and in 1965 released the first German double-cross hybrid 'Velox' (FAO 210).

At the University of Hohenheim Schnell focused on the development of  a comprehensive theory of plant breeding. Major research topics of his group included 
* modelling epistasis in the presence of linkage,
* quantitative genetic interpretation of heterosis,
* expected response to multi-stage and multi-trait selection,
* optimal breeding plans and
* [[genetic correlation]] between testcross and per se performance of inbred lines.

All theoretical studies were accompanied by extensive field experiments, many of which were conducted in collaboration with breeding companies.

After his retirement (1981) Schnell concentrated his research on the development of a unified quantitative genetic theory of [[heterosis]]. In several papers and scientific talks he made valuable contributions to this topic. In one of his last papers (together with C.C. Cockerham, Genetics 1992) he clarified the influence of multiplicative gene action versus other types of epistasis in heterosis.

Schnell excelled in intellectual power, clear research concepts, and a strong mission towards promoting plant breeding. His creative power resulted from his enthusiasm for gaining scientific knowledge and for developing superior breeding strategies. He once compared his scientific enthusiasm with a stampeder’s frenetic search for gold.

==Teaching==
When Schnell was appointed professor of Applied Genetics and Plant Breeding at Hohenheim, no adequate course program existed in this field. During the first years of his employment he therefore spent most of his energy on developing an up-to-date teaching program covering all relevant basic and applied areas. According to his research interests he put particular emphasis on the theoretical foundations and the general principles of plant breeding. He classified the breeding methods into four ''breeding categories'' viz. line, population, hybrid, and clone breeding. These categories are unambiguously defined by the reproductive characteristics and the genetic structure of the resulting varieties as well as by the mode of reproduction of the respective species. This classification system proved highly useful not only in teaching but also in research. In the course of time the system was adopted by many colleagues in Germany and abroad.

Schnell also built up first courses in biometry and population genetics. To strengthen these subjects, the University of Hohenheim followed his proposal to install a new chair for each of these fields (1971). Thereby Hohenheim became one of the most attractive places for studying plant breeding in Germany. Furthermore, he suggested a fundamental reform of the study course in Agricultural Sciences and, together with D Fewson (animal breeding), he initiated a new study course in Agricultural Biology.

Schnell mentored 26 Ph.D. students, many of whom reached leading positions in research institutions and breeding companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9366">{{For|the use of the term fiscal federalism as applied to Scotland|Full fiscal autonomy for Scotland}}
As a subfield of [[public economics]], '''fiscal federalism''' is concerned with "understanding which functions and instruments are best centralized and which are best placed in the sphere of [[Decentralization|decentralized]] levels of government" (Oates, 1999). In other words, it is the study of how competencies (expenditure side) and fiscal instruments (revenue side) are allocated across different (vertical) layers of the administration. An important part of its subject matter is the system of [[transfer payment]]s or [[grant (money)|grants]] by which a central government shares its [[revenue]]s with lower levels of government.

Federal governments use this power to enforce national rules and standards. There are two primary types of transfers, conditional and unconditional. A conditional transfer from a federal body to a province, or other territory, involves a certain set of conditions. If the lower level of government is to receive this type of transfer, it must agree to the spending instructions of the federal government. An example of this would be the [[Canada Health Transfer]].

An unconditional grant is usually a cash or tax point transfer, with no spending instructions. An example of this would be a [[equalization payments|federal equalization transfer]].

This may be noted that the concept of fiscal federalism is relevant for all kinds of government: unitary, federal and confederal.&lt;ref&gt;(King, 1984, Grornrndijk, 2002:1, Sharma 2005b).&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of fiscal federalism is not to be associated with fiscal decentralization in officially declared federations only; it is applicable even to non-federal states (having no formal federal constitutional arrangement) in the sense that they encompass different levels of government which have de facto decision-making authority.&lt;ref&gt;(Sharma, 2005a: 44)&lt;/ref&gt;

This, however, does not mean that all forms of governments are 'fiscally' federal, only that 'fiscal federalism' is a set of principles that can be applied to all countries attempting 'fiscal decentralization'. In fact, fiscal federalism is a general normative framework for assignment of functions to the different levels of government and appropriate fiscal instruments for carrying out these functions &lt;ref&gt;(Oates, 1999: 1120-1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Governor of Rivers State]] of Nigeria, [[Ezenwo Nyesom Wike]] said that he believes true fiscal federalism will "strengthen the economy of his country as all sections will develop based on their comparative advantages".&lt;ref name="Vanguard12"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Jimitota Onoyume]]|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/06/rivers-advocates-fiscal-federalism|title=Rivers State advocates fiscal federalism |date=15 June 2017|work=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]]|accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These questions arise: (a) how are federal and non-federal countries different with respect to 'fiscal federalism' or 'fiscal decentralization', and (b) how are fiscal federalism and fiscal decentralization related (similar or different)?

Chanchal Kumar Sharma &lt;ref&gt;(2005a, 2005b)&lt;/ref&gt; clarifies that while "fiscal federalism constitutes a set of guiding principles, a guiding concept" that helps in designing financial relations between the national and subnational levels of the government, "fiscal decentralization on the other hand is a process of applying such principles".&lt;ref&gt;(Sharma, 2005b: 178)&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal and non-federal countries differ in the manner in which such principles are applied. Application differs because unitary and federal governments differ in their political and legislative context and thus provide different opportunities for fiscal decentralization.&lt;ref&gt;(Sharma, 2005a:44)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main concepts ==

The concepts of fiscal federalism are related to vertical and horizontal fiscal relations. The notions related to horizontal fiscal relations are related to regional imbalances and horizontal competition. Similarly the notions related to fiscal relations are related to vertical fiscal imbalance between the two senior levels of government, that is the centre and the states/provinces. While the concept of horizontal fiscal imbalance is relatively non controversial (as explained above), the concept of vertical fiscal imbalance is quite controversial (see Bird 2003&lt;ref&gt;Bird, R.M. 2003. ‘Fiscal Flows, Fiscal Balance, and Fiscal Sustainability’, Working Paper 03-02, Atlanta: Georgia State University.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Vertical Fiscal Imbalance (VFI) is conceptually distinct from the notion of Vertical Fiscal Gap (VFG). These terms are used as synonyms, but they are not. &lt;ref&gt;SHARMA, C. K. (2011), BEYOND GAPS AND IMBALANCES: RE-STRUCTURING THE DEBATE ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL RELATIONS. Public Administration. Vol. 89 {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01947.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following Sharma (2011), any existing revenue-expenditure asymmetry between the two levels of a government should simply be called a Vertical Fiscal Asymmetry (VFA). The precise nature of this asymmetry, in a particular country, can be determined by using certain criteria that the author has evolved. The kind of policy solution to be applied will depend on the nature of asymmetry (VFA). Thus, there can be three types of VFAs:

# Fiscal asymmetry with fiscal imbalance: VERTICAL FISCAL IMBALANCE (VFI). This means inappropriate allocation of revenue powers and spending responsibilities. This state can be remedied by reassignment of revenue raising powers.
# Fiscal asymmetry without fiscal imbalance but with a fiscal gap: VERTICAL FISCAL GAP (VFG). This means a desirable revenue-expenditure asymmetry but with a fiscal gap to be closed. This state can be remedied by re-calibration of federal transfers.
# Fiscal asymmetry without fiscal imbalance and without fiscal gap: VERTICAL FISCAL DIFFERENCE (VFD). This means a desirable revenue-expenditure asymmetry without a fiscal gap ( i.e. gap is closed). This is a state of fiscal asymmetry where there is "no imbalance and no gap" and thus needs no remedial measure.

The VFI-VFG-VFD offers a nice framework to understand and debate issues surrounding fiscal federalism. VFD is a concept that has entered the lexicon of fiscal federalism and has the power to clarify the debate on intergovernmental financial relations.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Garcia (2016) Fiscal Federalism. presented at Federalist Academy, 8–10 July 2016, Brussels]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertical Fiscal Gap as the revenue deficiency arising from a mismatching between revenue means and expenditure needs.

'''[http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_35929024_1_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Network on Fiscal Relations Across Levels of Government]'''

The relationship between central and subcentral government bodies has a profound effect on efficiency and equity within the government and on macroeconomic stability of the country. The role of the '''OECD Network on Fiscal Relations Across Levels of Government''', part of its [[Centre for Tax Policy and Administration]], is to provide data and analysis on these relationships between organizations at different levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/department/0,3355,en_2649_35929024_1_1_1_1_1,00.html "Fiscal Federalism Network," &lt;u&gt;OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration&lt;/u&gt;, OECD.org, 17 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53972">The 1992 match between former World Chess Champions [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Boris Spassky]] was billed as a [[World Chess Championship]], but was unofficial.  It was a rematch of the [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 World Championship]] match. The match started in [[Sveti Stefan]] near [[Budva]], an island off the coast of [[Montenegro]]. The match rules required a player to win ten games (draws not counting), with no {{chessgloss|adjournment|adjournments}}. After a player had won five games, the match would take a 10-day recess and continue in [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]].  Both places were at the time part of the same country, the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was under heavy UN economic sanctions because of the country′s involvement in the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|wars]] in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

Fischer won the match 10–5.

==Background==
After defeating Spassky to win the title of World Champion in the [[World Chess Championship 1972]], Fischer was scheduled to defend his title in 1975 against the winner of the [[World Chess Championship 1975#1974 Candidates tournament|1974 FIDE Candidates Tournament]], [[Anatoly Karpov]]. Fischer, however, was unhappy with the format of the World Championship. At the time the format was a 24-game match, with the winner being the first player to score 12½ points; if the match was drawn 12–12, then the match would be stopped, the prize money split, and the Champion retained his title. Fischer disliked this format because the player who was leading could play to draw games instead of win, and with each drawn game coast closer to the title. In his match against Spassky in 1972, games 14 to 20 were all draws. This style of chess offended Fischer. Instead, Fischer demanded the format be changed to that used in the very [[World Chess Championship 1886|first World Championship]], between [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Johannes Zukertort]], where the winner was the first player to score 10 wins with draws not counting. In case of a 9–9 score, the champion would retain title, and the prize fund split equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seirawan |first=Yasser |date= |title=Winning Chess Brilliancies |url= |location= |publisher=Microsoft Press |page= |isbn=978-1857443479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kasparov |first=Garry |date= |title=My Great Predecessors, Volume IV |url= |location= |publisher=Gloucester Publishers |page= |isbn=1-85744-395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A FIDE Congress was held in 1974 during the [[Nice, France|Nice]] [[Chess Olympiad|Olympiad]]. The delegates voted in favor of Fischer's 10-win proposal, but rejected the 9–9 clause as well as the possibility of an unlimited match.&lt;ref&gt;Plisetsky &amp; Voronkov 2005, pp. 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Fischer refused to defend his title, and Karpov was declared World Champion by forfeit.

Seventeen years later, Fischer entered negotiations with sponsors willing to fund a match under his proposed format, settling on a bid from Yugoslav millionaire [[Jezdimir Vasiljević]]. Fischer insisted that since he had not been defeated in a match, he was still the true World Champion. He further claimed that all the games in the FIDE-sanctioned World Championship matches, involving Karpov and his challengers [[Viktor Korchnoi|Korchnoi]] and [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], had prearranged outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weeks|first=Mark |url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/92fs$$.htm |title=1992 Fischer – Spassky Rematch Highlights |publisher=Printer |date=1997–2008 |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then played a rematch of the 1972 World Chess Championship against Spassky (tied for 96th–102nd on the FIDE rating list at the time). The purse for the rematch was US$5&amp;nbsp;million, with $3.35&amp;nbsp;million of the purse to go to the winner.&lt;ref&gt;Seirawan &amp; Stefanovic 1992, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4374811.stm |title=Bobby Fischer arrives in Iceland |publisher=''BBC News''|date=March 25, 2005 |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ozone.unep.org/Publications/MP_Handbook/Section_3.8_Annexes_Declarations/Question_of_Yugoslavia.shtml |title=Question of Yugoslavia (1992) |publisher=Ozone Secretariat |year=2004 |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r210.htm |title=General Assembly |publisher=United Nations |date=December 21, 1993 |accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After Fischer's victory, he proclaimed himself as the "Undefeated Champion of the World". His status as a World Champion in 1992 is not widely acknowledged.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{Citation |last=Burgess |first=Graham |authorlink=Graham Burgess |title=The Mammoth Book of Chess |year=2010 |edition= |publisher=Running Press |id= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the FIDE world champion was [[Garry Kasparov]]. Kasparov was also world number one in the current (July 1992) rating list with a 2790 rating, a 70-point lead over second ranked [[Vassily Ivanchuk]]. Fischer's score of 17½ out of 30 (counting draws) against Spassky, rated 2545 at the time, gave him a performance rating of 2645,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ratings.fide.com/calculator_rp.phtml FIDE Chess Rating Calculator] using Rc=2545, W=17.5, N=30. Accessed 31-Aug-2017&lt;/ref&gt; which would have put him at No. 12 in the world on the July 1992 list. [[Yasser Seirawan]] believed that the match proved that Fischer's playing strength was "somewhere in the top ten in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Seirawan &amp; Stefanovic 1992, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov himself was dismissive of Fischer, stating that "Bobby is playing OK, nothing more. Maybe his strength is 2600 or 2650. It wouldn't be close between us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waitzkin |first=Fred |authorlink=Fred Waitzkin |title=Mortal Games: The Turbulent Genius of Garry Kasparov |year=1993 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-399-13827-7 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fischer never played competitively again after this match, and died in 2008.

As for Spassky, this match proved to be his last major challenge. He continued to play occasional events, but never participated in a world championship cycle again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6221">The '''Futian incident''' ({{zh|c=富田事变|p=Fùtián shìbiàn}}) is the common title for the December 1930 [[purge]] of a battalion of the [[Jiangxi-Fujian Soviet]]'s "Red Army" at Futian (now in the [[Ji'an]]'s [[Qingyuan District]]). The Futian battalion's leaders had mutinied against [[Mao Zedong]]'s purge of the Jiangxi Action Committee, ordered on the pretext of its alleged connection to the [[Anti-Bolshevik League incident|Anti-Bolshevik League]] and ties to [[Trotskyism]].&lt;ref name=saich&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tony Saich |author2=Benjamin Yang |author3=Bingzhang Yang |title=The Rise to power of the Chinese Communist Party |publisher= Published by M.E.

==Background==
In response to the [[Anti-Bolshevik League incident]], the Futian battalion rebelled against Mao, claiming that Mao was attempting to arrest generals [[Zhu De]] and [[Peng Dehuai]], and surrender to the KMT army.&lt;ref name=saich/&gt; These claims were unfounded, but the rebellion highlights the friction that existed between factions of the Red Army during the early days of the Communist revolution. In response to the rebellion, 700 officers of the Futian battalion were arrested and executed, and the remnants of the battalion were absorbed into others.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

During the Futian incident Zhu De and Peng Dehuai were unequivocal supporters of Mao, despite their different political positions. This allowed Mao's position as leader of the Red Army to be vindicated.&lt;ref name=saich/&gt;

==Further developments==
In September 1956, Mao admitted that the purges during the Anti-Bolshevik League incident, as well as the Futian incident, were a mistake, in which the wrong people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;"Literature of Chinese Communist Party", 1991; Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, President [[Yang Shangkun]] commissioned an investigation into the Futian incident, which recommended the rehabilitation of the victims, but it was never followed up due to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] and subsequent massacre.

The term '''Green New Deal''' (also '''New New Deal''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.redpepper.org.uk/A-Green-New-Deal/ |title=A Green New Deal |last=Jepps |first=Jim|last2=Read |first2=Rupert |author-link2=Rupert Read |date=21 January 2009 |website=[[Red Pepper (magazine)]] |access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-economist-com.abc.cardiff.ac.uk/node/12637053 |title=How new a deal? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=20 November 2008 |website=[[economist.com]] |access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe any [[stimulus (economics)|stimulus package]] that aims to address both [[Financial crisis|financial crises]] and [[environmental issue]]s such as [[global warming|climate change]]. The term references the [[New Deal]], the social and economic stimulus package undertaken by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in response to the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Lovell (July 21, 2008) [https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL204610020080721 "Climate report calls for green 'New Deal'"], Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of a Green New Deal most likely advocate for a combination of Roosevelt's fiscal ideals with more contemporary approaches such as [[Renewable energy commercialization|investment in renewable energies]] and the promotion of greater [[resource efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/en/2013/11/25/toward-transatlantic-green-new-deal Hilary French, Michael Renner and Gary Gardner: Toward a Transatlantic Green New Deal] The authors state: "Support is growing around the world for an integrated response to the current economic and environmental crises, increasingly referred to as the "Green New Deal". The term is a modern-day variation of the U.S. New Deal, an ambitious effort launched by President Franklin Roosevelt to lift the United States out of the Great Depression. The New Deal of that era entailed a strong government role in economic planning and a series of stimulus packages launched between 1933 and 1938 that created jobs through ambitious governmental programs, including the construction of roads, trails, dams, and schools. Today's Green New Deal proposals are also premised on the importance of decisive governmental action, but incorporate policies to respond to pressing environmental challenges through a new paradigm of sustainable economic progress."&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the concept ==
[[File:TVA Results of Fertilizer.gif|thumb|New Deal - use of synthetic fertilizers to boost agricultural production]]
[[File:Solar panels in Oregon vineyard.jpg|thumb|Green New Deal - Sustainable agriculture combined with the generation of renewable energy]]
An early influential use of the term Green New Deal, which gave it prominence in the US and well beyond, was by journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://grist.org/article/whats-the-green-new-deal-the-surprising-origins-behind-a-progressive-rallying-cry/|title=What’s the ‘Green New Deal’? The surprising origins behind a progressive rallying cry.|last=Kaufman|first=Alexander C|date=2018-06-30|work=Grist|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He  argued in favor of such concepts in two pieces that appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Friedman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/opinion/15iht-web-0415edgreen-full.5291830.html?pagewanted=all The Power of Green]. ''The New York Times Magazine'', April 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Friedman, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E5DD1E30F93AA25752C0A9619C8B63 A Warning From The Garden], ''The New York Times'', January 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007 Friedman wrote:{{quote|If you have put a windmill in your yard or some solar panels on your roof, bless your heart. But we will only green the world when we change the very nature of the electricity grid -- moving it away from dirty coal or oil to clean coal and renewables. And that is a huge industrial project -- much bigger than anyone has told you. Finally, like the New Deal, if we undertake the green version, it has the potential to create a whole new clean power industry to spur our economy into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Friedman: [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E5DD1E30F93AA25752C0A9619C8B63 A Warning From The Garden], ''The New York Times.'' January 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}This approach was subsequently taken up by the Green New Deal Group,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lynas: [http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2008/07/lynas-towards-economy-climate A Green New Deal], ''[[New Statesman]]'', July 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; which published its eponymous report on July 21, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://neweconomics.org/2008/07/green-new-deal Larry Elliott, Colin Hines, Tony Juniper, Jeremy Leggett, Caroline Lucas, Richard Murphy, Ann Pettifor, Charles Secrett &amp; Andrew Simms, A Green New Deal: Joined-up policies to solve the triple crunch of the credit crisis, climate change and high oil prices.] new economics foundation, July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was further popularized and put on a wider footing when the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) began to promote it. On October 22, 2008 UNEP's Executive Director [[Achim Steiner]] unveiled the ''Global Green New Deal'' initiative that aims to create jobs in "green" industries, thus boosting the world economy and curbing climate change at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Eccleston, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3353698/UN-announces-green-New-Deal-plan-to-rescue-world-economies.html UN announces green "New Deal" plan to rescue world economies], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', October 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== General proposals ==
Broadly, the proposals for a Green New Deal echo the recommendations of UN-mandated organizations such as [[ICLEI]] or the [[TEEB]], of global NGOs, and of the [[Basel II]] and related monetary accords, especially as these relate to reforms to measurement of fundamental ecosystem risk and financial liabilities. The [[reinsurance]] industry has also expressed support for the general principles of global carbon and emissions charges, for metrics of ecosystem destabilization risk, and for raising the price companies and individuals have to pay when using [[nature's services]] and [[natural resource]]s.

Several measures proposed as part of a Green New Deal have already been implemented in one or more G8 or G20 countries including Norway, South Korea, the UK, Germany, and the US. The financial proposals echo some of the programs already underway at the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[World Bank]], [[Bank for International Settlements|BIS]] and [[European Central Bank|ECB]] that aim to better reflect the value of ecosystems and reduce systematic incentives to invest in "dirty" or destructive industries.

== Actual measures ==

* Government-led investment in energy and [[resource efficiency]], as well as reusable energies and [[microgeneration]];
* Low-carbon infrastructure redevelopment in order to create jobs;
* A directed tax on the profits of oil and gas companies with proceeds being invested in renewable energy and energy efficiency;
* Financial incentives for [[Eco-investing|green investment]] and reduced energy usage, including low interest rates for green investment;
* Re-regulation of international finance, including capital controls, and increased scrutiny of [[financial derivative]]s - likely along the lines of [[Basel II]];
* Curbing corporate [[tax evasion]] through compulsory financial reporting and by clamping down on [[tax haven]]s;
* A [[Global Marshall Plan Initiative]] using "green quantitative easing" to create money to fund the "great transition" to a society free of fossil fuels and other measures that aim to preserve the biosphere.

==Notable proponents==
*The [[European Green Party]] and [[The Greens–European Free Alliance]] campaigned on the Green New Deal in the [[European Parliament election, 2009]] and maintain an ongoing European "Green New Deal" campaign

== United States ==
In the United States, [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Jill Stein]] made a Green New Deal a central part of her campaigns as early as 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/the-3-green-party-candidates-and-their-disappointing-platforms/257436/|title=The 3 Green Party Candidates and Their Disappointing Platforms|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|date=May 21, 2012|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greens continued to suggest a Green New Deal in their rebuttal to the 2018 State of the Union speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2018/01/31/green-party-rebuttal-president-trumps-2018-state-union-address|title=Green Party Rebuttal to President Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address|website=Common Dreams|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green New Deal is officially part of the platform of the Green Party of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gp.org/green_new_deal|title=Green New Deal|website=GPUS|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gp.org/gnd_full|title=GND-Full Language|website=GPUS|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Green New Deal" wing began to emerge in the Democratic Party after the November 2018 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-new-deal-progressive-democrats_us_5be26f5be4b0769d24c6a954|title=Democrats’ Green New Deal Wing Takes Shape Amid Wave Of Progressive Climate Hawk Wins|last=Kaufman|first=Alexander C.|date=2018-11-07|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/why-the-best-new-deal-is-a-green-new-deal/|title=Why the Best New Deal Is a Green New Deal|last=Carlock|first=Greg|date=|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-11-13|last2=McElwee|first2=Sean|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible program in 2018 for a "Green New Deal" assembled by the think tank Data for Progress was described as "pairing labor programs with measures to combat the climate crisis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://earther.gizmodo.com/most-americans-think-we-can-save-the-planet-and-create-1829168916|title=Most Americans Think We Can Save the Planet and Create Jobs at the Same Time|last=Kahn|first=Brian|work=Earther|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dataforprogress.org/green-new-deal/#introduction|title=Green New Deal Report|website=Data For Progress|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 2018 article in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' stated, "There isn’t just one Green New Deal yet. For now, it’s a platform position that some candidates are taking to indicate that they want the American government to devote the country to preparing for climate change as fully as [[Franklin D.

A week after the 2018 midterm elections, [[climate justice]] group Sunrise Movement organized a protest in [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s office calling on Nancy Pelosi to support a Green New Deal. On the same day, freshman congresswoman [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] launched a resolution to create a committee on the Green New Deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/14/18094452/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-nancy-pelosi-protest-climate-change-2020|title=Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is already pressuring Nancy Pelosi on climate change|last=Roberts|first=David|date=November 15, 2018|work=Vox|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, several candidates came out supporting a "Green New Deal", including [[Deb Haaland]], [[Rashida Tlaib]], [[Ilhan Omar]], and [[Antonio Delgado (politician)|Antonio Delgado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/11/07/saving-planet-green-new-deal-proves-popular-climate-hawks-celebrate-midterm|title=Saving Planet With 'Green New Deal' Proves Popular as Climate Hawks Celebrate Midterm Victories|last=Corbett|first=Jessica|date=November 7, 2018|work=Common Dreams|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the end of November, eighteen Democratic members of Congress were co-sponsoring a proposed House Select Committee on a Green New Deal, and incoming representative [[Ayanna Pressley]] had announced her support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/11/30/number-dems-backing-green-new-deal-swells-18-campaigners-demand-all-party-stand|title=As Number of Dems Backing Green New Deal Swells to 18, Campaigners Demand All of Party 'Stand Up to Fossil Fuel Billionaires'|last=Germanos|first=Andrea|date=November 30, 2018|work=Common Dreams|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ocasio-cortez-diverse-lawmakers-prioritize-climate-change-green-new-deal-n942336|title=Ocasio-Cortez, diverse lawmakers prioritize climate change with 'Green New Deal'|last=Gamboa|first=Suzanne|date=November 30, 2018|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations supporting a Green New Deal initiative included [[350.org]], [[Greenpeace]], and [[Friends of the Earth|Friends of the Earth.]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/417843-five-things-to-know-about-ocasio-cortezs-green-new-deal|title=Five things to know about Ocasio-Cortez’s 'Green New Deal'|last=Homan|first=Timothy R.|date=2018-11-24|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Opponents noted that the costs of a Green New Deal had not been fully determined, and that achieving 100% [[Renewable energy in the United States|renewable energy]] might not be possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

Paul Bledsoe of the [[Progressive Policy Institute]] expressed concern that setting unrealistic "aspirational" goals of 100% renewable energy, as in the Ocasio-Cortez proposal, "does a disservice to the real seriousness of [[climate change]]", and could undermine "the credibility of the effort."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Incoming committee chairs [[Frank Pallone]] and [[Peter DeFazio]] indicated a preference for handling these matters in the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce Committee]] and the [[House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/419117-dems-rally-for-green-new-deal|title=Dems rally for Green New Deal|last=Cama|first=Timothy|date=2018-11-30|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast, Representative [[Ro Khanna|Ro Kahanna]] thought that creating a Select Committee specifically dedicated to a Green New Deal would be a "very commonsense idea", based on the recent example of the [[United States House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming|Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming]] (2007-2011), which had proven effective in developing a [[American Clean Energy and Security Act|2009 bill for cap-and-trade legislation]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

==Critique==
Some developing countries have argued that a global Green New Deal may undermine national sovereignty regarding a country's control over its natural resources. Brazil, Mexico, and India have emphasized national sovereignty when discussing the Green New Deal, with India also expressing fears of a green "economic straitjacket". Bolivia, on its part, has argued that a Green New Deal may signal the "privatization and [[commodification of nature]]".&lt;ref&gt;Vedeld, Trond (2011): [http://www.nibr.no/filer/2011-118.pdf ''Grønn økonomi og Rio 20+. "Business as usual" eller nytt paradigme?''] (NIBR Notat 2011:118); Vedeld, Trond (2012): [http://blog.nibrinternational.no/#post48 D''eveloping Countries say no to green economy, yes to sustainable development''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430042505/http://blog.nibrinternational.no/ |date=2011-04-30 }} (NIBR International Blog 31.01.12)&lt;/ref&gt; China, while voicing some support for a Green New Deal, also pointed out that it may result in "trade protectionism under the pretext of environmental protection".

In the US, [[Robert Pollin]] characterized the concept of a "Green New Deal" as "egalitarian green growth," indicating that the seriousness of concerns about climate is also giving rise to alternative [[Degrowth]] proposals to contract economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/112/robert-pollin-de-growth-vs-a-green-new-deal|title=De-Growth vs a Green New Deal.|last=Pollin|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Pollin|date=July–August 2018|website=New Left Review 112|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4526">'''Haringey Solidarity Group''' or '''HSG''' is a collective of [[community]] [[activists]] based in the [[London Borough of Haringey|Borough of Haringey]], [[London]].

==Aims==

HSG is active in a wide range of campaigns and struggles for social justice, workers' control, public services, civil liberties and a sustainable environment. It also aims to help to build stronger local communities. HSG supports workers' disputes (e.g. postal workers, tubeworkers, Visteon workers, council bin workers) and campaigns against council cuts, health cuts, the loss of local community facilities (e.g. a local park, a community pub), and on disability, environmental, housing and claimants' issues. HSG aims to resist state control by campaigning against ID cards, against racism, oppressive policing and deaths in police custody, and in support of asylum seekers and refugees. The group holds regular open meetings and discussion evenings, and produces leaflets, posters and booklets.
HSG helps to set up and support similar groups in other London boroughs, under the name "Radical London", and wants to see ultimately a national network of such groups. The group aims to support local community struggles and hopes that other community groups will support them, this is the source of the word [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] within their name. The group aims to practise, encourage and support self-organised struggles by ordinary people within Haringey, against bosses, local councils, or multi-national corporations.

==History==

HSG was formed out of the remains of the Haringey [[Anti Poll Tax Union]], after the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]] was defeated. "Originally set up to fight the poll tax, they decided to carry on after the tax was defeated." &lt;ref&gt;Schnews. 2001. 'Avin It In Haringey. In. Monopolise Resistance. http://www.schnews.org.uk/monopresist/monopoliseresistance/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Initial hopes for several groups across the Borough proved to be unsustainable and after three years the groups were combined into one group. "In April 1991 it held its first meeting as Haringey Solidarity Group and by January 1992 it had formed three separate groups around the borough in Tottenham, Green Lanes, and Wood Green. Not being able to sustain three separate groups it came back together as HSG in September 1994. " &lt;ref&gt;Anon. 2009. Haringey Solidarity Group - some activities past and present [1990-2005]. http://radicalhistorynetwork.blogspot.com/2009/09/haringey-solidarity-group-some.html Wednesday, September 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 HSG set up the popular Haringey Independent Cinema (www.haringey.org.uk/hic). HSG has also put on events to bring other groups and the community together, such as Haringey Independence Day (www.haringey.org.uk/hid).

==Activities==

Members of HSG are active in their [[residents associations]],&lt;ref&gt;http://libcom.org/library/residents-take-over-community-organising&lt;/ref&gt; [[anti-fascism]], and [http://www.haringey.org.uk/ID.html Haringey Against ID], anti [[billboards]], anti [[debt]] campaigns, and various other antis. HSG continues to encourage  [[tenants]] and [[workers]] [[self organisation]] throughout the borough, and have supported various workers struggles in the Borough of Haringey and beyond, including the 1995 JJ Foods Strike.&lt;ref&gt;http://libcom.org/library/1995-the-jj-foods-strike&lt;/ref&gt; HSG members are also involved in organising free community festivals, the monthly [http://www.haringey.org.uk/hic/ Haringey Independent Cinema], and many other social events. Many of the people in HSG are involved with local resident, community and other campaigning groups around the borough. HSG regularly distributes thousands of copies of its free newsletter ''Totally Indypendent''. The group is non-hierarchical. All major decisions are made at monthly general meetings which are open to anyone. Subgroups are formed for specific tasks (e.g. a newsletter) or to campaign on a specific issue, and these too are open to new people.

In diplomatic usage, '''head of mission''' ('''HOM''') or '''chief of mission''' ('''COM''') from the French "chef de mission diplomatique" (CMD) is the head of a diplomatic representation, such as an [[ambassador]], [[High Commissioner|high commissioner]], [[Papal diplomacy|nuncio]], [[chargé d'affaires]], [[permanent representative]], and to a [[Consul (representative)|consul-general]] or consul. Depending on the context, it may also refer to the heads of certain [[international organization]]s' representative offices. Certain other titles or usages that would qualify as a head of mission or equivalent also exist. While they are primarily referred to by the other titles mentioned above, it is common for the diplomatic corps of several countries to use deputy head of mission or [[Deputy Chief of Mission|deputy chief of mission]] (DCM) as the primary title for the second in command of a diplomatic mission.

In diplomatic missions and foreign services where ambassadors may be political appointees rather than career diplomats, the deputy chief of mission may be the senior career foreign service professional and generally understood to be more than a "deputy."

Heads of offices of international organizations below this diplomatic rank who are that organization's senior official in country, such as a project manager, and of private sector organizations and firms are commonly called "chiefs of party" to distinguish them from "chiefs of mission."

'''Chef de Mission''' is also the title of the team manager of a national delegation in major international multi-discipline sporting events, such as the [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://olympic.ca/press/rio-chef-de-mission-backgrounder/ |title=Chef de Mission Rio 2016 Backgrounder |publisher=[[Canadian Olympic Committee]] |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International concentration camp committees''' are organizations composed of former inmates of the various [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s, formed at various times, primarily after the [[Second World War]]. Although most survivors have since died and those who are still alive are generally octogenarians, the committees are still active.

== Committees' history and purpose ==
During the [[Nazi era]], there were active, underground resistance organizations at several of the camps, such as those at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], [[Buchenwald Resistance|Buchenwald]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. After liberation, these groups became the foundation of post-war survivor organizations for their respective camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/04/12/6289056.html "65 years since liberation of Buchenwald"] (April 12, 2010). Retrieved April 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration camp committees are international organizations because their members come from and live in many different countries. The purpose of the committees is to educate the world about what was done under the [[Third Reich]] regarding the arrest and deportation of religious, political and social groups considered "undesirable" by the [[National Socialists]]. They also serve to care for the survivors of Nazi brutality, and finally, the committees facilitate communication and cooperation among survivors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auschwitz.info/e/history.html History of the International Auschwitz Committee] Retrieved April 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationales-sachsenhausen-komitee.eu/index_homenews1.htm Description of the International Sachsenhausen Committee], official website.

Retrieved April 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The committees' efforts have resulted in the establishment of numerous camp memorials and commemorative events and displays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comiteinternationaldachau.com/index.php/1/home.html Comité International de Dachau] History of the organization.

Retrieved April 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal in the new century ==
Held under the auspices of the [[International Auschwitz Committee]] in [[Berlin]], there was a meeting of the presidents of the international camp committees from January 24–27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auschwitz.info/e/events_statements/090125_meeting_presidents.html "The Survivors’ Bequest”] International Auschwitz Committee official website. (January 25, 2009) Retrieved April 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A document was produced under the auspices of the [[International Auschwitz Committee]] that was signed by representatives of ten different Nazi concentration camps in [[Berlin]] on January 25, 2010. It refers to the pledge taken by survivors to work for peace and freedom, to remember the past and work to keep [[fascism]] from gaining ascendancy and noting the thinning ranks of their own members, it calls on young people to take up the work for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergenbelsen.de/pdf/Vermaechtnis-engl.pdf "Preserve Remembrance — Conserve Authentic Places — Assume Responsibility"] (PDF) Document signed by representatives of 10 Nazi concentration camp committees.

The '''July Theses''' ({{lang-ro|Tezele din iulie}}) is a name commonly given to a speech delivered by [[Romania]]n [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party|leader]] [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] on July 6, 1971, before the Executive Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR).  Its full name was ''Propuneri de măsuri pentru îmbunătățirea activității politico-ideologice, de educare marxist-leninistă a membrilor de partid, a tuturor oamenilor muncii'' ("Proposed measures for the improvement of political-ideological activity, of the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] education of Party members, of all working people").

Strict ideological conformity in the humanities and social sciences was demanded. Competence and aesthetics were to be replaced by ideology; professionals were to be replaced by [[Agitprop|agitators]]; and culture was once again to become an instrument for [[communist propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Bozóki, p. 57"&gt;Bozóki, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their final version of early November 1971, publicized as an official document of the PCR Plenum, the Theses carried the title: ''Expunere cu privire la programul PCR pentru îmbunătățirea activității ideologice, ridicarea nivelului general al cunoașterii și educația socialistă a maselor, pentru așezarea relațiilor din societatea noastră pe baza principiilor eticii și echității socialiste și comuniste'' ("Exposition regarding the PCR programme for improving ideological activity, raising the general level of knowledge and the socialist education of the masses, in order to arrange relations in our society on the basis of the principles of socialist and communist ethics and equity").&lt;ref name = "Cioroianu 489" /&gt;

==Background==
After a period of rigid [[Stalinism]] from 1948, Romanian cultural life experienced a modest trend of [[liberalization]] and ideological relaxation in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name = "Cioroianu 489" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hitchins 1081"&gt;Keith Hitchins, "Historiography of the Countries of Central Europe: Romania", ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 97, No. 4. (Oct. 1992), p. 1081.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tismăneanu 223-42"&gt;Tismăneanu, pp. 223–42.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend accelerated with the IXth Congress of the Romanian Communist Party in 1965.&lt;ref name = "Tismăneanu 223-42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.bcub.ro/continut/unibib/memoria_comunismului.php "Memoria comunismului. Fondul ISISP din Biblioteca Centrală Universitară din București" ("The Memory of Communism. The ISIP Fund at the Central University Library in Bucharest")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506024827/http://www.bcub.ro/continut/unibib/memoria_comunismului.php |date=2007-05-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; A talented oppositional generation of writers emerged: [[Nichita Stănescu]], [[Ana Blandiana]], [[Gabriel Liiceanu]], [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [[Adrian Păunescu]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Bozóki, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, at the April 1968 Central Committee plenum, Ceaușescu denounced his predecessor [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] and rehabilitated [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]], executed just two days before Ceaușescu joined the [[Politburo]] (thus allowing him to claim innocence and to demote a key rival, [[Alexandru Drăghici]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 397–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Deletant 182"&gt;Deletant, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tismăneanu 157-8"&gt;Tismăneanu, pp. 157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; This opened up even more space for artistic expression. [[Eugen Barbu]]'s novel ''Principele'' ("The Prince", 1969), though set in the [[Phanariotes|Phanariot]] era, clearly refers to Gheorghiu-Dej — there is even a project to build a [[canal]] that claims many of its builders' lives (a disguised reference to the [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]]).  In [[Dumitru Radu Popescu]]'s novel ''F'', abuses committed during [[Collective farming|collectivisation]] are explored. Augustin Buzura's novel ''Absenții'' ("The Absent Ones", 1970) went so far as to provide a critique of contemporary society, describing the spiritual crisis of a young doctor.&lt;ref name = "Deletant 182" /&gt;

To be sure, [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship]] remained in place. [[Alexandru Ivasiuc]] and [[Paul Goma]] had both been imprisoned for their participation in the [[Bucharest student movement of 1956]], and each wrote a novel about a man's prison experiences and efforts to readjust after his release. Goma's ''Ostinato'' describes prison life, [[Securitate]] methods and the excesses of collectivisation. The censor asked for changes; eventually Goma published the book uncut in [[West Germany]] in the fall of 1971. Ivasiuc, in his ''Păsările'' ("The Birds"), complied with the censor's demands by justifying the protagonist's arrest and portraying the secret police in a positive light. Nevertheless, most writers were optimistic that the Party would tolerate a broader range of themes in creative literature.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp. 182–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A thaw in relations with the [[United States]], chief adversary of the Communist bloc during the [[Cold War]], also took place and brought with it an impact on citizens' lives. A [[Pepsi|Pepsi-Cola]] factory opened in [[Constanța]] in 1967, its product promoted in the press through American-style advertisements. The slogan "Pepsi, drive and energy" ran regularly in newspapers that just a few years earlier made no mention of Western products. [[Coca-Cola]] was not produced domestically, but could be found in bars and "[[Comturist|Comturist shops]]", stores with a restricted clientele where Western goods could be purchased in hard currency. In 1968, the first student bar/club opened in Bucharest; a writer for ''Viața Studențească'' described "low tables, discreet light... chewing gum and cigarettes, Pepsi and Coca-Cola, mechanical games, billiards... plus a few hours of interesting discussions. Here is why the club bar appears as an answer to a natural need for communication, for exchanging ideas and clashing opinions... in a relaxed atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern American art, harshly criticised during the period of [[Socialist realism in Romania|socialist realism]], began to receive favourable coverage, as seen during an exhibition ("American painting since 1945") that opened in early 1969, featuring work by artists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[James Rosenquist]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, pp. 169-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the US government received praise: President [[Richard Nixon]]'s world tour of 1969 was closely followed,&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Apollo 11|moon landing]] that July featured in advertisements, was broadcast live (in Eastern Europe, only [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] did so as well), and occasioned warm greetings from Ceaușescu to Nixon and the American people.&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the high point of Romanian-American relations during the Communist period came early the following month, when tens of thousands of enthusiastic Bucharesters welcomed Nixon, who became the first US President to visit an Eastern Bloc country.&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing over three decades later, Sorin Preda, who arrived in [[Bucharest]] from [[Bacău]] as an 18-year-old in 1970, recalled the cultural scene:

{{bquote|Inexplicably and in part miraculously, around 1970, time had slowed down all of a sudden. Tired out, history left people alone for a few years, forgetting about denouncements and workers' wrath, about suspicions and ugly memories. It was the artists' time — including those just released from prison. It was the time of the thaw. For ''Leonce and Lena'', the [[Bulandra Theatre]] was packed with people who'd come to give standing ovations for [[Liviu Ciulei|Ciulei]], [[Lucian Pintilie|Pintilie]], [[Irina Petrescu]] and [[Ion Caramitru|Caramitru]]. Our great visual artists — Maitec, Apostu and [[Corneliu Baba|Baba]], opened a new exhibition almost every month. The [[Romanian Athenaeum|Athenaeum]] and [[Romanian National Opera, Bucharest|Opera]] would sell out shows for their entire run, while in bookstores, the works of [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]], [[Constantin Noica|Noica]], [[Marin Preda|Preda]], [[Nicolae Breban|Breban]], [[Constantin Țoiu|Țoiu]] or Nichita [Stănescu] were sold on the sly, with much pleading and insistence.

In the 1970s, life in Bucharest really started toward midnight. After a concert or a play, people went for a walk, to enjoy themselves.  The elegant downtown restaurants were full of artists and beautiful girls.  The best-known writers and journalists dined at [[Casa Capșa|Capșa]] and Berlin [Restaurant], while at the Mignon the first private restaurant had opened, owned by the Chivu brothers, where you could find the freshest seafood, brought that very day from Paris by air. The city adulated its artists, receiving Nichita as it would a handsome and rebellious prince, and Marin Preda like a patriarch. The lights shone on the streets and there were even a few neon signs, American-style.  No one was in a hurry. There was time for everything &amp;ndash; for books and films, for political jokes and for a glass of good wine.  For a moment, Bucharest had recovered its pre-war normalcy. A year later, in '71, the July Theses would draw an invisible scalpel line over people, over the white nights of Bucharest, over all our small, guiltless pleasures. A freezing gust of wind heralded the dreadful ideological winter that would soon arrive. In disbelief and naive, people continued to go out, to fill the theatres and concert halls, while Ciulei, Pintilie and [[Andrei Șerban]]'s bags were being prepared for their permanent departure from the country.

Not even when the Mignon restaurant was closed, and the light bulbs downtown disappeared one by one, did people stop hoping. It's as if no one wanted to believe that everything could end so quickly, in an absurd and unfair twist of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} Sorin Preda, [http://www.formula-as.ro/reviste_651__144__-cu-dragoste,-despre-bucuresti....html "Cu dragoste, despre București…" ("With Love, about Bucharest…")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406170148/http://formula-as.ro/reviste_651__144__-cu-dragoste,-despre-bucuresti....html |date=2007-04-06 }}, in ''Formula As''&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}

==The Theses==
[[File:CeausescuKim1971.jpg|thumb|250px|Ceaușescu meets Kim on June 15, 1971]]
Ceaușescu visited the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]] in 1971.&lt;ref name = "Cioroianu 489"&gt;Cioroianu, p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Tismăneanu 2412"&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 2412.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/collections/colltopic.cfm?lng=en&amp;id=19504&amp;navinfo=16447 Minutes of the Romanian Politburo Meeting Concerning Nicolae Ceaușescu's Visit to China, North Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120030149/http://www.php.isn.ethz.ch/collections/colltopic.cfm?lng=en&amp;id=19504&amp;navinfo=16447 |date=2016-01-20 }}, Parallel History Project on Cooperative Security &lt;/ref&gt; He took great interest in the idea of total national transformation as embodied in the programs of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] and China's [[Cultural Revolution]].  He was also inspired by the [[cult of personality|personality cults]] of China's [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality|North Korea's Kim Il-sung]].  Shortly after returning home, he began to emulate North Korea's system, influenced by [[Kim Il-sung]]'s ''[[Juche]]'' philosophy.

Upon his return, he issued the Theses, which contained seventeen proposals.&lt;ref name = "Cioroianu 489" /&gt; Among these were: continuous growth in the "leading role" of the Party; improvement of Party education and of mass political action; youth participation on large construction projects as part of their "patriotic work" (''muncă patriotică''); an intensification of political-ideological education in schools and universities, as well as in children's, youth and student organisations (like the [[Union of Communist Youth]] and its affiliates); and an expansion of political propaganda, orienting radio and television shows to this end, as well as publishing houses, theatres and cinemas, opera, ballet, artists' unions, etc., promoting a "militant, revolutionary" character in artistic productions. The liberalisation of 1965 was condemned, and an Index of banned books and authors was re-established.

Although presented in terms of "Socialist Humanism", the Theses in fact marked a return to [[Socialist realism in Romania|socialist realism]], reaffirming an ideological basis for literature that, in theory, the Party had hardly abandoned. The difference was the addition of Party-sponsored nationalism in [[historiography]]; quoting [[Nicolae Iorga]] in another speech in July 1971, Ceaușescu asserted that "the man who does not write for his entire people is not a poet",&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and presented himself as the defender of Romanian values (an intensification of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|the personality cult]]).&lt;ref&gt;Roper, Steven D., ''Romania: The Unfinished Revolution'', p. 51, Routledge, 2000, {{ISBN|90-5823-027-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Especially after the Writers' Congress of 1968, Party leaders started to clash with writers; earlier that year Ceaușescu had announced: "the freedom of the individual is not in contradiction with the general demands and interests of society but, on the contrary, serves these interests".&lt;ref&gt;Ceaușescu, in Verdery, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ceaușescu managed to co-opt numerous intellectuals (many of them formerly apolitical or even oppositionist) and bring them into the Party after condemning the [[Warsaw Pact]]'s [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]],&lt;ref name = "Verdery 185"&gt;Verdery, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; but still the Party began to intensify the struggle among writers as a group and between them and the Party. In 1970, awards of literary prizes brought the Party leadership into open conflict with the [[Writers' Union of Romania|Writers' Union]]. This determined the Party to recover the privilege of granting such awards and of determining their standards of value.&lt;ref&gt;Verdery, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these forebodings of conflict, the Theses, with their promise of [[Neo-Stalinism]], came as a shock. The Party was supposed to supervise the Theses' implementation closely and meticulously, but it was unable to do so with the same efficacy as in the 1950s.  In part, this was due to the artistic community, which was numbed by the proposals and roused into a temporary united front against them.  [[Zaharia Stancu]] and [[Eugen Jebeleanu]], long associated with the régime, joined in protest with younger writers like Buzura, Păunescu, Popescu and [[Marin Sorescu]]. [[Leonid Dimov]] and [[Dumitru Țepeneag]] denounced the proposals on [[Radio Free Europe]] in Paris, and [[Nicolae Breban]], editor-in-chief of ''[[România Literară]]'', resigned while in [[West Germany]] and attacked the Theses in an interview with ''[[Le Monde]]''. Writers appeared combative at a meeting with Ceaușescu in [[Neptun, Romania|Neptun]].&lt;ref&gt;Bozóki, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Deletant 185"&gt;Deletant, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Party issued its own counter-measures. For instance, a law passed in December 1971 prohibited the broadcasting or publication abroad of any written material that might prejudice the interest of the state. Romanian citizens were also forbidden from having any contact with foreign radio stations or newspapers, as this was considered hostile to Romania. One man who had submitted a volume of poetry to a critic for evaluation was tried for having written "hostile" verse; despite the critic having come to defend him, a military court sentenced him to 12 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name = "Deletant 185" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bozóki, p. 59"&gt;Bozóki, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in advance of the National Writers' Conference (May 1972), the writers' initial solidarity was destroyed by infighting, not by the Party (which temporarily withdrew into the background). After [[Ștefan Bănulescu]] resigned as editor of ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Păunescu fought with [[Fănuș Neagu]] for the position, which went to someone else, causing Neagu to leave the opposition. Initial supporters of the Theses included Eugen Barbu, [[Aurel Baranga]] and [[Mihnea Gheorghiu]]; Nichita Stănescu also claimed to have received them with "a particular joy" and to regard them as "a real aid to culture".&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, pp. 185–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers felt resentment at Goma's success in West Germany and at Țepeneag's having been translated into [[French language|French]]; the Party exploited this by persuading the Writers' Union to hold its 1972 congress with delegates elected by secret ballot, not by a general assembly — delegates would choose one of two names offered to them.&lt;ref name="Bozóki, p. 59"/&gt; By the time of the July 1972 National Party Conference, the cultural élite's strategies and the conflicts that would dominate the 1970s and 1980s had crystallized.&lt;ref name="Bozóki, p. 57"/&gt; Dissident [[Monica Lovinescu]] describes four features of the literary scene in Romania until 1989: intermittent courage; position in the social order transformed into an aesthetic criterion; the efficacy of some means of corruption; and a breakdown between generations, with many young oppositionists ready to compromise and some older writers ready to resist.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, in Bozóki, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The Party offered increased royalties and pensions and played upon writers' envy, which led to the exclusion of Goma and Țepeneag, who failed to be elected by secret ballot and were jeered when they spoke at the Union delegate election meeting before the conference; there, it was also established that Goma had no talent. While writers like Blandiana, Buzura, [[Ștefan Augustin Doinaș]] and [[Marin Sorescu]] refused to conform, maintaining moral and artistic integrity, Goma and Țepeneag were targeted for their readiness to challenge the Party's cultural dictates. Other writers were anxious not to jeopardise their privileges and afraid that the Party might use the Theses to bring new "writers" into a rebellious Union. They instead preferred subtle evasion of their constraints and so were reluctant to back the pair of more outspoken dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;Deletant, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within three years, the balance of power in the writers' community had shifted from the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s generation]] to the [[protochronism|protochronists]]; writers eager for greater influence could now obtain it by specialising in the production of ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Verdery, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; These included both figures on the decline who hoped to revive their careers, such as Barbu (whose career had suffered at the expense of oppositionists),&lt;ref name = "Verdery 185"&gt;Verdery, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and younger writers like Păunescu, an initial opponent.&lt;ref name = "Verdery 185" /&gt; The two factions remained in open conflict for a decade, but by 1981 the Party had rendered the Union impotent by freezing its funds and restricting its activities — no more Writers' Conferences were allowed after that year.&lt;ref&gt;Verdery, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, with the greater emphasis on ideology, force, and centralisation, and with more funds, the protochronists remained more influential until the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], having been reinforced by the "[[Mangalia]] Theses" in the summer of 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Liiceanu, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in the 1980s, Romanian culture and science became increasingly isolated internationally.&lt;ref&gt;''Istoria României în date'', p. 621, [[Editura Enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 2003, {{ISBN|973-45-0432-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also as a result of the Theses, [[sociology]] was removed as a university discipline and what was left was taught at the Party's [[Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy]].  The number of those allowed to study non-technical subjects at the university was sharply cut; fewer books were published; and the privileges formerly accorded to intellectuals were reduced. In 1974, the Academy of Sciences was forced to take on [[Elena Ceaușescu]] as a member and then its head; she politicized it to such an extent that its prestige and much of its serious research were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Chirot, Daniel, ''Modern Tyrants: the power and prevalence of evil in our age'', p. 246, [[Princeton University Press]], 1996, {{ISBN|0-691-02777-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Left Youth Solid''' (styled '''left youth ['solid]'''; {{lang-de|linksjugend ['solid]}}) is a political youth organisation in [[Germany]]. It is the official youth wing of the political party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]. It was formed in 2007 as the legal successor to '''Solid: the socialist youth''' (['solid] – die sozialistische jugend) which was the unofficial youth wing of the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] and its predecessor [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]]. The name "solid" comes from '''so'''zialistisch, '''li'''nks, '''d'''emokratisch ''(socialist, left, democratic.)''

''Solid: the socialist youth'' was formed in [[Hanover]] in June 1999 and was accepted by the Party of Democratic Socialism as a youth organisation "close to PDS" in March 2002. Membership is for people between the ages of 14 and 35 and in March 2005 they had 1,500 members.

Before 1999 the PDS's youth organisation was [[Arbeitsgemeinschaft Junge GenossInnen]]; since then, most young members of the Left-Party have concentrated within ['solid]. But due to differences, other young members formed the "PDS Youth", a youth organisation integrated within the party and by self-definition of the group serving to form future cadres for the full-fledged party. The PDS-youth is small compared to ['solid] and only represented in a small number of the federal [[States of Germany]].

On Solid's federal delegate congress on 20 May 2007, the organisation reorganised to the present structure including the former PDS Youth and the youth organisation of [[Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative|WASG]]. This was a response to the fusion of the Left Party/PDS and WASG.

'''Marvin Herman Scilken''' (December 7, 1926 – February 2, 1999)&lt;ref name="Davis2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald G. Davis|title=Dictionary of American Library Biography: Second supplement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91UjM6TLRJgC&amp;pg=PA196|date=January 2003|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|isbn=978-1-56308-868-1|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[librarian]] and a leader in the field of [[library science]] during the 20th century. Scilken dedicated his life to bringing awareness to libraries and improving services for patrons. He encouraged libraries to take a more practical approach to librarianship and to consider libraries as a house of books rather than information centers.   In 1999, ''[[American Libraries]]'' named him one of the "100 Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century".&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Kniffel, Peggy Sullivan, Edith McCormick, "100 of the Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century," ''American Libraries'' 30, no. 11 (December 1999): 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Marvin Scilken was born and raised in the [[Bronx, New York]].  His parents were Russian immigrants Joseph Scilken and Esther Scilken and he had one sister Marjorie. Scilken attended his local high school, [[Bronx High School of Science]], and then continued his education at the [[University of Colorado-Boulder]] where he earned bachelor's degrees in [[Economics]] and [[Philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Davis, D. G., &amp; Davis, D. G., Jr. (Eds.). (2003). Scilken. In ''Dictionary of American Library Biography'' (2nd ed., p. 196-199). Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited&lt;/ref&gt;

When he graduated in 1948, he had not yet considered pursuing a career in [[library science]]. It was not until 1960 that library science piqued his interest. Scilken was originally interested in pursuing his Masters in Library Science degree at [[Columbia University]]. However, upon applying to Columbia’s program, he was asked for an essay on why he was interested in becoming a librarian and, as Scilken said, “I dawdled so much that time ran out and I failed to get in” &lt;ref name="conversation"&gt;Deitch, J. (2002). A Conversation with Marvin Scilken. In ''Getting Libraries the Credit They Deserve: A Festschrift in Honor of Marvin H. Scilken” (p. 45-58). Oxford: Scarecrow Press&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he entered and graduated from [[Pratt Institute]]'s [[Pratt Institute School of Information and Library Science|School of Information and Library Science]] in [[Brooklyn]] instead.

Scilken’s career in library science began quickly. In 1964, only a few years after his graduation, he received a directorship at Orange Public Library in [[New Jersey]] where he remained until his [[retirement]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; Scilken served five consecutive terms on the [[American Library Association|American Library Association (ALA)]] Council, was a prolific writer of [[letters to the editor]], founded his own practical library journal the ''U*N*A*B*A*S*H*E*D Librarian'', and achieved early fame for stopping the [[price fixing]] of library books.

Scilken died February 2, 1999, from a heart-attack while attending that year's [[American Library Association]] midwinter meeting.&lt;ref name=ALA_Maverick&gt;{{cite web|title=Maverick Librarian Marvin Scilken Dies at ALA Midwinter|url=http://www.americanlibrariesmagazine.org/archive/1999/february1999/mavericklibrarian|website=American Library Association|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to Library Science==

===Advocacy through Newspapers===
Scilken’s passion for reading the ''[[New York Times]]'' led him to use [[newspapers]] as one of his largest platforms for library advocacy. He would write a letter to the editor for every newspaper he came across. Through these letters, Scilken sought to get people excited about their local libraries and encouraged libraries to better serve their patrons. Scilken’s letters were featured in large nationwide publications including ''Texas Highways'', ''American Airlines'', ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'', and ''[[Newsweek]]''. Although he wrote letters to papers across the country, many he wrote to his hometown paper the ''New York Times''.

===The U*N*A*B*A*S*H*E*D Librarian===
Scilken’s advocacy through writing would later inspire him to create his own publication the ''U*N*A*B*A*S*H*E*D Librarian, the how I run my library good letter''. Choosing topics that focused on the practical parts of librarianship, the publication featured a collection of articles, cartoons, letters, and advice all dealing with the world of [[libraries]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; Advice was given on how to better improve library services including an assortment of topics from more traditional cataloguing techniques to more practical cleaning techniques.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;Deitch, J. (1984). Portrait: Marvin Scilken. ''Wilson Library Bulletin'' (59), 205-207. Retrieved September 21, 2008, from Wilson Web database.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[quarterly]] publication was started in 1971 and quickly became a family affair. His wife, Polly, assisted with the editing and publishing and her brother came up with the title and design. Her brother had been working as a designer at [[Harper and Row]] a publishing house that had printed [[Leo Rosten|Leo Rosten’s]] novel ''The Education of H*Y*M*A*N* K*A*P*L*A*N*''.&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt;

The ''U*N*A*B*A*S*H*E*D Librarian'' is still published today and, as in years past, librarians look to it as a forum for sharing ideas on how to “run a library good.”

===1966 Senate Hearing on the Price Fixing of Library Books===
Besides his writings, he is perhaps best remembered for his appearance before the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate’s]] Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly. Although a new librarian at the time, Scilken discovered that publishers were charging the same price per a book no matter how many were purchased. He was infuriated that libraries were being forced to pay more while at the same time publishers were offering discounts to booksellers buying multiple copies.  Unable to negotiate with the publishers, Scilken wrote letters to the Federal Trade Commission and to state and local politicians. The only responses came from New Jersey [[Clifford Case|Senator Clifford Case]] and [[Philip Hart|Senator Philip Hart]], who was involved with the senate subcommittee. After indictments of a few publishing houses, a senatorial hearing was held. In the spring of 1966, publishers, Scilken, business men, and other librarians appeared before the subcommittee to give their testimony.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; In the end, it was found that publishers were in fact price fixing. Although not well covered by the press at the time, it changed the way libraries did business with publishers.

Over $10 million was returned to libraries after various lawsuits stemming from the hearings.&lt;ref name="conversation"/&gt;

==Views on Contemporary Library Science==

===On Serving the Patron===
Unlike most librarians, Scilken always chose to refer to patrons as customers and often said that his [[motto]] is “The customer is king.” &lt;ref name="conversation"/&gt; Libraries, according to Scilken, need to be aware of who their patrons are. He often encouraged public libraries to buy all of the bestsellers and not concern themselves with purchasing books that would generally only be found and used in academic libraries.

Scilken also encouraged libraries to employ ways which would foster the library customer’s curiosity and browsing experience. For example, he encouraged customers of his public library to leave notes in books as to whether they enjoyed it or not. This would aid other customers in their decision as to whether they should check-out the book. He felt that browsing was an important part of the library experience. He said, “Half the fun in a library is falling across the unexpected.” &lt;ref name="aphorisms"&gt;Roy, L. (2002). Scilken Aphorisms. In ''Getting Libraries the Credit They Deserve: A Festschrift in Honor of Marvin H. Scilken” (p. 59-90). Oxford: Scarecrow Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Library Science and Technology===
One of Scilken’s great concerns was that libraries are forgetting their roots and their identities. It worried him that librarians are changing their identity in order to seem current with technology. He had become concerned that libraries and librarians are too quickly adopting any new fad or technology.  Overall, he was disappointed that libraries are now considering themselves information centers. He encouraged libraries to return to their focus on books and often “[told his] colleagues that [libraries] are in the book business, not the information business.”&lt;ref name="conversation"/&gt;

'''Operation Demetrius''' was a [[British Army]] operation in [[Northern Ireland]] on 9–10 August 1971, during [[the Troubles]]. It involved the mass [[arrest]] and [[internment]] (imprisonment without [[Trial (law)|trial]]) of 342 people suspected of being involved with the [[List of organisations known as the Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), which was waging a campaign for a united Ireland against the British state. It was proposed by the [[Northern Ireland Government]] and approved by the British Government. Armed soldiers launched [[police raid|dawn raids]] throughout Northern Ireland, sparking four days of violence in which 20 civilians, two IRA members and two British soldiers were killed. All of those arrested were [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]], the vast majority of them Catholic. Due to faulty intelligence, many had no links with the IRA. [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] paramilitaries were also carrying out acts of violence, which were mainly directed against Catholics and Irish nationalists, but no loyalists were included in the sweep.&lt;ref name=cainsum&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/intern/sum.htm Internment – Summary of Main Events]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of internment, the way the arrests were carried out, and the abuse of those arrested, led to mass protests and a sharp increase in violence. Amid the violence, about 7,000 people fled or were forced out of their homes. [[Five techniques|The interrogation techniques]] used on the internees were described by the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in 1976 as [[torture]], but the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled on appeal in 1978 that while the techniques were "inhuman and degrading", they did not constitute torture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later revealed that the British government had withheld information from the ECHR and that a policy of torture had in fact been authorized by British government ministers.&lt;ref name=ministers-sanctioned&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/british-ministers-sanctioned-torture-of-ni-internees-1.1820882 'British ministers sanctioned torture of NI internees'] (5 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, the Irish government asked the ECHR to revise its 1978 judgement.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/1202/664159-hooded-men/|title=Government backs 'Hooded Men' torture case|date=2 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of internment lasted until December 1975 and during that time 1,981 people were interned;&lt;ref name="joint2005p110"&gt;{{cite book|title=Counter-Terrorism Policy And Human Rights: Terrorism Bill and related matters: Oral and Written Evidence|author=[[Joint Committee on Human Rights]], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|series=Counter-Terrorism Policy And Human Rights: Terrorism Bill and related matters|volume=2|year=2005|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2CRQ6hNzHuAC&amp;pg=PA114|ref={{harvid|Joint Committee|2005}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,874 were nationalist, while 107 were loyalist. The first loyalist internees were detained in February 1973.&lt;ref name=cainsum/&gt;

==Background and planning==
Internment had been used a number of times during [[Northern Ireland]]'s (and the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s) history, but had not previously been used during [[the Troubles]], which began in the late 1960s. [[Ulster loyalist]] paramilitaries, such as the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), had been engaged in a low-level violent campaign since 1966. After the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|August 1969 riots]], the [[British Army]] was deployed on the streets to bolster the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC). Up until this point, the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–69)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) had been largely inactive. However, as the violence and political situation worsened, the IRA was divided over how to deal with it. It split into two factions, the [[Provisional IRA]] and [[Official IRA]]. In 1970–71, the Provisionals began to retaliate against the British Army and the RUC. The Officials' policy was more defensive.&lt;ref name=irishstory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/08/10/today-in-irish-history-9-august-1971-internment-is-introduced-in-northern-ireland/|title=Today in Irish History, 9 August 1971, Internment is introduced in Northern Ireland|date=10 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1970–71, there were numerous clashes between state forces and the two wings of the IRA, between the IRAs and loyalists, and occasionally between the IRAs. Most loyalist attacks were directed against Catholic civilians, but they also clashed with state forces and the IRA on a number of occasions.&lt;ref name=irishstory/&gt;

The idea of re-introducing internment for [[Irish republican]] militants came from the [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|government of Northern Ireland]], headed by [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Faulkner]]. It was agreed to re-introduce internment at a meeting between Faulkner and UK Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] on 5 August 1971. The [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British cabinet]] recommended "balancing action", such as the arrest of loyalist militants, the calling in of weapons held by (generally unionist) rifle clubs in Northern Ireland and an indefinite ban on parades (most of which were held by unionist/loyalist groups). However, Faulkner argued that a ban on parades was unworkable, that the rifle clubs posed no security risk and that there was no evidence of loyalist terrorism.&lt;ref name="theirishstory.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/08/10/today-in-irish-history-9-august-1971-internment-is-introduced-in-northern-ireland/|title=Today in Irish History, 9 August 1971, Internment is introduced in Northern Ireland|date=10 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually agreed that there would be a six-month ban on parades but no interning of loyalists and that internment would go ahead on 9 August, in an operation carried out by the British Army.&lt;ref name=irishstory/&gt;

On the initial list of those to be arrested, which was drawn up by [[RUC Special Branch]] and [[MI5]], there were 450 names, but only 350 of these were found. Key figures on the list, and many who never appeared on them, had got wind of the swoop before it began. The list included leaders of the non-violent [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] such as [[Ivan Barr]] and [[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]]. But, [[Tim Pat Coogan]] noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;What they did not include was a single Loyalist. Although the UVF had begun the killing and bombing, this organisation was left untouched, as were other violent Loyalist satellite organisations such as [[Tara (Northern Ireland)|Tara]], the [[Shankill Defence Association]] and the [[Ulster Protestant Volunteers]]. Faulkner was urged by the British to include a few Protestants in the trawl but, apart from two republicans, he refused.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Tim Pat. ''The Troubles: Ireland's ordeal 1966–1996 and the search for peace''. London: Hutchinson. p. 126 [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/intern/sum.htm Internment – Summary of Main Events]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a subsequent case brought to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] by the [[Irish government]] against the government of the United Kingdom, it was conceded that ''Operation Demetrius'' was planned and implemented from the highest levels of the British government and that specially trained personnel were sent to Northern Ireland to familiarize the local forces in what became known as the '[[five techniques]]', methods of interrogation described by opponents as "a euphemism for torture".&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Tom. ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'': [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/torture/justify/3.html "Is torture ever justified?"]. [[PBS]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
The internments were initially carried out under Regulations 11 and 12 of 1956 and Regulation 10 of 1957 (the Special Powers Regulations), made under the authority of the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]]. The [[Detention of Terrorists (Northern Ireland) Order 1972|Detention of Terrorists Order]] of 7 November 1972, made under the authority of the [[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972|Temporary Provisions Act]], was used after direct rule was instituted.

Internees arrested without trial pursuant to Operation Demetrius could not complain to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] about breaches of Article 5 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) because on 27 June 1957, the UK lodged a notice with the [[Council of Europe]] declaring that there was a "public emergency within the meaning of Article 15(1) of the Convention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Detention of Suspected Terrorists in Northern Ireland and Great Britain|first=Brice|last=Dickson|journal=[[University of Richmond Law Review]]|volume=43|issue=3|date=March 2009|url=http://lawreview.richmond.edu/the-detention-of-suspected-terrorists-in-northern-ireland-and-great-britain/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515110821/http://lawreview.richmond.edu/the-detention-of-suspected-terrorists-in-northern-ireland-and-great-britain/|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation and immediate aftermath==
[[File:HMS Maidstone.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Maidstone (1937)|HMS ''Maidstone'']] (pictured here in Algiers in the Second World War), a prison ship which docked at [[Belfast]] and where many internees were sent]]

Operation Demetrius began on Monday 9 August at about 4 am and progressed in two parts:
*(1) Arrest and movement of the detainees to one of three regional holding centers: Girdwood in [[Belfast]], [[Abercorn Barracks|Ballykinler]] in [[County Down]], or [[Magilligan (HM Prison)|Magilligan]] in [[County Londonderry]];
*(2) The process of identification and questioning, leading either to release of the detainee or movement into detention at [[Crumlin Road (HM Prison)|Crumlin Road prison]] or aboard [[HMS Maidstone (1937)|HMS ''Maidstone'']], a [[prison ship]] in Belfast Harbour.&lt;ref name=compton&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/compton.htm The Compton Report, November 1971]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first wave of raids across Northern Ireland, 342 people were arrested.&lt;ref name=cainchron&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/intern/chron.htm Internment: A chronology of the main events]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those arrested reported that they and their families were assaulted, verbally abused and threatened by the soldiers. There were claims of soldiers smashing their way into houses without warning and firing [[rubber bullet|baton round]]s through doors and windows. Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to [[gauntlet (punishment)|run a gauntlet]] of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having the barrel of a gun pressed against their heads, being dragged by the hair, being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a [[human shield]].&lt;ref name=kennally1&gt;Danny Kennally and Eric Preston.

[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).&lt;/ref&gt; Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter. They were told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but were actually only a few feet from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-25137411 "Former internees claim 'new evidence' of Army torture"]. BBC News. 28 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation sparked an immediate upsurge of violence, the worst since the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|August 1969 riots]].&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; The British Army came under sustained attack from Irish nationalist rioters and gunmen, especially in Belfast. According to journalist [[Kevin Myers]]: "Insanity seized the city. Hundreds of vehicles were hijacked and factories were burnt. Loyalist and IRA gunmen were everywhere".&lt;ref name=lostlives80&gt;McKittrick, David. ''Lost Lives: The stories of the men, women and children who died through the Northern Ireland Troubles''. Mainstream, 1999. p.80&lt;/ref&gt; People blocked roads and streets with burning barricades to stop the British Army entering their neighbourhoods.  In [[Derry]], barricades were again erected around [[Free Derry]] and "for the next 11 months these areas effectively seceded from British control".&lt;ref name=anphoblacht36th&gt;[http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/20188 "Blunt weapon of internment fails to crush nationalist resistance"]. ''[[An Phoblacht]]''. 9 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 9 and 11 August, 24 people were killed or fatally wounded: 20 civilians (14 Catholics, 6 Protestants), two members of the Provisional IRA (shot dead by the British Army), and two members of the British Army (shot dead by the Provisional IRA).&lt;ref name=Sutton&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1971.html Malcolm Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland: 1971].

[[File:BallymurphyMassacre.jpg|thumb|A [[Murals in Northern Ireland|mural]] commemorating those killed in the [[Ballymurphy Massacre]] during Operation Demetrius]]

Of the civilians killed, 17 were killed by the British Army and the other three were killed by unknown attackers.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; In West Belfast's Ballymurphy housing estate, 11 Catholic civilians were killed by [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] between 9 and 11 August in an episode that has become known as the [[Ballymurphy Massacre]]. Another flashpoint was [[Ardoyne]] in North Belfast, where soldiers shot dead three people on 9 August.&lt;ref name=Sutton/&gt; Many Protestant families fled Ardoyne and about 200 burnt their homes as they left, lest they "fall into Catholic hands".&lt;ref name=coogan&gt;Coogan, Tim Pat. ''The Troubles: Ireland's ordeal 1966–1996 and the search for peace''. Palgrave, 2002. p.152&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant and Catholic families fled "to either side of a dividing line, which would provide the foundation for the permanent [[peace lines|peaceline]] later built in the area".&lt;ref name=lostlives80/&gt; Catholic homes were burnt in Ardoyne and elsewhere too.&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt; About 7,000 people, most of them Catholics, were left homeless.&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt; About 2,500 Catholic refugees fled south of the border, where new [[refugee camp]]s were set up.&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt;

By 13 August, media reports indicated that the violence had begun to wane, seemingly due to exhaustion on the part of the IRA and security forces.&lt;ref&gt;"Violence ebbing in Northern Ireland". ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'', 13 August 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August, the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) announced that it was starting a campaign of [[civil disobedience]] in response to the introduction of internment. By 17 October, it was estimated that about 16,000 households were withholding rent and rates for council houses as part of the campaign of civil disobedience.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

On 16 August, over 8,000 workers went on strike in Derry in protest at internment. [[Joe Cahill]], then [[List of Irish Republican Army chiefs of staff|Chief of Staff]] of the Provisional IRA, held a press conference during which he claimed that only 30 Provisional IRA members had been interned.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt;

On 22 August, in protest against internment, about 130 non-[[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[councillor]]s announced that they would no longer sit on [[Local government in Northern Ireland|district councils]]. The SDLP also withdrew its representatives from a number of public bodies.&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; On 19 October, five Northern Ireland Members of [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Parliament]] (MPs) began a 48-hour [[hunger strike]] against internment. The protest took place near [[10 Downing Street]] in London. Among those taking part were [[John Hume]], [[Austin Currie]], and [[Bernadette Devlin]].&lt;ref name=cainchron/&gt; Protests would continue until internment was ended in December 1975.

==Long-term effects==
[[File:Bogside (12), August 2009.JPG|thumb|right| Modern anti-internment graffiti on Derry's Walls seen from the [[Bogside]] area of Derry]]
The backlash against internment contributed to the decision of the British Government under Prime Minister Edward Heath to suspend the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland Government]] and replace it with [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] from [[Her Majesty's Government|Westminster]], under the authority of a British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]]. This took place in 1972.

Following the suspension of the Northern Ireland Government and [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], internment was continued by the direct rule administration until 5 December 1975. During this time a total of 1,981 people were interned: 1,874 were from an Irish nationalist background, while 107 were from a unionist background.&lt;ref name=cainsum/&gt;

Historians generally view the period of internment as inflaming sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland, while failing in its goal of arresting key members of the IRA. Many of the people arrested had no links whatsoever with the IRA, but their names appeared on the list of those to be arrested through bungling and incompetence. The list's lack of reliability and the arrests that followed, complemented by reports of internees being abused far in excess of the usual state violence,&lt;ref name="theirishstory.com"/&gt; led to more nationalists identifying with the IRA and losing hope in non-violent methods. After Operation Demetrius, recruits came forward in huge numbers to join the Provisional and Official wings of the IRA.&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt; Internment also led to a sharp increase in violence. In the eight months before the operation, there were 34 conflict-related deaths in Northern Ireland. In the four months following it, 140 were killed.&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt; A serving officer of the British [[Royal Marines]] declared:&lt;blockquote&gt;It (internment) has, in fact, increased terrorist activity, perhaps boosted IRA recruitment, polarised further the Catholic and Protestant communities and reduced the ranks of the much needed Catholic moderates.&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, D. ''Pig in the Middle: The Army in Northern Ireland''. London, Methuen, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In terms of loss of life, 1972 was the most violent year of the Troubles. The fatal march on [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] (30 January 1972) in [[Derry]], when 14 unarmed civil rights protesters were shot dead by British paratroopers, was an anti-internment march.

==Interrogation of internees==
All of those arrested were interrogated by the British Army and RUC. However, twelve internees were then chosen for further "deep interrogation", using [[sensory deprivation]]. This took place at a secret interrogation centre, which was later revealed to be [[Shackleton Barracks]], outside [[Ballykelly, County Londonderry|Ballykelly]]. In October, a further two internees were chosen for deep interrogation. These fourteen became known as "[[The Hooded Men 1971|the Hooded Men]]", or "the Guineapigs". 

After undergoing the same treatment as the other internees, the men were [[hooding|hooded]], handcuffed and flown to the base by helicopter. On the way, soldiers severely beat them and threatened to throw them from the helicopter. When they arrived they were stripped naked, photographed, and examined by a doctor.&lt;ref name=mcguffin4&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea4.htm Chapter 4: The Experiment].&lt;/ref&gt;

For seven days, when not being interrogated, they were kept hooded and handcuffed in a cold cell and subjected to a continuous loud hissing noise. Here they were forced to stand in a [[stress position]] for many hours and were repeatedly beaten on all parts of their body. They were deprived of sleep, food and drink. Some of them also reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls, being shot at with blank rounds, and being threatened with injections. The result was severe physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness.&lt;ref name=mcguffin4/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcguffin6&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea6.htm Chapter 6: Replay].&lt;/ref&gt;

The interrogation methods used on the men became known as the '[[five techniques]]'. Training and advice regarding the five techniques came from senior intelligence officials in the British government. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) defined the five techniques as follows:
{{quotation|
*(a) wall-standing: forcing the detainees to remain for periods of some hours in a "stress position", described by those who underwent it as being "spreadeagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above the head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers";
*(b) hooding: putting a black or navy coloured bag over the detainees' heads and, at least initially, keeping it there all the time except during interrogation;
*(c) subjection to noise: pending their interrogations, holding the detainees in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise;
*(d) deprivation of sleep: pending their interrogations, depriving the detainees of sleep;
*(e) deprivation of food and drink: subjecting the detainees to a reduced diet during their stay at the centre and pending interrogations.}}

The fourteen Hooded Men were the only internees subjected to the full five techniques. However, over the following months, some internees were subjected to at least one of the five techniques, as well as other interrogation methods. These allegedly included [[waterboarding]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/6862034/Prisoners-in-Northern-Ireland-subjected-to-waterboarding-by-British-army-officers.html "Prisoners in Northern Ireland 'subjected to waterboarding by British army officers'"]. ''The Telegraph''. 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric shock#Torture|electric shocks]], burning with matches and candles, forcing internees to stand over hot electric fires while beating them, beating and squeezing of the genitals, inserting objects into the anus, injections, [[Foot whipping|whipping the soles of the feet]], and psychological abuse such as [[Russian roulette]].&lt;ref name=mcguffin9&gt;[http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guineapigs.htm ''The Guineapigs''] by John McGuffin (1974, 1981). [http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/guineapigs/guinea9.htm Chapter 9: Down on the Killing Floor].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parker Report===
When the interrogation techniques used on the internees became known to the public, there was outrage at the British government, especially from [[Irish nationalist]]s. In answer to the anger from the public and Members of Parliament, on 16 November 1971, the British government commissioned a committee of inquiry chaired by [[Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington|Lord Parker]] (the [[Lord Chief Justice of England]]) to look into the legal and moral aspects of the 'five techniques'.

The "Parker Report"&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/parker.htm The Parker Report, March 1972]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt; was published on 2 March 1972 and found the five techniques to be illegal under domestic law:
{{quotation|10. Domestic Law ...(c) We have received both written and oral representations from many legal bodies and individual lawyers from both England and Northern Ireland. There has been no dissent from the view that the procedures are illegal alike by the law of England and the law of Northern Ireland. ... (d) This being so, no Army Directive and no Minister could lawfully or validly have authorized the use of the procedures. Only Parliament can alter the law. The procedures were and are illegal.}}

On the same day (2 March 1972), United Kingdom Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] stated in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]: 
{{quotation|[The] Government, having reviewed the whole matter with great care and with reference to any future operations, have decided that the techniques ... will not be used in future as an aid to interrogation... The statement that I have made covers all future circumstances.&lt;ref name="Ireland.v. UK"&gt;[http://www.menneskeret.dk/menneskeretieuropa/konventionen/baggrund/domme/ref00000091/ Ireland v. the United Kingdom] Paragraph 101 and 135&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
As foreshadowed in the Prime Minister's statement, directives expressly forbidding the use of the techniques, whether alone or together, were then issued to the security forces by the government.&lt;ref name="Ireland.v. UK"/&gt; While these are still legally in force and the use of such methods by UK security forces is not officially condoned by the government, the five techniques were still being used by the British Army in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035029/Baha-Mousa-inquiry-Army-condemned-gratuitous-violence.html|title=Deplorable, shocking, shameful: Fox's verdict on troops who beat Iraqi as he vows to end 'conspiracy of silence'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Commission of Human Rights===
The Irish Government, on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five techniques, took a case to the [[European Commission on Human Rights]] (''Ireland v. United Kingdom'', 1976 Y.B. Eur. Conv. on Hum. Rts. 512, 748, 788–94 (Eur. Comm’n of Hum. Rts.)). The Commission stated that it
{{quotation|...unanimously considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture, on the grounds that (1) the intensity of the stress caused by techniques creating sensory deprivation "directly affects the personality physically and mentally"; and (2) "the systematic application of the techniques for the purpose of inducing a person to give information shows a clear resemblance to those methods of systematic torture which have been known over the ages...a modern system of torture falling into the same category as those systems applied in previous times as a means of obtaining information and confessions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070629145037/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/prohibits_torture.htm Security Detainees/Enemy Combatants: U.S. Law Prohibits Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment] Footnote 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weissbrodt, David. ''[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc Materials on torture and other ill-treatment: 3. European Court of Human Rights]'' (doc) [http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:u7wX9dL11d4J:www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;lr=lang_en html]: Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1976 Y.B. Eur. Conv. on Hum. Rts. 512, 748, 788–94 (Eur. Comm’n of Hum. Rts.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===European Court of Human Rights===
The Commissions findings were appealed. In 1978, in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) trial ''Ireland v. the United Kingdom'' (Case No. 5310/71),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html|title=IRELAND v. THE UNITED KINGDOM – 5310/71 (1978) ECHR 1 (18 January 1978)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled:
{{quotation|167. ... Although the five techniques, as applied in combination, undoubtedly amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment, although their object was the extraction of confessions, the naming of others and/or information and although they were used systematically, they did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture as so understood. ...''
168. The Court concludes that recourse to the five techniques amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, which practice was in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 3 - prohibition of torture|Article 3 (art. 3)]].}}

On 8 February 1977, in proceedings before the ECHR, and in line with the findings of the Parker Report and UK Government policy, the Attorney-General of the United Kingdom stated:
{{quotation|The Government of the United Kingdom have considered the question of the use of the 'five techniques' with very great care and with particular regard to Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention. They now give this unqualified undertaking, that the 'five techniques' will not in any circumstances be reintroduced as an aid to interrogation.}}

===Later developments===
In 2013, declassified documents revealed the existence of the interrogation centre at Ballykelly. It had not been mentioned in any of the inquiries. Human rights group the [[Pat Finucane Centre]] accused the British Government of deliberately hiding it from the inquiries and the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-23586361 "Secret Ballykelly interrogation centre unveiled"]. BBC News. 6 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, an [[RTÉ]] documentary entitled ''The Torture Files'' uncovered a letter from the UK Home Secretary [[Merlyn Rees]] in 1977 to the then British Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]]. It confirmed that a policy of 'torture' had in fact been authorized by the British Government's ministers—specifically the Secretary for Defence [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Peter Carrington]]—in 1971, contrary to the knowledge of the Irish government or the ECHR. The letter states: "It is my view (confirmed by [[Brian Faulkner]] before his death) that the decision to use methods of torture in Northern Ireland in 1971/72 was taken by ministers – in particular Lord Carrington, then secretary of state for defence".&lt;ref name=ministers-sanctioned/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27714715 'British government authorised use of torture methods in NI in early 1970s'] (5 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2014 revelations, the President of [[Sinn Féin]], [[Gerry Adams]], called on the Irish government to bring the case back to the ECHR because the British government, he said, "lied to the European Court of Human Rights both on the severity of the methods used on the men, their long term physical and psychological consequences, on where these interrogations took place and who gave the political authority and clearance for it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/adams-calls-on-government-to-reopen-hooded-men-case-1.1821738 Adams calls on Government to reopen ‘Hooded Men’ case] (5 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2014, the Irish government announced that, having reviewed the new evidence and following requests from the survivors, it had decided to officially ask the ECHR to revise its 1978 judgement.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"/&gt;

'''Operation Entebbe''', or '''Operation Thunderbolt''', was a successful [[counter-terrorist]] [[hostage]]-rescue mission carried out by [[Sayeret Matkal|commandos]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) at [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]] in [[Uganda]] on 4 July 1976.&lt;ref name="Hostages freed as israelis raid uganda airport"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/04/archives/hostages-freed-as-israelis-raid-uganda-airport-commandos-in-3.html|title=Hostages Freed as Israelis Raid Uganda Airport; Commandos in 3 Planes Rescue 105-Casualties Unknown Israelis Raid Uganda Airport And Free Hijackers' Hostages|last=Smith|first=Terence |work=The New York Times|accessdate=4 July 2009 | date=4 July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week earlier, on 27 June, an [[Air France]] plane with 248 passengers had been [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by two members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations]] (PFLP-EO) under orders of [[Wadie Haddad]] (who had earlier broken away from the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]] of [[George Habash]]),&lt;ref name="Hartuv"/&gt; and two members of the German [[Revolutionary Cells (RZ)|Revolutionary Cells]].

The IDF acted on information provided by the Israeli intelligence agency [[Mossad]]. The hijackers threatened to kill the hostages if their prisoner release demands were not met. This threat led to the planning of the rescue operation.&lt;ref name="Mossad took photos"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3269662,00.html|title=Mossad took photos, Entebbe Operation was on its way.|year=2006|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|accessdate=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans included preparation for armed resistance from Ugandan troops.&lt;ref name="Back to Entebbe"&gt;{{cite news |date=29 June 2006 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Back-to-Entebbe |title=Back to Entebbe|last=Feldinger|first=Lauren Gelfond |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation took place at night. Israeli transport planes carried 100 commandos over {{convert|4000|km|mi}} to Uganda for the rescue operation. The operation, which took a week of planning, lasted 90 minutes. Of the 106 remaining hostages, 102 were rescued and three were killed.

=== Hostage situation at Entebbe airport ===
At Entebbe, the four hijackers were joined by at least four others, supported by the forces of Uganda's President, [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_2786000/2786967.stm |title=1976: Israelis rescue Entebbe hostages |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 December 2012 |archivedate=27 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DE7fZYVd?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_2786000/2786967.stm |deadurl=no |date=4 July 1976 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hijackers transferred the passengers to the transit hall of the disused former airport terminal where they kept them under guard for the following days. Amin came to visit the hostages almost on a daily basis, updating them on developments and promising to use his efforts to have them freed through negotiations.&lt;ref name="Rosenkovitch"/&gt;

On 28 June, a PFLP-EO hijacker issued a declaration and formulated their demands: In addition to a ransom of $5 million USD for the release of the airplane, they demanded the release of 53 Palestinian and Pro-Palestinian militants, 40 of whom were prisoners in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunstan|first1=Simon|title=Entebbe: The Most Daring Raid of Israel's Special Forces|date=2011|publisher=Rosen|location=New York|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They threatened that if these demands were not met, they would begin to kill hostages on 1 July 1976.&lt;ref name="Detailed Story"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19760713&amp;id=7-QhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OGcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3641,5254231|title=Detailed Story Of Dramatic Israeli Raid|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=13 July 1976|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Separation of the hostages into two groups ===
On 29 June, after Ugandan soldiers had opened an entrance to a room next to the crowded waiting hall by destroying a separating wall, the hijackers separated the Israelis (including those holding dual citizenship) from the other hostages{{#tag:ref|Claims by various authors that the separation was made between Jews and non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1976 Operation Entebbe|url=http://www.idfblog.com/about-the-idf/history-of-the-idf/1976-operation-entebbe/|website=IDF blog|publisher=Israeli Defense Forces|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are in conflict with eyewitness accounts&lt;ref name="Freed Hostages Tell Their Story"&gt;{{cite news |title=Freed Hostages Tell Their Story|url=http://www.jta.org/1976/07/02/archive/freed-hostages-tell-their-story|accessdate=23 September 2014|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=2 July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ofer1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moufflet&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moufflet|first1=Claude|title=Otages à Kampala|date=1976|publisher=Presses de la Cité|page=82|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Epstein"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jerozolimski|first1=Ana|title=Ada Lazarovitz (46), que hace 30 años fuera una de las rehenes en el avión de Air France secuestrado por terroristas en Entebbe, recuerda su liberación.|url=http://letras-uruguay.espaciolatino.com/jerozolimski/ada_lazarovitz_46.htm|website=Espacio Latino|publisher=Semanario Hebreo|accessdate=23 September 2014|language=Spanish|date=13 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later they were expressly disclaimed by several former hostages as a "myth" or a manipulation by "sensation-hungry journalists and film-makers."&lt;ref name="Hartuv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenkovitch"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldberg/&gt; |group="nb"|name="SeparationNote"}} and told them to move to the adjoining room.&lt;ref name="Ofer1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yehuda Ofer|title=Operation Thunder: The Entebbe Raid.

=== Release of most non-Israeli hostages ===
On 30 June, the hijackers released 48 hostages. The released were picked from among the non-Israeli group – mainly elderly and sick passengers and mothers with children. Forty-seven of them were flown to Paris, and one passenger was treated in hospital for a day. On 1 July, after the Israeli government had conveyed its agreement to negotiations, the hostage-takers extended their deadline to noon on 4 July and released another group of 100 non-Israeli captives who again were flown to Paris a few hours later. Among the 106 hostages staying behind with their captors at Entebbe airport were the 12 members of the Air France crew who refused to leave,&lt;ref&gt;David Kaplan, "[https://www.jpost.com/Features/A-historic-hostage-taking-revisited A Historic Hostage-Taking Revisited]," ''The Jerusalem Post'', 3 August 2006, Retrieved 4 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; about ten young French passengers, and the Israeli group of some 84 people.&lt;ref name=MHS /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hostages freed as israelis raid uganda airport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Entebbe's unsung hero." /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Entebbe Rescue Mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/entebbe.html|title=The Entebbe Rescue Mission|work=Israel Defense Forces|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational planning==
In the week before the raid, Israel tried using political avenues to obtain the release of the hostages. Many sources indicate that the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] was prepared to release Palestinian prisoners if a military solution seemed unlikely to succeed. A retired IDF officer, Baruch "Burka" Bar-Lev, had known Idi Amin for many years and was considered to have a strong personal relationship with him. At the request of the cabinet, he spoke with Amin on the phone many times, trying to gain the release of the hostages, without success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914380,00.html "Vindication for the Israelis"]. ''Time''. 26 July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914382,00.html "War of Words over a Tense Border"]. ''Time''. 26 July 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli government also approached the United States government to deliver a message to Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]], asking him to request that Amin release the hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS%5Ckissinger%5C0000C08F.pdf |title=Conversation between Henry Kissinger and Israeli Ambassador Simch Dinitz, 30 June 1976 |format=PDF |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and defence minister [[Shimon Peres]] spent one week disagreeing on whether to give in to the hijackers' demands (Rabin's position) or not, to prevent more terrorism (Peres' position).&lt;ref name="Telegraph_David"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/11701064/Israels-raid-on-Entebbe-was-almost-a-disaster.html|title=Israel's raid on Entebbe was almost a disaster|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=[[Saul David]]|date=27 June 2015|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1 July deadline,&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, Paul. [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/30/archives/rescuing-the-entebbe-hostages.html "Rescuing the Entebbe Hostages"]. ''The New York Times''. Friday, 30 July 1976. (The Weekend, p. 51).&lt;/ref&gt; the Israeli cabinet offered to negotiate with the hijackers to extend the deadline to 4 July. Amin also asked them to extend the deadline until that date. This meant he could take a diplomatic trip to [[Port Louis]], Mauritius, to officially hand over chairmanship of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] to [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipkin-Shakhak, Tali.

Historama. 16 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This extension of the hostage deadline proved crucial to providing Israeli forces enough time to get to Entebbe.&lt;ref name="General Dan Shomron" /&gt;

On 3 July, at 18:30, the Israeli cabinet approved a rescue mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/04/archives/hostages-freed-as-israelis-raid-uganda-airport-commandos-in-3.html|title=Hostages Freed as Israelis Raid Uganda Airport |last=Terence|first=Smith | work=The New York Times | date=4 July 1976 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented by [[Aluf|Major General]] [[Yekutiel Adam|Yekutiel "Kuti" Adam]] and [[Dan Shomron|Brig.

===Attempts at a diplomatic solution===
As the crisis unfolded, attempts were made to negotiate the release of the hostages. According to declassified diplomatic documents, the Egyptian government under Sadat tried to negotiate with both the PLO and the Ugandan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=172177&amp;dt=2082&amp;dl=1345 |title=Herman Eilts (US Ambassador to Egypt) to Secretary of State, 6 July 1976 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=181803&amp;dt=2082&amp;dl=1345 |title=Herman Eilts (US Ambassador to Egypt) to Secretary of State, 9 July 1976 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; PLO chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] sent his political aide [[Hani al-Hassan]] to Uganda as a special envoy to negotiate with the hostage takers and with Amin.&lt;ref name="Hartuv"/&gt; However, the PFLP-EO hijackers refused to see him.&lt;ref name=NouvelObs&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chabalier|first1=Hervé|title=Israël: le prix d'un exploit |newspaper=Le Nouvel Observateur |date=12 July 1976 |page=25 |url=http://referentiel.nouvelobs.com/archives_pdf/OBS0609_19760712/OBS0609_19760712_025.pdf |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raid preparation===
When Israeli authorities failed to negotiate a political solution, they decided that their only option was an attack to rescue the hostages. Lt. Col. [[Joshua Shani]], lead pilot of the operation, later said that the Israelis had initially conceived of a rescue plan that involved dropping naval commandos into [[Lake Victoria]]. The commandos would have ridden rubber boats to the airport located on the edge of the lake. They planned to kill the hijackers and after freeing the hostages, they would ask Amin for passage home. The Israelis abandoned this plan because they lacked the necessary time and also because they had received word that Lake Victoria was inhabited by the [[Nile crocodile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Israel Defense Forces: A People's Army |last=Williams |first=Louis |year=2000 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9780595143535 |page=131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSsxPDuQy8YC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22rubber+boats%22+Entebbe+%22Lake+Victoria%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BdA0hBNs_o&amp;sig=JkbU0-_FMzHrQ-p5IVXLN_mmrb0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vl3cUNLvCcTC2QWaloCQBg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rubber%20boats%22%20Entebbe%20%22Lake%20Victoria%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnon Biran]], the mission's intelligence officer, later stated that the proper layout of the airport was unknown, also the exact location of the hostages and whether the building had been prepared with explosives.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_David" /&gt;

====Aircraft refuelling====
While planning the raid, the Israeli forces had to plan how to refuel the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft they intended to use while en route to Entebbe. The Israelis lacked the logistical capacity to [[Aerial refueling|aerially refuel]] four to six aircraft so far from Israeli airspace. While several [[East Africa]]n nations, including the logistically preferred choice Kenya, were sympathetic, none wished to incur the wrath of Amin or the Palestinians by allowing the Israelis to land their aircraft within their borders.

The raid could not proceed without assistance from at least one East African government. The Jewish owner of the Block hotels chain in Kenya, along with other members of the Jewish and Israeli community in [[Nairobi]], may have used their political and economic influence to help persuade Kenya's President [[Jomo Kenyatta]] to help Israel. The Israeli government secured permission from Kenya for the IDF task force to cross Kenyan airspace and refuel at what is today [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Entebbe: The Most Daring Raid of Israel's Special Forces |last=Dunstan |first=Simon |year=2011 |publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=9781448818686 |page=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrL9bHLpOq4C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Entebbe+%22Jomo+Kenyatta+airport%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VGrcUNlRxbvZBfvMgdAI&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Entebbe%20%22Jomo%20Kenyatta%20airport%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenyan [[Ministry of Agriculture (Kenya)|Minister of Agriculture]] [[Bruce Mackenzie (British intelligence operative)|Bruce MacKenzie]] persuaded Kenyan President Kenyatta to permit Mossad to collect intelligence prior to the operation, and to allow the [[Israeli Air Force]] access to the Nairobi airport.&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Melman |first=Yossi |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Analysis-Israel-and-Kenya-blood-ties-326880 |title=A history of cooperation between Israel and Kenya |work=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, Ugandan President Idi Amin ordered Ugandan agents to assassinate MacKenzie. He was killed on 24 May 1978 when a bomb attached to his aircraft exploded.&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAar3TpYOt4C&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=israel+kenya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G45DUoO4FJPa4AO9noGgDg&amp;ved=0CHkQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=israel%20kenya&amp;f=false |author=Ephraim Kahana |title=Historical Dictionary of Israeli Intelligence |publisher= |year=2006 |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="standardmedia1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000042641&amp;pageNo=1 |title=Ugandan agents killed former Cabinet minister, says dossier |publisher=Standard Digital News |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrL9bHLpOq4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=bruce+mackenzie+May+24,+1978&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gay4o2OJzA&amp;sig=3xduzFuGBsBYYAHlklRMQgeZWNY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pZRDUo6HCu7G4AObxYDQAg&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bruce%20mackenzie%20May%2024%2C%201978&amp;f=false |title=Entebbe: The Most Daring Raid of Israel's Special Forces – Simon Dunstan |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Mossad Chief Director [[Meir Amit]] had a forest planted in Israel in MacKenzie's name.&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt;

====Hostage intelligence====
The Mossad built an accurate picture of the whereabouts of the hostages, the number of hijackers, and the involvement of Ugandan troops from the released hostages in Paris.&lt;ref name="TimeMagazine"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914272,00.html|title=The Rescue: 'We Do the Impossible' |date=12 July 1976|work=Time|accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Israeli firms were involved in building projects in Africa during the 1960s and 1970s and while preparing the raid the Israeli army consulted with [[Solel Boneh]], a large Israeli construction company that had built the terminal where the hostages were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wars and Operations: Operation Thunderball ("Entebbe")|url=http://www.iaf.org.il/4694-33040-he/IAF.aspx|publisher=[[Israel Air Force]](official website)|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; While planning the military operation the IDF erected a partial replica of the airport terminal with the assistance of civilians who had helped build the original.

[[Muki Betser]] said in a later interview that Mossad operatives extensively interviewed the hostages who had been released. He said that a French-Jewish passenger who had a military background and "a phenomenal memory" provided detailed information about the number of weapons carried by the hostage-takers.&lt;ref name="betzer"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-04-palestinian-pressure_x.htm "Israel marks 30th anniversary of Entebbe"]. Associated Press in ''USA Today''. 5 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After Betzer collected intelligence and planned for several days, four Israeli Air Force C-130 Hercules transport aircraft secretly flew to Entebbe Airport at midnight without being detected by Entebbe air traffic control.

===Task force===
The Israeli ground task force numbered approximately 100 personnel, and comprised the following:&lt;ref name="ediary" /&gt;
; The ground command and control element
:This small group comprised the operation and overall ground commander, [[Dan Shomron|Brigadier General Dan Shomron]], the air force representative Col. Ami Ayalon and the communications and support personnel.
; The assault element
:A 29-man assault unit led by Lt. Col. [[Yonatan Netanyahu]] – this force was composed entirely of commandos from [[Sayeret Matkal]], and was given the primary task of assaulting the old terminal and rescuing the hostages. Major Betser led one of the element's assault teams, and took command after Lt. Col. Netanyahu was killed.
; The securing element
:# The [[Paratroopers Brigade|Paratroopers]] force led by [[Matan Vilnai|Col. Matan Vilnai]] – tasked with securing the civilian airport field, clearing and securing the runways, and protection and fuelling of the Israeli aircraft in Entebbe.
:# The [[Golani Brigade|Golani]] force led by [[Uri Sagi|Col. Uri Sagi]] – tasked with securing the C-130 Hercules aircraft for the hostages' evacuation, getting it as close as possible to the terminal and boarding the hostages; also with acting as general reserves.
:# The [[Sayeret Matkal]] force led by [[Shaul Mofaz|Major Shaul Mofaz]] – tasked with clearing the military airstrip, and destroying the squadron of [[MiG]] fighter jets on the ground, to prevent any possible interceptions by the [[Uganda People's Defence Force|Ugandan Air Force]]; also with holding off hostile [[ground forces]] from the city of Entebbe.

==Raid==
[[File:Entebbe Aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of the city of [[Entebbe]] and the [[Entebbe International Airport]] at sunset]]

===Attack route===
Taking off from [[Sharm el-Sheikh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/entebbi_eng.htm|title=Operation Entebbe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the task force flew along the international flight path over the [[Red Sea]], mostly flying at a height of no more than 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) to avoid radar detection by Egyptian, Sudanese, and Saudi Arabian forces. Near the south outlet of the Red Sea the C-130s turned south and passed south of [[Djibouti]]. From there, they went to a point northeast of Nairobi, Kenya, likely across Somalia and the [[Ogaden]] area of Ethiopia. They turned west, passing through the [[East African Rift|African Rift Valley]] and over Lake Victoria.&lt;ref name="Ninety Minutes at Entebbe"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stevenson|first=William|title=Ninety Minutes at Entebbe|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|year=1976|page=100|isbn=0-553-10482-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[Boeing 707]] jets followed the cargo planes. The first Boeing contained medical facilities and landed at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya. The commander of the operation, General Yekutiel Adam, was on board the second Boeing, which circled over Entebbe Airport during the raid.&lt;ref name="ediary" /&gt;

The Israeli forces landed at Entebbe on 3 July at 23:00 [[Israel Standard Time|IST]], with their [[cargo bay]] doors already open.

===Hostage rescue===

The Israelis left their vehicles and ran towards the terminal. The hostages were in the main hall of the airport building, directly adjacent to the runway. Entering the terminal, the commandos shouted through a megaphone, "Stay down! Stay down! We are Israeli soldiers," in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and English. Jean-Jacques Maimoni, a 19-year-old French immigrant to Israel, stood up and was killed when Israeli company commander Muki Betzer and another soldier mistook him for a hijacker and fired at him.&lt;ref name="Entebbe's unsung hero." /&gt; Another hostage, Pasco Cohen, 52, was also fatally wounded by gunfire from the commandos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalemdiaries.com/article/6 |title=Remembering Entebbe |publisher=Jerusalem Diaries |date=3 July 2001 |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a third hostage, 56-year-old Ida Borochovitch, a Russian Jew who had [[Aliyah|emigrated to Israel]], was killed by a hijacker in the crossfire.&lt;ref name="Bacos, 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berg|first1=Raffi|title=Entebbe pilot Michel Bacos 'saw hostage murdered'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36584346|accessdate=3 July 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to hostage Ilan Hartuv, Wilfried Böse was the only hijacker who, after the operation began, entered the hall housing the hostages. At first he pointed his [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] rifle at hostages, but "immediately came to his senses" and ordered them to find shelter in the restroom, before being killed by the commandos. According to Hartuv, Böse fired only at Israeli soldiers and not at hostages.&lt;ref name="Hartuv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/setting-the-record-straight-entebbe-was-not-auschwitz-1.372131 |title=Setting the record straight: Entebbe was not Auschwitz |author=Yossi Melman |date=8 July 2011 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=27 December 2012 |archivedate=27 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DE5G4iCG?url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/setting-the-record-straight-entebbe-was-not-auschwitz-1.372131 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western nations spoke in support of the raid. West Germany called the raid "an act of self-defence". Switzerland and France praised the operation. Representatives of the United Kingdom and United States offered significant praise, calling the Entebbe raid "an impossible operation".

==Commemorations==
In August 2012, Uganda and Israel commemorated the raid at a sombre ceremony at the base of a tower at the Old Entebbe Airport, where Yonatan Netanyahu was killed.

The flags of Uganda and Israel waved side by side, demonstrating the two countries' strong bilateral relations, next to a plaque bearing a history of the raid. The ceremony was attended by Ugandan State Minister for Animal Industry [[Bright Rwamirama]] and the deputy [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel]] [[Daniel Ayalon]], who laid wreaths at the site.&lt;ref name="Uganda Israel 2012"/&gt; Forty years to the day after the rescue operation, Israeli Prime-Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and brother of the slain Israeli Sayeret Matkal commando, Yoni Netanyahu, visited Entebbe with an Israeli delegation, and laid the groundwork for further Israeli–sub-Saharan African bilateral relations.

A '''Peace Pole''' is a monument that displays the message "May Peace Prevail on Earth” in the language of the country where it has been placed, and usually 3 to 13 additional translations. The message often is referred to as a peace prayer, but sometimes it is not in order to avoid peace poles from being regarded as religious objects that violate zoning restrictions. A Quaker group in New York City ran into that problem year after year and never got permission to plant a '''peace pole''' in a park. At least one site refers to the phrase only as a Peace Message in order for there to be a reference to point to in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace Poles made by an Artist|url=http://www.peace-pole.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Peace Poles was first thought up by Masahisa Goi in 1955 in Japan. The Peace Pole Project today is promoted by [[The World Peace Prayer Society]] as well as other groups and individuals. The first Peace Poles outside Japan were constructed in 1983.&lt;ref name="worldpeace history"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldpeace.org/about_history.html|title=The World Peace Prayer Society|last=|first=|date=|website=www.worldpeace.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more than 200,000 have been placed around the world in close to 200 countries.&lt;ref name="worldpeace history" /&gt;

Peace Poles are made of many materials; most are made of wood, while others are made of limestone, copper, plastic or stainless steel. The text might be painted, carved, etched, welded, pasted, or riveted on, or it might simply be a plastic plaque attached with screws. In other cases, it is the careful work of an artist or sculptor.

Peace Poles have been placed in such notable locations as the [[North Magnetic Pole]], the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]], the site of the [[Egyptian Pyramids]] in [[Giza]], and the [[Aiki Shrine]] in [[Iwama, Ibaraki|Iwama]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aikidohawaii.org/peaceprayer.html Aikido Hawaii]&lt;/ref&gt; Peace Poles are commonly installed at high-profile public gathering places, such as community parks or near the entrances of churches or schools. In one case, a garden, created for a wedding, was designed around the Peace Pole that was its centerpiece. The [[Republic of Molossia]], a [[micronation]], has a Peace Pole in eight languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molossia.org/peacepole molossia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The University of California, Los Angeles has a limestone peace pole with 14 languages directly in front of Kerckhoff Hall.

The initial inspiration for planting a Peace Pole often is as a response to a local historic hate crime, incident or issue. The world's second-largest Peace Pole, at {{convert|52|ft}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.janesvillecvb.com/things_to_do/details/4720/225665/Peace_Pole|title=Explore Janesville - Wisconsin's Great Outside|website=www.janesvillecvb.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located in [[Janesville, Wisconsin]] at the site of a 1992 [[KKK]] rally (Saturday, May 30).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/news/local/2016/01/29/sheboygan-helped-unicef-successful-1952/79355646/|title=Sheboygan helped UNICEF be successful in 1952|last=Dippel|first=Beth|date=2016-01-29|work=Sheboygan Press Media|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://journaltimes.com/news/national/kkk-makes-plans-for-janesville-rally/article_a4527e1d-beb0-5fae-bcbd-1597246c3633.html|title=KKK makes plans for Janesville rally|last=Associated Press|first=|date=1992-05-10|work=Journal Times|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/01/us/klan-rally-draws-violent-protest.html|title=Klan Rally Draws Violent Protest|last=Associated Press|first=|date=1992-06-01|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the largest Peace Poles in the world, as measured in tons, is the granite Peace Pole&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peace-pole.com/granite_peace_pole.htm the granite Peace Pole]&lt;/ref&gt; in Beech Acres Park&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andersonparks.com/ParkBAPeacePole.html Beech Acres Park]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], inspired by [[hate literature]] left in the driveways of [[Jew]]ish residents.

In September 2016, the World Peace Prayer Society and the [[Little Free Library]] project announced a collaboration to offer a new Peace Pole Library structure. It features the standard Peace Pole message of peace - "May Peace Prevail on Earth” - in a six-foot library. Some of these new libraries were installed at locations significant to the [[civil rights movement]], such as the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|16th Street Baptist Church]] in Birmingham, Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://littlefreelibrary.org/may-peace-prevail-on-earth-is-message-of-new-peace-pole-library/|title=‘May Peace Prevail on Earth’ Is Message of New Peace Pole Library|date=2016-09-12|work=Little Free Library|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://littlefreelibrary.org/peace-pole-libraries-given-to-honor-civil-rights-movement/|title=Peace Pole Libraries Given to Honor Civil Rights Movement|date=2016-09-16|work=Little Free Library|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[multilingual inscription]] of a peace pole constitutes a [[parallel text]] with top-to-bottom sentences. Each one is usually shown:
*rotated clockwise in languages using [[left-to-right|LTR]] scripts (English, Latin, ...)
*rotated counterclockwise in languages using [[right-to-left|RTL]] scripts (Arabic, Hebrew, ...)
*arranged vertically in languages using [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|East Asian scripts]] (Japanese, Chinese, ...)

They can be set in different [[Letter case#Case styles|case styles]] ([[sentence case]], [[title case]] [[all caps]], [[small caps]]), even on a single pole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4190">'''Personal carbon credits''' are [[carbon credit]]s created and owned by individuals who reduce their green house gas (GHG) emissions by a real and verifiable amount. Individuals cause GHG emissions from a variety of direct and indirect activities including transportation use, electrical use and home heating and cooling. Verifiable reductions in GHG emissions are aggregated into 1 metric ton increments and they become personal Carbon Credits.

Traditional carbon credits are purchased by GHG emitters to offset the difference between their actual emissions and their allowable limit under a cap and trade type GHG reduction program or to reduce their total GHG emissions under a voluntary limit. These same credits are created when specific GHG reduction projects produce real, additional and verifiable GHG reductions. These [[carbon project]]s are typically large in scale and include reforestation, fuel switching and biogas projects.

Personal carbon credits follow the same concept as traditional carbon credits, but these projects are small in scale, developed by individuals and encourage actual reduction in energy demand at the use point. They are applicable globally, wherever the verification requirements can be satisfied.

Personal carbon credits differ from [[personal carbon trading]] which imposes a cap or allowance on individual GHG emissions. Personal carbon credits are a voluntary method for individuals to directly reduce energy consumption and the resulting GHG emissions. Successful individual reductions are rewarded through lower utility costs and the value of the created personal carbon credits.

Personal carbon credits were first introduced by My Emissions Exchange in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rhJzjktg |archivedate=2010-08-03 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6169783.ece|title=Eco Firm will pay Irish to Curb Carbon Usage|first=Sarah|last=McInerary|date=April 26, 2009 |newspaper= The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts on carbon credit markets have called for inclusion of small scale GHG reduction projects and verification methods that are valid, appropriate and cost effective for projects of this size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonoffsetsdaily.com/global/charismatic-carbon-anyone-2-10823.htm|title=Charismatic Carbon Anyone?|first=Lisa|last=Ashford|date=August 17, 2009 |publisher=Businessgreen.com/Carbon Offsets Daily.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal carbon credits address this need and create more opportunities for GHG reductions.

==Verification==
Verification and certification of all carbon credits are necessary to insure real GHG reductions are occurring and to insure buyer confidence in using credits to offset GHG emissions.  There are many certification standards in existence today for both the compliance and voluntary credit markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/cms_documents/StateOfTheVoluntaryCarbonMarkets_2009.pdf Fortifying the Foundation – State of the Voluntary Carbon Markets 2009] by Katherine Hamilton, et al. at Ecosystems Marketplace and New Carbon Finance, May 20, 2009 Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal carbon credits are a new approach to GHG reduction strategies and as such there are no specific protocols existing today within the various certification standards, specifically, because personal carbon credits are so new.  However, the proper design of the verification system, such as the use of utility company billing meters and review of historical consumption patterns, can insure that personal carbon credits comply with all the requirements of The Greenhouse Gas Protocol by the World Resources Institute, including additionality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/files/ghg_project_protocol.pdf The Greenhouse Gas Protocol on Project Accounting by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Greater awareness of personal carbon credits will encourage certification organizations to develop specific protocols in the future.

'''''Lophophora williamsii''''' ({{IPAc-en|l|oʊ|ˈ|f|ɒ|f|ə|r|ə|_|w|ɪ|l|i|ˈ|æ|m|s|i|aɪ}}) or '''peyote''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|j|oʊ|t|i}}) is a small, spineless [[cactus]] with [[Psychoactive cactus|psychoactive alkaloids]], particularly [[mescaline]].&lt;ref name=SalakHuicholIndians&gt;{{cite web |last =Salak |first =Kira |title =Lost Souls of the Peyote Trail (published in National Geographic Adventure) |work =Kira Salak |publisher =Kira Salak, KiraSalak.com| url =http://www.kirasalak.com/Peyote.html |accessdate = 2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peyote'' is a Spanish word derived from the [[Nahuatl]], or Aztec, '''''peyōtl''''' {{IPA-nah|ˈpejoːt͡ɬ|}}, meaning "glisten" or "glistening". Other sources translate the Nahuatl word as "Divine Messenger".&lt;ref name=Andr03&gt;{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=J.

It is found primarily in the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] and in the [[States of Mexico|states]] of [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[San Luis Potosí]] among scrub. It flowers from March through May, and sometimes as late as September. The flowers are pink, with [[thigmotactic]] anthers (like ''[[Opuntia]]'').

Known for its [[psychoactive]] properties when ingested, peyote is used worldwide, having a long history of ritualistic and [[traditional medicine|medicinal]] use by [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous North Americans]]. Peyote contains the [[hallucinogen]] [[mescaline]].

==Description==
[[File:Lophophora williamsii ies.jpg|thumb|A group of ''Lophophora williamsii''.]]
[[File:Lophophora williamsii.jpg|thumb|A flowering peyote.]]
The various species of the genus ''[[Lophophora]]'' grow low to the ground and they often form groups with numerous, crowded shoots. The blue-green, yellow-green or sometimes reddish-green shoots are mostly flattened spheres with sunken shoot tips. They can reach heights of from {{convert|2|to|7|cm|sp=us}} and diameters of {{convert|4|to|12|cm|abbr=on}}. There are often significant, vertical ribs consisting of low and rounded or hump-like bumps. From the cusp [[areole]]s arises a tuft of soft, yellowish or whitish woolly hairs. Spines are absent.
Flowers are pink or white to slightly yellowish, sometimes reddish. They open during the day, are from 1 to 2.4&amp;nbsp;cm long, and reach a diameter from 1 to 2.2&amp;nbsp;cm.

[[File:L. williamsii.JPG|thumb|right|''Lophophora williamsii'' seedling at roughly 1 1/2 months of age]]
The cactus produces flowers sporadically; these are followed by small edible pink fruit. The club-shaped to elongated, fleshy fruits are bare and more or less rosy colored. At maturity, they are brownish-white and dry. The fruits do not burst open on their own and they are between 1.5 and 2&amp;nbsp;cm long. They contain black, pear-shaped seeds that are 1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm long and 1&amp;nbsp;mm wide.
The seeds require hot and humid conditions to germinate. Peyote contains a large spectrum of [[phenethylamine]] alkaloids.  The principal one is mescaline for which the content of ''Lophophora williamsii'' is about 0.4% fresh&lt;ref name= "erowid"&gt;{{cite web | title =Lophophora | work =Visionary Cactus Guide | publisher =Erowid.org | date =2008-03-08 | url =http://www.erowid.org/plants/cacti/cacti_guide/cacti_guide_lophopho.shtml | accessdate = 2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (undried) and 3–6% dried.&lt;ref name="erowid"/&gt;

Peyote is extremely slow growing. Cultivated specimens grow considerably faster, sometimes taking less than three years to go from seedling to mature flowering adult. More rapid growth can be achieved by grafting peyote onto mature [[Echinopsis pachanoi|San Pedro]] root stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 | publisher=The Lophophora Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top of the above-ground part of the cactus, the crown, consists of disc-shaped buttons. These are cut above the roots and sometimes dried. When done properly, the top of the root forms a callus and the root does not rot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Currently in South Texas, peyote grows naturally but has been over-harvested, to the point that the state has listed it as an [[endangered species]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The buttons are generally chewed, or boiled in water to produce a psychoactive tea. Peyote is extremely bitter and most people are [[nausea]]ted before they feel the onset of the psychoactive effects.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Distribución del Peyote.jpg|thumb|right|Range of wild peyote]]
''L. williamsii'' is native to southern [[North America]], mainly distributed in [[Mexico]]. In the United States it grows in Southern [[Texas]]. In Mexico it grows in the [[States of Mexico|states]] of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]], and [[Tamaulipas]] in the north to [[San Luis Potosi]] and [[Zacatecas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Martin | first =Terry | title =Stalking the wild Lophophora Part 1: Chihuahua and Coahuila | journal =Cactus and Succulent Journal | volume =80 | issue =4 | pages =181–186 | publisher =Cactus and Succulent Society of America | date =July 2008 | url =http://www.lophophora.info/Stalking%20the%20wild%20Lophophora_english-part%201.pdf | issn =0007-9367 | doi = 10.2985/0007-9367(2008)80[181:STWL]2.0.CO;2 | accessdate = 2013-09-12 | year =2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Martin | first =Terry | title = Stalking the wild Lophophora Part 2: Zacatecas, San Luis potosí, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas | journal = Cactus and Succulent Journal | volume =80 | issue =5 | pages =222–228 | publisher = Cactus and Succulent Society of America | date =September 2008 | url = http://www.lophophora.info/Stalking%20the%20wild%20Lophophora_english-part%202.pdf | issn = 0007-9367 | doi = 10.2985/0007-9367(2008)80[222:STWL]2.0.CO;2 | accessdate = 2013-09-12 | year =2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Martin | first =Terry | title = Stalking the wild Lophophora Part 3: San Luis Potosí (central), Querétaro, and Mexico City | journal = Cactus and Succulent Journal | volume =80 | issue =6 | pages =310–317 | publisher = Cactus and Succulent Society of America | date =November 2008 | url = http://www.lophophora.info/Stalking%20the%20wild%20Lophophora_english-part%203.pdf | issn =  0007-9367 | doi = 10.2985/0007-9367-80.6.310 | accessdate = 2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily found at elevations of {{convert|100|-|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} and exceptionally up to {{convert|1900|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Chihuahuan desert]], but is also present in the more mild climate of Tamaulipas.

[[File:Mescaline chemical structure.png|thumb|150px|[[Chemical structure]] of mescaline, the primary hallucinogen in peyote]]

When used for its [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] properties, common doses for pure mescaline range from roughly 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;mg. This translates to a dose of roughly 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;g of dried peyote buttons of average potency; however, potency varies considerably between samples, making it difficult to measure doses accurately without first extracting the mescaline. The effects last about 10 to 12 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{CitePiHKAL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peyote is reported to trigger rich visual or auditory effects (see [[synesthesia]]).&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5701998|year=2017|author1=Orsolini|first1=L|title=The "Endless Trip" among the NPS Users: Psychopathology and Psychopharmacology in the Hallucinogen-Persisting Perception Disorder.

In addition to psychoactive use, some Native American tribes use the plant in the belief it may have curative properties.

===History===
In 2005 researchers used [[radiocarbon dating]] and alkaloid analysis to study two specimens of peyote buttons found in [[archaeological]] digs from a site called Shumla Cave No. 5 on the Rio Grande in [[Texas]]. The results dated the specimens to between 3780 and 3660 [[Common Era|BCE]]. Alkaloid extraction yielded approximately 2% of the alkaloids including mescaline in both samples. This indicates that native North Americans were likely to have used peyote since at least five-and-a-half thousand years ago.&lt;ref name=prehistoric&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Seedi HR, De Smet PA, Beck O, Possnert G, Bruhn JG |title=Prehistoric peyote use: alkaloid analysis and radiocarbon dating of archaeological specimens of Lophophora from Texas |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=101 |issue=1–3 |pages=238–42 |date=October 2005 |pmid=15990261 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2005.04.022 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specimens from a burial cave in west central [[Coahuila]], Mexico have been similarly analyzed and dated to 810 to 1070 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bruhn JG, Lindgren JE, Holmstedt B, Adovasio JM |title=Peyote Alkaloids: Identification in a Prehistoric Specimen of Lophophora from Coahuila, Mexico |journal=Science |volume=199 |issue=4336 |pages=1437–1438 |date=March 1978 |pmid=17796678 |doi=10.1126/science.199.4336.1437 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lophophorawilliamsii.jpg|thumb |Peyote in [[Wirikuta]], Mexico]]

From earliest recorded time, peyote has been used by indigenous peoples, such as the [[Huichol people|Huichol]]&lt;ref&gt;Lumholtz, Carl, ''Unknown Mexico'', New York: Scribners, 1902&lt;/ref&gt; of northern Mexico and by various Native American tribes, native to or relocated to the Southern Plains [[U.S. state|states]] of present-day [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]]. Its usage was also recorded among various Southwestern [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan-language]] tribal groups. The [[Tonkawa]], the [[Mescalero]], and [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]] were the source or first practitioners of peyote religion in the regions north of present-day Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also the principal group to introduce peyote to newly arrived migrants, such as the [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]] from the Northern Plains. The religious, ceremonial, and healing uses of peyote may date back over 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Under the auspices of what came to be known as the [[Native American Church]], in the 19th century, American Indians in more widespread regions to the north began to use peyote in religious practices, as part of a revival of native spirituality. Its members refer to peyote as "the sacred medicine", and use it to combat spiritual, physical, and other social ills. Concerned about the drug's psychoactive effects, between the 1880s and 1930s, U.S. authorities attempted to ban Native American religious rituals involving peyote, including the [[Ghost Dance]]. Today the Native American Church is one among several religious organizations to use peyote as part of its religious practice. Some users claim the drug connects them to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37101268|title=The people who take drugs to see God|work=BBC news|date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Navajo belief or ceremonial practice did not mention the use of peyote before its introduction by the neighboring [[Ute people|Utes]]. The Navajo Nation now has the most members of the Native American Church.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Dr. John Raleigh Briggs (1851–1907) was the first to draw scientific attention of the Western scientific world to peyote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/27qu47m77g617718/ Jan G. Bruhn and Bo Holmstedt, "Early peyote research: an interdisciplinary study"], ''Economic Botany'', Volume 28, Number 4, October 1973, accessed 15 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Lewin]] described ''Anhalonium lewinii'' in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Louis|last=Lewin|author-link=Louis Lewin|title=Ueber Anhalonium Lewinii|language=de|date=1888-05-18|work=Archiv für Experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie|volume=24|issue=6|pages=401–411|doi=10.1007/bf01923627}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Heffter]] conducted self experiments on its effects in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heffter.org/review/Review2/chap2.pdf Daniel Perrine, "Visions of the Night: Western Medicine Meets Peyote, 1887-1899"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722210159/http://www.heffter.org/review/Review2/chap2.pdf |date=2008-07-22 }}, in ''The Heffter Review of Psychedelic Research'', Vol. 2, 2001, p.42, accessed 15 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Carl Sofus Lumholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;Lumholtz, Carl, ''Unknown Mexico'', New York: Scribners (1902)&lt;/ref&gt; studied and wrote about the use of peyote among the Indians of Mexico. Lumholtz also reported that, lacking other intoxicants, [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] captured by Union forces during the [[American Civil War]] soaked peyote buttons in water and became "intoxicated with the liquid".&lt;ref&gt;Lumholtz, Carl, ''Unknown Mexico'', New York: Scribners (1902), p.358&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adverse reactions===
A study published in 2007 found no evidence of long-term cognitive problems related to peyote use in [[Native American Church]] ceremonies, but researchers stressed their results may not apply to those who use peyote in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern JH, Sherwood AR, Hudson JI, Yurgelun-Todd D, Pope HG Jr. Psychological and cognitive effects of long-term peyote use among Native Americans. Biol Psychiatry. 2005;58(8):624-631.&lt;/ref&gt; A four-year large-scale study of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] who regularly ingested peyote found only one case where peyote was associated with a [[psychotic break]] in an otherwise healthy person; other psychotic episodes were attributed to peyote use in conjunction with pre-existing substance abuse or mental health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bergman RL (1971). "Navajo peyote use: its apparent safety," Amer J Psychiat 128(6):695-699[51-55].&lt;/ref&gt; Later research found that those with pre-existing mental health issues are more likely to have adverse reactions to peyote.&lt;ref&gt;Inaba, D.S. &amp; Cohen, W.E. (2004). Uppers, Downers, All Arounders. (pp. 229-230, 232). Oregon: CNS Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Peyote use does not appear to be associated with [[hallucinogen persisting perception disorder]] (a.k.a. "flashbacks") after religious use.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, J. H. (1996). The use of hallucinogens in the treatment of addiction. Addiction Research, 4(2);177-189.&lt;/ref&gt; Peyote does not seem to be associated with [[physical dependence]], but some users may experience [[psychological dependence]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, S. E. &amp; Malenka, R. C. (2001). Addiction and the brain: The neurobiology of compulsion and its persistence. Neuroscience. 2;696&lt;/ref&gt;

Peyote can have strong [[emetic]] effects, and one death has been attributed to [[Mallory–Weiss syndrome|esophageal bleeding]] caused by vomiting after peyote ingestion in a Native American patient with a history of alcohol abuse.&lt;ref&gt;K B Nolte and R E Zumwalt. Fatal peyote ingestion associated with Mallory-Weiss lacerations. West J Med. 1999 Jun; 170(6): 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Peyote is also known to cause potentially serious variations in heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and [[mydriasis|pupillary dilation]].&lt;ref&gt;Nole and Zumwalt 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=poisoning/&gt;

Research into the [[huichol]] natives of central-western Mexico, who have taken peyote regularly for an estimated 1,500 years or more, found no evidence of [[chromosome]] damage in either men or women.&lt;ref&gt;Dorrance; Janiger; and Teplitz (1975), "Effect of peyote on human chromosomes: cytogenic study of the huichol indians of northern mexico." JAMA 234:299-302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
[[File:Peyote Drummer.jpg|thumb|right|A Native American Peyote Drummer (circa 1927)]]

===Huichol culture===
The [[Huichol people|Huichol]] religion consists of four principal [[deities]]: Corn, Blue Deer, Peyote, and the Eagle, all descended from their Sun God, "Tao Jreeku". Schaefer has interpreted this to mean that peyote is the soul of their religious culture and a [[visionary]] [[sacrament]] that opens a pathway to the other deities.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy B. Schaefer, Peter T. Furst. People of the Peyote: Huichol Indian History, Religion, and Survival. UNM Press, 1997. Pg 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{main|Legality of mescaline cactus by country}}

===United Nations===

[[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 32: RESERVATIONS|Article 32]] of the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] allows nations to exempt certain traditional uses of substances from prohibition:
{{quote|A State on whose territory there are plants growing wild which contain psychotropic substances from among those in Schedule I and which are traditionally used by certain small, clearly determined groups in magical or religious rites, may, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, make reservations concerning these plants, in respect of the provisions of article 7, except for the provisions relating to international trade.}}
However, this exemption would apply only if the peyote cactus were ever explicitly added to the Schedules of the Psychotropic Convention. Currently the Convention applies only to chemicals. Peyote and other psychedelic plants are neither listed nor regulated by the Convention.

===Canada===
Mescaline is listed as a Schedule III controlled substance under the Canadian [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]], but peyote is specifically exempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8/page-14.html#h-30 laws-lois.justice.gc.ca], Controlled Drugs and Substances Act - S.C. 1996, c. 19 (SCHEDULE III), accessed 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Possession and use of peyote plants is legal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/psychedelic-use-spreads-in-b-c-native-community-1.1111869 cbc.ca]; CBC News: Psychedelic use spreads in B.C. native community, accessed 15 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Non-drug uses of peyote in religious ceremonies by the Native American Church and its members are exempt from registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Section 1307.31 Native American Church  |work =Code of Federal Regulations |publisher =U.S. Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration Office of Diversion Control |url =http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1307/1307_31.htm | accessdate = 2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law has been codified as a [[statute]] in the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] of 1978, and made part of the [[common law]] in ''[[Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh]]'', (5th Cir. 1991);&lt;ref&gt;James W.H. McCord, Sandra McCord, and C. Suzanne Bailey, ''Criminal and Procedure for the Paralegal: A Systems Approach'', p. 178-179 (4th ed. Delmar Cengage 2012) {{ISBN|978-1435440166}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also in [[administrative law]] at the {{USCFR|21|1307|31}} which states for "Special Exempt Persons":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Section 1307.31 Native American Church. The listing of peyote as a controlled substance in Schedule I does not apply to the nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church, and members of the Native American Church so using peyote are exempt from registration. Any person who manufactures peyote for or distributes peyote to the Native American Church, however, is required to obtain registration annually and to comply with all other requirements of law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''U.S. v. Boyll'', 774 F.Supp. 1333 (D.N.M. 1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants =UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff, v. Robert Lawrence BOYLL, Defendant. |vol =Crim. No. 90-207-JB |pinpoint =774 F.Supp. 133 (D.N.M. 1991) |court =United States District Court, D. New Mexico |date =1991-09-03 |url= http://www.druglibrary.org/olsen/religion/boyll.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; addresses this racial issue specifically and concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the reasons set out in this Memorandum Opinion and
Order, the Court holds that, pursuant to 21 C.F.R. § 1307.31
(1990), the classification of peyote as a Schedule I controlled
substance, see 21 U.S.C. § 812(c), Schedule I(c)(12), does not
apply to the importation, possession or use of peyote for 'bona
fide' ceremonial use by members of the Native American Church,
regardless of race.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the passage of the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] Amendments of 1994, United States [[federal law]] (and many [[state law]]s) protects the [[harvest]], [[Possession (law)|possession]], [[ingestion|consumption]] and [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] of peyote as part of "[[bona fide]] religious ceremonies" (the federal statute is the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, codified at {{USC|42|1996a}}, "Traditional Indian religious use of the peyote sacrament", exempting only use by Native American persons. US v. Boyll expanded permitted use to all persons engaged in traditional Indian use, regardless of race. All US states with the exception of Idaho and Texas allow usage by non-native, non-enrolled persons in the context of ceremonies of the [[Native American Church]]. Some states such as Arizona additionally exempt any general bona fide religious activity or spiritual intent. US jurisdictions enacted these specific statutory exemptions in reaction to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'', {{ussc|494|872|1990}}, which held that laws prohibiting the use of peyote that do not specifically exempt religious use nevertheless do not violate the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Peyote is listed by the United States DEA as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] controlled substance.

{{Politics of Switzerland}}
The '''President of the Swiss Confederation''', also known as the '''President of the Confederation''' or colloquially as the '''President of Switzerland''', is the head of [[Switzerland]]'s seven-member [[Federal Council (Switzerland)|Federal Council]], the country's [[executive (government)|executive branch]]. Elected by the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]] for one year, the president chairs the meetings of the Federal Council and undertakes special representational duties. [[Primus inter pares|First among equals]], the president has no powers over and above the other six councillors and continues to head their [[Ministry (government department)|department]]. Traditionally the duty rotates among the members in order of seniority and the previous year's vice-president becomes president. The president is not the Swiss [[head of state]]; the entire Federal Council is the collective head of state.

The constitutional provisions relating to the organization of the Federal Government and Federal administration are set out in ''Section 1 Organisation and Procedure'' of ''Chapter 3 Federal Council and Federal Administration'' of the ''Title 3 Confederation, Cantons and Communes'' of the Swiss Federal Constitution&lt;ref name=SR101&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/index.html |title=SR 101 Federal constitution of the Swiss Confederation of 18 April 1999 (Status as of 12 February 2017), unauthorized English version |date=12 February 2017 |publisher=The Federal Council |location=Berne, Switzerland |language=de, fr, it, en |type=official site |accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; at articles 174 to 179. Article 176 specifically relates to the Presidency.

==Competencies==
The Swiss president is not – as are, for example, the [[President of Austria|Presidents in Austria]] or [[President of Germany|Germany]] – the [[head of state]] of the country: under the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]], the Federal Council doubles as a collective head of state and head of government.&lt;ref name=ch/&gt; When a tied vote occurs in the council (which sometimes happens, because the six Federal Councillors who are not president vote first), the president – as the chair of the council – casts the deciding vote (or may abstain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/en/home/dokumentation/abc-der-politischen-rechte/bundespraesident--bundespraesidentin.html |title=President of the Swiss Confederation; President of the Confederation |publisher=Federal Chancellery |location=Berne, Switzerland |date=24 August 2016 |type=official site |accessdate=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the control of his or her own department, the president carries out some of the representative duties that are normally carried out by a single head of state in other democracies. For example, since joining the [[United Nations]], Swiss presidents have on occasion spoken at inaugural sessions of the [[United_Nations General Assembly#General Debates|General Assembly]] along with other visiting heads of state and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hug |first1=Simon |last2=Wegmann |first2=Simone |title=Ten Years in the United Nations: Where Does Switzerland Stand? |journal=Swiss Political Science Review |date=1 June 2013 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=212–232 |publisher=Swiss Political Science Association |location=Geneva, Switzerland |doi=10.1111/spsr.12034 |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/spsr.12034 |issn=1662-6370 |via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=UN News - Swiss President, at General Assembly, Highlights Crucial Role of UN in Solving Crises |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54974 |publisher=UN News, United Nations |location=New York City |date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the Swiss have no single head of state, the country carries out no state visits. When traveling abroad, the president does so only in their capacity as head of their department. Visiting heads of state are received by the seven members of the Federal Council together, rather than by the President of the Confederation. Treaties are signed on behalf of the full Council, with all Federal Council members signing [[letters of credence]] and other documents of the kind.

==Election==
The president is elected by the Federal Assembly from the Federal Council for a term of one year.&lt;ref name=SR101/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Emerson |first1=Peter |title=Defining Democracy: Voting Procedures in Decision-Making, Elections and Governance |date=2012 |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642209031 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin, Germany |isbn=978-3-642-20904-8 |pages=125-126 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ch&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stojanović |first1=Nenad |title=Party, Regional and Linguistic Proportionality Under Majoritarian Rules: Swiss Federal Council Elections |journal=Swiss Political Science Review |date=1 March 2016 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=41–58 |publisher=Swiss Political Science Association |location=Geneva, Switzerland |doi=10.1111/spsr.12208 |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/spsr.12208 |issn=1662-6370 |via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the election as federal president was an award for especially esteemed Federal Council members. However, a few influential members of the government were regularly passed over. One such example was [[Wilhelm Matthias Naeff]], who – although a member of the Federal Council for 27 years – was federal president only once, in 1853.

Since the twentieth century, the election has usually not been disputed. There is an unwritten rule that the member of the Federal Council who has not been federal president the longest becomes President. Therefore, every Federal Council member gets a turn at least once every seven years. The only question in the elections that provides some tension is the question of how many votes the person who is to be elected president receives. This is seen as a popularity test. In the 1970s and 1980s, 200 votes (of 246 possible) was seen as an excellent result, but in the current era of growing party-political conflicts, 180 votes are a respectable outcome.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Until 1920, it was customary for the serving federal president to also lead the Department of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, every year there was a moving around of posts, as the retiring president returned to his former department and the new president took up the Foreign Affairs portfolio. Likewise, it was traditional for the federal president not to leave Switzerland during their year in office.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''Roman/Red''' ({{lang-nl|Rooms/rood}}) is the nickname of coalitions of [[Catholicism|catholic]] and [[social democracy|social-democratic]] parties in the Netherlands and Belgium. Roman refers to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and Red to the colour of social democrats. Between 1946 and 1958, the [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP) and the social-democratic [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) formed the core of several 'Roman/red' cabinets, led by [[Willem Drees]].

After the Catholic KVP merged with two Protestant parties to form the [[non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]] [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) in 1980, the term was used less in Dutch politics. In Belgian politics the term is still used to describe cabinets made up out of the Catholic [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish]] party (CD&amp;V) and [[Centre démocrate humaniste|Humanist Democratic Centre]] (CDh) and the social-democratic [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Socialist Party Different]] (SP.A) and [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Socialist Party]] (PS).

'''Visolela Rosalinda "Rosa" Namises''' (born 1958), nicknamed the "[[Rosa Luxemburg]] of Namibia",&lt;ref name=Welt&gt;{{Cite news | title=Ich liebe die Welt! |trans-title=I love the world! | language=German | last=Dregger | first=Leila | newspaper=[[Die Wochenzeitung]] | date=6 March 2014 | url=https://www.woz.ch/-4c2f}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Namibia]]n politician and human-rights activist. She is a former Member of [[Parliament of Namibia|Parliament]] and founding member and former secretary-general of the Namibian [[Congress of Democrats]] (CoD). A prominent voice on gender issues, human-rights violations, and violence against women and children in Namibia, she is the director of [[Woman Solidarity Namibia]] and works at the ''Dolam Residential Child Care'' centre, a day-care centre for vulnerable children.

==Early life and education==
Namises was born on 20 April 1958&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Namises Visolela Rosalinda | publisher=[[Parliament of Namibia]] | accessdate=12 October 2016 | url=http://www.parliament.na/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;view=contact&amp;id=568:namises-visolela-rosalinda&amp;catid=123&amp;Itemid=1372}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of nine children to an Angolan father and [[Damara people|Damara]] mother in the [[Old Location]] of [[Windhoek]], the capital of Namibia. She grew up with her father until she was 15 years old and attended the [[Augustineum Secondary School]] in [[Windhoek]]. After graduating she worked first as a cleaner, then as a nursing assistant, and in parallel she completed her [[matric]] through a correspondence course with [[Sukses College]].&lt;ref name=passion&gt;{{Cite news | title=Rosa Namises: Human Rights Activist with a passion | last=Nghidengwa | first=Marianne | newspaper=[[Confidente]] | date=18 December 2012 | url=http://www.confidente.com.na/2012/12/rosa-namises-human-rights-activist-with-a-passion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her political activism first landed her in jail and then led her into exile,&lt;ref name=Welt/&gt; conditions that forced her to discontinue her education. Only in 1990 when [[Independence of Namibia|Namibia became independent]] did she continue to study. She obtained a Diploma in Adult and Basic Education from [[UNISA]] and a Diploma in Gender Development and Planning from the [[University of London]]. She further holds a Diploma in Women in Management, has had some [[paralegal]] education, and acquired counselling and facilitation skills.&lt;ref name=passion/&gt;

==Political career==
In the early 1980s Namises joined the then-illegal [[SWAPO party]]. She organised meetings, acquired new members, and distributed promotional material. She was caught and spent two months in [[solitary confinement]] but soon returned to her activist's activities.&lt;ref name="Überblick"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Namibia: Rosa Namises kämpft für Gerechtigkeit |trans-title=Rosa Namises fights for justice | language=German | last=von Wietersheim | first=Erika | journal=[[Der Überblick]] | issue=1 | year=2001 | page=85 | url=http://www.der-ueberblick.de/ueberblick.archiv/one.ueberblick.article/ueberblick0a8c.html?entry=page.200101.085}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985&lt;ref name="Überblick"/&gt; she lost her job in the hospital after having been seen holding hands in public with a white doctor, violating [[apartheid legislation]] on [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref name=Welt/&gt; She was also jailed a second time for her political activities, this time for 14 months.&lt;ref name="Überblick"/&gt;

Once released she was offered a job by the [[Catholic Church]] as community development officer. In the same year [[Ben Ulenga]] was released from [[Robben Island]] prison. Namises and Ulenga met and became a couple soon thereafter. When she was pregnant with their second child in 1987 but they still refused to marry each other, Namises was fired. She also abandoned her Catholic faith at that time, and for that reason. Namises then went into exile and worked in Europe and America. She only returned after the [[Independence of Namibia]] in 1990. Not long thereafter several past human rights violations by SWAPO were uncovered. When the party subsequently erected a [[Breaking the Wall of Silence|wall of silence]] instead of reappraising what had happened, Namises ceased her SWAPO membership in 1992.&lt;ref name="Überblick"/&gt;

When the [[Congress of Democrats]] (CoD) was founded in 1999, Namises was one of its founding members. In the subsequent [[Namibian general election, 1999|parliamentary elections]], the CoD gained seven seats, and Namises as secretary-general became a Member of [[Parliament of Namibia|Parliament]]. When the CoD only gained five seats in the [[Namibian general election, 2004|next elections in 2004]], Namises was one of the politicians not to return to parliament. However, after the party expelled [[Nora Schimming-Chase]] in 2009, Namises took her seat for the remainder of the legislative period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Namises back in Parliament | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=25 September 2009 | url=http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=58101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
As Namises went in and out of politics, she spent the time in between as an activist and lobbyist. Her first formal role was her work at the Legal Assistance Centre in the early 1990s, a job she took after quitting SWAPO. She helped to discover and fight human rights violations there, a step she described as "revenge".&lt;ref name="Überblick"/&gt;

She is the director of [[Woman Solidarity Namibia]], an organisation fighting violence against women and children. Namises is also the founder and main operator of ''Dolam Residential Child Care'', a day-care facility for vulnerable children. There are {{As of|2014|alt=currently}} 21 children at the centre.&lt;ref name=passion/&gt;

The '''Spirit of Revolt Archive''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spirit of Revolt - Archives of Dissent|url=http://spiritofrevolt.info|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Glasgow]] ([[Scotland]]), is dedicated to collecting, managing and preserving multi-media records from Glasgow’s and [[Clydeside]]’s [[anarchist]] and [[libertarian]]-socialist movement. It is a ‘community archive’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bastian, J.A.|title=Community Archives. The shaping of memory|year=2009|publisher=Facet|location=London|isbn=978-1856046398|pages=3–28|author2=Alexander, B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; largely run by volunteers. It was constituted in August 2011 and today forms part of Glasgow City Archives’ collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow City Archives|url=http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/libraries/the-mitchell-library/archives/Pages/home.aspx|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst maintaining its organisational independence. Its catalogue will join the [[National Records of Scotland]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Records of Scotland|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive derives its name from the title of an 1880 pamphlet by the Russian anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings|year=2003|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Dover|isbn=978-0486419558|pages=34–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The archive’s digitised documents are hosted on www.archive.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archive.org|url=https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Spirit+of+Revolt.%22|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For its initial scoping and start-up phase, Spirit of Revolt Archive was funded by the Barry Amiel and Norman Melburn Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barry Amiel and Norman Melburn Trust|url=http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/trustinfo/grants.htm|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which seeks to ‘advance public education, learning and knowledge in all aspects of the philosophy of Marxism, the history of socialism, and the working-class movement’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barry Amiel and Norman Melburn Trust|url=http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/trustinfo/about%20the%20trust.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Material selected for retention in the archive provides one or more of the following: evidence of a campaign, movement, organisation, or individual’s activities; information pertinent to the anarchist movement, e.g., expositions of anarchist ideology, political positions, rationale behind activities; an insight into membership and associates of anarchist organisations; evidence of the impact of anarchism culturally and politically. Material from political parties is not collected, according to archival policy.&lt;ref name="academia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal profile|last=Pautz|first=Hartwig|url=https://www.academia.edu/3139826/The_Spirit_of_Revolt_A_community_archive_of_libertarian_socialism_and_anarchism|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2013, the archive organised an exhibition, called ‘Radical Presses Clydeside – 100 Years of Autonomous Protest Literature’ at Glasgow’s [[Mitchell Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire|first=Neil|title=Spirit of Revolt exhibition|url=http://gsavis.com/blog/2013/01/13/the-spirit-of-revolt-exhibition/|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Cat|title=Spirit of Revolt: A Review|url=http://internationalsocialist.org.uk/index.php/blog/spirit-of-revolt-a-review/|publisher=International Socialist Group|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Spirit of Revolt was represented at the 19th "Alternative Futures and Popular Protest" conference at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]].&lt;ref name="academia" /&gt;

Spirit of Revolt Archive also works in conjunction with "[http://radicalglasgow.me.uk/strugglepedia/index.php?title=Main_Page Radical Glasgow's Strugglepedia]" which gives information about Glasgow's radical history.

'''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''', often informally known as the '''LDS Church''' or '''Mormon Church''', is a [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]], [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Restorationism|restorationist]] church that is considered by its members to be the [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of the [[One true church#Latter Day Saint movement|original church]] founded by [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]]. The church is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] in the United States, and has established congregations and built [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] worldwide. According to the church, it has over 67,000 [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]]&lt;ref name="Statistics 2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=2017 Statistical Report for 2018 April Conference|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/2017-statistical-report-april-2018-general-conference|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=MormonNewsroom.org|date=March 31, 2018|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics|membership]] of over 16 million.&lt;ref name="Statistics 2017" /&gt; In 2012, the [[National Council of Churches]] ranked the church as the fourth-largest [[Christian denomination]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ncccusa.org/news/120209yearbook2012.html |title= National Council of Churches News: Church giving drops $1.2 billion reports 2012 Yearbook of Churches |date= March 20, 2012 |work= ncccusa.org |publisher= [[National Council of Churches]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 6.5 million members reported by the church, as of January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts {{!}} Total Church Membership|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/united-states|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=MormonNewsroom.org|accessdate=September 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement|largest denomination]] in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] founded by [[Joseph Smith]] during the period of religious revival known as the [[Second Great Awakening]].

Adherents, often referred to as "Latter-day Saints" or, less formally, "[[Mormons]]", view faith in Jesus Christ and his [[Substitutionary atonement|atonement]] as fundamental principles of their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1976|p= 121}} "The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Thomas S. Monson |first= Thomas S. |last= Monson |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/2003/01/the-way-of-the-master |title= The Way of the Master |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= January 2003 |pages= 2–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; LDS theology includes the Christian doctrine of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] only through Jesus Christ,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ." Book of Mormon, {{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|3|12}}&lt;/ref&gt; though LDS doctrines regarding the [[God in Mormonism|nature of God]] and the [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|potential of mankind]] differ significantly from mainstream Christianity. The church has an [[biblical canon|open canon]] which includes four [[religious text|scriptural texts]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bible (both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s), the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and [[exegesis]] about the Bible, texts described as [[apocryphal|lost parts of the Bible]], and other works believed to be written by ancient [[prophet]]s. Because of some of the doctrinal differences, [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], and several [[Protestant]] churches consider the Church to be distinct and [[Mormonism and Christianity|separate from mainstream Christianity]].&lt;ref name="kennedy2004"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/february/14.18.html |title=Winning them softly|first=John W.|last=Kennedy|date=February 2004|volume=48|issue=2|work=Christianity Today|accessdate=October 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the doctrine of [[continuous revelation|continuing]] [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]], Latter-day Saints believe that the church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] is a modern-day "[[prophet, seer, and revelator]]" and that Jesus Christ, under the direction of [[God the Father]], leads the church by revealing his will to its president. &lt;!--replace when new president is chosen--&gt; Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |quote= Perhaps the puzzle some feel can be explained by the reality that each of us has two different channels to God. We have a channel of governance through our prophet and other leaders. This channel, which has to do with doctrine, ordinances, and commandments, results in obedience. We also have a channel of personal testimony, which is direct to God. This has to do with His existence, our relationship to Him, and the truth of His restored gospel. This channel results in knowledge. |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |first= Dallin H. |last= Oaks |date= May 2008 |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/2008/05/testimony |title= Testimony |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president heads a hierarchical structure with various levels reaching down to local congregations. [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishops]], drawn from the [[laity]], lead local congregations. Male members, after reaching age 12, may be ordained to the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]], provided they are living the standards of the church. Women are not ordained to the priesthood but do occupy leadership roles in some church [[auxiliary organization (LDS Church)|auxiliary organizations]].&lt;ref name="ballard2007"&gt;{{Citation |last= Ballard |first= M.

Both men and women may serve as missionaries and the church maintains a large missionary program that [[proselytism|proselytizes]] and conducts [[LDS Humanitarian Services|humanitarian services]] worldwide. Faithful members adhere to church laws of [[Law of chastity|sexual purity]], [[Word of Wisdom|health]], [[Fasting#Mormonism|fasting]], and [[Sabbath in Christianity#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Sabbath observance]], and contribute ten percent of their income to the church in [[Tithing (Latter Day Saints)|tithing]]. The church also teaches about sacred [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] through which adherents make [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] with God, including [[Baptism (Mormonism)|baptism]], [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmation]], the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]] ([[Eucharist|holy communion]]), [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood ordination]], [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]], and [[celestial marriage]] (marriage blessings which extend beyond mortality)—all of which are of great significance to church members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/liahona/2001/11/ordinances-and-covenants |title= Ordinances and Covenants |last= Neuenschwander |first= Dennis B. |journal= [[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]] |date= November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The history of the LDS Church is typically divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of [[Joseph Smith]], which is in common with all Latter Day Saint movement churches; (2) a pioneer era under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] and his 19th-century successors; and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century as [[Utah]] achieved statehood.

===Beginnings===
[[File:Joseph Smith first vision stained glass.jpg|upright|thumb|Adherents believe that [[Joseph Smith]] was called to be a modern-day prophet through, among other events, a [[First Vision|visitation]] from [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].]]
{{See also|History of the Latter Day Saint movement|Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)}}
The LDS Church, originally called the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], was formally organized by [[Joseph Smith]] on April 6, 1830, in [[burned-over district|western New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholars and eyewitnesses disagree whether the church was organized in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]] at the Smith log home, or in [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the home of [[Peter Whitmer]]. {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=109}}; {{Harvnb|Marquardt|2005|pp=223–23}} (arguing that organization in Manchester is most consistent with eye-witness statements). The LDS Church officially favors organization in Fayette.{{Citation |last= Lloyd |first= R.

Smith intended to establish the [[New Jerusalem]] in North America, called ''[[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=122}}; LDS {{lds|D&amp;C|dc|57|1|3}}: "the city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at [Jackson County, Missouri], even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, the church moved to [[Kirtland, Ohio]] (the eastern boundary of Zion),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=97}} (citing letter by Smith to Kirtland converts, quoted in {{Harvnb|Howe|1833|p=111}}). In 1834, Smith designated Kirtland as one of the "[[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]]" of Zion, referring to the tent–stakes metaphor of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] {{lds||isa|54|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and began establishing an outpost in [[Jackson County, Missouri]] (Zion's "center place"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=154}}; {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=162}}; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where he planned to eventually move the church headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Smith said in 1831 that God intended the Mormons to "retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years". ([[Doctrine and Covenants]] {{lds||dc|64|21}}).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1833, Missouri settlers brutally expelled the Latter Day Saints from Jackson County,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=222–27}}; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=137}} (noting that the brutality of the Jackson Countians aroused sympathy for the Mormons and was almost universally deplored by the media).&lt;/ref&gt; and the church was unable via a [[Zion's Camp|paramilitary expedition]] to recover the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|pp=141, 146–59}}; {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the church flourished in Kirtland&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=101}}; {{Harvnb|Arrington|1992|p=21}} (by summer of 1835, there were 1500 to 2000 Saints in Kirtland); ''Desert Morning News 2008 Church Almanac'' p. 655 (from 1831 to 1838, church membership grew from 680 to 17,881).&lt;/ref&gt; as Smith published new revelations and the church built the [[Kirtland Temple]], culminating in a dedication of the building similar to the day of [[Pentecost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=310–19}}; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kirtland era ended in 1838, after a [[Kirtland Safety Society|financial scandal]] rocked the church and caused widespread defections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=328–38}}; {{Harvnb|Brooke|1994|p=221}} ("Ultimately, the rituals and visions dedicating the Kirtland temple were not sufficient to hold the church together in the face of a mounting series of internal disputes.")&lt;/ref&gt; Smith regrouped with the remaining church in [[Far West, Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1905|p=24}} (referring to the Far West church as the "church in Zion"); {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=345}} (The revelation calling Far West "Zion" had the effect of "implying that Far West was to take the place of Independence".)&lt;/ref&gt; but tensions soon escalated into [[Mormon War (1838)|violent conflicts]] with the old Missouri settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=357–364}}; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|pp=227–30}}; {{Harvnb|Remini|2002|p=134}}; {{Harvnb|Quinn|1994|pp=97–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Believing the Saints to be in insurrection, the [[Lilburn Boggs|Missouri governor]] ordered that the Saints be [[Missouri Executive Order 44|"exterminated or driven from the State]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=367}} (Boggs' executive order stated that the Mormon community had "made war upon the people of this State" and that "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace").

On June 27, 1844, Smith and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were [[Death of Joseph Smith|murdered by a mob]] in [[Carthage, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Latter-Day Saint History'' p. 824; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|pp=393–94}}; {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while being held on charges of treason.&lt;ref&gt;Many local Illinoisans were uneasy with Mormon power, and their unease was fanned by the local media after Smith suppressed a newspaper containing an exposé regarding plural marriage, theocracy, and other sensitive and oft-misinterpreted issues. The suppression resulted in Smith being arrested, tried, and acquitted for "inciting a riot". On June 25, Joseph let himself be arrested and tried for the riot charges again, this time in Carthage, the county seat, where he was incarcerated without bail on a new charge of treason. {{citation |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4208 |contribution= Smith, Joseph: Legal Trials of Joseph Smith |first= Joseph I. |last= Bentley |pages= 1346–1348 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

===Pioneer era===
[[File:BrighamYoung1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brigham Young]] led the LDS Church from 1844 until his death in 1877.]]
For two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents.

Young incorporated the LDS Church as a legal entity, and initially governed both the church and the state as a [[theocracy|theocratic]] leader. He also publicized the practice of [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;The Mormon doctrine of plural wives was officially announced by one of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Twelve Apostles]] [[Orson Pratt]] and Smith's successor [[Brigham Young]] in a special conference of the elders of the church assembled in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]] on August 28, 1852, and reprinted in an extra edition of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' Only a small percentage of church leaders participated in plural marriage believing it was a part of a restitution of ancient Priesthood blessings and a commandment of god to raise up a righteous generation. At the time, it was not barred by statute within the United States.{{Cite news | title = Minutes of conference: a special conference of the elders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints assembled in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, August 28th, 1852, 10 o'clock, a.m., pursuant to public notice | work = [[Deseret News|Deseret News Extra]] | date = September 14, 1852 | page = 14}}.

By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Young.&lt;ref&gt;See Tullidge, Edward, ''History of Salt Lake City'', 132-35 (Original from the University of Michigan, 1886).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Utah War|Utah Mormon War]] ensued from 1857 to 1858, which resulted in the relatively peaceful&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The most notable instance of violence during this war was the tragic [[Mountain Meadows massacre]], in which leaders of a local Mormon militia, contrary to top church leaders orders, ordered the massacre of a civilian emigrant party who had the misfortune of traveling through Utah during the escalating military tensions. The Mormons feared the mobs which murdered their families at the Haun's mill massacre and other illegal thefts of land, and murders which had plagued them back east.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To combat the notion that rank-and-file Mormons were unhappy under Young's leadership, Cumming noted that he had offered to help any leave the territory who desired. Of the 50,000 inhabitants of the territory of Utah, the underwhelming response—56 men, 33 women, and 71 children, most of whom stated they left for economic reasons—impressed Cumming, as did the fact that Mormon leaders contributed supplies to the emigrants.

At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other church presidents, who resisted efforts by the [[United States Congress]] to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', decreed that "religious duty" to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Official Declaration —|od|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart or damaged, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a "[[Second Manifesto]]", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today actively distances itself from "[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]" groups still practicing polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |quote= If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose.

A number of official changes have taken place to the organization during the modern era. One significant change was the ordination of men of black African descent to the priesthood in 1978, which reversed [[Black people and Mormonism|a policy]] originally instituted by Brigham Young in 1852.&lt;ref name = "Bush 1984 p70"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=445 |chapter= Mormonism's Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview |last= Bush |first= Lester E., Jr. |year= 1984 |editor1-last= Bush |editor1-first= Lester E., Jr. |editor2-last= Mauss |editor2-first= Armand L. |editor2-link= Armand L.

For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].

==Teachings and practices==

===Authorized texts===
[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[standard works]]''.]]
The theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the "[[standard works]]". Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be "Another Testament of Jesus Christ" that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as "the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= [[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]] |volume= 4 |page= 461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be "the word of God as far as it is translated correctly."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: "We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly."&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.

Another source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The church teaches that the First Presidency (the church's president and his counselors) and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets&lt;ref name="oct12_conference"&gt;{{Citation |title= The Sustaining of Church Officers |first= Henry B. |last= Eyring |authorlink= Henry B.

===Distinctive doctrines and practices===
{{Main|Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
[[File:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|upright|A couple after their [[Celestial marriage|marriage]] in the [[Manti Utah Temple]]]]
Several doctrines and practices of the LDS Church are peculiar within Christianity. For example, the [[Mormon cosmology]] and [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] include the doctrines of a [[pre-mortal life]], [[Degrees of Glory|three degrees of heaven]], and [[Exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]]. According to these doctrines, every human spirit is a literal child of a [[God the Father|Heavenly Father]], and each has the potential to continue to learn, grow, and progress in the eternities, eventually achieving eternal life (which Latter-day Saints view as distinct from [[immortality]]), which is to become one with God in the same way that [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is one with the Father, thus allowing the children of God to become divine beings or "gods" themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51254902|title=The Divinization of the Christian according to the Greek Fathers|last=Gross|first=Jules|last2=|date=2002|publisher=A &amp; C Press|year=|isbn=0736316000|edition= 1st|location=Anaheim, Calif.|page=|pages=|translator-last=Onica|translator-first=Paul|trans-title=|trans-chapter=|oclc=51254902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.i.html|title=Irenaeus: Against Heresies|last=Irenaeus|first=|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 5, Preface|trans-chapter=|author-link=Irenaeus}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view on the doctrine of [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]] is also referred to as becoming a "joint-heir with Christ."&lt;ref name="EoM Godhood"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Carter |first= K.

This latter ordinance, known as a [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealing]] ceremony, reflects a singular LDS view with respect to families. According to LDS Church theology, men and women may be "sealed" to one another so that their marital bond continues into the eternities.&lt;ref&gt;A man may be sealed to more than one wife if his previous wives are either dead or legally divorced from him; a living woman, however, may only be sealed to one husband. See {{Citation | author=LDS Church | title=[[Church Handbook of Instructions]] | year=2006 | place=Salt Lake City, Utah | publisher=LDS Church | page=85}}. Thus, there is a common view within the LDS Church that though prohibited by the LDS Church in mortality, [[plural marriage]] will exist in the afterlife. See, e.g., {{Citation | last=Penrose | first=Charles W. | author-link=Charles W. Penrose | title=Mormon Doctrine Plain and Simple, or Leaves from the Tree of Life | page=66 | year=1897 | publication-place=Salt Lake City, UT}} ("In the case of a man marrying a wife in the everlasting covenant who dies while he continues in the flesh and marries another by the same divine law, each wife will come forth in her order and enter with him into his glory."); {{Citation | editor1-last=McConkie | editor1-first=Bruce R. | editor1-link=Bruce R.

The church teaches that all will have the opportunity to hear and accept or reject the gospel of Jesus Christ and the blessings that come to those who faithfully adhere to it, in this life or the next.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Ordinances such as baptisms for the dead, sealings, and [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowments]] are performed in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] that are built and dedicated specifically for these purposes.

The LDS faithful observe a health code called the "[[Word of Wisdom]]," in which they abstain from the consumption of alcohol, coffee, tea, and tobacco.&lt;ref name = wordofwisdom/&gt; The Word of Wisdom also encourages the use of wholesome herbs and fruits within season, moderate consumption of meat, and consumption of grains.&lt;ref name = wordofwisdom&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] {{lds||dc|89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latter-day Saints follow a [[moral code]], called the "[[law of chastity]]," which prohibits [[adultery]], all homosexual behavior, and any sexual relations outside of marriage.

LDS faithful donate a ten-percent [[Tithing (Latter Day Saints)|tithe]] on their annual income, for the operations of the church, including construction of temples, meetinghouses, and other buildings, and other church uses.&lt;ref name = tithe&gt;{{citation |title= Gospel Topics: Tithing |url= //www.lds.org/topics/tithing |work= lds.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faithful members also abstain from food and drink ([[fasting]]) on the [[Fast Sunday|first Sunday of each month]] for at least two consecutive meals, prayerfully dedicating the fast to a purpose of each individual's choosing. They donate at least the cost of the two skipped meals as a [[fast offering]], which the church uses to assist the poor and needy and expand its [[LDS Humanitarian Services|humanitarian efforts]].&lt;ref name = fastoffering&gt;{{citation |title= Gospel Topics: Fasting and Fast Offerings |url= //www.lds.org/topics/fasting-and-fast-offerings |work= lds.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members are further instructed to set aside one night a week, typically Monday, for a "[[Family Home Evening]]," where they gather as a family to study gospel principles and participate in wholesome activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/activities|title=Activities - Monday Nights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lds.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Missionary service====
[[File:MISSIONNAIRES MORMONS.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Missionary (LDS Church)|Missionaries]] typically commit to 18–24 months of full-time service.]]
{{main|Missionary (LDS Church)}}
All LDS young men are expected to serve a two-year, full-time proselytizing mission.&lt;ref&gt;In 1974, church president [[Spencer W. Kimball]] said that "every male member of the Church should fill a mission". {{citation |last= Kimball |first= Spencer W. |title= Planning for a Full and Abundant Life |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= May 1974 |page= 86 |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/1974/05/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life |authorlink= Spencer W. Kimball |quote= The question is asked: Should every young man fill a mission? And the answer of the Church is yes, and the answer of the Lord is yes. Enlarging this answer we say: Certainly every male member of the Church should fill a mission, like he should pay his tithing, like he should attend his meetings, like he should keep his life clean and free from the ugliness of the world and plan a celestial marriage in the temple of the Lord. While there is no compulsion for him to do any of these things, he should do them for his own good.}}. The church's current president, [[Thomas S. Monson]], stated in 2012 that "missionary work is a priesthood duty" and encouraged "all young men who are worthy and who are physically able and mentally capable to respond to the call to serve."{{citation |last= Monson |first= Thomas S. |title= Welcome to Conference |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/2012/11/welcome-to-conference |authorlink= Thomas S. Monson |date= November 2012 |journal= Ensign |quote= We affirm that missionary work is a priesthood duty—and we encourage all young men who are worthy and who are physically able and mentally capable to respond to the call to serve. Many young women also serve, but they are not under the same mandate to serve as are the young men. We assure the young sisters of the Church, however, that they make a valuable contribution as missionaries, and we welcome their service.}} In the church's October 2002 general conference, [[M. Russell Ballard]], of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], stated that local leaders recommend for full-time missions "only those young men ... whom you judge to be spiritually, physically, mentally, and emotionally prepared to face today's realities of missionary work"; he added that "not every young man needs to be called to serve away from his home; some may best serve under your direction as ward missionaries." {{citation |quote= Upon you bishops and you stake presidents rests the responsibility to recommend only those young men and women whom you judge to be spiritually, physically, mentally, and emotionally prepared to face today's realities of missionary work.

Russell Ballard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missionaries do not choose where they serve or the language in which they will proselytize, and are expected to fund their missions themselves or with the aid of their families. Prospective male missionaries must be at least 18 years old and no older than 25, not yet married, have completed secondary school, and meet certain criteria for physical fitness and spiritual worthiness. Missionary service is not compulsory, nor is it required for young men to retain their church membership. Unmarried women 19 years and older may also serve as missionaries, generally for a term of 18 months. However, the LDS Church emphasizes that women are not under the same expectation to serve as male members are, and may serve solely as a personal decision. There is no maximum age for missionary service for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=22472472 |title= LDS Church members respond to new mission age rules |first= David Self |last= Newlin |first2= Jennifer |last2= Stagg |date= October 8, 2012 |publisher= [[KSL-TV|KSL]] |accessdate= March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to October 2012, the minimum age for full-time missionary service was generally 19 for men and 21 for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Joseph |last= Walker |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765609643/LDS-Church-lowers-age-requirement-for-missionary-service.html |title= LDS Church lowers age requirement for missionary service |newspaper= Deseret News |date= October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retired couples are encouraged to serve missions, and may serve for either 6-, 12-, 18-, or 23-month terms.&lt;ref&gt;"Missionary Policy Changes Give More Seniors Opportunity to Serve", LDS Church News Release, June 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike younger missionaries, these senior missionaries may serve in non-proselytizing capacities such as [[humanitarian aid]] workers or [[family history]] specialists. Other men and women who desire to serve a mission, but may not be able to perform full-time service in another state or country due to health issues, may serve in a service mission. They might assist at Temple Square in Salt Lake City or aide in the seminary systems in schools.

===Comparisons with Christian denominations outside the Latter Day Saint movement===
{{See also|Mormonism and Christianity}}
The LDS Church shares various teachings with other branches of Christianity. These include a belief in the Bible (subject to an acknowledgement that it is imperfect),&lt;ref&gt;Adherents believe in the Bible "as far as it is translated correctly": see {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}. Additionally, Joseph Smith taught that the [[Song of Songs|Songs of Solomon]] "are not inspired writings".&lt;/ref&gt; the divinity of Jesus, and his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and [[resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrection]]. LDS theology also includes belief in the doctrine of salvation through Jesus alone, [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[millennialism]], [[continuationism]], [[penal substitution]],&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon, Alma 34:8–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and a form of [[apostolic succession]]. The practices of [[baptism#Submersion|baptism by immersion]] and the [[eucharist]] (referred to as ''the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]]'') are also held in common. However, the [[Catholic Church]] considers doctrinal differences between the two groups to be so great that it will not accept a prior LDS baptism as evidence of Christian initiation, as it will baptism by other Christian groups, such as the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm|title=The Question of the Validity of Baptism Conferred in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|author=Fr. Luis Ladaria, S.J.|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church does not accept baptisms performed in any other churches, as it teaches that baptism is only valid when it is conducted through proper priesthood authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Restoration of The Gospel in the Latter Days|url=http://mormon.org/restoration|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=Mormon.org|accessdate=July 13, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712133441/http://mormon.org/restoration/|archivedate=July 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the LDS Church differs from the many other churches within contemporary Christianity, and many people do not accept the church as part of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;For example, a 2007 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 31 percent of Americans surveyed do not consider Mormons to be Christian.{{cite web|title=Public Expresses Mixed Views of Islam, Mormonism|url=http://pewforum.org/surveys/religionviews07/|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|website=PewForum.org|date=September 25, 2007|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faith itself views other modern Christian faiths as having departed from true Christianity&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Smith | first=Joseph, Jr. | author-link=Joseph Smith | title=Church History [Wentworth Letter] | journal=[[Times and Seasons]] | volume=3 | issue=9 | pages=706–10 [707]  | date=March 1, 1842a | url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n09.htm#706}} (traditional Christian denominations "were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them was acknowledged of God as His church and kingdom"). {{Citation | last=Smith | first=Joseph, Jr. | author-link=Joseph Smith | title=History of Joseph Smith | journal=[[Times and Seasons]] | volume=3 | issue=11 | pages=748–49  | date=April 1, 1842c | url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n11.htm#748}} Stating that Jesus told Smith that all existing Christian creeds "were an abomination in his sight".&lt;/ref&gt; via a [[Great Apostasy|general apostasy]] and maintains that it is a restoration of 1st-century Christianity and the only true and authorized Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;C 1:30 (LDS Church is the "only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth").&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between the LDS Church and most of traditional Christianity include disagreement with aspects of the [[Nicene Creed]], belief in a theory of [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|human salvation]] that includes three heavens (referred to as "[[degrees of glory]]", its interpretation of I Cor. 15:35 ''et.seq.''),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Spencer W.

Officially, major Christian denominations view the LDS Church as standing apart from [[creed]]al Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Citation|url=http://www.pcusa.org/interfaith/study/lds.htm|title=Presbyterians and Latter-day Saints|accessdate=January 30, 2007}} ([[Presbyterian Church USA]], stating that "Mormonism is a new and emerging religious tradition distinct from the historic apostolic tradition of the Christian Church"); {{Citation|url=http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|title=Should Lutherans Rebaptize Former Mormons Who Are Joining the Congregation?|accessdate=August 15, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211010129/http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|archivedate=February 11, 2006|df=mdy-all}} [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], stating that LDS Church doctrine regarding the [[Trinity]] is "substantially different from that of orthodox, creedal Christianity"; {{Citation|url=http://www.gc2000.org/pets/cal/TEXT/c0806.asp|title=General Conference 2000 806-NonDis|accessdate=August 15, 2006}} ([[United Methodist Church]], stating that the LDS Church, "by self-definition, does not fit within the bounds of the historic, apostolic tradition of Christian faith").&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of the LDS Church assert that the LDS Church is the only true church and that other churches do not have the authority to act in Jesus' name.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Joseph Smith]], Jesus told him that the other churches claiming to be Christian creeds "were an abomination in the Lords sight; that those professors [of religion] were all corrupt".  ''Pearl of Great Price'', [[Joseph Smith—History]] 1:19.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of Christians who agree with creeds, the most significant area of departure is the rejection by the LDS Church of certain parts of ecumenical creeds such as the Nicene Creed, which defines the predominant view of the Christian God as a [[Trinity]] of three separate persons in "[[Homoousian|one essence]]". LDS Church theology includes the belief in a "[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]" composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead. Other significant differences relate to the church's acceptance of additional scripture, doctrine, and practices beyond what is found in the Catholic, Protestant, or [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] versions of the Bible.

===Comparison with other Latter Day Saint movement faiths===
{{See also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement}}
The LDS Church shares a common heritage with a number of smaller faith groups that are collectively called the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. The largest of these smaller groups is the [[Community of Christ]] (previously known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), based in [[Independence, Missouri]], followed by [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]], based in [[Monongahela, Pennsylvania]]. Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.

The main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith. Other branches may be considered later offshoots of the LDS Church branch, mainly due to disagreements about plural marriage.

===Name and legal entities===
{{main|Name of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The church teaches that it is a continuation of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] established in 1830 by Joseph Smith.

===Geographic distribution and membership===
{{See also|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership history|List of Latter Day Saints}}

Church congregations are organized geographically. Members are generally expected to attend the congregation with their assigned geographical area; however, some geographical areas also provide separate congregations for young single adults (between the ages of 18 and 30), single adults aged 31 to 45,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= [[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 2: Administering the Church]] |publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |contribution-url= //www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/single-members |contribution= 16. Single Members}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for speakers of alternate languages. For Sunday services, the church is grouped into either larger (~150 to ~400 people) congregations known as [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]], or smaller congregations known as branches. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a chapel, the room used as a chapel for religious services is only one component of the standard [[meetinghouse]]. The church maintains a virtual tour online of a typical example and also an online meetinghouse locator, which can be used to find the locations and meeting times of its congregations all over the world. Regional church organizations, encompassing multiple congregations, include [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]], [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]], [[District (LDS Church)|districts]], [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]], and regions.

The church reports a worldwide membership of 16&amp;nbsp;million;&lt;ref name="Statistics 2017" /&gt; This is the church's own accounting, based on membership records. The church's definition of "membership" includes all persons who were ever baptized, or whose parents were members while the person was under the age of eight called "members of record" {{Harv|LDS Church|2006|pp=145–46}}, who have neither been excommunicated nor asked to have their names removed from church records &lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|LDS Church|2006|pp=116, 148–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 8.3 million residing outside the United States, as of December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Subtracting U.S. membership of 6,144,582 (December 31, 2011) from total worldwide membership (December 31, 2011) of 14,441,346, results in 8,296,764 (rounded to 8.3 million) members outside the United States of America&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Facts and Statistics: United States |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/united-states/ |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these statistics it is the fourth largest religious body in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;2005 [[Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches]], [[National Council of Churches]]{{full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Largest U.S. Churches, 2005 |url= http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001481.html |work= Information Please Database (infoplease.com) |publisher= [[Pearson Education]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208223209/http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001481.html |archive-date= December 8, 2014 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church membership report includes all baptized members and their children.

The church continues to seek recognition in regions where it has had little or no influence. On August 30, 2010, church leaders announced that they were making significant progress on "regularized operations for the Church in China."&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-in-talks-to-regularize-activities-in-china |title= News Release: Church in Talks to "Regularize" Activities in China |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priesthood hierarchy===
{{Main|Priesthood (LDS Church)}}
[[File:Russell M. Nelson.png|right|thumb|[[Russell M. Nelson]], current President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.]]

The LDS Church is organized in a hierarchical priesthood structure administered by men. Latter-day Saints believe that [[Jesus]] leads the church through revelation and has chosen a single man, called "the Prophet" or President of the Church, as his spokesman on the earth.  While there have been exceptions in the past, he and two counselors are normally ordained [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] and form the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the presiding body of the church; twelve other apostles form the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].&lt;ref name="Haight, David B. 1986"&gt;{{citation|authorlink=David B. Haight|last=Haight|first=David B.|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1986/05/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord|title=A Prophet Chosen of the Lord|magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]|date=May 1986|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a president dies, his successor is invariably the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve (the one who has been an apostle the longest), who reconstitutes a new First Presidency.&lt;ref name="Haight, David B. 1986"/&gt; Following the death of [[Thomas S. Monson]] on January 2, 2018, senior apostle [[Russell M. Nelson]] became the presumptive successor to the church presidency; he formally was named president on January 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/leader-biographies/president-russell-m-nelson|title=President Russell M. Nelson|work=www.mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These men, and the other male members of the church-wide leadership (including the first two [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Quorums of Seventy]] and the [[Presiding Bishopric (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]]) are called [[general authority|general authorities]]. They exercise both [[ecclesiastical]] and administrative leadership over the church and direct the efforts of regional leaders down to the local level. General authorities and [[mission president]]s work full-time and typically receive stipends from church funds or investments.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, Daniel H., ''Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents'', 1948/1993, ch. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twice each year (in April and October), general authorities address the worldwide church through [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference,]] which includes five two-hour sessions over the course of two days. General conference sessions are translated into as many as 80 languages and are broadcast from the 21,000-seat Conference Center in Salt Lake City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/general-conference|title=Mormons Gather Twice a Year for General Conference|date=2011-07-14|work=www.mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to general conference, general authorities speak to church members in local congregations throughout the world; they also frequently speak to youth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/nelson?lang=eng|title=Face to Face with President and Sister Nelson|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and young adults&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults?lang=eng|title=Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in special broadcasts and at the Church Educational System schools, such as [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://speeches.byu.edu|title=BYU Devotionals, Forums, Commencement Addresses - BYU Speeches|website=BYU Speeches|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the local level, the church leadership are drawn from the laity and work on a part-time volunteer basis without stipend.&lt;ref&gt;For a time, the church had a paid local clergy; however, that practice was discontinued in the early 1900s. See [[D. Michael Quinn]] (1997), ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power,'' Salt Lake City: Signature Books, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Like all members, they are asked to donate a tithe of 10 percent of their income to the church. An exception to that rule is for LDS missionaries, who work at the local level and are paid basic living expenses from a fund that receives contributions from their families or home congregations. But, prospective missionaries are encouraged to contribute the cost of their missions to this fund themselves when possible. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.

All males who are living the standards of the church are generally considered for the [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] and are ordained to the priesthood as early as age 12. Ordination occurs by a ceremony where [[laying on of hands|hands are laid]] on the head of the one ordained. The priesthood is divided into an [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] for young men 12 and up, and a [[Melchizedek Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] for men 18 and up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Aaronic Priesthood {{!}} The Priesthood of Aaron|url = https://www.lds.org/topics/aaronic-priesthood|website = www.lds.org|accessdate = December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Melchizedek Priesthood|url = https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/melchizedek-priesthood|website = www.lds.org|accessdate = December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programs and auxiliary organizations===
{{See also|Auxiliary organization (LDS Church)}}

Under the leadership of the priesthood hierarchy are five auxiliary organizations that fill various roles in the church: [[Relief Society]] (a women's organization),&lt;ref&gt;The [[Relief Society]] was founded in 1842 in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], and with the motto "Charity Never Faileth", the organization today includes more than 5 million women in more than 165 countries. {{Citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/relief-society-history |work= MormonNewsroom.org |title= Topic: Relief Society History |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}. Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Young Men organization|Young Men]] and [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] organizations (for adolescents ages 12 to 18), [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]] (an organization for children up to age 12), and [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] (which provides a variety of Sunday classes for adolescents and adults). Women serve as presidents and counselors in the presidencies of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary, while men serve as presidents and counselors of the Young Men and Sunday School.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Organization How the Church Is Organized |url= //www.lds.org/topics/church-organization/how-the-church-is-organized |work= lds.org |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church also operates several programs and organizations in the fields of proselytizing, education, and church welfare such as [[LDS Humanitarian Services]]. Many of these auxiliaries and programs are coordinated by the [[Priesthood Correlation Program]], which is designed to provide a systematic approach to maintain worldwide consistency, orthodoxy, and control of the church's ordinances, doctrines, organizations, meetings, materials, and other programs and activities.

[[File:BYUclarillon.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Brigham Young University Centennial Carillon Tower|carillon tower]] at [[Brigham Young University]], one of several educational institutions sponsored by the church]]

The church operates a [[Church Educational System]] which includes [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) (and its associated [[Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center|Jerusalem Center]]), [[Brigham Young University–Idaho|BYU–Idaho]], [[Brigham Young University–Hawaii|BYU–Hawaii]], and [[LDS Business College]]. The church also operates [[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]] near the campuses of many colleges and universities. For high-school aged youth, the church operates a four-year [[LDS Seminary|Seminary program]], which provides religious classes for students to supplement their secular education. The church also sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the [[Perpetual Education Fund]], which provides educational opportunities to students from [[developing nations]].&lt;ref name="MormonNewsroom.org Education"&gt;{{citation |publisher= LDS Church |title= Topic: Education |work= MormonNewsroom.org |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/education |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LDS genealogy library slc utah.jpg|thumb|right|The church's [[Family History Library]] is the world's largest library dedicated to [[genealogy|genealogical research]]]]
The church's welfare system, initiated during the [[Great Depression]], provides aid to the poor. It is financed by [[fast offering]]s: monthly donations beyond the normal 10 percent tithe, which represents the cost of forgoing two meals on monthly [[Fast Sunday]]s. Money from the program is used to operate [[Bishop's storehouse]]s, which package and store food at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]]. The church also distributes money through its [[LDS Philanthropies]] division to disaster victims worldwide.

Other church programs and departments include [[LDS Family Services]], which provides assistance with [[adoption]], [[relationship counseling|marital and family counseling]], [[psychotherapy]], and [[intervention (counseling)|addiction counseling]]; the LDS Church History Department, which collects church history and records; and the Family History Department, which administers the church's large [[family history]] efforts, including the world's largest [[Family History Library|family history library]] and organization ([[FamilySearch]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.intl-research.com/overview.htm |title=AAG International Research |author=AAG International Research |publisher=AAG |accessdate=October 31, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212071828/http://www.intl-research.com/overview.htm |archive-date=December 12, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For over 100 years, the church has also a major sponsor of [[Scouting]] programs for boys, particularly in the United States, where it provides more members of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) than any other church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Boy Scouts of America Membership Report&amp;nbsp;– 2007 |date=January 7, 2008 |url=http://www.praypub.org/pdf_docs/BSA_Membership_Report_2007.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=P.R.A.Y. |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528182132/http://www.praypub.org/pdf_docs/BSA_Membership_Report_2007.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2018, the church announced it will no longer sponsor BSA programs, effective the end of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/new-program-children-youth|title= Church Announces Plan for Worldwide Initiative for Children and Youth |work= Newsroom |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |date= May 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church receives significant funds from [[tithe]]s and [[fast offering]]s. According to the church, tithing and fast offering money collected are devoted to ecclesiastical purposes and not used in for-profit ventures.

The church has also invested in for-profit business and real estate ventures such as [[Bonneville International]], [[Deseret Book Company]], [[City Creek Center]], and cattle ranches in Utah, Florida, Nebraska, Canada and other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Caroline|title=How the Mormons Make Money|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-07-10/how-the-mormons-make-money|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that the LDS Church received $33-billion in donations from its members in 2010 and, during the decade of the 2010s to net about $15-billion gains per year. According to [[Bloomberg Businessweek]], the LDS Church's worth at $40 billion as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher |first=Peggy |url=http://www.sltrib.com/religion/local/2017/10/14/historian-digs-into-the-hidden-world-of-mormon-finances-shows-how-church-went-from-losing-money-to-making-money-lots-of-it/ |title=Historian digs into the hidden world of Mormon finances, shows how church went from losing money to making money — lots of it - The Salt Lake Tribune |publisher=Sltrib.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, members of the church have developed a distinct culture. It is primarily concentrated in the [[Intermountain West]]. Many of the church's more distinctive practices include adhering to the Word of Wisdom, a health law or code which outlines guidelines for maintaining good health. Among these guidelines are instructions prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, tea, and improper drug use.&lt;ref name = wordofwisdom/&gt; As a result of members adhering to the Word of Wisdom, areas of the world with a high concentration of LDS members practice these restrictions. They sometimes come into conflict with local retail businesses that serve non-members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |author= Editorial Board |url= http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619 |title= Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse |date= December 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/living-well-usn/2008/12/15/americas-10-fittest-citiesand-10-least-fit-too.html |title=America's 10 Fittest Cities—and 10 Least Fit, Too |author= Megan Johnson |date=December 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of Latter-day Saint culture.

===Media and arts===
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for independent LDS media. Such communities include [[LDS cinema|cinema]], [[LDS fiction|fiction]], websites, and graphical art such as photography and paintings. The church owns a chain of bookstores called [[Deseret Book]], which provide a channel through which publications are sold. Titles including ''[[The Work and the Glory]]'' and ''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' have found acceptance both within and outside the church; [[BYU TV]], the church-sponsored television station, also airs on several networks. The church also produces [[List of pageants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|six pageants]] annually depicting various events of the primitive and modern-day church. Its [[Mesa Arizona Easter Pageant|Easter pageant ''Jesus the Christ'']] has been identified as the "largest annual outdoor Easter pageant in the world."&lt;ref name="EVT"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/86475 |title=Mesa Mormon temple prepares for Easter pageant |work=[[East Valley Tribune]] |date=March 24, 2007 |first=Lawn |last=Griffiths |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911150555/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/86475 |archivedate=September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home and family===
In 1995, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and [[Quorum of the Twelve (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]] issued "[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]," which stresses the importance of the family. The proclamation states that "[[Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|marriage]] between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the eternal destiny of His children." The document further says that "gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose," that the father and mother have differing but equal roles in raising children, and that successful marriages and families, founded upon the teachings of Jesus Christ, can last eternally.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation |title= The Family: A Proclamation to the World |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1995}}. See also: [[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]&lt;/ref&gt; This document is widely cited by LDS members as a statement of principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Douglas E. |last= Brinley |title= Together forever: Gospel perspectives for marriage and family |page= 48 |isbn= 1-57008-540-4 |place= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= Bookcraft |year= 1998 |oclc= 40185703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adult women (members of the church's [[Relief Society]]) in a congregation meet at least quarterly for additional instruction and service. The meetings may consist of a service project, conferences, or of various classes being offered.

After interviewing and polling thousands of youth across America, evangelical statistician Christian Smith writes, "in general comparisons among major U.S. religious traditions using a variety of sociological measures of religious vitality and salience .... it is Mormon teenagers who are sociologically faring the best."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1= Christian |last1= Smith |first2= Melinda Lundquist |last2= Denton |title= Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers |page= 261 |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2005 |isbn= 019518095X |oclc= 55947930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social events and gatherings===
[[File:Usapride (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|As part of its [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men program]], the church contributes more members to the [[Boy Scouts of America]] than any other [[Boy Scouts of America#Chartered organizations and units|chartered organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/1982/11/run-boy-run |title= Run, Boy, Run! |authorlink= Thomas S. Monson |first= Thomas S. |last= Monson |date= November 1982 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Additional meetings are also frequently held at the meetinghouse. Auxiliary officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. The church's [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]] and [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] organizations meet at the meetinghouse once a week, where the youth participate in activities and work on [[Duty to God Award|Duty to God]], [[Boy Scouts of America|Scouting]], or [[Personal Progress]]. Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances, and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve meetinghouses at no cost for weddings, receptions, and funerals.

In the summer, the LDS Church promotes week-long seminars throughout North America, known as Especially for Youth (EFY). This program is held Monday through Saturday during the summer months for youth ages 14–18. During this week, youths often spend the night in college campus dorms and the day in various classes taught by adult religious educators, as well as participating in other various activities such as scripture study and dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Craig|first1=Chanelle|title=Especially For Youth|url=http://ldsefy.weebly.com|publisher=Chanelle Craig|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political involvement===
{{Main|LDS Church and politics in the United States}}

The LDS Church takes no partisan role in politics, stating that it will not "endorse, promote or oppose political parties, candidates or platforms; allow its church buildings, membership lists or other resources to be used for partisan political purposes; attempt to direct its members as to which candidate or party they should give their votes to ... or attempt to direct or dictate to a government leader."&lt;ref name="PN"&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-reemphasizes-political-neutrality |title= News Story: Church Reemphasizes Political Neutrality |date= December 6, 2007 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the church takes an apolitical approach to candidates, it encourages its members to play an active role as responsible citizens in their communities, including becoming informed about issues and voting in elections. It actively works to counter anti-Mormonism that may come up during political campaigns. A 2012 [[Pew Center]] on Religion and Public Life survey indicates that 74 percent of U.S. members lean towards the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/pew-survey-most-mormons-feel-they-are-misunderstood-not-viewed-as-mainstream/|title=Majority of Mormons Lean Republican; Half Cite Discrimination Against Their Faith|date=January 12, 2012|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some liberal members say they feel that they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/30/mormon-liberals-minority/1669155/|title=Liberal Mormons: A Minority Within a Minority|date=October 30, 2012|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the 2012 U.S Republican Presidential Primary, [[Michael Otterson]], the LDS Church's managing director for public affairs stated, "We now have two Latter-day Saints running, and the potential for misunderstanding or missteps is therefore twice what it was before."&lt;ref name=wsj20110803&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisman|first=Jonathan|title=Mormons Duck Political Duel|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=August 3, 2011|pages=A1, A6|url=http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904772304576470442390289196.html?mod=WSJ_WSJ_US_News_5&amp;mg=reno-wsj}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official church stance on staying out of politics does not include if there are instances of what church leaders deem to be moral issues. It has previously opposed same-sex marriage in [[California Proposition 8 (2008)#Religious organizations|California Prop 8]], supported a gay rights bill in Salt Lake City which bans discrimination against homosexual persons in housing and employment,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/us/12utah.html |title= Mormon Support of Gay Rights Statute Draws Praise |newspaper= The New York Times |date= November 11, 2009 |first= Kirk |last= Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/statement-given-to-salt-lake-city-council-on-nondiscrimination-ordinances |title= News Story: Statement Given to Salt Lake City Council on Nondiscrimination Ordinances |date= January 1, 2009 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposed gambling, opposed storage of nuclear waste in Utah,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/635205027/No-to-nuclear-storage-LDS-say.html?pg=all |title= No to nuclear storage, LDS say |date= May 5, 2006 |publisher= Deseret News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/ci_3787890 |title= LDS joins N-storage foes |date= May 5, 2006 |publisher= The Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and supported the [[Utah Compact]].

[[Jack Gerard|Jack N.

The LDS Church stresses the importance of worldwide [[humanitarianism|humanitarian service]].&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mormons: Humanitarian Programs|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/themes/humanitarian.html|work=American Experience website|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=philanthropy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riley|first=Naomi Schaefer|title=A Welfare System That Works|url= http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/a_welfare_system_that_works |journal=Philanthropy|date=Fall 2012|publisher=[[Philanthropy Roundtable]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church's welfare and humanitarian efforts are coordinated by [[LDS Philanthropies]] (LDSP), a church department under the direction of the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]]. Welfare efforts, originally initiated during the [[Great Depression]], provide aid for the poor, financed by donations from church members. LDSP is also responsible for philanthropic donations to the LDS Church and other affiliated charities, such as the [[Church History Library]], the [[Church Educational System]]—which includes [[Brigham Young University]], the [[Perpetual Education Fund]], and the [[Polynesian Cultural Center]]—the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]], and efforts dedicated to providing funds for [[missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]] and [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ldsphilanthropies.org/ |title= LDS Philanthropies: Helping Change and Save Lives |publisher= [[LDS Philanthropies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=March 2014}} Donations are also used to operate [[bishop's storehouse]]s, which package and store food for the poor at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local [[Bishop (LDS Church)|bishops]]. These local storehouses distribute commodities to the needy as requested by local bishops on a specified form. Bishop's storehouses also provide service opportunities for those receiving assistance and for those desiring to serve missions or to volunteer in the church's welfare program. The day-to-day operations of the storehouses are typically run by senior-aged missionaries as store managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://apps.lds.org/welfareoperations/overview.jsf?operation=bishops.storehouses |contribution= Overview of Bishops' Storehouses |title= Welfare Operations Training |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church also distributes money through its [[LDS Humanitarian Services|Humanitarian Services]] division to natural disaster victims worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/annual-report-highlights-church-emergency-relief |title= News Story: Annual Report Highlights Church Emergency Relief |date= March 9, 2011 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church's Humanitarian Center, established in 1991, prepares emergency relief supplies for worldwide shipment to disaster victims, works to establish a global sense of self-reliance, and offers service opportunities to both church members and non-members. The emergency relief supplies that the church donates typically include clothing, personal care kits, and medical supplies. According to the LDS Humanitarian Center website, it ships about 12 million pounds of shoes and clothing, one million hygiene kits, and one million pounds of medical supplies per year, to relieve suffering in more than 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/topics/humanitarian-service/center?lang=eng |title= Humanitarian Services: Latter-day Saint Humanitarian Center |work= lds.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a disaster strikes, the church works with local government officials and other organizations to determine the immediate needs, and sends the necessary supplies and food to the affected area within hours. Missionaries are then sent to help alleviate other long-term damages by assisting injured persons and reconstructing damaged buildings. The church carries out these efforts without regard to the nationality or religion of the recipients, and 100 percent of the financial contributions donated to the church by members and non-members are used for humanitarian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/humanitarian-services |title= Topic: Humanitarian Services |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The LDS Church has been subject to criticism and sometimes [[Anti-Mormonism|discrimination]] since its early years in New York and [[Pennsylvania]]. In the late&amp;nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.

In the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.

As the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.

Academic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.

[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. It also criticizes what it considers{{Weasel inline|date=October 2018}} to be a lack of honesty&lt;!--what does this mean?  --&gt; when it comes to the scholarship of non-Mormon critics.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists within the church.

During the [[civil rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the LDS Church was criticized for its [[Blacks and Mormonism|policy of excluding black men of African descent]] from the priesthood, a policy that the church changed in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Out of Obscurity: Mormonism Since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199358222|pages=132–137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;

 }} – In the contemporary record as noted by Conway, Paine's birth date is given as January 29, 1736–37. Common practice was to use a dash or a slash to separate the old-style year from the new-style year. In the old calendar, the new year began on March 25, not January 1. Paine's birth date, therefore, would have been before New Year, 1737. In the new style, his birth date advances by eleven days and his year increases by one to February 9, 1737. The [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] link gives more detail if needed.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--As consensus since February 20, 2010 see talk page--&gt; – June 8, 1809) was an English-born American political activist, philosopher, political theorist and revolutionary. One of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], he authored the two most influential pamphlets at the start of the [[American Revolution]] and inspired the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] in 1776 to declare independence from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=America's History, Volume 1: To 1877|last=Henretta|first=James A.|year=2011|publisher= Macmillan|display-authors=etal|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PmY3sBubw8C&amp;pg=PA165|isbn=9780312387914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas reflected [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment-era]] ideals of transnational human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Jason D. Solinger. "Thomas Paine's Continental Mind." ''Early American Literature'' (2010) 45#3, Vol. 45 Issue 3, pp. 593–617&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul K. Padover]] described him as "a [[corsetmaker]] by trade, a journalist by profession, and a propagandist by inclination".&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul K. Padover]], ''Jefferson: A Great American's Life and Ideas'', (1952), pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Thetford]] in the English county of [[Norfolk]], Paine migrated to the British American colonies in 1774 with the help of [[Benjamin Franklin]], arriving just in time to participate in the American Revolution. Virtually every rebel read (or listened to a reading of) his powerful pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776), proportionally the all-time best-selling&lt;ref name=Hitchens /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biographer Harvey Kaye writes, "Within just a few months 150,000 copies of one or another edition were distributed in America alone. The equivalent sales today would be fifteen million, making it, proportionally, the nation's greatest best-seller ever." in {{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine And The Promise of America|author=Kaye, Harvey J.|author-link=Harvey J. Kaye|year=2005|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|page=43|isbn=0-8090-9344-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; American title, which crystallized the rebellious demand for independence from Great Britain. His ''[[The American Crisis]]'' (1776–1783) was a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series. ''Common Sense'' was so influential that [[John Adams]] said: "Without the pen of the author of ''Common Sense'', the sword of Washington would have been raised in vain".&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/16/061016crbo_books The Sharpened Quill], ''The New Yorker''; accessed November 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine lived in France for most of the 1790s, becoming deeply involved in the [[French Revolution]]. He wrote ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791), in part a defense of the French Revolution against its critics. His attacks on Irish [[Conservatism|conservative]] writer [[Edmund Burke]] led to [[Trial of Thomas Paine|a trial and conviction]] [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] in England in 1792 for the crime of [[seditious libel]].

The British government of [[William Pitt the Younger]], worried by the possibility that the French Revolution might spread to England, had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. Paine's work, which advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government, was duly targeted, with a [[writ]] for his arrest issued in early 1792. Paine fled to France in September where, rather immediately and despite not being able to speak French, he was elected to the French [[National Convention]]. The [[Girondist]]s regarded him as an ally. Consequently, the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]], especially [[Maximilien Robespierre]], regarded him as an enemy.

In December 1793, he was arrested and was taken to Luxembourg Prison in Paris. While in prison, he continued to work on ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1793–1794). Future President [[James Monroe]] used his diplomatic connections to get Paine released in November 1794. He became notorious because of his pamphlets ''The Age of Reason'', in which he advocated [[deism]], promoted reason and free thought and argued against institutionalized religion in general and Christian doctrine in particular. He published the pamphlet ''[[Agrarian Justice]]'' (1797), discussing the origins of [[property]] and introduced the concept of a [[guaranteed minimum income]]. In 1802, he returned to the U.S. where he died on June 8, 1809. Only six people attended his funeral as he had been ostracized for his ridicule of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Conway2"&gt;[[Moncure D.

Thomas Paine was born on January 29, 1736 {{small|([[New Style|NS]] February 9, 1737&lt;!--As consensus since February 20, 2010 see talk page--&gt;),&lt;ref group="Note" name="Conway group=Note" /&gt; }} the son of Joseph and Frances ({{nee|Cocke}}) Pain, in [[Thetford]], [[Norfolk]], England.

[[File:Old School at Thetford Grammar.jpg|thumb|Old School at [[Thetford Grammar School]], where Paine was educated]]
He attended [[Thetford Grammar School]] (1744–1749), at a time when there was no compulsory education.&lt;ref name=Thetford&gt;[http://www.thetgram.norfolk.sch.uk/History.htm School History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205004955/http://www.thetgram.norfolk.sch.uk/History.htm|date=December 5, 2010}} Thetford Grammar School; accessed January 3, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 13, he was apprenticed to his stay-maker father.

A connection to shipping and the sea explains why, in late adolescence, Thomas enlisted and briefly served as a [[privateer]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rights of Man II'', Chapter V.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas had intended to serve under the ill-fated Captain [[William Death]] but was dissuaded by his father.

On September 27, 1759, Thomas Paine married Mary Lambert. His business collapsed soon after. Mary became pregnant; and, after they moved to [[Margate]], she went into early labor, in which she and their child died.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In July 1761, Paine returned to Thetford to work as a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] officer. In December 1762, he became an [[HM Customs and Excise|Excise Officer]] in [[Grantham]], Lincolnshire; in August 1764, he was transferred to [[Alford, Lincolnshire|Alford]], also in Lincolnshire, at a salary of £50 per annum. On August 27, 1765, he was dismissed as an Excise Officer for "claiming to have inspected goods he did not inspect". On July 31, 1766, he requested his reinstatement from the Board of Excise, which they granted the next day, upon vacancy. While awaiting that, he worked as a stay-maker. Again, he was making stay ropes for shipping, not stays for corsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 1767, he was appointed to a position in [[Grampound]], Cornwall. Later he asked to leave this post to await a vacancy, and he became a schoolteacher in London.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On February 19, 1768, he was appointed to [[Lewes]] in [[Sussex]], a town with a tradition of opposition to the monarchy and pro-republican sentiments since the revolutionary decades of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="TP-FR36"&gt;{{Cite book

Paine first became involved in civic matters when he was based in Lewes. He appears in the Town Book as a member of the Court Leet, the governing body for the town. He was also a member of the parish [[Administrative vestry|vestry]], an influential local church group whose responsibilities for parish business would include collecting taxes and tithes to distribute among the poor. On March 26, 1771, at age 34, he married Elizabeth Ollive, his landlord's daughter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
[[File:White Hart Paine plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque at the White Hart Hotel, [[Lewes]], East Sussex, south east England]]

From 1772 to 1773, Paine joined excise officers asking Parliament for better pay and working conditions, publishing, in summer of 1772, ''The Case of the Officers of Excise'', a 12-page article, and his first political work, spending the London winter distributing the 4,000 copies printed to the Parliament and others. In spring 1774, he was again dismissed from the excise service for being absent from his post without permission; his tobacco shop failed, too. On April 14, to avoid [[debtors' prison]], he sold his household possessions to pay debts. On June 4, 1774, he formally separated from his wife Elizabeth and moved to London, where, in September, mathematician, Fellow of the Royal Society, and Commissioner of the Excise [[George Lewis Scott]] introduced him to [[Benjamin Franklin]],&lt;ref&gt;"Letter to the Honorable Henry Laurens" in Philip S. Foner's ''The Complete Writings of Thomas Paine'' (New York: Citadel Press, 1945), 2:1160–65.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested emigration to British colonial America, and gave him a letter of recommendation. In October, Paine emigrated to the American colonies, arriving in [[Philadelphia]] on November 30, 1774.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Paine|title=Thomas Paine {{!}} British-American author|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=September 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pennsylvania Magazine''===
Paine barely survived the transatlantic voyage. The ship's water supplies were bad and [[typhoid fever]] killed five passengers. On arriving at Philadelphia, he was too sick to disembark. Benjamin Franklin's physician, there to welcome Paine to America, had him carried off ship; Paine took six weeks to recover. He became a citizen of Pennsylvania "by taking the oath of allegiance at a very early period".&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Moncure Daniel, 1892. ''The Life of Thomas Paine'' vol. 1, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1775, he became editor of the ''Pennsylvania Magazine'', a position he conducted with considerable ability.&lt;ref name="larkin3140"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larkin |first1=Edward |title=Thomas Paine and the Literature of Revolution |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=31–40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5z2iRUemxMC&amp;dq |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Paine's arrival in America, sixteen magazines had been founded in the colonies and ultimately failed, each featuring substantial content and reprints from England. In late 1774, Philadelphia printer [[Robert Aitken (publisher)|Robert Aitken]] announced his plan to create what he called an "American Magazine" with content derived from the colonies.&lt;ref name="larkin3140" /&gt; Paine contributed two pieces to the magazine's inaugural issue in February 1775, and Aitken hired Paine as the Magazine's editor one month later. Under Paine's leadership, the magazine's readership rapidly expanded, achieving a greater circulation in the colonies than any American magazine up until that point.&lt;ref name="larkin3140" /&gt; While Aiken had conceived of the magazine as nonpolitical, Paine brought a strong political perspective to its content, writing in its first issue that "every heart and hand seem to be engaged in the interesting struggle for ''American Liberty.''"&lt;ref name="larkin3140" /&gt;

Paine wrote in the ''Pennsylvania Magazine'' that such a publication should become a "nursery of genius" to help America "outgrow the state of infancy," exercising and educating American minds, and shaping American morality.&lt;ref name="larkin3140" /&gt;

On March 8 1775, the ''Pennsylvania Magazine'' published an unsigned abolitionist essay titled ''African Slavery in America''.&lt;ref name="LoA" /&gt; The essay is often attributed to Paine on the basis of a letter by [[Benjamin Rush]], recalling Paine's claim of authorship to the essay.&lt;ref name="LoA"&gt;{{cite book |title=American Antislavery Writings: Colonial Beginnings to Emancipation |date=2012 |publisher=Library of America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JuG3IKMYdIYC |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay attacked slavery as an "execrable commerce" and "outrage against Humanity and Justice."&lt;ref name="LoA" /&gt;

Consciously appealing to a broader and more working class audience, Paine also used the magazine to discuss worker rights to production. This shift in the conceptualization of politics has been described as a part of "the 'modernization' of political consciousness," and the mobilization of ever greater sections of society into political life.&lt;ref name="larkin3140" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jpgreen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Jack |title=Paine, America, and the "Modernization" of Political Consciousness |journal=Political Science Quarterly |date=1978 |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=73-92 |doi=10.2307/2149051 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2149051 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note name="Green and Larkin"&gt;From Jack P.

[[File:Commonsense.jpg|thumb|''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'', published in 1776]]

===''Common Sense'' (1776)===
{{Main|Common Sense (pamphlet)}}
Paine has a claim to the title ''The Father of the American Revolution'',&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Kostyal. ''Funding Fathers: The Fight for Freedom and the Birth of American Liberty'' (2014) ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Braff, "Forgotten Founding Father: The Impact of Thomas Paine," in Joyce Chumbley, ed., ''Thomas Paine: In Search of the Common Good'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; which rests on his pamphlets, especially ''Common Sense,'' which crystallized sentiment for independence in 1776. It was published in [[Philadelphia]] on January 10, 1776, and signed anonymously "by an Englishman". It became an immediate success, quickly spreading 100,000 copies in three months to the two million residents of the 13 colonies. During the course of the American Revolution, a total of about 500,000 copies were sold, including unauthorized editions.&lt;ref name=Hitchens&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine's original title for the pamphlet was ''Plain Truth'', but Paine's friend, pro-independence advocate [[Benjamin Rush]], suggested ''Common Sense'' instead.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The pamphlet came into circulation in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was passed around and often read aloud in taverns, contributing significantly to spreading the idea of republicanism, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the [[Continental Army]]. Paine provided a new and convincing argument for independence by advocating a complete break with history. ''Common Sense'' is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offers a solution for Americans disgusted with and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Commonalities of Common Sense|author=Robert A. Ferguson|journal= [[William and Mary Quarterly]]|volume=57#3|pages=465–504|date=July 2000|jstor=2674263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine's attack on monarchy in ''Common Sense'' is essentially an attack on [[George III]]. Whereas colonial resentments were originally directed primarily against the king's ministers and Parliament, Paine laid the responsibility firmly at the king's door. ''Common Sense'' was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution. It was a clarion call for unity against the corrupt British court, so as to realize America's providential role in providing an asylum for liberty. Written in a direct and lively style, it denounced the decaying despotisms of Europe and pilloried hereditary monarchy as an absurdity. At a time when many still hoped for reconciliation with Britain, ''Common Sense'' demonstrated to many the inevitability of separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Thomas Paine|author=Philp, Mark|author-link=Mark Philp|editor=Edward N.

Paine was not on the whole expressing original ideas in ''Common Sense'', but rather employing rhetoric as a means to arouse resentment of the Crown. To achieve these ends, he pioneered a style of political writing suited to the democratic society he envisioned, with ''Common Sense'' serving as a primary example. Part of Paine's work was to render complex ideas intelligible to average readers of the day, with clear, concise writing unlike the formal, learned style favored by many of Paine's contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Jensen, ''The Founding of a Nation: A History of the American Revolution, 1763–1776'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), 668.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have put forward various explanations to account for its success, including the historic moment, Paine's easy-to-understand style, his democratic ethos, and his use of psychology and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Hoffman, "Paine and Prejudice: Rhetorical Leadership through Perceptual Framing in Common Sense." ''Rhetoric and Public Affairs'', Fall 2006, Vol. 9, Issue 3, pp. 373–410.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

''Common Sense'' was immensely popular in disseminating to a very wide audience ideas that were already in common use among the elite who comprised Congress and the leadership cadre of the emerging nation, who rarely cited Paine's arguments in their public calls for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Maier, ''American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence'' (New York: Knopf, 1997), 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet probably had little direct influence on the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress']] decision to issue a [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], since that body was more concerned with how declaring independence would affect the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Jack N. Rakove, ''The Beginnings of National Politics: An Interpretive History of the Continental Congress'' (New York: Knopf, 1979), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; One distinctive idea in ''Common Sense'' is Paine's beliefs regarding the peaceful nature of republics; his views were an early and strong conception of what scholars would come to call the [[democratic peace theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack S. Levy, William R. Thompson, ''Causes of War'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] vigorously attacked ''Common Sense''; one attack, titled ''Plain Truth'' (1776), by Marylander [[James Chalmers (loyalist)|James Chalmers]], said Paine was a political quack&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and warned that without monarchy, the government would "degenerate into democracy".&lt;ref name="Jensen669"&gt;Jensen, ''Founding of a Nation'', 669.&lt;/ref&gt; Even some American revolutionaries objected to ''Common Sense''; late in life [[John Adams]] called it a "crapulous mass". Adams disagreed with the type of radical democracy promoted by Paine (that men who did not own property should still be allowed to vote and hold public office) and published ''[[Thoughts on Government]]'' in 1776 to advocate a more conservative approach to republicanism.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Sophia Rosenfeld argues that Paine was highly innovative in his use of the commonplace notion of "common sense". He synthesized various philosophical and political uses of the term in a way that permanently impacted American political thought. He used two ideas from [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]]: that ordinary people can indeed make sound judgments on major political issues, and that there exists a body of popular wisdom that is readily apparent to anyone. Paine also used a notion of "common sense" favored by [[philosophe]]s in the Continental Enlightenment. They held that common sense could refute the claims of traditional institutions. Thus, Paine used "common sense" as a weapon to delegitimize the monarchy and overturn prevailing conventional wisdom. Rosenfeld concludes that the phenomenal appeal of his pamphlet resulted from his synthesis of popular and elite elements in the independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Sophia Rosenfeld, "Tom Paine's Common Sense and Ours." ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2008), 65#4, pp. 633–68 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40212021 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Robert Middlekauff]], ''Common Sense'' became immensely popular mainly because Paine appealed to widespread convictions. Monarchy, he said, was preposterous and it had a heathenish origin. It was an institution of the devil. Paine pointed to the [[Old Testament]], where almost all kings had seduced the Israelites to worship idols instead of God. Paine also denounced aristocracy, which together with monarchy were "two ancient tyrannies." They violated the laws of nature, human reason, and the "universal order of things," which began with God. That was, Middlekauff says, exactly what most Americans wanted to hear. He calls the Revolutionary generation "the children of the twice-born".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, New York, NY; {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, pp. 30–53.&lt;/ref&gt; because in their childhood they had experienced the [[Great Awakening]], which, for the first time, had tied Americans together, transcending denominational and ethnic boundaries and giving them a sense of patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Middlekauff, ''The Glorious Cause'', pp. 4–5, 324–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

===''The American Crisis'' (1776)===
In late 1776, Paine published ''[[The American Crisis]]'' pamphlet series to inspire the Americans in their battles against the British army. He juxtaposed the conflict between the good American devoted to civic virtue and the selfish provincial man.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Roth, "Tom Paine and American Loneliness." ''Early American Literature,'' September 1987, Vol. 22, Issue 2, pp. 175–82.&lt;/ref&gt; To inspire his soldiers, General [[George Washington]] had ''The American Crisis'', first ''Crisis'' pamphlet, read aloud to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins:

{{quote|These are the times that try men's souls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like Hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.}}

===Foreign affairs===
In 1777, Paine became secretary of the Congressional Committee on Foreign Affairs. The following year, he alluded to secret negotiation underway with France in his pamphlets. His enemies denounced his indiscretions. There was scandal; together with Paine's conflict with [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] and [[Silas Deane]] it led to Paine's expulsion from the Committee in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine: Enlightenment, Revolution, and the Birth of Modern Nations|last=Nelson|first=Craig|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|pages=174–75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRFql6S6jKgC&amp;pg=PT174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1781, he accompanied [[John Laurens]] on his mission to France. Eventually, after much pleading from Paine, New York State recognized his political services by presenting him with an estate at [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], New York and Paine received money from Pennsylvania and from Congress at Washington's suggestion. During the Revolutionary War, Paine served as an aide-de-camp to the important general, [[Nathanael Greene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crisis in representation: Thomas Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Helen Maria Williams, and the rewriting of the French Revolution|last=Blakemore|first=Steve|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Silas Deane affair====
In what may have been an error, and perhaps even contributed to his resignation as the secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Paine was openly critical of [[Silas Deane]], an American diplomat who had been appointed in March 1776 by the Congress to travel to France in secret. Deane's goal was to influence the French government to finance the colonists in their fight for independence. Paine largely saw Deane as a war profiteer who had little respect for principle, having been under the employ of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], one of the primary financiers of the American Revolution and working with [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a French royal agent sent to the colonies by King Louis to investigate the Anglo-American conflict. Paine labelled Deane as unpatriotic, and demanded that there be a public investigation into Morris' financing of the Revolution, as he had contracted with his own company for around $500,000.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Unfortunately, Paine's criticisms turned against him. Amongst his criticisms, he had written in the ''[[Pennsylvania Packet]]'' that France had "''prefaced [their] alliance by an early and generous friendship''," referring to aid that had been provided to American colonies prior to the recognition of the Franco-American treaties. This was effectively an embarrassment to France, which potentially could have jeopardised the alliance. [[John Jay]], the President of the Congress who had been a fervent supporter of Deane, immediately spoke out against Paine's comments. The controversy eventually became public, and Paine was then denounced as unpatriotic for criticising an American revolutionary. He was even physically assaulted twice in the street by Deane supporters.  This much added stress took a large toll on Paine, who was generally of a sensitive character and he resigned as secretary to the Committee of Foreign Affairs in 1779.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine|author=Craig Nelson|pages=134–38|isbn=0-670-03788-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding the Revolution===
Paine accompanied Col. John Laurens to France and is credited with initiating the mission.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Wheeler's ''Life and Writings of Thomas Paine'' Vol. 1 (1908) pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; It landed in France in March 1781 and returned to America in August with 2.5&amp;nbsp;million [[French livre|livres]] in silver, as part of a "present" of 6 million and a loan of 10&amp;nbsp;million. The meetings with the French king were most likely conducted in the company and under the influence of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Upon returning to the United States with this highly welcomed cargo, Thomas Paine and probably Col. Laurens, "positively objected" that General Washington should propose that Congress remunerate him for his services, for fear of setting "a bad precedent and an improper mode". Paine made influential acquaintances in Paris and helped organize the Bank of North America to raise money to supply the army.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Wheeler, ''Life and Writings of Thomas Paine'' Vol. 1 (1908), pg. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1785, he was given $3,000 by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in recognition of his service to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Common Sense and Other Writings|author=Paine, Thomas|year=2005|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Classics|page=xiii|isbn=0-672-60004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Laurens]] (father of Col. [[John Laurens]]) had been the ambassador to the [[Netherlands]], but he was captured by the British on his return trip there. When he was later exchanged for the prisoner [[Lord Cornwallis]] (in late 1781), Paine proceeded to the Netherlands to continue the loan negotiations. There remains some question as to the relationship of Henry Laurens and Thomas Paine to Robert Morris as the Superintendent of Finance and his business associate Thomas Willing who became the first president of the Bank of North America (in January 1782). They had accused Morris of profiteering in 1779 and Willing had voted against the Declaration of Independence. Although Morris did much to restore his reputation in 1780 and 1781, the credit for obtaining these critical loans to "organize" the Bank of North America for approval by Congress in December 1781 should go to Henry or John Laurens and Thomas Paine more than to Robert Morris.&lt;ref name="Paine1824"/&gt;

Paine bought his only house in 1783 on the corner of Farnsworth Avenue and Church Streets in [[Bordentown, New Jersey|Bordentown City]], New Jersey and he lived in it periodically until his death in 1809.  This is the only place in the world where Paine purchased real estate.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 1787, a bridge of Paine's design was built across the [[Schuylkill River]] at Philadelphia. At this time his work on single-arch iron bridges led him back to Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Man Of Reason: The Life Of Thomas Paine|last=Aldridge|first=Alfred|publisher=J. B.

Franklin provided letters of introduction for Paine to use to gain associates and contacts in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paine and Jefferson in the Age of Revolutions|last=Ziesche|first=Philipp|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2013|page=124}}&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Paine returned to London from Paris. He then released a pamphlet on August 20 called ''Prospects on the Rubicon: or, an investigation into the Causes and Consequences of the Politics to be Agitated at the Meeting of Parliament''. Tensions between England and France were increasing, and this pamphlet urged the British Ministry to reconsider the consequences of war with France. Paine sought to turn the public opinion against the war to create better relations between the countries, avoid the taxes of war upon the citizens, and not engage in a war he believed would ruin both nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Man Of Reason: The Life Of Thomas Paine|last=Aldridge|first=Alfred|publisher=J.

==''Rights of Man''==
{{Main|Rights of Man}}
{{See also|Revolution Controversy|Trial of Thomas Paine}}
Back in London by 1787, Paine would become engrossed in the French Revolution after it began in 1789, and decided to travel to France in 1790. Meanwhile, conservative intellectual [[Edmund Burke]] launched a counterrevolutionary blast against the French Revolution, entitled ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), which strongly appealed to the landed class, and sold 30,000 copies. Paine set out to refute it in his ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791). He wrote it not as a quick pamphlet, but as a long, abstract political tract of 90,000 words which tore apart monarchies and traditional social institutions. On January 31, 1791, he gave the manuscript to publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]]. A visit by government agents dissuaded Johnson, so Paine gave the book to publisher J.S. Jordan, then went to Paris, per [[William Blake]]'s advice. He charged three good friends, [[William Godwin]], [[Thomas Brand Hollis]], and [[Thomas Holcroft]], with handling publication details. The book appeared on March 13, 1791 and sold nearly a million copies. It was "eagerly read by reformers, Protestant dissenters, democrats, London craftsman, and the skilled factory-hands of the new industrial north".&lt;ref&gt;George Rudé, ''Revolutionary Europe: 1783–1815'' (1964), pg. 183.&lt;!--publisher; ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Undeterred by the government campaign to discredit him, Paine issued his ''Rights of Man, Part the Second, Combining Principle and Practice'' in February 1792. It detailed a representative government with enumerated social programs to remedy the numbing poverty of commoners through [[progressive tax]] measures. Radically reduced in price to ensure unprecedented circulation, it was sensational in its impact and gave birth to reform societies. An indictment for [[seditious libel]] followed, for both publisher and author, while government agents followed Paine and instigated mobs, hate meetings, and burnings in effigy. A fierce pamphlet war also resulted, in which Paine was defended and assailed in dozens of works.&lt;ref&gt;Many of these are reprinted in ''Political Writings of the 1790s'', ed. G. Claeys (8 vols, London: Pickering and Chatto, 1995).&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities aimed, with ultimate success, to chase Paine out of Great Britain. He was then [[Trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']] and found guilty, although never executed. The French translation of ''Rights of Man, Part II'' was published in April 1792. The translator, François Lanthenas, eliminated the dedication to Lafayette, as he believed Paine thought too highly of Lafayette, who was seen as a royalist sympathizer at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmopolitan Patriots: Americans in Paris in the Age of Revolution|last=Ziesche|first=Phillipp|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer of 1792, he answered the sedition and libel charges thus: "If, to expose the fraud and imposition of monarchy ... to promote universal peace, civilization, and commerce, and to break the chains of political superstition, and raise degraded man to his proper rank; if these things be libellous ... let the name of libeller be engraved on my tomb."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Paine, Letter Addressed To The Addressers On The Late Proclamation, in Michael Foot, Isaac Kramnick (ed.), The Thomas Paine Reader, pg. 374&lt;!-- publisher; ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine was an enthusiastic supporter of the French Revolution, and was granted honorary French [[citizenship]] alongside prominent contemporaries such as [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[George Washington]], [[Benjamin Franklin]] and others. Paine's honorary citizenship was in recognition of the publishing of his ''Rights of Man, Part II'' and the sensation it created within France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmopolitan Patriots: Americans in Paris in the Age of Revolution|last=Ziesche|first=Philipp|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=62|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his inability to speak French, he was elected to the [[National Convention]], representing the district of [[Pas-de-Calais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Political Philosophy of Thomas Paine|last=Fruchtman|first=Jack|year=2009|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|page=192|isbn=0-8018-9284-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks after his election to the National Convention, Paine was selected as one of nine deputies to be part of the Convention's Constitutional Committee, who were charged to draft a suitable constitution for the [[French Republican Calendar|French Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paine and Jefferson in the Age of Revolutions|last=Munck|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=165|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequentially participated in the Constitutional Committee in drafting the [[Girondin constitutional project]]. He voted for the French Republic, but argued against the execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], saying the monarch should instead be [[exile]]d to the United States: firstly, because of the way royalist France had come to the aid of the American Revolution; and secondly, because of a moral objection to capital punishment in general and to revenge killings in particular. However, Paine's speech in defense of Louis XVI was interrupted by [[Jean-Paul Marat]], who claimed that as a Quaker, Paine's religious beliefs ran counter to inflicting capital punishment and thus he should be ineligible to vote. Marat interrupted a second time, stating that the translator was deceiving the convention by distorting the meanings of Paine's words, prompting Paine to provide a copy of the speech as proof that he was being correctly translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paine|last=Hawke|first=David|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1974|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=275–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded as an ally of the [[Girondist|Girondins]], he was seen with increasing disfavor by the [[The Mountain|Montagnards]], who were now in power; and in particular by [[Maximilien Robespierre]]. A decree was passed at the end of 1793 excluding foreigners from their places in the Convention ([[Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grâce, baron de Cloots|Anacharsis Cloots]] was also deprived of his place). Paine was arrested and imprisoned in December 1793.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Paine wrote the second part of ''[[Rights of Man]]'' on a desk in [[Thomas 'Clio' Rickman]]'s house, with whom he was staying in 1792 before he fled to France. This desk is currently on display in the [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Collection highlights, Tom Paine's Desk|publisher=People's History Museum|url=http://www.phm.org.uk/our-collection/tom-paines-desk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Paine by Laurent Dabos-crop.jpg|thumb|Oil painting by [[Laurent Dabos]], circa 1791]]

Paine was arrested in France on December 28, 1793. [[Joel Barlow]] was unsuccessful in securing Paine's release by circulating a petition among American residents in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cosmopolitan Patriots: Americans in Paris in the Age of Revolution|last=Ziesche|first=Philipp|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=86|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen American citizens were allowed to plead for Paine's release to the Convention, yet President [[Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier]] of the Committee of General Security refused to acknowledge Paine's American citizenship, stating he was an Englishman and a citizen of a country at war with France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paine|last=Hawke|first=David|publisher=Harper &amp; Row Publishers|year=1974|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=297–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine himself protested and claimed that he was a citizen of the U.S., which was an ally of Revolutionary France, rather than of Great Britain, which was by that time at war with France. However, [[Gouverneur Morris]], the American minister to France, did not press his claim, and Paine later wrote that Morris had connived at his imprisonment. Paine narrowly escaped execution. A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the gaoler on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the mark had accidentally been made on the inside of his door rather than the outside; this was due to the fact that the door of Paine's cell had been left open whilst the gaoler was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. But for this quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning. He kept his head and survived the few vital days needed to be spared by the fall of Robespierre on [[Thermidorian Reaction|9 Thermidor]] (July 27, 1794).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Life and Writings of Thomas Paine: Containing a Biography|last1=Paine|first1=Thomas|last2=Rickman|first2=Thomas Clio|publisher=Vincent Parke &amp; Co.|year=1908|pages=261–62|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3zcNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=%22thomas+paine%22+jailer+door|access-date=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine was released in November 1794 largely because of the work of the new American Minister to France, [[James Monroe]],&lt;ref&gt;Foot, Michael, and Kramnick, Isaac. 1987. ''The Thomas Paine Reader'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; who successfully argued the case for Paine's American citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, 1976. ''Tom Paine and Revolutionary America'', pg. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1795, he was re-admitted into the Convention, as were other surviving Girondins. Paine was one of only three députés to oppose the adoption of the new [[Constitution of the Year III|1795 constitution]] because it eliminated [[universal suffrage]], which had been proclaimed by the [[French Constitution of 1793|Montagnard Constitution of 1793]].&lt;ref&gt;[[François Victor Alphonse Aulard|Aulard, Alphonse]]. 1901. ''Histoire politique de la Révolution française'', pg. 555.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1796, a [[Wearmouth Bridge (1796)|bridge]] he designed was erected over the mouth of the Wear River at [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear]], England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yorkshire Stingo]]&lt;/ref&gt; This bridge, the Sunderland arch, was after the same design as his [[Schuylkill River]] Bridge in Philadelphia and it became the prototype for many subsequent [[voussoir]] arches made in iron and steel.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Bridge Engineering'', H.G.

Chrimes, ed., Thomas Telford, 2002; ({{ISBN|0-7277-2939-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0727729392}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to receiving a British patent for the single-span iron bridge, Paine developed a smokeless candle&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ushistory.org/Paine/index.htm Thomas Paine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929122148/http://www.ushistory.org/paine/index.htm|date=September 29, 2006}}, Independence Hall Association; accessed online November 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and worked with inventor [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]] in developing steam engines.

In 1797, Paine lived in Paris with [[Nicholas Bonneville]] and his wife. As well as Bonneville's other controversial guests, Paine aroused the suspicions of authorities. Bonneville hid the [[Royalist]] [[Antoine Joseph Barruel-Beauvert]] at his home. Beauvert had been outlawed following the [[coup of 18 Fructidor]] on September 4, 1797. Paine believed that the United States under President [[John Adams]] had betrayed revolutionary France.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonneville was then briefly jailed and his presses were confiscated, which meant financial ruin.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 1800, still under police surveillance, Bonneville took refuge with his father in [[Evreux]]. Paine stayed on with him, helping Bonneville with the burden of translating the "Covenant Sea". The same year, Paine purportedly had a meeting with [[Napoleon]]. Napoleon claimed he slept with a copy of ''Rights of Man'' under his pillow and went so far as to say to Paine that "a statue of gold should be erected to you in every city in the universe".&lt;ref name="oneill"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Who was Thomas Paine?|last=O'Neill|first=Brendan|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8089115.stm|date=June 8, 2009|access-date=June 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine discussed with Napoleon how best to invade England. In December 1797, he wrote two essays, one of which was pointedly named ''Observations on the Construction and Operation of Navies with a Plan for an Invasion of England and the Final Overthrow of the English Government'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Papers of James Monroe ... from the original manuscripts in the Library of Congress|url=https://archive.org/stream/papersofjamesmon00librrich/papersofjamesmon00librrich_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he promoted the idea to finance 1,000 gunboats to carry a French invading army across the English Channel. In 1804, Paine returned to the subject, writing ''To the People of England on the Invasion of England'' advocating the idea.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; However, upon noting Napoleon's progress towards dictatorship, he condemned him as "the completest charlatan that ever existed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine|author=Craig Nelson|page=299|isbn=0-670-03788-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paine remained in France until 1802, returning to the United States only at President Jefferson's invitation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Criticism of George Washington===
Paine believed that U.S. President George Washington had conspired with Robespierre to imprison him. He had felt largely betrayed that Washington, who had been a lifelong friend, did nothing while Paine suffered in prison. While staying with Monroe, he planned to send Washington a letter of grievance on the former President's birthday. Monroe stopped the letter from being sent just in time and after Paine's criticism of the [[Jay Treaty]] Monroe suggested that Paine reside somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine|author=Craig Nelson|page=291|isbn=0-670-03788-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still embittered by the perceived betrayal, Paine tried to ruin Washington's reputation by calling him a treacherous man who was unworthy of his fame as a military and political hero. He sent a stinging letter to Washington, in which he described him as an incompetent commander and a vain and ungrateful person. Paine never received a reply, so he contacted his lifelong publisher, the anti-Federalist [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Bache]] to publish this ''Letter to George Washington'' in 1796. In this scathing publication, Paine wrote that "the world will be puzzled to decide whether you are an apostate or an impostor; whether you have abandoned good principles or whether you ever had any".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Letter to George Washington, July 30, 1796: "On Paine's Service to America"|last=Paine|first=Thomas|url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/paine_letter_to_washington_01.html|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927084319/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/paine_letter_to_washington_01.html|access-date=November 4, 2006|archive-date=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further wrote that without the aid of France, Washington could not have succeeded in the Revolution and had "but little share in the glory of the final event". He also commented on Washington's poor character, saying that Washington had no sympathetic feelings and was a hypocrite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine|author=Craig Nelson|pages=292–94|isbn=0-670-03788-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In 1802 or 1803, Paine left France for the United States, also paying the passage for Bonneville's wife [[Marguerite Brazier]] and the couple's three sons, [[Benjamin Bonneville|Benjamin]], [[Louis Bonneville|Louis]] and [[Thomas Bonneville]], to whom Paine was godfather. Paine returned to the United States in the early stages of the [[Second Great Awakening]] and a time of great political partisanship. The ''Age of Reason'' gave ample excuse for the religiously devout to dislike him and the Federalists attacked him for his ideas of government stated in ''Common Sense,'' for his association with the French Revolution and for his friendship with President Jefferson. Also still fresh in the minds of the public was his ''Letter to Washington'' published six years before his return. This was compounded when his right to vote was denied in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] on the grounds that Gouverneur Morris did not recognize him as an American and Washington had not aided him.&lt;ref&gt;Claeys, Gregory, 1989. ''Thomas Paine, Social and Political Thought''.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, publisher, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazier took care of Paine at the end of his life and buried him after his death on June 8, 1809. In his will, Paine left the bulk of his estate to Marguerite, including 100 acres (40.5 ha) of his farm so she could maintain and educate Benjamin and his brother Thomas. In 1814, the fall of Napoleon finally allowed Bonneville to rejoin his wife in the United States where he remained for four years before returning to Paris to open a bookshop.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Death==
[[File:Thomas Paine death mask.jpg|thumb|Paine's [[death mask]], in the [[People's History Museum]] in [[Manchester]]]]
On the morning of June 8, 1809, Paine died, aged 72, at 59 Grove Street in [[Greenwich Village]], New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/paine|title=Thomas Paine|website=ushistory.org|access-date=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original building is no longer there, the present building has a plaque noting that Paine died at this location.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

After his death, Paine's body was brought to New Rochelle, but the Quakers would not allow it to be buried in their graveyard as per his last will, so his remains were buried under a walnut tree on his farm. In 1819, English agrarian radical journalist [[William Cobbett]], who in 1793 had published a hostile continuation&lt;ref&gt;William Cobbett, ''The Life of Thomas Paine, Interspersed with Remarks and Reflections'' (London: J. Wright, 1797)&lt;/ref&gt; of Francis Oldys (George Chalmer)'s ''The Life of Thomas Paine'',&lt;ref&gt;"Francis Oldys" [George Chalmers], The Life of Thomas Paine. One Penny-Worth of Truth, from Thomas Bull to His Brother John (London: Stockdale, 1791)&lt;/ref&gt; dug up his bones and transported them back to England with the intention to give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but this never came to pass. The bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died over twenty years later, but were later lost. There is no confirmed story about what happened to them after that, although various people have claimed throughout the years to own parts of Paine's remains, such as his skull and right hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Paine Monument at Last Finds a Home|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1905/10/15/archives/the-paine-monument-at-last-finds-a-home-accepted-by-new-rochelle.html|date=October 15, 1905|access-date=February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rehabilitating Thomas Paine, Bit by Bony Bit|last=Chen|first=David W.|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.mindspring.com/~phila1/nyt330.htm|access-date=February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin G.

At the time of his death, most American newspapers reprinted the obituary notice from the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'' that was in turn quoting from ''The American Citizen'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Paine's Obituary (click the "1809" link; it is 1/3 way down the 4th column)|newspaper=New York Evening Post|url=http://www.classicapologetics.com/special/painerelief.html|date=June 10, 1809|access-date=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which read in part: "He had lived long, did some good, and much harm". Only six mourners came to his funeral, two of whom were black, most likely [[Freedman|freedmen]]. Many years later the writer and orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] wrote:

{{quote|Thomas Paine had passed the legendary limit of life. One by one most of his old friends and acquaintances had deserted him. Maligned on every side, execrated, shunned and abhorred – his virtues denounced as vices – his services forgotten – his character blackened, he preserved the poise and balance of his soul. He was a victim of the people, but his convictions remained unshaken. He was still a soldier in the army of freedom, and still tried to enlighten and civilize those who were impatiently waiting for his death. Even those who loved their enemies hated him, their friend – the friend of the whole world – with all their hearts. On the 8th&amp;nbsp;of June 1809, death came – Death, almost his only friend. At his funeral no pomp, no pageantry, no civic procession, no military display. In a carriage, a woman and her son who had lived on the bounty of the dead – on horseback, a Quaker, the humanity of whose heart dominated the creed of his head – and, following on foot, two negroes filled with gratitude – constituted the funeral cortege of Thomas Paine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thomas Paine (1892)|author=Robert G.

==Ideas==
Biographer [[Eric Foner]] identifies a utopian thread in Paine's thought, writing: "Through this new language he communicated a new vision—a utopian image of an egalitarian, republican society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tom Paine and Revolutionary America|author=Eric Foner|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, 2nd edition|pages=xxxii, 16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OyFF1M8_VDAC|isbn=9780195174861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine's utopianism combined [[Republicanism in the United States|civic republicanism]], belief in the inevitability of scientific and social progress and commitment to free markets and liberty generally. The multiple sources of Paine's political theory all pointed to a society based on the common good and individualism. Paine expressed a redemptive futurism or political messianism.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Jendrysik, "Tom Paine: Utopian?", ''Utopian Studies'' (2007) 18#2 pp. 139–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing that his generation "would appear to the future as the Adam of a new world", Paine exemplified British utopianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature|author=Gregory Claeys, ed.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=11–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFCuoqykV9QC&amp;pg=PA11|isbn=9781139828420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, his encounters with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] made a deep impression. The ability of the [[Iroquois]] to live in harmony with nature while achieving a democratic decision-making process helped him refine his thinking on how to organize society.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherford, Jack "Indian Givers How the Indians of the Americas Transformed the World", 1988, p. 125.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas Paine by Matthew Pratt, 1785-95.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Thomas Paine by [[Matthew Pratt]], 1785–1795]]

===Slavery===

On March 8 1775, one month after Paine became the editor of ''The Pennsylvania Magazine'', the magazine published an anonymous article titled "African Slavery in America", the first prominent piece in the colonies proposing the emancipation of African-American slaves and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of slavery.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia|last=Rodriguez|first=Junius P.|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X44KbDBl9gC&amp;pg=PA279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine is often credited with writing the piece,&lt;ref name=Rodriguez /&gt; on the basis of later testimony by Benjamin Rush, cosigner of the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref name="LoA" /&gt; Citing a lack of further evidence of Paine's authorship however, scholars [[Eric Foner]] and [[Alfred Owen Aldridge]] no longer consider this one of his works. By contrast, journalist John Nichols writes that Paine's "fervent objections to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]" led to his exclusion from power during the early years of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Obama's Vindication of Thomas Paine|author=Nichols, John|author-link=John Nichols (journalist)|magazine=[[The Nation]]|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/obamas-vindication-thomas-paine#axzz2edDwnJ4g|date=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Agrarian Justice''===
His last pamphlet, ''[[Agrarian Justice]]'', published in the winter of 1795, opposed to agrarian law and to agrarian monopoly and further developed his ideas in the ''Rights of Man'' about how land ownership separated the majority of people from their rightful, natural inheritance and means of independent survival. The U.S. [[Social Security Administration]] recognizes ''Agrarian Justice'' as the first American proposal for an [[Pension|old-age pension]] and [[basic income]] or [[citizen's dividend]]. Per ''Agrarian Justice'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a right, and not a charity ... [Government must] create a national fund, out of which there shall be paid to every person, when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen pounds sterling, as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property. And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall arrive at that age.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that £10 and £15 would be worth about £800 and £1,200 ($1,200 and $2,000) when adjusted for inflation (2011 British pounds sterling).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to Present|publisher=Measuringworth.com|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk|date=February 15, 1971|access-date=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamb argues that Paine's analysis of property rights marks a distinct contribution to political theory. His theory of property defends a libertarian concern with private ownership that shows an egalitarian commitment. Paine's new justification of property sets him apart from previous theorists such as [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] and [[John Locke]]. It demonstrates Paine's commitment to foundational liberal values of individual freedom and moral equality.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Robert.

==Religious views==
Before his arrest and imprisonment in France, knowing that he would probably be arrested and executed, following in the tradition of [[deists#The rise of British deism (1690–1740)|early eighteenth-century British deism]] Paine wrote the first part of ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', an assault on organized "revealed" religion combining a compilation of the many inconsistencies he found in the Bible.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

About his own religious beliefs, Paine wrote in ''The Age of Reason'':

{{quote|I believe in [[one God]], and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.}}

{{quote|I do not believe in the creed professed by the [[Judaism|Jewish church]], by the [[Catholicism|Roman church]], by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek church]], by the [[Islam|Turkish church]], by the [[Protestantism|Protestant church]], nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.}}

{{quote|Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Theological Works of Thomas Paine|author=Thomas Paine|year=1824|publisher=R.

Though there is no evidence Paine himself was a [[Freemason]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Thomas Paine's Masonic Essay and the Question of His Membership in the Fraternity|author=Shai Afsai|journal=[[Philalethes Society|Philalethes]] 63|issue=4|pages=138–44|quote=As he was certainly not a Master Mason when he wrote the essay—and as there is no evidence he joined the fraternity after then—one may conclude, as have Mackey, Newton, and others, that Paine was not a Freemason. Still, though the 'pantheon of Masons' may not hold Thomas Paine, this influential and controversial man remains connected to Freemasonry, if only due to the close friendships he had with some in the fraternity, and to his having written an intriguing essay on its origins.|url=http://freemasonry.org/pdf/2010_04_sample_article.pdf|date=Fall 2010|access-date=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon his return to America from France he also penned "An Essay on the Origin of Free-Masonry" (1803–1805) about Freemasonry being derived from the religion of the ancient Druids.&lt;ref&gt;Shai Afsai, "[http://freemasonry.org/pdf/2010_04_sample_article.pdf Thomas Paine's Masonic Essay and the Question of His Membership in the Fraternity]." [[Philalethes Society|''Philalethes'']] 63:4 (Fall 2010), pp. 140–41.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay, he stated: "The Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the sun, in which they put a man called Christ in the place of the sun, and pay him the adoration originally paid to the sun". Marguerite de Bonneville published the essay in 1810 after Paine's death, but she chose to omit certain passages from it that were critical of Christianity, most of which were restored in an 1818 printing.&lt;ref name="Afsai 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Thomas Paine, Freemason or Deist?|last=Afsai|first=Shai|journal=Early America Review|year=2012|issue=Winter/Spring|url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/2012_winter_spring/paine-freemason-or-deist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Paine never described himself as a [[deist]],&lt;ref name="Afsai 2012"/&gt; he did write the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;The opinions I have advanced ... are the effect of the most clear and long-established conviction that the Bible and the Testament are impositions upon the world, that the fall of man, the account of Jesus Christ being the Son of God, and of his dying to appease the wrath of God, and of salvation, by that strange means, are all fabulous inventions, dishonorable to the wisdom and power of the Almighty; that the only true religion is [[Deism]], by which I then meant, and mean now, the belief of one God, and an imitation of his moral character, or the practice of what are called moral virtues{{spaced ndash}}and that it was upon this only (so far as religion is concerned) that I rested all my hopes of happiness hereafter.

==Legacy==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:ThomasPaineStamp1969.jpg|right|thumb|In 1969, a [[Prominent Americans series]] stamp honoring Paine was issued.]]
Paine's writing greatly influenced his contemporaries and especially the American revolutionaries. His books provoked an upsurge in deism in the United States, but in the long term inspired [[Philosophical radicals|philosophic]] and working-class [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] in the United Kingdom and United States. [[American liberalism|Liberals]], [[Libertarianism|libertarians]], [[left-libertarianism|left-libertarians]], [[Feminism|feminists]], [[democratic socialists]], [[social democrats]], [[anarchist]]s, [[Freethought|free thinkers]] and [[Progressivism|progressives]] often claim him as an intellectual ancestor. Paine's critique of institutionalized religion and advocacy of rational thinking influenced many British free thinkers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such as [[William Cobbett]], [[George Holyoake]], [[Charles Bradlaugh]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Bertrand Russell]].

The quote "Lead, follow, or get out of the way" is widely but incorrectly attributed to Paine. This can be found nowhere in his published works.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Abraham Lincoln===
When [[Abraham Lincoln]] was 26 years old in 1835, he wrote a defense of Paine's deism and a political associate, Samuel Hill, burned it to save Lincoln's political career.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Burlingame, ''Abraham Lincoln: a life'' (2008), vol. 2, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Roy Basler]], the editor of Lincoln's papers, said Paine had a strong influence on Lincoln's style:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No other writer of the eighteenth century, with the exception of Jefferson, parallels more closely the temper or gist of Lincoln's later thought. In style, Paine above all others affords the variety of eloquence which, chastened and adapted to Lincoln's own mood, is revealed in Lincoln's formal writings.&lt;ref&gt;Roy P. Basler (ed.), ''Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings'' (1946), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Thomas Edison===
The inventor [[Thomas Edison]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have always regarded Paine as one of the greatest of all Americans. Never have we had a sounder intelligence in this republic ... It was my good fortune to encounter Thomas Paine's works in my boyhood ... it was, indeed, a revelation to me to read that great thinker's views on political and theological subjects. Paine educated me, then, about many matters of which I had never before thought. I remember, very vividly, the flash of enlightenment that shone from Paine's writings, and I recall thinking, at that time, 'What a pity these works are not today the schoolbooks for all children!' My interest in Paine was not satisfied by my first reading of his works. I went back to them time and again, just as I have done since my boyhood days.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Edison, Introduction to ''The Life and Works of Thomas Paine'', New York: Citadel Press, 1945, Vol. I, pp. vii–ix. [http://www.thomaspaine.org/ Reproduced online] on thomaspaine.org, accessed November 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===South America===
In 1811, Venezuelan translator Manuel Garcia de Sena published a book in Philadelphia which consisted mostly of Spanish translations of several of Paine's most important works.&lt;ref name="street"&gt;John Street, ''Artigas and the Emancipation of Uruguay'' (London: Cambridge University Press, 1959), 178–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also included translations of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the U.S. Constitution and the constitutions of five U.S. states.&lt;ref name="street"/&gt;

It subsequently circulated widely in South America and through it [[Uruguay]]an national hero [[José Gervasio Artigas]] became familiar with and embraced Paine's ideas. In turn, many of Artigas's writings drew directly from Paine's, including the ''[[Instructions of 1813]]'', which Uruguayans consider to be one of their country's most important constitutional documents. It was one of the earliest writings to articulate a principled basis for an identity independent of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="street"/&gt;

===Memorials===
The first and longest-standing memorial to Paine is the carved and inscribed 12 foot marble column in [[New Rochelle, New York]] organized and funded by publisher, educator and reformer Gilbert Vale (1791–1866) and raised in 1839 by the American sculptor and architect [[John Frazee (sculptor)|John Frazee]] – the [[Thomas Paine Monument]] (see image below).&lt;ref&gt;See Frederick S. Voss, ''John Frazee 1790–1852 Sculptor'' (Washington City and Boston: The National Portrait Gallery and The Boston Athenaeum, 1986), pp. 46–47.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

New Rochelle is also the original site of [[Thomas Paine Cottage|Thomas Paine's Cottage]], which along with a 320-acre (130 ha) farm were presented to Paine in 1784 by act of the New York State Legislature for his services in the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;See Alfred Owen Aldridge, ''Man of Reason'' (Philadelphia: J. P. Lippincott Company, 1959), pg. 103.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The same site is the home of the [[Thomas Paine National Historical Association|Thomas Paine Memorial Museum]]. Thomas Edison helped to turn the first shovel of earth for the museum which serves as a museum to display both Paine relics as well as others of local historical interest. A large collection of books, pamphlets and pictures is contained in the Paine library, including many first editions of Paine's works as well as several original manuscripts. These holdings, the subject of a sell-off controversy, were temporarily relocated to the [[New-York Historical Society]] &lt;!--This is the correct punctuation--&gt; and have since been more permanently archived in the [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] library nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iona.edu/library/about/collections/archives/paine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529155142/http://www.iona.edu/library/about/collections/archives/paine|date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paine was originally buried near the current location of his house and monument upon his death in 1809. The site is marked by a small headstone and burial plaque even though his remains were removed years later.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the 20th century, [[Joseph L. Lewis|Joseph Lewis]], longtime president of the Freethinkers of America and an ardent Paine admirer, was instrumental in having larger-than-life-sized statues of Paine erected in each of the three countries with which the revolutionary writer was associated. The first, created by [[Mount Rushmore]] sculptor [[Gutzon Borglum]], was erected in [[Paris]] just before [[World War II]] began, but not formally dedicated until 1948. It depicts Paine standing before the French [[National Convention]] to plead for the life of [[King Louis XVI]]. The second, sculpted in 1950 by [[Georg J. Lober]], was erected near Paine's one time home in [[Morristown, New Jersey]]. It shows a seated Paine using a drum-head as a makeshift table. The third, sculpted by Sir [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]], President of the Royal Academy, was erected in 1964 in Paine's birthplace, [[Thetford]], England. With quill pen in his right hand and an inverted copy of ''The Rights of Man'' in his left, it occupies a prominent spot on King Street. Thomas Paine was ranked No. 34 in the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' 2002 extensive Nationwide poll conducted by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A bronze plaque attached to the wall of Thetford's Thomas Paine hotel gives details of Paine's life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thethomaspainehotel.co.uk/about-the-hotel&lt;/ref&gt; It was placed there in 1943 by voluntary contributions from U.S. airmen from a nearby bomber base.

Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 1980, pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City, the [[Thomas Paine Park]] is marked by a fountain called The Triumph of the Human Spirit. Located in downtown Manhattan, near [[New York City Hall|City Hall]], the 300-ton-plus monument was dedicated on October 12, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/thomas-paine-park/monuments/1909&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronx Community College]] includes Paine in its Hall of Fame of Great Americans and there are statues of Paine in [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] and [[Bordentown, New Jersey|Bordentown]], New Jersey and in the [[Parc Montsouris]], in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Photos of Tom Paine and Some of His Writings|publisher=Morristown.org|url=http://www.morristown.org/tompaine.htm|access-date=January 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928201911/http://morristown.org/tompaine.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Parc Montsouris|publisher=Paris Walking Tours|url=http://www.paris-walking-tours.com/parcmontsouris.html|access-date=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, largely through the efforts of citizen activist David Henley of Virginia, legislation (S.Con.Res 110 and H.R. 1628) was introduced in the 102nd Congress by ideological opposites Sen. [[Steve Symms]] (R-ID) and Rep. [[Nita Lowey]] (D-NY). With over 100 formal letters of endorsement by United States and foreign historians, philosophers and organizations, including the Thomas Paine National Historical Society, the legislation garnered 78 original co-sponsors in the Senate and 230 original co-sponsors in the House of Representatives, and was consequently passed by both houses' unanimous consent. In October 1992, the legislation was signed into law (PL102-407 and PL102-459) by President [[George H. W. Bush]] authorizing the construction by using private funds of a memorial to Thomas Paine in "Area 1" of the grounds of the [[US Capitol|U.S. Capitol]]. {{As of|2011|1}}, the memorial has not yet been built.

}} A complete edition of Paine's writings, on the model of Eric Foner's edition for the Library of America, is badly needed.  Until then Philip Foner's two-volume edition is a serviceable substitute. Volume I contains the major works, and volume II contains shorter writings, both published essays and a selection of letters, but confusingly organized; in addition, Foner's attributions of writings to Paine have come in for some criticism in that Foner may have included writings that Paine edited but did not write and omitted some writings that later scholars have attributed to Paine.

===April 2003===
*April 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Speaking before an audience in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], John Kerry says "We need a regime change not just in Iraq. We need a regime change here in the United States." &lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2010}} [http://www.monadnockledger.info/2003/stories/1_news_040303.shtml] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040108065841/http://www.monadnockledger.info/2003/stories/1_news_040303.shtml |date=2004-01-08 }}.

''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''  Retrieved May 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*April 17&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Democratic fundraising totals for the first quarter of 2003 are reported. John Edwards raises $7.4 million, John Kerry raises $7.0 million, Dick Gephardt raises $3.5 million, Joe Lieberman raises $3.0 million, Howard Dean raises $2.6 million, Bob Graham raises $1.1 million, and Dennis Kucinich and Carol Moseley Braun raise less than $1 million each.

===May 2003===
*May 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[George W. Bush]] lands on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72|6}}, in a [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gives a speech announcing the end of major combat in the Iraq war. Clearly visible in the background is a banner stating "Mission Accomplished". Bush's landing is criticized by opponents as overly theatrical and expensive. The banner, made by [[White House]] personnel (according to a [[CNN]] story:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= [[Dana Bash|Bash, Dana]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/28/mission.accomplished/|title=White House Pressed on 'Mission Accomplished' Sign&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Navy Suggested It, White House Made It, Both Sides Say|publisher= [[CNN]] |date= October 29, 2003|accessdate= October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and placed there by the U.S. Navy, is criticized as premature. Nonetheless, Bush's approval rating in the month of May rides at 66%, according to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Staff |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/24/politics/main555427.shtml |title=Bush Jumpstarts '04 Fundraising |agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[CBS News]] |date= February 11, 2009 |accessdate= October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event would come back to haunt Bush as combat in Iraq continued.
*May 3&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Democrats meet at the [[University of South Carolina]], located in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], in the first formal debate between the nine challengers for the 2004 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] presidential nomination. The candidates disagree on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war against Iraq]], health insurance, and even President Bush's tax cuts, but unite in criticizing Bush's handling of the economy.
*May 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Gary Hart]], former [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Colorado]], announces he will not seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2004.
*May 7&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Vice President of the United States of America|U.S. Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] announces he will be President Bush's running mate again in 2004. Cheney's position on the ticket had been the subject of some speculation because he has had four [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], though none as vice president. Bush had still not formally announced he would seek re-election yet.
* May 16&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] formally files papers with the [[Federal Election Commission]] seeking a second term as [[President of the United States|U.S. President]].

===June 2003===

*June 23&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upholds [[affirmative action]] in university admissions in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]''
*June 24&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Liberal advocacy website [[MoveOn]] holds the first-ever online Democratic "primary", which lasts just over 48 hours. It is an unofficial and non-binding affair, but with important symbolic and financial value. Of 317,647 votes, [[Howard Dean]] receives 44%, [[Dennis Kucinich]] 24%, and [[John Kerry]] 16%. Had any candidate received 50% of the vote, the candidate would have received MoveOn's endorsement and financial support. Instead, MoveOn supports all the candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html |title= Report on the 2003 MoveOn.org Political Action Primary |publisher= [[MoveOn.org]] |date= n.d. |accessdate= October 19, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050929062844/http://moveon.org/pac/primary/report.html |archivedate= September 29, 2005 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*July 18&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[David Cobb]] announces his candidacy for the Green Party nomination in Washington, D.C. As part of a "genuine effort to reach progressives across party lines", he announces that his strategy includes a "Strategic States Plan", concentrating efforts where [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] votes are not "in play." Some Greens decry the lack of an "all-out" strategy from Cobb and the loss of [[ballot access|ballot status]] that would ensue.

===August 2003===
*August 11&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; U.S. Senator [[Joe Biden]] from [[Delaware]] announces he will not seek the Democratic nomination, saying his campaign would be "a long shot" and that he could wield the most influence in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

===September 2003===

**The ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' publishes an interview with John Kerry. This quote is used by the Bush campaign to attack Kerry by claiming he is weak on terrorism, and used by Bush in the debate on October 13: ''"We have to get back to the place we were, where terrorists are not the focus of our lives, but they're a nuisance. As a former law-enforcement person, I know we're never going to end prostitution. We're never going to end illegal gambling. But we're going to reduce it, organized crime, to a level where it isn't on the rise. It isn't threatening people's lives every day, and fundamentally, it's something that you continue to fight, but it's not threatening the fabric of your life."''

==In depth analysis of week of 2004 election==
&lt;!-- [[Image:USPresidentialSeal transparent 100px.png||right|100px|The Seal of the President of the United States of America]]--&gt;
This page contains a timeline of the '''2004 U.S. presidential election'''. For a more in-depth discussion of the candidates and issues at stake in that election and the campaign history leading up to election day, see [[U.S. presidential election, 2004]]. For information on other races conducted the same day, see [[U.S. Senate election, 2004]] and [[U.S. House election, 2004]]. For an explanation of the U.S. presidential election process see [[U.S. Electoral College]].

The U.S. presidential election occurred on November 2, 2004. However, as in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. election]], the election was too close for a winner to be declared that night. By the next morning, the Republican campaign was declaring a victory while the results in several states remained too close for the media to declare winners. Soon afterward the Kerry campaign decided that there were not enough uncounted votes in Ohio for them to win that state and Kerry telephoned Bush to concede. At 2 p.m. EST, Kerry held a news conference announcing the same. An hour later, Bush held his own to accept his victory.

In Ohio, the Libertarian and Green parties raised $113,600 necessary to fund a recount of the popular vote, which took place in early December and upheld the Bush victory in that state.

==Events==

===Tuesday, November 2, 2004===

====Morning====
*Citizens in two small [[New Hampshire]] towns were the first to have their ballots counted in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. The polls were opened at midnight and closed within minutes as everyone who had registered had voted. In [[Dixville Notch, New Hampshire|Dixville Notch]], the more famous of the two due to its longstanding tradition of early voting, the incumbent lost ground compared to his showing in 2000, but got more total votes than the challenger: Bush — 19, Kerry — 7. Bush also won the vote in [[Hart's Location, New Hampshire|Hart's Location]], which managed to report its results slightly earlier this year; Bush — 16, Kerry — 14, and Nader — 1. (09:00 UTC, November 2, 2004, Associated Press ([http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/ELN_FIRST_VOTES?SITE=JRC&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT Associated Press]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) ([http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsPackageArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=613450&amp;section=news Reuters]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) In both cases this represented a small swing compared with the 2000 results from the Republican candidate to the Democratic candidate.
*"U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] Tuesday allowed Republicans to challenge voter qualifications at the polls in Ohio, a key battleground state that could determine the presidential election. Stevens acted on an emergency request shortly before polls opened in Ohio and across the nation." He refused to set aside a U.S. appeals court order, issued Monday, which, reversing a lower court's ban, permitted political party members to challenge the credentials of potential voters at polling places across the state. -[https://web.archive.org/web/20050509044515/http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&amp;storyID=6689186 Reuters] ([https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&amp;sid=a7QdNFNQp7NY&amp;refer=top_world_news Bloomberg])
*Some reports say Florida, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., (and possibly other states) have received record numbers of requests for absentee ballots for this election. Absentee ballots are counted differently based on the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionline.org/site/docs/html/counting_absentee_ballots.htm |title=Pew Center on the States |publisher=electionline.org |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010200246/http://www.electionline.org/site/docs/html/counting_absentee_ballots.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  with most states counting them on election day, but with some exceptions, the last deadline being 10 days after the election (all Washington, D.C. absentee ballots, and oversea absentee ballots in Ohio and Florida). Washington State allows 15 days after the election for out of country absentee ballots to come in. It is possible that absentee ballots are being requested due to concerns about electronic voting, or simply due to an expected high overall voter turnout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc-2.com/articles/readarticle.asp?articleid=1661&amp;z=3&amp;p= ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309083426/http://www.nbc-2.com/articles/readarticle.asp?articleid=1661&amp;z=3&amp;p= |date=March 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Staff |url=http://washingtontimes.com/metro/20041101-110119-6698r.htm |title=Absentee Voting Surges This Year | work = [[The Washington Times]] |date= November 1, 2004 |accessdate= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Leroy Chiao]], currently stationed on the [[International Space Station]], cast his vote by encrypted e-mail and became the first American to vote in a presidential election from space.
*Slate reports exit polls from ten states, with John Kerry winning in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and New Mexico. Bush projected to win in Nevada, North Carolina and Colorado. Together with the polls from MyDD there are results from 34 states. Kerry leads with 192 electoral votes, while Bush has 152.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Shafer, Jack |url=http://washingtontimes.com/metro/20041101-110119-6698r.htm/ |title=Mucho Flattering to Kerry; Plus Nader Makes an Appearance. – By Jack Shafer – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.msn.com |date= November 2, 2004 |accessdate= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Based on exit polls, Zogby predicts a decisive 311 to 213 win for Kerry with 14 electoral votes too close to call.
* As the day progresses, late-day exit polls show that Florida has flipped to Bush, but by a narrow margin, and Nevada to Kerry, giving the challenger a 289–249 edge.

====Evening====
*At 7:00 pm EST, polls close in GA, IN, KY, SC, VT, and VA. CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox News Channel all agree in projecting Georgia, Indiana, and Kentucky for Bush, and Vermont for Kerry, giving the Republicans a 34–3 lead.
*At 7:30 pm, polls close in OH and WV. ABC, CBS, CNN, and Fox News call West Virginia for Bush. NBC waits 15 minutes before concurring. Bush leads 39–3.
*At 8:00 pm, polls are closed in AL, CT, DE, DC, FL, IL, KS, ME, MD, MA, MI, MS, MO, NJ, OK, PA, TN, and TX. CNN, CBS, Fox, and NBC project Alabama, Oklahoma, and Tennessee for President Bush; Connecticut, Delaware, Washington DC, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine (at-large vote and first congressional district), New Jersey, and Vermont for Senator Kerry: current electoral vote is 77–66, Kerry ahead. ABC does not call Maine until a half-hour later and has Kerry ahead 74–66.
*NBC calls North Carolina for Bush, 81–77 for Bush
*CNN (and ABC, and possibly others) projects South Carolina (8), Virginia (13), Kansas (6), Nebraska (4), North Dakota (3), South Dakota (3), Texas (34) and Wyoming (3) for President Bush, and New York (31) and Rhode Island (4) for Senator Kerry. Projected count 155–112 for Bush. According to these numbers, both candidates have won the same states that their parties won in the 2000 election, but redistribution of districts means that the Democrats have lost 5 electoral votes and the Republicans have won 2 with respect to those elections.
*CNN and ABC project Louisiana (9) and Mississippi (6) for the president, leaving the count at 170–112 for the incumbent.
*FoxNewsChannel has Bush at 193–112 with Missouri (11), Arkansas (5) and Utah (5) now in the Bush column.
*ABC has Bush at 196–112, with Montana (3) for the president with Bush ahead in [[swing state]]s Florida and Ohio, but way behind in Pennsylvania.
*FoxNewsChannel says Bush has 75% chance of winning Florida
*CBS, CNN and FoxNewsChannel call Pennsylvania for Kerry, 196-133 for Bush. Florida would give Bush 223

*ABC calls Arizona (10) for Bush. 210-188.
*CNN won't call Florida but says Kerry camp is all but conceding there.
*ABC has Bush 237-Kerry 188
*ABC, BBC and CNN call Florida for Bush
*On CNN, Bush re-election committee chair [[Marc Racicot]] says we'll have a result tonight, seemed quietly confident of victory in Ohio and generally. Kerry camp still optimistic about Ohio.
*Kerry camp less optimistic now, according to FoxNews.
*ABC says Bush 237 Kerry 195; Fox says Bush 246 Kerry 206
*BBC, CNN, ABC and FoxNews call Colorado for Bush.
*Votes still being cast in Ohio. Peter Snow for the BBC estimates a Bush 279 Kerry 259 result if Bush takes Ohio; Kerry 'could get through the winning post otherwise'.
*Fox calls New Hampshire, plus 2nd Congressional District of Maine, for Kerry.
*Fox calls Ohio for Bush.
*BBC claims that the one Maine vote given to Bush has been given to Kerry, who now has all 4 Maine votes.

*After 1 a.m., CNN changes exit polling results in Ohio from Kerry ahead to Bush ahead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilcaonline.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=906&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0 ]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*BBC, ABC, CBS, CNN call Nevada for Bush. FOX News and MSNBC, who both earlier called Ohio for Bush, do not call Nevada for Bush—yet as of 4:07&amp;nbsp;a.m. EST. (Calling both for Bush would be equivalent to calling the presidency for Bush.)
*NBC calls Minnesota for Kerry.
*[[Tom Brokaw]] of NBC News refuses to call Nevada for Bush as long as outstanding absentee ballots (rumored to be as many as 60,000) have not been counted. Another reason for refusal is the contention by the Kerry camp that Ohio should not be called for Bush.
*BBC, CNN call Wisconsin for Kerry.
*On a special edition of ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', Tom Brokaw announces that NBC News will not call any more states for either candidate as long as the Kerry camp contests the Bush win in Ohio. This puts the NBC News electoral vote count at 269 for Bush and 238 for Kerry.
*White House Chief of Staff [[Andy Card]] claims victory for Bush before Kerry concedes or any of the networks call a winner.
*AP &amp; CNN report Kerry has called Bush and conceded the election. NBC finally calls Nevada for Bush.

* Bush declared victory at 3 p.m. EST saying, "America has spoken, and I'm humbled by the trust and the confidence of my fellow citizens. With that trust comes a duty to serve all Americans. And I will do my best to fulfill that duty every day as your president." Networks have still not declared victors in several states.
*"Black Box Voting (.ORG) is conducting the largest Freedom of Information action in history. At 8:30 p.m. Election Night, Black Box Voting blanketed the U.S. with the first in a series of public records requests, to obtain internal computer logs and other documents from 3,000 individual counties and townships.

*Voting machines controversy in PA. Before polls even opened in Philadelphia, 2,000 votes had already been cast on voting machines. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050522074416/http://www.drudgereport.com/vote1.htm Drudge Report].

*In Iowa, a glitch with an optical vote counting machine caused Greene County to not report results for 6 of 15 precincts. A replacement machine was brought in and counting resumed at 9:45&amp;nbsp;a.m., including recounting of the 9 precincts already counted. The count was finished in just over an hour and half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041104/NEWS09/411040398/1056 ]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The electoral vote for the United States Presidency is officially certified as 286 for Republican President George W. Bush, 251 for Democratic Senator John Kerry, and 1 for Democratic Senator John Edwards, leading to Bush's reelection, despite a formal challenge to Ohio's electoral votes, the first challenge since 1877, resulting in a vote — 1-74 (Yea-Nay) in the Senate and 31–267 in the House.

==Election incidents==
As of November 10, there were 31,515 reported incidents of voting problems nationally, with approx. 350 new incidents being reported a day. One-third of the problems (12,074) involved voter registration, followed by "polling place inquiries" (7,073), absentee ballot-related problems (3,218) and machine problems (1,599). The latter included complaints that some machines registered votes for George W. Bush when the voter selected John Kerry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://voteprotect.org/index.php?display=EIRMapCounty&amp;tab=ALL&amp;state=Ohio&amp;county=Mahoning&amp;cat=02&amp;start_time=&amp;start_date=&amp;end_time=&amp;end_date=&amp;search=&amp;go=Apply+filter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516234323/https://voteprotect.org/index.php?display=EIRMapCounty&amp;tab=ALL&amp;state=Ohio&amp;county=Mahoning&amp;cat=02&amp;start_time=&amp;start_date=&amp;end_time=&amp;end_date=&amp;search=&amp;go=Apply+filter |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 16, 2011 |title=VerifiedVoting.org : Index |publisher=Voteprotect.org |date= |accessdate=February 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some allege that voting locations that used electronic voting machines that did not issue a paper receipt or offer auditability correlate geographically with areas that had unilateral discrepancies between exit poll numbers and actual results. Exit polling data in these areas show significantly higher support for Kerry than actual results (outside the margin of error). Some are concerned that, from a statistical perspective, this may be indicative of [[vote rigging]], because the likelihood of this happening by chance is less than 1 in 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluelemur.com/index.php?p=405  |title=The Blue Lemur – Progressive Politics and Media News » Odds of Bush gaining by 4 percent in all exit polling states 1 in 50,000; Evoting/paper variance not found to be significant |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate= May 24, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050903013112/http://www.bluelemur.com/index.php?p=405 |archivedate = September 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out this could be explained by poor exit polling techniques or all discrepancies may be within the margin of error.&lt;ref&gt;CNN: [https://web.archive.org/web/20041106064509/http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/biztech/11/04/e.votingtested.ap/index.html E-vote goes smoothly, but experts skeptical.]  November 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado constitutional amendment===
&lt;div id="Colorado"&gt;* – Colorado had a constitutional amendment, [[Colorado Amendment 36|Amendment 36]], on the ballot this year which could have changed the process by which its electoral votes were distributed. The vote failed, so Colorado awarded all 9 of its electoral votes to Bush, the winner of the vote in that state. Results of the vote follow:

===Maine and Nebraska splits===
&lt;div id="Split"&gt;** – Maine and Nebraska are unlike the other 48 states and the District of Columbia in that they allocate their electoral votes in the following manner: 1 for the winner of each congressional district, 2 for the state winner. However, neither state split the vote, so each of these states effectively went winner-take-all.&lt;/div&gt;

===Pre-election odds===
* On [http://www.tradesports.com/ Tradesports], the Bush [[futures contract]] dropped from about 53, where it had been for several days before election, to about 30, in about an hour, but then rallied to 65–66 by 15:30 UTC. On [[Betfair]] the odds on a Bush victory increased from 1.75 at the beginning of the day, to 5.0 at 13:00 UTC, and moved down to 1.33 at 15:20 UTC.

* The price of [[crude oil|light crude oil]] dropped the day before election by nearly $1.63 (3.2%), amid speculation that a win for Kerry would result in the abolition of President Bush's maximum-capacity [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] policy.

The '''Turner Controversy''' was a dispute within the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] regarding the nature of [[socialism]] instigated by Tony Turner.  The dispute ultimately led to an exodus of members who went on to form the short-lived '''Movement for Social Integration'''.

When membership and activity was at a peak in the period after the [[Second World War]], Turner began giving lectures for the Party on what [[socialism]] would be like. The content of these lectures led
him to develop a position that caused enormous controversy in the Party by the early to mid-1950s and which was elaborated by Turner and his supporters in articles in the Party’s internal discussion journal of the time, ''Forum''.&lt;ref name ="Forum 26"&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Socialist Party of Great Britain
|authorlink=A. W. Turner
|title=Socialism - or Clause 6?, Forum 26
|location=London
|publisher=Socialist Party of Great Britain
|year=November 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three interlocking propositions underpinned the ‘Turnerite’ viewpoint:
# that the society of mass [[consumerism]] and [[automation|automated labour]] which [[capitalism]] had become had to be swept away in its entirety if alienation was to be abolished and a truly human community created. This meant a return to [[pre-industrial]] methods of production, on lines inspired by [[Tolstoy]] and [[William Morris]]’s ''[[News From Nowhere]]''.
# that the creation of the new socialist society was not simply in the interests of the [[working class]] but was in the interests of the whole of humanity, irrespective of class, a proposition they thought it essential for the Party to recognise in its everyday propaganda, and
# the means of creating the new peaceful and cooperative society had to be entirely peaceful, indeed [[pacifist]] (and in the view of some, possibly even gradual).
This view was in direct contradiction to the Party's Declaration of Principles, which identifies [[socialism]] as being the product of the [[class struggle]] and which states that the socialist
movement will organise for the capture of political power, including power over the state’s coercive machinery, should it need to be used against a recalcitrant anti-socialist minority.

A series of acrimonious disputes between the ‘Turnerites’ and the majority of the Party&lt;ref name ="Forum 28"&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Socialist Party of Great Britain
|authorlink=J. Trotman
|title=Socialism and Clause Six, Forum 28
|location=London
|publisher=Socialist Party of Great Britain
|year=January 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminated in a Party referendum and then a resolution being carried at the 1955 Party Conference to the effect that all members not in agreement with the Declaration of Principles be asked to resign. Turner, having survived a previous attempt to expel him, promptly did so, along with a number of other
members including [[Joan Lestor]] (later to become a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] minister) and the psychologist [[John Rowan (psychologist)|John Rowan]]. Some of these ex-members formed a short-lived Movement for Social Integration, though the impact the dispute had on the Party as a whole was almost entirely disruptive and negative. Indeed, it did not recover its vitality for some years, until the wave of radicalisation that grew up in the late 1960s.

The '''United Farmers of Quebec''' (''Fermiers unis du Québec'') were founded in 1920 as part of the broader [[United Farmers of Canada|United Farmers]] movement in of Canada.

The genesis of the organization was in protests resulting from the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] against the attempt of [[Robert Borden]]'s federal government to conscript farm youths into the Canadian military during World War I. Quebec farmers organized a large demonstration on [[Parliament Hill]] in Ottawa on May 15, 1918 bringing them into contact with the United Farmers national movement. 

The Quebec farmers organized 20 associations in western Quebec and in September 1918 organized the 
Interprovincial Union of Farmers as an umbrella group. A conference held in Montreal in January 1920 transformed this group into the United Farmers of Québec which, by 1921, had 5,000 members in 20 counties. 

In 1921, the United Farmers and the ''Union des cultivateurs du Québec'' formed the ''Parti fermier-progressiste du Québec'' (Progressive Farmers of Québec) with the support of [[Joseph-Noé Ponton]] and the ''Bulletin des agriculteurs''. 

The party was inspired by both the program of the [[Progressive Party of Canada]] (the political party of the national United Farmers movement) and the nationalism of [[Henri Bourassa]].

The party supported 21 candidates, most of whom ran in conjunction with the Progressive Party of Canada in the [[Canadian federal election, 1921|1921 federal election]], but none were elected. The farmers' candidates won 42,000 votes, or 11% of the total in Quebec. 

By 1924, the group had been overshadowed by the more conservative Catholic Union of Farmers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4324">'''Urban Land Committees''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Comités de Tierras Urbanas'', CTUs) are [[Venezuela]]n local neighbourhood committees which, in conjunction with [[Venezuelan Communal Councils]], develop [[land titling]] in urban areas. CTUs are organised and set up by local communities (around 100-200 families), in a [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] area defined by the community. Under a February 2002 decree, the CTUs can apply to a government office for the local "[[barrio]]" residents to be given [[property|property title]] for state-owned land they have informally occupied on a long-term basis. The CTUs operate on the principle of [[participatory democracy]], and create maps of the local area, on the basis of which (after official verification) land titles are drawn up.&lt;ref name=VA06/&gt; By early 2010, CTUs had obtained over 500,000 land titles, benefiting over 300,000 households.

==History==

By mid-2005, there were around 5000 CTUs, representing around 5m Venezuelans, and the government had issued over 84,000 titles to 126,000 families, benefiting about 630,000 inhabitants (out of a total urban poor population of around 10m).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Wilpert, ''[[Venezuelanalysis.com]]'', 12 September 2005, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/1355 Venezuela’s Quiet Housing Revolution: Urban Land Reform]&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2006 the government said that over 200,000 titles had been assigned, benefiting about 1m inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Collier, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 2 October 2006, "[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/1002-06.htm Venezuela's Oil Wealth Funds Gusher of Anti-Poverty Projects] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606022508/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/1002-06.htm |date=2009-06-06 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; and by early 2010 over 500,000 titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} YVKE, 12 April 2010, [http://www.radiomundial.com.ve/yvke/noticia.php?455431 Más de 500 mil títulos de tierra ha entregado el Gobierno en barrios venezolanos]&lt;/ref&gt; benefiting over 300,000 households.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} ''Correo del Caroni'', 22 September 2009, [http://www.correodelcaroni.com/archivo/archivo.php?id=136838 Marcharán por la reforma de Ley de Tierras Urbanas]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5122">In [[Germany|German]] [[corporate governance]], a '''''Vorstand''''' is the [[executive board]] of a [[corporation]] ([[public limited company]]). It is hierarchically subordinate to the [[supervisory board]] (''Aufsichtsrat''),&lt;ref name=Charkham&gt;{{cite book|title=Keeping Good Company: A Study of Corporate Governance in Five Countries|author=Jonathan P. Charkham|pages=14&amp;ndash;21|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-828987-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as German company law imposes a two-tier [[board of directors]].

German law confers executive powers on the executive board as a body. It is expected to act collectively and collegially. Unlike the [[Committee#Executive committee|executive committee]] (''aka'' operating committee or executive council) of a [[United States|US]] or [[United Kingdom|UK]] company, the executive board is not an adjunct of the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] (managing director). In contrast to [[Japan]]ese corporate governance, the German executive board has real decision-making power. It is, by law, the managing body of a company and cannot be instructed by any [[legal person]], be they natural or artificial, to act in such a way as to harm the business. Executive board members are personally liable for accepting any such instructions.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

The specific scope of an executive board's duties varies from business to business. (A group of companies may each have their own individual executive boards, for example). The president of the executive board (i.e., the CEO) and the position's role are determined by the supervisory board. German law permits, but does not require, executive board members to elect a president/CEO from among their number.  There are no specific legal requirements regarding the CEO's role, or even for the title given to the holder of the CEO position, although in practice the most common title is simply ''Vorstandsvorsitzender'', literally, "''Vorstand'' chairman". A noticeable minority refer to their CEOs as ''[[wikt:Sprecher|Sprecher]]'' (lit., "[[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]"), implying that the CEO is no more than ''[[primus inter pares]]''&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;; probably the best-known example for a company which uses this terminology is [[Deutsche Bank]].

The exact relationship between the CEO and the other executive officers depends on the company's type, how it was founded, and indeed the individual personalities of the people involved.  A family business could, for example, have a strong CEO who is a member of the founding family and exercises a great deal of power over the rest of the board.  In other companies, executive officers may hold themselves accountable to the executive board as a whole and not at all accountable to the CEO as an individual.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

The relationships among executive officers can vary too. It is common practice for board members to be senior executives with specific areas of functional responsibility. However, the law requires that they oversee the activities of their fellow officers, since they are still personally liable for any failings outside their specific departments/subdivisions.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt; Each board member has one vote.  Decisions are ''never'' escalated, when there is a lack of [[consensus]], to the supervisory board. Executive board meetings are commonly held on a weekly basis and can last up to a whole day.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

Formally, the power to appoint executive officers to the board lies with the supervisory board, which can appoint officers with a two-thirds majority vote of approval, or a simple majority if multiple rounds of voting are required in order to reach a decision.  Since up to 50% of the supervisory board members are delegates of the employees (or even external trade union representatives, for details see [[Co-determination in Germany|Mitbestimmung]]), this prevents employees from blocking the appointment of executive officers to the executive board.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

Executive officers have a certain degree of [[job security]], which is partly a preventative measure aimed at ensuring that executive boards are not dominated and that they are not "packed" with hand-picked appointees. Officers are usually appointed for the maximum statutory term—5 years. Removal must be for good cause, such as serious [[Breach of duty in English law|breach of duty]], and is subject to the supervisory board's veto. When an executive officer's ability to perform his duties is diminished due to old age, it is customary for him to serve out the remainder of his term but with a deputy to help perform his duties. Neither the shareholders nor the executive board can compel an officer to retire, whereas the supervisory board can.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

Commonly, the CEO receives between 30% and 50% greater salary than that of the other executive officers. An officer's remuneration usually comprises 65% basic salary, and 35% that is equally split between annual bonuses and benefits.&lt;ref name=Charkham /&gt;

The '''Working Definition of Antisemitism''' is a non-legally binding working definition of [[antisemitism]] adopted by the inter-governmental body the [[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance]] (IHRA), and governmental and non-governmental organizations worldwide. The definition (which is published accompanied by illustrative examples) is:&lt;ref name=workdef/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It was developed during 2003–04 and first published on 28 January 2005 on the website of the [[European Union]] agency, the [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC).{{sfn|Stern|2010}}&lt;ref name="Elman2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

==Background==
The EUMC grew from the Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (CRX), established in 1994, and also known as the Kahn Commission. The CRX was transformed into the EUMC in June 1998; officially established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1035/97 of 2 June 1997. Its mandate was to monitor different forms of racism and xenophobia. In 2002, it published a large-scale monitoring report on [[Islamophobia]] since [[9/11]], including a total of 75 reports, 15 from each member state and a synthesis report.&lt;ref name=AllenNielsen&gt;{{cite web

This was to be followed by a comparable report on antisemitism. 

A report entitled ''Manifestations of antisemitism in the EU 2002–2003'' was published in May 2004,&lt;ref name="Manifestations"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any acts or attitudes that are based on the perception of a social subject (individual, group, institution, or state) as "the ('deceitful', 'corrupt', 'conspiratorial', etc.) Jew".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The report also explored the question of when anti-Zionist or anti-Israel expression might be antisemitic (pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14) and highlighted the need to develop a common EU definition in order to collect and compare incidents across countries (pp.&amp;nbsp;25–29).

In December 2003, the [[Centre for Research on Antisemitism]] (ZfA) analyzed a pre-release version of this EUMC report. The ZfA report was leaked to the press and poorly received. According to civil rights lawyer [[Kenneth L. Marcus]], in the report the primary cause of rising antisemitism in Europe was assigned to young Muslim males,&lt;ref name="Marcus152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth L. Marcus|title=The Definition of Anti-Semitism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=767fCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152|date=17 July 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937565-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in a press release for the subsequent final publication the EUMC assigned the rise in antisemitism to "young, disaffected white Europeans." Marcus writes, the larger issue was missed that the definition of antisemitism that the EUMC used was based on "seven stereotypical traits: deceptiveness, strange-ness, hostility, greed, corruption, conspiratorial power, and deicidal murderousness."&lt;ref name="Marcus153"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth L. Marcus|authorlink=Kenneth L.

Following the EUMC report, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE)'s Berlin Declaration recognised that post WW2 antisemitism had changed and was now at times directed against Jews as a collective and Israel as an embodiment of the Jew.&lt;ref name="Marcus159–160"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth L. Marcus|authorlink=Kenneth L. Marcus|title=The Definition of Anti-Semitism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=767fCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=17 July 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937565-3|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlin Declaration also tasked the OSCE's [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR) to work with the EUMC to develop better ways to monitor antisemitic incidents in OSCE countries.&lt;ref name="Marcus159–160"/&gt; At the same time, according to Marcus, the EUMC, largely due to pressure from American Jewish organizations, scrapped its failed definition of antisemitism.&lt;ref name="Marcus161"/&gt;

===2004 Stern, Porat and Bauer version===
Israeli scholar [[Dina Porat]], then head of the [[Stephen Roth Institute]] at [[Tel Aviv University]], proposed the idea for a common definition during an NGO conference organized by the [[American Jewish Committee]] (AJC).{{sfn|Stern|2010}}  [[Kenneth S. Stern]] of the AJC, a human rights lawyer, was critical of the EUMC's original definition, as it was confusing about when attacks on Jews related to the Israel/Palestine conflict could be considered antisemitic, and required investigators to know the intentions of attackers.{{sfn|Stern|2010}} Meanwhile, the EUMC asked "selected Jewish NGOs and academics to provide a simple working definition that would encompass antisemitic demonization of Israel, and which could also be used by their own RAXEN network of national focal points and by law enforcement agencies."&lt;ref name="Whine 2010"/&gt;

During 2003-04, involving the "efforts of a large number of institutes and individual experts",{{sfn | Porat | 2011 | pp=93–101}} and coordinated by Stern, together with Dina Porat, [[Holocaust]] scholars [[Yehuda Bauer]], [[Michael Berenbaum]] and Roni Stauber, the [[Community Security Trust]]'s Michael Whine, human rights expert [[Felice D. Gaer]], and others, a proposed definition and set of examples was drafted.{{sfn|Stern|2010}}&lt;ref name="Marcus161–162"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth L. Marcus|title=The Definition of Anti-Semitism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=767fCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161|date=17 July 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937565-3|pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dina Porat, [https://archive.today/20121218121748/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/porat.htm Defining Antisemitism], in ''Anti-Semitism  Worldwide 2003/4'', Tel Aviv University, 2005, pp. 5-17&lt;/ref&gt; Stern's draft working definition identified that some [[criticism of Israel]] and of [[Zionism]] are antisemitic: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Antisemitism is hatred toward Jews because they are Jews and is directed toward the Jewish religion and Jews individually or collectively. More recently, antisemitism has been manifested in the demonization of the State of Israel.

Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. (It may also be manifested on people mistaken as Jews, or on non-Jews seen as sympathetic to Jews.){{sfn|Stern|2006}}&lt;ref name="Marcus161"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This was then followed by a list of illustrative examples, including five examples of the ways in which antisemitism manifests itself with regard to
the State of Israel.{{sfn|Stern|2006}} According to both Ken Marcus and Antony Lerman, the novel element in Stern's draft definition was identifying certain forms of criticism of Israel and Zionism as antisemitic,&lt;ref name="Marcus161"/&gt;{{sfn|Lerman|2018a}} and Marcus also highlights the "[[Praxeology|praxeological]]" nature of the definition and its examples, i.e. its focus on pragmatic identification rather than scholarly understanding.&lt;ref name="Marcus161"/&gt;

At the suggestion of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), the EUMC director organized a meeting of Jewish representatives to discuss the new definition of antisemitism which had been drafted by Kenneth Stern;{{sfn|Stern|2010}} the consultation involved representatives of the AJC and [[European Jewish Congress]], the EUMC director and head of research, and the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination program director and antisemitism expert.&lt;ref name="Whine 2010"/&gt; The outcome was negotiated between Andrew Baker, Stern's colleague at the AJC, and Beate Winkler, director of the EUMC.{{sfn|Stern|2010}} Again Stern was tasked with drafting the final text.{{sfn|Stern|2017}} Additionally, according to Michael Whine of the Community Security Trust, "the Director of the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination Division and the Advisor on Antisemitism played an active role in formulating the Working Definition."{{sfn|Whine|2010}}

On 28 January 2005, the EUMC published on its website a working definition of [[antisemitism]] which shared many features of Stern's earlier draft.&lt;ref name="Marcus161–162"/&gt; Winkler published the definition "without formal review by her political overseers".&lt;ref name="Marcus166–167"/&gt; The definition included the concept of collective antisemitism. Several examples relate to animus towards Israel, including both Holocaust inversion and the application of double standards to Israel.&lt;ref name="Marcus161–162"/&gt; The definition states that "However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic."&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;[http://kantorcenter.tau.ac.il/sites/default/files/WORKING%20DEFINITION%20OF%20ANTISEMITISM.pdf Working definition of Antisemitism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124202101/http://kantorcenter.tau.ac.il/sites/default/files/WORKING%20DEFINITION%20OF%20ANTISEMITISM.pdf |date=24 November 2015 }}. The European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated purpose of the definition was to "provide a guide for identifying incidents, collecting data and supporting the implementation and enforcement of legislation dealing with antisemitism", and the working definition stated: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of [[Jews]], which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."&lt;ref name="definition"/&gt;

The EUMC separated the working definition with 11 examples. This was presented as two separate groups, the first six examples were antisemitic tropes and the following five examples were introduced with the sentence: "Examples of the ways in which antisemitism manifests itself with regard to the state of Israel taking into account the overall context could include".{{sfn|Lerman|2018a}} Marcus writes that it was a "working definition" in two senses: a working guide to identifying antisemitism in practice, and a work-in-progress as opposed to a final statement to be approved by the EU's political leadership: "for this reason, formal endorsement was neither sought nor obtained."&lt;ref name="Marcus161–162"/&gt; 

The EUMC working definition was prominently referenced by the OSCE Cordoba conference in June that year.{{sfn | Porat | 2011 | pp=93–101}} The definition was promoted by the AJC, other American Jewish organizations, national Jewish representative bodies, Jewish defence organizations, the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli government]], pro-Israeli-advocacy groups, and was approved by the OSCE and other pan-European organizations.{{sfn|Lerman|2018a}} The EUMC working definition was widely criticized and the organization was put under pressure by supporters and critics of the definition.{{sfn|Lerman|2018a}} The EUMC never granted any official status to the definition{{sfn|Feldman|2016}} and claimed that the definition was not wholly endorsed by them; it was only on its website as a guide, a basis for discussion.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In 2007, the EU replaced the EUMC with the [[Fundamental Rights Agency]] (FRA), with a broader remit than racism and antisemitism. It has continued to deliver annual reports of antisemitic incidents in the EU countries, based on data from its national contact points.&lt;ref name="Author 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Leviev-Sawyer| first=Clive  | title=Bulgaria among 11 EU countries lacking official data on anti-Semitic incidents – European rights agency | website=The Sofia Globe | date=9 November 2017 | url=https://sofiaglobe.com/2017/11/09/bulgaria-among-11-eu-countries-lacking-official-data-on-anti-semitic-incidents-european-rights-agency/ | access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whine IAJLJ"&gt;Michael Whine ''[https://cst.org.uk/public/data/file/1/2/legal%20protections%20for%20jews.pdf Improving Legal and Other Protections for Europe’s Jews]" in ''[http://intjewishlawyers.org/justice/no59/#6 JUSTICE The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists]'', No.59, pp.7-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of the EUMC definition===
In 2008, the European Forum on Antisemitism commissioned translations of the Working Definition into each of the 33 languages used by the OSCE states.{{sfn|Whine|2010}}

In 2010, Stern wrote that "In the last five years, the definition has been increasingly used, because it is provides a workable, non-ideological approach to task of identifying antisemitism."{{sfn|Stern|2010}} The definition was used by monitoring agencies and law enforcement officials in some European countries. According to Stern, by 2010, the definition had &lt;blockquote&gt;been referenced or relied upon in or by courts (in Lithuanian and Germany), congressional hearings in the United States, online reference tools, newspapers, blogs, scholarly articles, legal articles, radio shows, student groups, museums, national inquiries of parliamentarians (most importantly in the UK), international meetings of parliamentarians, United States Department of State Reports, The United States Commission on Civil Rights, and in submissions to the United Nations Economic and Social Council Commission on Human Rights, Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights... It continues to be referenced more and more because of its clear utility. {{sfn|Stern|2010}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; For example, in [[Lithuania]], it was referred to in a successful criminal case against an editor of a [[Respublika (Lithuanian newspaper)|right-wing newspaper]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Decision, Vilnius District 2 Court, Judge A. Cinnas, #A11-01087-497/2005, 7 July 2005. Cited in Porat, Dina, "[http://www.tau.ac.il/AntSemitism/asw2003-4/porat.htm Defining Antisemitism]," Stephen Roth Institute, and Stern, Kenneth, "The Working Definition – A Reappraisal" ''[http://kantorcenter.tau.ac.il/sites/default/files/proceeding-all.pdf The Working Definition of Antisemitism – Six Years After] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816042052/http://kantorcenter.tau.ac.il/sites/default/files/proceeding-all.pdf |date=16 August 2014 }}'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition was used to some extent by some intergovernmental and EU agencies. For example, the OSCE used the definition in a  2005 report ''Education on the Holocaust and Antisemitism: An Overview and Analysis of Educational Approaches.''{{sfn|Stern|2010}} By 2010 it was recommended in the course leaders’ Facilitators Guide in the OSCE OHDIR programme to assist law enforcement officials to understand and investigate [[hate crime]], and at the 2010 OSCE High Level Conference on Tolerance and Non-Discrimination in Astana urged participating states to use and promote the Working Definition.{{sfn|Stern|2010}}{{sfn|Whine|2010}} In February 2009, the Inter-parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism conference, in the ''London Declaration on Combating Antisemitism'', issued a call to governments to expand the use of the Working Definition.{{sfn|Whine|2010}}

Canadian Members of Parliament adopted a resolution to combat antisemitism in 2007 that cited the definition, and the Australian [[Online Hate Prevention Institute]].&lt;ref name="Elman2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Amy Elman [https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154939623.pdf Sidestepping Lethal Antisemitism – The EU's Response in the Aftermath of Terror], March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The definition is used by the Justice Ministers of [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] in training prosecutors and judges.&lt;ref name="Baker 2017 Defining"&gt;{{cite web | last=Baker | first=Andrew | title=Defining Anti-Semitism Is The First Step Towards Stopping It | website=The Forward | date=10 November 2017 | url=https://forward.com/opinion/387390/defining-anti-semitism-is-the-first-step-towards-stopping-it/ | access-date=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also adopted formally by other governmental and non-governmental organizations in some countries.

====United Kingdom====
In 2006, the [[All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism]] recommended that the UK adopt the definition and that it be promoted by the Government and law enforcement agencies.{{sfn|Whine|2010}} The Government Response the following year recognised the "useful work being done by the EUMC in identifying antisemitic discourse", noted that the government accepted the definition of racism in the [[MacPherson Report]] on [[institutional racism]] and that this subsumed the EUMC and went further. It also noted that "from the EUMC's evidence to the Committee", the "definition is in fact a work in progress and has not been recommended to states for adoption". However, it undertook to re-examine this if the EUMC's successor body, the FRA, did recommend it for adoption,&lt;ref name="inquiry"/&gt; an undertaking it repeated the following year in its progress report on implementing the Inquiry's recommendations, noting this had been delayed by the process of transforming into the FRA delayed this.&lt;ref&gt;All-Party Inquiry into Antisemitism: Government Response – One year on Progress Report, p. 6, Cm 7351, 12 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Whine|2010}} In 2009, the leaders of the Labour and Conservative parties signed the ''London Declaration'' endorsing the definition.{{sfn|Whine|2010}}

The [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] formally adopted the Working Definition at its 2007 Conference. Some individual students unions followed suit, although at others motions to do so were defeated.{{sfn|Whine|2010}} In 2011, the [[University and College Union]] passed a resolution opposing the use of the definition, which led to the [[Jewish Leadership Council]] and [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] describing the union as "institutionally antisemitic".&lt;ref name="Hirsh 2004"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hirsh | first=David | title=Defining antisemitism down | website=Fathom | date=31 March 2004 | url=http://fathomjournal.org/defining-antisemitism-down/ | access-date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn | Porat | 2011 | pp=93–101}}

On 1 January 2015, Professor [[David Feldman (lawyer)|David Feldman]] stated in a Sub-Report for the Parliamentary Committee Against Antisemitism that the definition had "largely has fallen out of favour" due to criticisms received.&lt;ref&gt;Professor David Feldman, [http://archive.jpr.org.uk/download?id=1582 Sub-Report for the Parliamentary Committee Against Antisemitism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031014143/http://archive.jpr.org.uk/download?id=1582 |date=31 October 2017 }}, 1 January 2015, page 4: "However, the definition itself rapidly became a topic of controversy rather than consensus. The points at issue included what the status of a 'working definition' actually was, whether the working definition was an effective and coherent definition at all, and, finally, controversy dogged the application of the working definition to debate on the State of Israel and its policies. The criticisms have been damaging and the EUMC working definition largely has fallen out of favour."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/136/136.pdf House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, Antisemitism in the UK, Tenth Report of Session 2016–17] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009100043/https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/136/136.pdf |date=9 October 2017 }}, 16 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]], after investigating campus antisemitism, adopted the definition, to help universities identify the lines between hateful and non-hateful incidents.&lt;ref name="Marcus 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Marcus | first=Kenneth L. | title=Why universities need a definition of anti-Semitism | website=The Jerusalem Post &amp;#124; JPost.com | date=6 July 2015 | url=https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Why-universities-need-a-definition-of-anti-Semitism-408178 | access-date=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the EUMC definition was adopted as "an initial guide" by the [[Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism]] within the U.S. Department of State, stating that it "should not be construed... as United States policy".&lt;ref name="ajc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ajc.org/news/defining-anti-semitism-is-the-first-step-towards-stopping-it|title=Defining Anti-Semitism Is The First Step Towards Stopping It|author=Andrew Baker|date=10 November 2017|publisher=American Jewish Committee|access-date=8 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807114649/https://www.ajc.org/news/defining-anti-semitism-is-the-first-step-towards-stopping-it|archive-date=7 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/56589.htm Fact Sheet, Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, Washington, DC, February 8, 2007, "Working Definition" of Anti-Semitism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117115543/https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/56589.htm |date=17 November 2017 }}: "In light of the longstanding commitment of the U.S. to free speech and other individual freedoms as demonstrated within our Constitution, the Office of the Special Envoy believes that this definition provides an adequate initial guide by which anti-Semitism can eventually both be defined and combated, and therefore presents this "working definition" as a starting point in the fight against anti-Semitism. [Footnote: The recitation of the EUMC "working definition" of anti-Semitism should not be construed as an acceptance of that definition, or the statements and examples thereunder, as United States policy.]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the State Department again endorsed the Working Definition in their ''Contemporary Global Antisemitism'' report to Congress, noting that “a widely accepted definition of antisemitism can be useful in setting the parameters of the issue. Such a definition also helps to identify the statistics that are needed and focuses attention on the issues that policy initiatives should address….The EUMC’s working definition provides a useful framework for identifying and understanding the problem and is adopted for the purposes of this report.”{{sfn|Whine|2010}}&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State 2009"&gt;{{cite web | title=Contemporary Global Anti-Semitism:A Report Provided to the United States Congress | website=U.S. Department of State | date=20 January 2009 | url=//2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/102406.htm | access-date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010 the State Department adopted a definition based on the EUMC definition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/fs/2010/122352.htm Defining Anti-Semitism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318120526/https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/fs/2010/122352.htm |date=18 March 2018 }}, 8 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It used exactly the same headline definition as the EUMC definition, but made various modifications to the examples,&lt;ref name="ajc.org"/&gt; to incorporate Israeli politician [[Natan Sharansky]]'s [[3D Test of Antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="Cardaun2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cardaun|first=Sarah K.|title=Countering Contemporary Antisemitism in Britain: Government and Civil Society Responses between Universalism and Particularism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_XjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79|date=19 June 2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-30089-7|pages=79–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marcus, while it was in effect the State Department definition was more important in determining U.S. government foreign policy than the EUMC definition since it represented an official policy position.&lt;ref name="Marcus23"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth L. Marcus|authorlink=Kenneth L.

In 2011, the AJC's Ken Stern and [[Cary Nelson]], President of the [[American Association of University Professors]] published a letter stating that "It is a perversion of the definition to use it, as some are doing, in an attempt to censor what a professor, student, or speaker can say";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/news/cary-nelson-and-kenneth-stern-pen-open-letter-campus-antisemitism#.W3NSfqTTWaN|title=Cary Nelson and Kenneth Stern Pen Open Letter on Campus Antisemitism|website=www.aaup.org|access-date=14 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815024935/https://www.aaup.org/news/cary-nelson-and-kenneth-stern-pen-open-letter-campus-antisemitism#.W3NSfqTTWaN|archive-date=15 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; this generated significant controversy within the American Jewish community.&lt;ref name=Marcus21/&gt;

The State Department has since adopted the IHRA definition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/rga/resources/267538.htm State Department Resources] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726121340/https://www.state.gov/s/rga/resources/267538.htm |date=26 July 2018 }}: "As a member of IHRA, the United States now uses this working definition and has encouraged other governments and international organizations to use it as well."&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2016, [[Peter Roskam]] and [[Tim Scott]] introduced a bipartisan bill in the [[House of Representatives|House]] and [[Senate]] on combating antisemitism on campus, under the title of The Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, to codify the working definition. It would require the US Department of Education to refer to the definition in deciding if educational institutions had violated Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] by tolerating antisemitic harassment. It was passed in the [[Senate]],&lt;ref name="JPost Jew v Jew"/&gt; and on 22 December 2016 it was were referred to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|114|h|6421}} and {{USBill|114|s|10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hearing was held on 7 November 2017;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://judiciary.house.gov/hearing/examining-anti-semitism-college-campuses/|title=Examining Anti-Semitism on College Campuses|publisher=House Judiciary Committee|access-date=14 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815030207/https://judiciary.house.gov/hearing/examining-anti-semitism-college-campuses/|archive-date=15 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; it "took a heated turn" as four of the nine witnesses argued that the definition infringes on freedom of speech regarding Israel.&lt;ref name="JPost Jew v Jew"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Its-Jew-vs-Jew-as-Congress-weighs-a-new-definition-for-antisemitism-513941|title=It's Jew vs. Jew as Congress weighs a new definition for antisemitism|publisher=Jeruslem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohler-Esses 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cohler-Esses | first=Larry | title=Congress Is Trying To Decide Who’s An Anti-Semite | website=The Forward | date=9 November 2017 | url=https://forward.com/news/breaking-news/387245/congress-is-trying-to-decide-whos-an-anti-semite/ | access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trachtenberg Trachtenberg 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Trachtenberg | first=Barry | last2=Trachtenberg | first2=Barry | title=Opinion - It Protects Israel | website=The Forward | date=3 July 2018 | url=https://forward.com/opinion/404591/the-anti-semitism-awareness-act-wouldnt-protect-jews-it-would-protect/ | access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FRA removal===
The EUMC did not adopt the definition, and in November 2013, its successor agency, the [[Fundamental Rights Agency]] (FRA), removed it from its website in "a clear-out of non-official documents"; a spokesperson stated at the time that "We are not aware of any official definition [of anti-Semitism]".&lt;ref name=JTA&gt;[https://www.jta.org/2013/12/04/news-opinion/world/eu-anti-racism-agency-unable-to-define-anti-semitism-official-says EU anti-racism agency unable to define anti-Semitism, official says] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809122845/https://www.jta.org/2013/12/04/news-opinion/world/eu-anti-racism-agency-unable-to-define-anti-semitism-official-says |date=9 August 2018 }}, JTA, 4 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiesenthal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=8776547&amp;ct=13381863 |title=SWC to EU Baroness Ashton: "Return Anti-Semitism Definition Document to EU Fundamental Rights Agency Website" &amp;#124; Simon Wiesenthal Center |website=Wiesenthal.com |date=6 November 2013 |accessdate=17 February 2016 |quote=In a letter to European Union Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Catherine Ashton, the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's Director for International Relations, Dr. Shimon Samuels, noted "The Trust has now, apparently, reversed its ruling following the Definition's removal, claiming: 'A press officer at the FRA has explained that this was a discussion paper and was never adopted by the EU as a working definition, although it has been on the FRA website until recently when it was removed during a clear-out of non-official documents.

The EUMC and IHRA definitions are set out differently. The EUMC 38-word working definition is distinguished from the rest of the text by being set in bold type. The same text in the IHRA definition is not only also in bold type, it's enclosed in a box which contains the longer part of a prefatory sentence that begins outside the box.{{sfn|Lerman|2018b}} The European Coordination of Committees and Associations for Palestine states that on 12 September 2017 the IHRA Permanent Office in Berlin replied to their inquiry thusly.

In March 2016, the UK government published a short article on defining antisemitism, authored by [[Eric Pickles]], then [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]], which stated "for those seeking a definition of antisemitism, the UK’s [[College of Policing]] does include a working definition of antisemitism [i.e. the EUMC working definition] in their guidance to police forces in the UK", which was then quoted in full in the article, this definition was the EUMC working definition.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/a-definition-of-antisemitism A definition of antisemitism]" Published 30 March 2016 Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon Lord Pickles.

Among the Committee's recommendations were "that the IHRA definition, with our additional caveats, should be formally adopted by the UK Government, law enforcement agencies and all political parties, to assist them in determining whether or not an incident or discourse can be regarded as antisemitic."&lt;ref name="HAC"&gt;Home Affairs Committee ''[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/136/13602.htm 10th Report - Antisemitism in the UK]'', October 2016.

In December, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]] responded that it had agreed to adopt the IHRA definition, but that the caveats were unnecessary given the definition's clause “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic” is sufficient to ensure freedom of speech. The government also noted that the police already used a previous version of the definition (the EUMC version) and that it "is a useful tool for criminal justice agencies and other public bodies to use to understand how anti-Semitism manifests itself in the 21st century".&lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/576792/CM9386_-_Select_Comittee_Response_-_Antisemitism_in_UK.pdf Government Response to Home Affairs Committee Report: ‘Anti-Semitism in the UK’].

In July 2018, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC) adopted without a vote&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/labour-rejects-ihra-definition-antisemitism-nec-1.467291|title=Labour Rejects IHRA Definition|author=Jewish Chronicle|access-date=16 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917105109/https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/labour-rejects-ihra-definition-antisemitism-nec-1.467291|archive-date=17 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; a definition of antisemitism based on the IHRA definition, although it removed or amended four out of eleven examples of what allegedly constitutes antisemitism, added an additional three examples and amended points showing how criticising Israel can be antisemitic.{{sfn|Klug|2018a}} Labour said the wording in the code of conduct "expands on and contextualises" the IHRA examples. The Shadow Solicitor-General, [[Nick Thomas-Symonds]], said many of IHRA's examples were "adopted word for word in our code of conduct" while "the ground is covered" for others. He said: "We should be going further than the IHRA definition and the language of the code is at times much stronger. We need to expand on a lot of the examples to ensure that we have a legally enforceable code so that we can enforce discipline as everyone wants to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-44923669/labour-rejects-anti-semitism-claims|first=|last=|title=Labour rejects anti-Semitism claims|work=BBC News|date=23 July 2018|accessdate=27 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023074833/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-44923669/labour-rejects-anti-semitism-claims|archive-date=23 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NEC's modified examples sparked criticism amid [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|allegations of antisemitism]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/comment/analysis/jeremy-corbyn-labour-definition-antisemitism-1.466626 Jeremy Corbyn Labour Definition Antisemitism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811062301/https://www.thejc.com/comment/analysis/jeremy-corbyn-labour-definition-antisemitism-1.466626 |date=11 August 2018 }}, The Jewish Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt; leading the NEC to announce that it would review the decision in consultation with the UK Jewish community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A statement by the UK Delegation to the IHRA stated that "Any 'modified' version of the IHRA definition that does not include all of its 11 examples is no longer the IHRA definition. Adding or removing language undermines the months of international diplomacy and academic rigour that enabled this definition to exist. If one organization or institution can amend the wording to suit its own needs, then logically anyone else could do the same. We would once again revert to a world where antisemitism goes unaddressed simply because different entities cannot agree on what it is."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/ihra-warns-labour-against-undermining-its-antisemitism-definition-1.468105 IHRA Warns Labour against undermining its antisemitism definition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825074243/https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/ihra-warns-labour-against-undermining-its-antisemitism-definition-1.468105 |date=25 August 2018 }}, The Jewish Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/index.php/news-archive/statement-experts-uk-delegation-ihra-working-definition-antisemitism|title=Statement by Experts of the UK Delegation to the IHRA on the Working Definition of Antisemitism|website=IHRA|access-date=25 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825110328/https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/index.php/news-archive/statement-experts-uk-delegation-ihra-working-definition-antisemitism|archive-date=25 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Antony Lerman]] pointed out that "the administration of the IHRA itself confirmed unequivocally that the definition and the examples were separate things.

In September 2018, the NEC decided to add all 11 IHRA examples (unamended) to the definition of antisemitism.&lt;ref name="SabSep18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full|title=Labour adopts IHRA antisemitism definition in full|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|date=4 September 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=16 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916081456/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full|archive-date=16 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://labourlist.org/2018/09/leaks-antisemitism-and-democracy-review-alice-perrys-latest-nec-report/|title=Leaks, antisemitism and democracy review – Alice Perry's latest NEC report {{!}} LabourList|date=5 September 2018|work=LabourList {{!}} Labour's biggest independent grassroots e-network|access-date=16 September 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917071357/https://labourlist.org/2018/09/leaks-antisemitism-and-democracy-review-alice-perrys-latest-nec-report/|archive-date=17 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] voted by a majority of 205 to adopt the unamended definition to their standing orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/05/labour-votes-full-antisemitism-ihra-terms-party-standing-orders|title=Labour votes for full antisemitism terms in standing orders|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|date=5 September 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=16 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917181607/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/05/labour-votes-full-antisemitism-ihra-terms-party-standing-orders|archive-date=17 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the month, a report by the Media Reform Coalition examined over 250 articles and broadcast news segments of coverage of Labour's revised code of conduct on antisemitism, and found over 90 examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. The research found evidence of "overwhelming source imbalance" in which critics of Labour's code of conduct dominated coverage which failed to include quotes from those defending the code, critiquing the IHRA working definition and key contextual facts about the IHRA working definition.&lt;ref name="MRC"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Flawed reporting on antisemitism claims against the Labour party|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/30/flawed-reporting-on-antisemitism-claims-against-the-labour-party|accessdate=30 September 2018|work=The Guardian|date=5 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930200257/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/30/flawed-reporting-on-antisemitism-claims-against-the-labour-party|archive-date=30 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other political parties====
In July 2018, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] claimed it had adopted the definition in full. However, at the time their code of conduct approved in December 2017, which only governs the behavior of anyone representing the Party as an elected or appointed official or office-holder, didn't mention antisemitism or specify a definition of it. Since then their code has been amended to include an interpretive annexe on discrimination, which does refer to the IHRA definition and says it was adopted in December 2016 (the date the Conservative ''government'' adopted the definition).&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/05/the-ihra-definition-of-antisemitism-where-uk-parties-stand|title=The IHRA definition of antisemitism: where UK parties stand|last=Weaver|first=Matthew|date=5 September 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001232613/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/05/the-ihra-definition-of-antisemitism-where-uk-parties-stand|archive-date=1 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conservatives.com/codeofconduct|title=CODE OF CONDUCT FOR CONSERVATIVE PARTY REPRESENTATIVES|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Lee | first=Georgina | title=FactCheck: Conservative party rulebook doesn’t mention antisemitism | website=Channel 4 News | date=20 July 2018 | url=https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-conservative-party-rulebook-doesnt-mention-antisemitism | access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] formally adopted the IHRA definition with the working examples.&lt;ref name="Weaver"/&gt;

In October, [[Green Party of England and Wales]] did not adopt the definition. Their home affairs spokesman and former deputy leader, [[Shahrar Ali]], told their annual conference the definition was "politically engineered to restrict criticism of Israel's heinous crimes upon the Palestinian people".&lt;ref name="Harpin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harpin|first=Lee|url=https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/green-party-fails-to-adopt-ihra-antisemitism-definition-at-conference-1.470718|title=Green Party fails to adopt IHRA antisemitism definition at Conference|work=The Jewish Chronicle|date=10 October 2018|accessdate=17 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017123738/https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/green-party-fails-to-adopt-ihra-antisemitism-definition-at-conference-1.470718|archive-date=17 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Academic===
In March 2005, [[Brian Klug]] argued that this definition proscribed legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring [[criticism of Israel]] into the category of antisemitism, and does not sufficiently distinguish between criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology, on the one hand, and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Perry]] (Ed.),  Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009, pp 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, [[David Feldman (historian)|David Feldman]] wrote: "While some consensus is needed in this debate, I fear this definition is imprecise, and isolates antisemitism from other forms of bigotry." He added: "The text also carries dangers. It trails a list of 11 examples. Seven deal with criticism of Israel. Some of the points are sensible, some are not. Crucially, there is a danger that the overall effect will place the onus on Israel's critics to demonstrate they are not antisemitic."{{sfn|Feldman|2016}}

In July 2018, [[Antony Lerman]] wrote: "investing all in the IHRA working definition of antisemitism is just making matters worse. This is the time to take the path to working with other minority groups, civil society organizations and human rights bodies to confront antisemitism within the context of a wider antiracist struggle, not to perpetuate the notion that Jews stand alone."{{sfn|Lerman|2018a}} He later stated that "the case against IHRA is so strong" and "...the fundamental principle that IHRA is so flawed it should be abandoned..."{{sfn|Lerman|2018b}}

In the same month, Klug wrote: "...critics maintain that Labour (or anyone else) has to adopt the IHRA document 'in full'. But the text is not written in stone. It is a working definition with working examples. It is a living document, subject to revision and constantly needing to be adapted to the different contexts in which people apply its definition... But people of goodwill who genuinely want to solve the conundrum – combating antisemitism while protecting free political speech – should welcome the code as a constructive initiative, and criticise it constructively... For this to happen, the seas of language are going to have to subside and critics must stop treating the IHRA document as immutable. In the Judaism in which I was nurtured and educated, there is only one text whose status is sacred; and it was not written by a committee of the IHRA."{{sfn|Klug|2018b}}

In February 2017, a letter signed by 244 academics asserts "this definition seeks to conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism" and raised concerns about muddying the definition of anti-Semitism and restricting free debate on Israel. The academics included [[Conor Gearty]], [[Dorothy Griffiths]], [[Moshé Machover]], [[Iain Chalmers]], [[Steven Rose]], [[Gilbert Achcar]], [[Penny Green (criminologist)|Penny Green]], [[Marian Hobson]], [[Erica Burman]], [[Richard Seaford]], [[Colin Eden]], [[Neil Davidson, Baron Davidson of Glen Clova|Neil Davidson]], [[Catherine Cobham]], [[Matthew Beaumont]], [[Richard Bornat]], [[Paul Taylor (professor)|Paul Taylor]], [[Ray Bush]], [[Michael Edwards (academic)|Michael Edwards]], [[Peter Collins (academic)|Peter Collins]], [[Elizabeth Cowie]], [[Mona Baker]], [[Laleh Khalili]], [[Aneez Esmail]], [[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]], [[Pat Devine]], [[Daphne Hampson]], [[Clément Mouhot]], [[Peter Hallward]], [[Frank Land]], [[Stephen G.

In August 2018, Professor Rebecca Ruth Gould published the first extended scholarly critique of the IHRA definition: ''Legal Form and Legal Legitimacy: The IHRA Definition of Antisemitism as a Case Study in Censored Speech''. Gould described "the IHRA definition as a quasi-law" and documents the meaning of the IHRA document's self-description as "legally non-binding," the history of its application, and the legal dynamics bearing on its deployment in university contexts. In November, Gould stated that "These dimensions are made all the more contentious by its imprecise content and the significant ambiguity around its legal status. On the basis of the many ways in which the IHRA definition has been used to censor speech, particularly on university campuses" and "that the definition's proponents have not paid enough attention to the harms of censoring Israel-critical speech."{{sfn|Gould|2018b}}

===Legal===
In March 2017, human rights lawyer [[Hugh Tomlinson]] QC criticised the [[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance]] (IHRA) definition as "unclear and confusing", saying it did not have "the clarity which would be required" from a legal definition of antisemitism."{{sfn|Tomlinson|2017}}&lt;ref name="Winstanley"&gt;{{cite news|last=Winstanley|first=Asa|url=https://www.electronicintifada.net/blogs/asa-winstanley/calling-israel-racist-isnt-anti-semitic-rules-uk-labour|title=Calling Israel racist isn't anti-Semitic, rules UK Labour|work=The Electronic Intifada|date=7 July 2018|accessdate=17 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718001530/https://www.electronicintifada.net/blogs/asa-winstanley/calling-israel-racist-isnt-anti-semitic-rules-uk-labour|archive-date=18 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed concerns that the definition conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel and could be misused to curtail campaigning on behalf of Palestinians. He stated: "Properly understood in its own terms the IHRA Definition does not mean that activities such as describing Israel as a state enacting a [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|policy of apartheid]], as practising settler colonialism or calling for policies of boycott divestment or sanctions against Israel can properly be characterized as antisemitic. A public authority which sought to apply the IHRA Definition to prohibit or sanction such activities would be acting unlawfully." He presented his legal opinion on the new working definition at the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name="jewishnews1"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/hugh-tomlinson-ihra/|title=Leading lawyer rounds on ‘unclear and confusing’ IHRA anti-Semitism definition|work=|location=|publisher=''[[Jewish News]]''|date=3 April 2017|accessdate=19 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501183827/http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/hugh-tomlinson-ihra/|archive-date=1 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, former Court of Appeal judge [[Stephen Sedley]] said: "Shorn of philosophical and political refinements, anti-Semitism is hostility towards Jews as Jews. Where it manifests itself in discriminatory acts or inflammatory speech it is generally illegal, lying beyond the bounds of freedom of speech and of action. By contrast, criticism (and equally defence) of Israel or of Zionism is not only generally lawful: it is affirmatively protected by law. Endeavours to conflate the two by characterising everything other than anodyne criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic are not new. What is new is the adoption by the UK government (and the Labour Party) of a definition of anti-Semitism which endorses the conflation."{{sfn|Sedley|2017}} In July 2018, Sedley wrote: "...Sir [[William Macpherson (judge)|William Macpherson]] did not advise that everything perceived as racist was ipso facto racist. He advised that reported incidents that were perceived by the victim as racist should be recorded and investigated as such. His purpose was to reverse the dismissive culture that characterised the reporting and policing of racial incidents. To derive from this fallacy a proposition that anything perceived by one or more Jewish people as antisemitic is legally an act of racism is not only absurd: it overlooks another aspect of legality, the right of free expression contained in [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|article 10 of the European convention on human rights]] and now embodied in our law by the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]]. It is a right that may be qualified by proportionate legal restrictions necessary for protecting the rights of others: hence the legal bar on hate speech."{{sfn|Sedley|2018}} Regarding the examples he said: "They point to the underlying purpose of the text: to neutralise serious criticism of Israel by stigmatising it as a form of antisemitism."{{sfn|Sedley|Janner-Klausner|Bindman|Rose|2018}}

In July 2018, human rights solicitor [[Geoffrey Bindman]] wrote: "Unfortunately, the definition and the examples are poorly drafted, misleading, and in practice have led to the suppression of legitimate debate and freedom of expression. Nevertheless, clumsily worded as it is, the definition does describe the essence of antisemitism: irrational hostility towards Jews. The 11 examples are another matter. Seven of them refer to the state of Israel. This is where the problem arises. Some of them at least are not necessarily antisemitic. Whether they are or not depends on the context and on additional evidence of antisemitic intent."{{sfn|Sedley|Janner-Klausner|Bindman|Rose|2018}}

In August 2018, Rebecca Ruth Gould noted that since the adoption of the IHRA definition: "at least five universities [in the UK], and likely many more, have had planned events cancelled or otherwise censored due to a perceived need to comply with this definition, even in the absence of its legal ratification."{{sfn|Gould|2018a}}

In August 2018, [[Geoffrey Robertson]] QC, an expert on freedom of speech and human rights, states that the working definition fails to cover the most insidious forms of hostility to Jewish people. He said that several of the examples are so loosely drafted that they are likely to chill free speech, legitimate criticisms of the Israeli Government and coverage of human rights abuses against Palestinians. He said the definition was not intended to be binding and was not drafted as a comprehensible definition the British government's adoption of the working definition "has no legal effect" and recommended that any public bodies or organizations should follow the Home Affairs Committee recommendation and add to it the clarification that "it is not anti-Semitic to criticise the Government of Israel without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent." He concluded that "It is imprecise, confusing and open to misinterpretation and even manipulation... is not fit for any purpose that seeks to use it as an adjudicative standard" and political action against Israel is not properly characterised as antisemitic unless the action is intended to promote hatred or hostility against Jews in general.{{sfn|Robertson|2018}}&lt;ref name="thetimes"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/government-definition-of-antisemitism-not-fit-says-geoffrey-robertson-qc-htx6trnmq|title=Government definition of antisemitism not fit, says Geoffrey Robertson, QC|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original drafter===
The main drafter of the working definition and its examples, [[Kenneth S. Stern]], cautioned against the free speech implications of its use as a legal tool.{{sfn|Stern|2017}} He has opposed efforts to enshrine it in legislation{{sfn|Stern|2015}} and wrote a letter to members of the US Congress warning that giving the definition legal status would be "unconstitutional and unwise" in December 2016.{{sfn|Stern|2016}} In 2011, he co-authored an article about how the 'Working Definition' was being abused in Title VI cases, because it was being employed in an attempt to "restrict academic freedom and punish political speech." In November 2017, Stern explained to the [[US House of Representatives]] that the definition has been abused on various US university campuses. He warned that it could "restrict academic freedom and punish political speech" and questioned whether definitions created by minority groups should be legislatively enshrined, giving as one of several examples.{{sfn|Stern|2017}} &lt;blockquote&gt;"Imagine a definition designed for Palestinians. If "Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, and denying Israel the right to exist" is antisemitism, then shouldn't "Denying the Palestinian people their right to self-determination, and denying Palestine the right to exist" be anti-Palestinianism? Would they then ask administrators to police and possibly punish campus events by pro-Israel groups who oppose the two state solution, or claim the Palestinian people are a myth?"{{sfn|Stern|2017}} &lt;/blockquote&gt; He states that the definition was created "as a tool for data collectors in European countries to identify what to include and exclude from their reports about antisemitism, and to have a common frame of reference so that data might be compared across borders."{{sfn|Stern|2015}} He "encouraged the Department of State's first Special Envoy for Antisemitism to promote the definition as an important tool." He used it effectively as the framework for a report on global antisemitism. He added: "approaches to antisemitism that endorse and promote academic freedom are more likely to work, in part because they underscore the academy's goal of increasing knowledge and promoting critical thinking.... approaches that explain academic freedom away or harm it will not only fail, they make the problem worse."{{sfn|Stern|2017}}

===Organizations===
In August 2017, [[Jewish Voice for Labour]] (JVL) saw the working definition as "attempts to widen the definition of antisemitism beyond its meaning of hostility towards, or discrimination against, Jews as Jews".&lt;ref name="Sugarman"/&gt; In August 2018, JVL thought the IHRA examples of antisemitism fell short of providing "a clear and unambiguous statement based on attitudes to Jews as Jews, not attitudes to a country, Israel".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45402036|title=Labour's ruling body holds crunch anti-Semitism talks|work= |location= |publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date=4 September 2018|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] wrote that "there is a worrying resistance from universities to adopting it and free speech is given as the primary reason for their reluctance. It is said to be 'contentious' because some people argue that current concerns surrounding antisemitism are motivated by ulterior motives, namely defending the policies of the Israeli government. We would suggest that if a definition of prejudice against any other community referenced arguments that their concerns were even partially guided by ulterior motives then that community would infer that the definition did not take prejudice and discrimination against their group seriously.

In May 2018, the members' conference of the British civil liberties advocacy group [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] passed a motion resolving that the definition could constitute a threat to freedom of expression by "conflating anti-semitism with criticism of Israel and legitimate defence of the rights of Palestinians."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/sites/default/files/resolutions%20passed%202018.pdf Resolutions Passed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824101810/https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/sites/default/files/resolutions%20passed%202018.pdf |date=24 August 2018 }}, Liberty, May 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zeffman|first=Henry|title=Liberty members warn against IHRA's definition of anti-semitism|url=https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/article/liberty-members-warn-against-ihras-definition-anti-semitism|accessdate=5 September 2018|work=The Times|date=1 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906195433/https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/liberty-members-warn-against-ihras-definition-anti-semitism|archive-date=6 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VilkomersonKuper"/&gt;

In July 2018, a statement signed by 39 left-wing Jewish organizations in 15 countries, including six based in the UK, was released criticising the working definition, declaring that it was "worded in such a way as to be easily adopted or considered by western governments to intentionally equate legitimate criticisms of Israel and advocacy for Palestinian rights with antisemitism, as a means to suppress the former" and that "this conflation undermines both the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and equality and the global struggle against antisemitism. It also serves to shield Israel from being held accountable to universal standards of human rights and international law." The statement went on to urge governments, municipalities, universities and other institutions to reject the IHRA definition.&lt;ref name="jewishorganisations"&gt;Chernick, Ilanit (18 July 2018).

'''Zwischengeschlecht''' (literally "between sexes") is a human rights advocacy group campaigning on [[intersex human rights|intersex]] bodily autonomy issues. The group demonstrates outside medical events where surgical interventions are discussed or performed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostschweiz-am-sonntag.ch/ostschweiz/ostschweiz/tb-os/Zwist-um-Zwitter-Operationen;art120094,1686479 {{de icon}} Zwist um Zwitter-Operationen], Ostschweiz am Sonntag, 10 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; engages with the media, and participates in consultations with human rights institutions.

==Advocacy==
===Physical integrity and bodily autonomy===
Zwischengeschlecht were consulted by the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics in the preparation of an Opinion report, ''On the management of differences of sex development, Ethical issues relating to "intersexuality"'' in November 2012.&lt;ref name="swissnek"&gt;[http://www.bag.admin.ch/nek-cne/04229/04232/index.html?lang=en&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1ad1IZn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCKfX96f2ym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A-- On the management of differences of sex development, Ethical issues relating to “intersexuality", Opinion No. 20/2012], Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics, November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The report is notable for making a clear apology for damage done to intersex people in the past, and up until the present. It recommends deferring all "non-trivial" surgeries which have "irreversible consequences". The report also recommended criminal sanction for non-medically necessary genital surgeries.

The organization actively campaigns for recognition of [[intersex medical interventions]] as forms of "intersex genital mutilation", including through submissions to UN institutions. In March 2017, Zwischengeschlecht reported that the UN had made 22 concluding observations on the performance of UN member states according to their international treaty obligations. This included 14 countries, across in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania.&lt;ref name="zwischmar2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Harmful-Practice-Ireland-Germany-reprimanded-by-UN-CEDAW-for-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations | title = “Harmful Practice”: Ireland and Germany sternly reprimanded by UN-CEDAW for Intersex Genital Mutilations - again! | work = Zwischengeschlecht | date = March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection from discrimination===
In 2016, Zwischengeschlecht described actions to promote equality or civil status legislation without action on banning "intersex genital mutilations" as a form of pinkwashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = “Intersex legislation” that allows the daily mutilations to continue = PINKWASHING of IGM practices | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/Intersex-politics-that-ignore-the-daily-mutilations-PINKWASHING-OF-IGM-PRACTICES | date = August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has previously highlighted evasive government statements to UN Treaty Bodies that conflate intersex, transgender and LGBT issues, instead of addressing harmful practices on infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TRANSCRIPTION &gt; UK Questioned over Intersex Genital Mutilations by UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Gov Non-Answer + Denial | url = http://stop.genitalmutilation.org/post/UK-Questioned-over-Intersex-Genital-Mutilations-by-UN-Committee-on-the-Rights-of-the-Child | date = May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification documents===
Zwischengeschlecht have described media coverage of moves to create a third gender classification as "silly season fantasies"; the main goal is to stop intersex genital mutilations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/23183/germany-third-gender-birth-certificates/ German proposals for a “third gender” on birth certificates miss the mark], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 20 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/11/germany-adopts-third-gender-law-2013111141748757336.html Germany adopts third gender law] [[Al Jazeera]], 1 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/club/das-dritte-geschlecht {{de icon}} Das dritte Geschlecht], [[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen]], 22 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostschweiz-am-sonntag.ch/ostschweiz-am-sonntag/reflexe/art302975,3616028 {{de icon}} Es muss auch den anderen weh tun], Ostschweiz am Sonntag, 24 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visibility work ===
The group demonstrates outside medical events where surgical interventions are discussed or performed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostschweiz-am-sonntag.ch/ostschweiz/ostschweiz/tb-os/Zwist-um-Zwitter-Operationen;art120094,1686479 {{de icon}} Zwist um Zwitter-Operationen], Ostschweiz am Sonntag, 10 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and engages with the media.

===International activities===
Zwischengeschlecht participated in the third [[International Intersex Forum]] in late 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.zwischengeschlecht.info/post/2014/12/24/Malta-Gesetzesentwurf-IGM-Praktiken-verbieten-koerperliche-Unversehrtheit |title=Malta &gt; Gesetzesentwurf der Regierung will IGM-Praktiken verbieten, unterstreicht Recht auf köperliche Unversehrtheit, Selbstbestimmung |last1=Zwischengeschlecht |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=31 December 2014 |website= |publisher=Zwischengeschlecht |accessdate=2015-01-12 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also contributed to a joint statement to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] on 11 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arc-international.net/global-advocacy/human-rights-council/hrc25 25th session of the Human Rights Council], ARC International, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/24756/intersex-human-rights-panel-meeting-un-human-rights-council/ Human rights: first intersex-led discussions at the UN Human Rights Council], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 10 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crin.org/en/home/what-we-do/crinmail/childrens-rights-united-nations-120#intersex Children's Rights at the United Nations 120], [[Child Rights Information Network]], 11 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.zwischengeschlecht.info/post/2014/03/26/Schattenbericht-aUN-Kinderrechtsauschuss-kritisiert-Intersex-Genitalverstummelungen {{de icon}} NGO-Bericht an UN-Kinderrechtsausschuss kritisiert Intersex-Genitalverstümmelungen, fordert gesetzgeberische Massnahmen], Zwischengschlecht, 28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
