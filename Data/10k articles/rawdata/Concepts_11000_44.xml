The '''2011 England riots''', more widely known as the '''London Riots''' were a series of [[riots]] between the 6th of August and 11 August 2011, when thousands of people rioted in cities and towns across [[England]], saw [[looting]], [[arson]], and mass deployment of police, and resulted in the deaths of five people.

Protests started in [[Tottenham]], [[London]], following the [[death of Mark Duggan]], a local man who was shot dead by police on 4 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14434318 |title=Riots in Tottenham after Mark Duggan shooting protest |publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2011 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several violent clashes with police ensued, along with the destruction of police vehicles, a [[double-decker bus]] and many homes and businesses, thus rapidly gaining attention from the media. Overnight, looting took place in [[Tottenham Hale]] retail park and nearby [[Wood Green]]. The following days saw similar scenes in other parts of London, with the worst rioting taking place in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[Brixton]], [[Walthamstow]], [[Peckham]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[Battersea]], [[Croydon]], [[Ealing]], [[Barking, London|Barking]], [[Woolwich]], [[Lewisham]] and [[East Ham]].

From 8 to 10 August, other towns and cities in England (including [[Birmingham]], [[Coventry]], [[Leicester]], [[Derby]], [[Wolverhampton]], [[Northampton]], [[Nottingham]], [[West Bromwich]], [[Bristol]], [[Liverpool, England|Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]) saw what was described by the media as "copycat violence". [[Social media]] sites including [[Facebook]] also featured rumours of further disturbances or details surrounding known disturbances which were later proven to be inaccurate; for instance there were rumours of disturbances in the town of [[Dudley]] and at the nearby [[Merry Hill Shopping Centre]], but no incidents in these areas were detected by police. Rumours of a hospital being targeted by rioters in Birmingham were also proven to be wrong, as were rumours of disturbances in the [[Heath Town]] district of Wolverhampton, which had witnessed a serious riot in May 1989.

By 10 August, more than 3,000 arrests had been made across England, with more than 1,000 people issued with criminal charges for various offences related to the riots.&lt;ref name=bbc15Aug/&gt; Initially, courts sat for extended hours. There were a total of 3,443 crimes across London that were linked to the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/08/25/london-riots-more-than-2-000-people-arrested-over-disorder-115875-23371068/ |title=London riots: More than 2,000 people arrested over disorder |date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|8|15|alt=Along with the five deaths, at least 16 others were injured}} as a direct result of related violent acts. An estimated £200 million worth of property damage was incurred, and local economic activity – which in many cases was already struggling due to [[Great Recession|the recession]] – was significantly compromised.

The riots have generated significant ongoing debate among political, social and academic figures about the causes and context in which they happened. Attributions for the rioters' behaviour include such social factors such as racial tension, class tension, economic decline and the unemployment that it had brought, as well as individual factors like criminality, hooliganism, the breakdown of social morality and the development of gang culture.{{ref|&lt;ref name="cnn_figures"&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain's rioters count cost of unrest as order restored|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/08/12/uk.riots|publisher=CNN |date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc15Aug&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14532532|title=England's week of riots|publisher=BBC News|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lewis|first=Paul|title=Tottenham riots: a peaceful protest, then suddenly all hell broke loose|work=The Guardian|accessdate=7 August 2011|date=7 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-peaceful-protest|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham in flames as protesters riot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/06/police-cars-attacked-tottenham-mark-duggan|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 August 2011|location=London|date=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{main article|Death of Mark Duggan}}

On Thursday 4 August 2011, a police officer shot and killed 29-year-old Mark Duggan during an intelligence-led, targeted vehicle stop procedure on the Ferry Lane bridge next to [[Tottenham Hale station]].{{refn|&lt;ref name=bbc2nd /&gt;&lt;ref name=Laville07 /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-Mark-Duggan"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mark Duggan shooting: Bullets results 'within 24 hours'|publisher=BBC|date=8 August 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14443311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44091979/ns/world_news-europe|title=Soul searching lies ahead as UK riots cool|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) said that the planned arrest was part of [[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Operation Trident]], which at that time investigated gun crime within the [[Black British|black community]].&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan" /&gt; The incident had been referred to the IPCC,&lt;ref name=bbc2nd&gt;{{cite news|title=Man dead and police officer hurt in Tottenham shooting|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14412752|publisher=BBC News|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is standard practice if death or serious injury follows police contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What does the IPCC do? |url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/Pages/what_do.aspx |publisher=Independent Police Complaints Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the shooting, the media widely reported that a bullet was found embedded in a police radio, implying that Duggan fired on the police.&lt;ref name=Laville07 /&gt; Friends and relatives of Duggan said that he was unarmed. The police later revealed that initial [[ballistics]] tests on the bullet recovered from the police radio indicate that it was a "very distinct" police issue [[hollow-point bullet]].&lt;ref name=Laville07 &gt;{{cite news|title=Doubts emerge over Duggan shooting as London burns|author=Sandra Laville|author2=Paul Lewis|author3=Vikram Dodd|author4=Caroline Davies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/07/police-attack-london-burns|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riots-police-duggan-live#block-44|title=London disturbances – Sunday 7&amp;nbsp;August|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=4 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC later stated that a loaded [[Bruni Olympic .380 BBM|Bruni BBM]] [[Starting pistol|blank-firing pistol]], converted to fire live ammunition, was recovered from the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8699857/The-street-code-of-vengeance-that-sparked-the-riots.html|title=The street code of vengeance that sparked the riots|last=Lewis|first=Jason|date=13 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=18 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976974-no-evidence-that-mark-duggan-shot-at-police-says-ipcc.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919080804/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976974-no-evidence-that-mark-duggan-shot-at-police-says-ipcc.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 September 2012 |title='No evidence' that Mark Duggan shot at police, says IPCC |date=10 August 2011 |work=London Evening Standard |accessdate=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/264057/UK-riots-Mark-Duggan-had-a-loaded-pistol-|title=UK RIOTS: MARK DUGGAN ‘HAD A LOADED PISTOL’|date=10 August 2011|work=Daily Express|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was wrapped in a sock and there was no evidence that it had been fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Independent Police Complaints Commission has just announced that there is no evidence|work=The Guardian|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/aug/09/london-riots-day-four-live-blog#block-63|location=London|first1=Sam|last1=Jones|first2=Matt|last2=Wells|first3=Paul|last3=Owen|first4=Ben|last4=Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August, the IPCC stated that Duggan did not open fire: "It seems possible that we may have verbally led journalists to [wrongly] believe that shots were exchanged". The bullet that had lodged in an officer's radio is believed to have been an [[overpenetration]], having passed through Duggan's body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mark-duggan-did-not-fire-his-weapon-at-police/story-e6frg6so-1226111938756 "Mark Duggan did not fire his weapon at police",] ''[[The Australian]]'', 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130111160854/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/193718.html "Media misled on Mark Duggan death",] [[Press TV]], 13 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At lunchtime on 6 August, a meeting was called by police between local community leaders, councillors and members of police advisory groups. In this meeting, police were warned several times that there could possibly be another riot similar to the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] of 1985 if local concerns regarding the death were not addressed.&lt;ref name="channel4ex"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Tottenham in flames as riot follows protest|publisher=Channel 4|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2011|date=19 August 2011|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/could-the-tottenham-riots-have-been-prevented}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcreport"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stephenson|first=Wesley|title=Tottenham police 'could have stopped riots'|publisher=BBC|location=London|accessdate=16 September 2011|date=25 August 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14646187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2014, a jury at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] concluded that Duggan was [[Lawful killing|lawfully killed]].

===Protest march===
On Saturday 6 August, a protest was held, initially peacefully, beginning at [[Broadwater Farm]] and finishing at Tottenham police station.&lt;ref name="bolesworth"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bolesworth|first=Sarah|author2=Barry Neild |author3=Peter Beaumont |author4=Paul Lewis |author5=Sandra Laville|title=Tottenham in flames as riot follows protest|work=The Observer|location=London|accessdate=7 August 2011|date=7 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/06/tottenham-riots-protesters-police}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest was organised by friends and relatives of Duggan to demand justice for the family.&lt;ref name="guardian-06-duggan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14423942|title=Tottenham police shooting: Dead man was minicab passenger|publisher=BBC News|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/police-patrol-tottenham-after-riots|title=Tottenham riots are a disgrace, says MP|publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of some 300 people demanded that a senior local police officer come out to speak to them. When Chief Inspector Ade Adelekan arrived, he was met with boos and cries of "murderer", "[[Uncle Tom#Epithet|Uncle Tom]]" and "[[List of ethnic slurs#C|coconut]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-riots--one-year-on-owen-jones-commences-a-series-of-special-reports-7965142.html "London riots – one year on: Owen Jones commences a series of special reports", ''The Independent''], 23 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The crowd stayed in front of the police station hours longer than they originally planned because they were not satisfied with the seniority of the officers available at the time. Rumours that a 16-year-old girl had sustained injuries after attacking police with a champagne bottle began circulating on social media. To date, the girl remains unidentified and the report unconfirmed. However the rumour alone was sufficient to further fuel tensions in the area.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/05/tottenham-riots-police-community "Tottenham riots: missteps in the dance of police and a frustrated community" by Hugh Muir], ''The Guardian'', 5 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A peaceful march on Saturday 6 August in Tottenham was followed by rioting and looting, first in Tottenham and later in Tottenham Hale Retail Park.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10321233 |title=England riots: Maps and timeline|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 August 2011|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rioting occurred shortly after about 120 people marched from the Broadwater Farm estate to Tottenham Police Station via the High Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrowobserver.co.uk/west-london-news/world-uk-news/2011/08/07/eight-officers-hurt-as-riots-erupt-116451-29192283 "Eight officers hurt as riots erupt"], ''Harrow Observer'', 7 August 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of news and rumours about the previous evening's disturbances in Tottenham sparked riots during the night of Sunday 7 August in the London districts of Brixton, Enfield, Islington and [[Wood Green]] and in Oxford Circus in the centre of London.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt;

[[File:Tottenham riots August 6th.jpg|thumb|left|Rioters facing police on the evening of 6 August 2011]]
The morning of Monday 8 August was quiet, but by evening, areas across London were affected by widespread looting, arson and violence, with significant outbreaks in parts of Battersea, Brixton, Bromley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, East Ham, Hackney, Harrow, Lewisham, Peckham, Stratford, Waltham Forest, Woolwich, and Wood Green. A man was found shot in Croydon, and died later in hospital. Another man who had been assaulted in Ealing died in hospital on Thursday 11 August.

Similar riots were reported outside London – notably in Birmingham, Bristol, Gloucester, Gillingham and Nottingham.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Just the job to bring riots to capital? |date=18 August 2011 |work=The Scotsman |url=http://www.scotsman.com/opinion/Ross-Martin-Just-the-job.6820832.jp}}{{Dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2011 London riots.jpg|thumb|Rioters attempt to loot a cycle shop in Chalk Farm, Camden]]
Following a greatly increased police presence, London was quiet on Tuesday 9 August, but rioting continued in Nottingham and Birmingham (where, according to the police account, eleven shots were fired at police, including at a police helicopter, and petrol bombs thrown at officers&lt;ref name="WMP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.west-midlands.police.uk/latest-news/appeal.asp?ID=4190 |title=Footage released after shots fired at police in Birmingham disorder |date=20 August 2011 |publisher=[[West Midlands Police]] |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728114513/http://www.west-midlands.police.uk/latest-news/appeal.asp?id=4190 |archivedate=28 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and spread to Leicester, parts of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] and to parts of [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Merseyside]] in the north-west of England.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt; On Wednesday 10 August, London remained quiet while hundreds of arrests were being made by the police.

Three men were killed in Birmingham in a hit-and-run incident related to the disturbances. Looting and violence continued in two locations around Manchester and Liverpool.&lt;ref name=bbc_timeline/&gt;

==Social media==
[[File:Barclays - 2011 London Looting.jpg|thumb|left|Bank workers in Walthamstow observe the destruction which was caused in the early hours of the morning]]
Throughout the rioting, many of the rioters failed to cover their faces. Some posed for pictures with stolen goods, posting them on social-networking sites.&lt;ref name="Tom de Castella &amp; Caroline McClatchey"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14463452|title=UK riots: What turns people into looters?|accessdate=10 August 2011 | publisher=BBC News|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although London employs [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras to monitor crime and large events, reports indicate that citizen footage contributed more to capturing looters in action than the police force.&lt;ref name="London and England riots: CCTV Pictures"&gt;{{cite news|title=London and England riots: CCTV pictures of suspects are released by the police|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8690951/London-riots-CCTV-pictures-of-suspects-are-released-by-the-Metropolitan-Police.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the CCTV, looters were filmed and photographed with their faces visible. Police forces and investigators used websites like [[Flickr]] to find galleries of the looters to help solve and prevent cases of vandalism and further damage. [[Facebook]] pages were also created to identify looters.&lt;ref name="Citizen Cameras"&gt;{{cite web|last=Popkins|first=Helen|title=Citizen Cameras Capture more Looters than London Cops|url=http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/citizen-cameras-capture-more-london-looters-cops-121801|work=Blog|publisher=TechnoBlog|accessdate=28 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420112134/http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/citizen-cameras-capture-more-london-looters-cops-121801 |archivedate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several interactive maps were implemented in the [[Google Maps]] website that showed satellite views of what was happening in the streets during the rioting. James Cridland, the managing director of the free media resources, created a Google Map that tracked verified locations of rioting.
[[Channel 4 News]] also had similar maps that progressively tracked the damage in the streets as well.&lt;ref name="Interactive Maps reveal satellite's view of UK Riots"&gt;{{cite web|last=Benedetti|first=Winda|title=Interactive maps reveal satellite's view of UK riots|url=http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/interactive-maps-reveal-satellites-view-uk-riots-121583|work=Blog|publisher=TechnoBlog|accessdate=27 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508151113/http://www.technolog.msnbc.msn.com/technology/technolog/interactive-maps-reveal-satellites-view-uk-riots-121583|archivedate=8 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; News channels also were able to utilise this public service to capture live footage on the streets and inform citizens of dangerous or crowded areas.

===BlackBerry Messenger===
[[File:Croydon Riots 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Stand-off between rioters and police in Croydon]]
There were reports that the [[BlackBerry Messenger]] service was used by looters to organise their activities, and that inflammatory and inaccurate accounts of Mark Duggan's killing on social media sites may have incited disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/london-riots-tottenham-duggan-blog#block-61 |title=London riots – live blog |author=Paul Lewis |date=8 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/08/london-riots-facebook-twitter-blackberry |title=London riots: how BlackBerry Messenger played a key role |author=Josh Halliday |date=8 August 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G8AUG2011/&gt; One of the many messages shared between users was the following:

[[File:Tottenham Riot-shops.jpg|thumb|A shop in Tottenham Hale Retail park after the looting]]
[[Research in Motion]] assisted British police in tracking rioters who used BBM, stating, "We comply with the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]] and co-operate fully with the Home Office and UK police forces."&lt;ref name="garside1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garside|first=Juliette|title=UK riots: Mobile phone operators help police to identify looters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/09/uk-riots-mobile-phone-operators|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 March 2012|date=9 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased connectivity among individuals has led to a greater ability to organise and execute massive gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jurgenson|first=N.|title=When atoms meet bits: social media, the mobile web and augmented revolution|journal=Future Internet|year=2012|volume=4|pages=83–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has not occurred only with the riots in England, but with other collective gatherings such as the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chebib|first=Nadine Kassem|author2=Sohail, Rabia Minatullah|title=The reasons social media contributed to the 2011 Egyptian Revolution|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|year=2011|volume=2|issue=3|pages=139–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twitter===
Much like BBM, the mobility of technology shaped the London riots. During the Tottenham riots of 1985, citizens had to head into a public place to voice their message.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams, Lee|first=William|title=London Riots: Organized via Twitter and Smart phones?|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2087337,00.html|work=Time|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, with access to [[Twitter]] as a communication medium, social media was used to rapidly spread messages of the riots.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

Radio 4 criticised Twitter's contribution to the riots through greed and criminality.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Olivia|title=London Riots: Twitter That Caused Them?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/08/08/london-riots-twitter-that_n_920791.html|publisher=The Huffington Post- Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' described Twitter as being an outlet for promoting gang violence.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; Evidence shows that Twitter is powerful because tweets of individuals were inspired by news content.&lt;ref name="Tonkin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tonkin |first=Emma |author2=Heather D. Pfeiffer |author3=Greg Tourte |title=Twitter, information sharing and the London riots |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]] |date=13 January 2012 |volume=38 |issue=2 |doi=10.1002/bult.2012.1720380212 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.2012.1720380212/pdf |pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an article in ''Time'' magazine suggested BlackBerry Messenger was more to blame.&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;

During the riots, Twitter accounted for four out of every 170 UK Internet visits on Monday 8 August. In addition, citizens also used Twitter to band together, after the destruction.
The aftermath of the riots resulted in a disrupted city, yet Twitter was further used to maintain peace, with hashtags including "#riotcleanup".&lt;ref name="Tonkin"/&gt; Evidence shows that people were tweeting and re-tweeting news related to the riots, not original content.&lt;ref name="Tonkin"/&gt;

===Mobile phones===
Other than BlackBerry Messenger and social networking sites, mobile phone operators T-Mobile and Orange prioritised police requests for information about the phones that were used to plan the riots that hit British cities. Under the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]], phone companies were required to hand over data about the locations calls were made from, the owners of phones, and lists of calls made to and from a particular handset.&lt;ref name="garside1"/&gt;

====Richard Mannington Bowes====
[[File:Springbridge Mews floral tributes.jpg|thumb|right|Floral tributes at the site of the fatal assault. The flowers at the top spell out the word "why".]]
A 68-year-old man, Richard Mannington Bowes, died on 11 August after he was attacked while attempting to stamp out a litter-bin fire in [[Ealing]] on the evening of 8 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ealing riot: Richard Mannington Bowes dies after attack|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14500869|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowes was attacked by members of a mob on 8 August 2011, while attempting to extinguish a fire that had been [[arson|deliberately started]] in industrial bins on Spring Bridge Road. The attack inflicted severe head injuries which resulted in a coma. The assault was caught on [[CCTV]] and reportedly filmed on mobile phones by associates of the alleged assailant.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3750093/Fire-rages-around-riot-hero-Richard-Bowes.html "He paid a terrible price: Fire rages around riot hero"] by Anthony Price, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. Retrieved 13 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The attack on Bowes was witnessed by several police officers, but due to the number of rioters they were unable to come to his aid until riot squad officers pushed back the rioters while being attacked to reach Bowes.
A line of officers then held back the rioters as paramedics arrived. Bowes' wallet and phone had been stolen, and police faced difficulty in identifying him. He died of his injuries at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] on 11 August 2011 after being removed from life support.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14500869 "Riots: Arrest over death of Richard Mannington Bowes"] [[BBC News]].

A spokesman for the [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's office]] added: "The rioting in Tottenham last night was utterly unacceptable.

The [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|deputy prime minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] said that the riots were "completely unacceptable" and described the rioters as "needless and opportunistic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14443082|title=Nick Clegg: Riots 'completely unacceptable'|publisher=BBC | date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heralddeparis.com/london-violence-needless-opportunistic-theft/143750 |title=London violence: 'needless opportunistic theft' |publisher=Herald de Paris |date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London's mayor, [[Boris Johnson]], who cut short a holiday in Canada to return to the UK on 9 August, said: "I'm appalled at the scenes of violence and destruction in Tottenham"&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; whilst his deputy [[Kit Malthouse]] told a [[Sky News]] reporter that "criminal elements were to blame for the trouble."&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] condemned the "terrible scenes of people looting, vandalising, thieving, robbing" and told rioters "You will feel the full force of the law.

[[Croydon Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Croydon Central]] MP [[Gavin Barwell]] called the damage caused in the London Borough of Croydon "sickening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Your Local Guardian|title=Riot Fall Out Hits Croydon|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/topstories/9183466.LIVE__Riot_fallout_hits_Croydon/|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a strongly worded criticism of what he deems to be a misplaced "hyper-sensitivity about race", dating back to the [[Macpherson Report]] of 1999, [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]] director David Green attributed the reluctance by police to use force to a fear of disciplinary action.

Several countries issued warnings advising caution to travellers visiting the United Kingdom during the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/08/10/uk.riots.international.view|first=Barry|last=Neild|title=Libya, Iran revel in mocking Britain over riots|publisher=CNN International|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German [[far-left politics|far-left]] activists suggested using the riots as a [[role model]] to be applied to their political activities in Germany as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article1727786/London-brennt-wann-folgt-endlich-Berlin.html "London brennt, wann folgt endlich Berlin?"

Commentators likened the riots to the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] of 1985, during which a police officer, [[Death of Keith Blakelock|Keith Blakelock]], was murdered.&lt;ref name=lammy&gt;{{Cite news| last=Lammy|first=David|title=Tottenham riot: The lesson of Broadwater Farm|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=7 August 2011|date=7 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riot-broadwater-farm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' called the scenes "shameful" and lamented that "[w]ith the London Olympics less than a year away, our reputation is being damaged at the worst moment". It added: "This is anarchy, pure and simple. And it presents a serious threat to life and property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Be decisive |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/244723/The-Sun-Says.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522103135/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/244723/The-Sun-Says.html |archive-date=22 May 2009 |work=The Sun |location=UK |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=9 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s editorial said: "What we have experienced in London and elsewhere since Saturday night is a wholly new phenomenon: violent disorder whose sole intent is criminal... In such circumstances, there can be only one response if the law-abiding majority is to be protected: the thugs must be taught to respect the law of the land the hard way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The criminals who shame our nation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/8691352/The-criminals-who-shame-our-nation.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=UK|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Telegraph'' also reported: "Tottenham riots: police let gangs run riot and loot: Britain’s biggest police force is facing criticism after it let looters run riot in north London for almost 12 hours..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tottenham riots: police let gangs run riot and loot|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8687540/Tottenham-riots-police-let-gangs-run-riot-and-loot.html|publisher=''The Telegraph'', 7 August 2011|accessdate=27 February 2013|location=London|first=Martin|last=Beckford|date=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' called on the public to back the police: "... Britain's 2011 riots have become a defining contest between disorder and order. In that contest, important caveats notwithstanding, there is only one right side to be on. The attacks, the destruction, the criminality and the reign of fear must be stopped. The rule of law in the cities of Britain must not only be defended against delinquent destruction. It must also be enforced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Urban riots: The battle for the streets|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/09/urban-riots-battle-streets-editorial|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the height of the riots, ''The Guardian'' was accused of anti-Semitic incitement by the media monitoring organisation, Comment Is Free Watch (CiFW), after Guardian journalist Paul Lewis singled out [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jewish]] residents who were not involved in the rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guardian report on London riots omits the race or ethnicity of rioters – but, still mentions Jews|url=http://cifwatch.com/2011/08/08/guardian-report-on-london-riots-omits-the-race-or-ethnicity-of-rioters-but-still-mentions-jews/|publisher=CiF Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of his report stated, "The make-up of the rioters was racially mixed. Most were men or boys, some apparently as young as 10….But families and other local residents, including some from Tottenham's Hasidic Jewish community, also gathered to watch and jeer at police." CIFW responded by condemning the newspaper saying, "A 1,800 Guardian report doesn't mention the race, ethnicity, or religion of the rioters, somehow found it pertinent to note that some of those who gathered to jeer police were, allegedly, Hasidic Jews." As a result of the negative publicity, ''The Guardian'' revised the story.&lt;ref name="Guardian-07-peaceful" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Guardian revises story about UK Riots which singled out Hasidic Jews|url=http://cifwatch.com/2011/08/09/the-guardian-revises-story-about-uk-riots-which-singled-out-hasidic-jews/|publisher=CiF Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 9 August leading article, ''[[The Independent]]'' said the police's handling of [[death of Mark Duggan|Mark Duggan's death]] "looks to have been poor", and that there is "context of mistrust of the police here." The paper added that "it is spurious to draw a connection between that disaffection [by the inner-city youth] and specific outbreaks of violence of the sort we have seen in recent days."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leading article: The lessons to be drawn from mindless violence|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-the-lessons-to-be-drawn-from-mindless-violence-2333987.html|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Hitchens]] of ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' disputed the idea that the events were riots on the basis that they were fundamentally apolitical. He further stated: "This is an equal-opportunity crime wave. The lawbreakers are not from any distinct ethnic group, and attempts to explain this behaviour on these ground are baseless and poisonous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2011/08/radio-silence.html|title=Radio Silence – Mail Online – Peter Hitchens blog|publisher=Hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Theodore Dalrymple]] wrote an opinion piece for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', in which he blamed the "sense of entitlement" that he sees as being common among Britain's youth as a cause for the riots, and said that British youth are today among "the most unpleasant and violent in the world" as a result.&lt;ref name="ny_daniels"&gt;{{cite news|last=Daniels|first=Anthony|title=Behind England's riots, a violent and entitled generation of British young people|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2011/08/10/2011-08-10_behind_englands_riots_a_violent_and_entitled_generation_of_british_young_people.html|work=Daily News|accessdate=12 August 2011|authorlink=Theodore Dalrymple |location=New York |date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some journalists made comparisons between these riots and the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 riots in France]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|author=J.

Writing in Pakistan's ''[[Newsline (magazine)|Newsline]]'', Mahir Ali likened the government's response to that of [[Margaret Thatcher]] to the [[1981 England riots]].&lt;ref name="newslinemagazine trying to make sense"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newslinemagazine.com/2011/09/english-meltdown-trying-to-make-sense-of-the-london-riots/ | title=English Meltdown: Trying to Make Sense of The London Riots | work=[[Newsline (magazine)|Newsline]] | date=13 September 2011 | accessdate=13 September 2011 | author=Ali, Mahir | location=Karachi | quote=There was plenty of breast-beating back then [1981] too, and Thatcher came up with prescriptions remarkably similar to the ones that Cameron has lately been offering.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Race relations====
The ethnic makeup of the rioters varied in different cities: 76% of those arrested in Manchester were white, while 29% were white and 39% black in London, and the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] was the only area where more than 6% were Asian.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Richard Phillips; Frost, Diane; and Singleton, Alex (March 2013). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4959.2012.00463.x/full "Researching the Riots"], ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 179, No. 1:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been much speculation about the causes and meanings of the riots that swept through English cities in August 2011...&lt;p&gt;"These disturbances began on 6 August following the police shooting of Mark Duggan, a black resident of Tottenham, North London. Over the following days, they spread within London and to other English cities....&lt;p&gt;"There were no riots in English cities such as Sheffield and Newcastle, and the streets of Welsh and Scottish cities remained equally calm."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18681866 BBC News: "England riots: Who's been prosecuted?"], quoting [[Ministry of Justice]] statistics from June 2012: 89% are listed as male, 53% were twenty or under, and ethnic statistics are given for each area&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by the [[University of Nottingham]] suggested that race relations in Britain deteriorated in the period following the riots and that prejudice towards ethnic minorities increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|title=British public 'are more prejudiced against minorities after riots'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/05/british-public-prejudiced-minorities-riots|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 September 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the hit-and-run incident in Birmingham, in which three Asian men were killed by a black driver, racial tensions between blacks and Asians in Birmingham increased; hostilities were defused by the public appeals for an end to violence by Tariq Jahan, father of one of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerrins|first=Suzanne|title=Sir Ian Botham: bring in corporal punishment and ban reality TV to save today's youth|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/news/8786663/Sir-Ian-Botham-bring-in-corporal-punishment-and-ban-reality-TV-to-save-todays-youth.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of [[black people|black culture]] were discussed by historian [[David Starkey]] in the edition of the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' TV programme of 12 August. Starkey singled out the influence of black [[gangsta rap|gangster and rap culture]] on youths of all races, contrasting contemporary [[Multicultural London English|youth patois]] with the speech patterns of black Tottenham MP [[David Lammy]], who, Starkey asserted, "sounded white". The author [[Dreda Say Mitchell]] countered his argument by saying that there is no one single "black culture".&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14513517|title='The whites have become black' says David Starkey|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators remarked on the apparently high proportion of black people involved in the riots and took the view that there was a disproportionately high number of rioters who were black, compared to the overall demographics of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="economist-black community"&gt;{{cite news|title=A reckoning – The black community wrestles with the causes of the riots|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21528285|work=The Economist|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ministry of Justice has admitted "the group of people brought before the courts is only a subset of all people who took part in the public disorder". In February 2012 a report was published by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] providing demographic statistics of the people charged over participation the riots up to 1 February 2012 which revealed that 41% of those brought before the courts identified themselves as being from the White group, 39% from the Black ethnic group, 12% from the Mixed ethnic group, 6% the Asian ethnic group, and 2% the Other ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical bulletin on the public disorder of 6 to 9 August 2011 – February update&lt;/ref&gt; These figures were disproportionate to the [[Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom|average UK population]];&lt;ref name="ethnicity-moj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical bulletin on the public disorder of 6th–9th August 2011 full report|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/statistics/criminal-justice-stats/august-public-disorder-stats-bulletin-230212.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=26 June 2012|date=24 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219082623/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217805/august-public-disorder-stats-bulletin-230212.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnicity-sky"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gangs Had No 'Pivotal Role' In English Riots|url=http://news.sky.com/home/article/16095055|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=13 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112122926/http://news.sky.com/home/article/16095055 |archivedate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the figures revealed varying demographics in different areas when compared to local populations. For example, in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], the figures revealed that 55% of defendants in court over riot-related charges were black, compared to a 17% black population; in [[City of Salford|Salford]], 94% of rioters in court were white, compared to an 88% white population, and 6% of rioters were black, compared to a 2% black population.&lt;ref name="ethnicity-bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=England rioters 'poorer, younger, less educated'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15426720|accessdate=13 November 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, looters from 44 foreign countries were jailed, with Jamaicans representing the largest group.&lt;ref name="ethnicity-star"&gt;{{cite web|title=YOBS NOT TOO ILL TO LOOT|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/217426/Yobs-not-too-ill-to-loot/|work=Daily Star|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Justice report also noted that rioters brought before the courts were disproportionately male (89%) and young (53% were aged 20 or under, with the number of "[[Minor (law)|juveniles]]" ranging from 26% in London to 39% in [[Merseyside]], and very few listed as over 40).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18681866 BBC News: "England riots: Who's been prosecuted?"], quoting [[Ministry of Justice]] statistics from June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Independent'', the costs to the Metropolitan Police of policing the disorder and disturbances in London are expected to exceed £34 million.

====Trials and sentencing====
On 1 September 2011 the BBC reported that official [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] figures showed that of the 1,566 people that had appeared before magistrates on charges connected with the disorder, 1,027 had been in London, 190 in Greater Manchester, 132 in the West Midlands, 67 in Merseyside and 64 in Nottingham.&lt;ref name=BBC1SEP2011&gt;{{cite news |title=England riots: Court appearance total rises above 1,500 |date=1 September 2011 |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14746229 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giving the judgment of the court, the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Lord Judge]], sitting with Sir John Thomas and [[Brian Leveson|Lord Justice Leveson]], stated that there is "an overwhelming obligation on sentencing courts to do what they can to ensure the protection of the public", that "the imposition of severe sentences, intended to provide both punishment and deterrence, must follow" and that "[t]hose who deliberately participate in disturbances of this magnitude, causing injury and damage and fear to even the most stout-hearted of citizens, and who individually commit further crimes during the course of the riots are committing aggravated crimes". The appeals were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Blackshaw, R. v (Rev 1) [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2011/2312.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2011]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWCA Crim 2312,] 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 2012, the Court of Appeal (Lord Judge CJ, [[Peter Openshaw|Openshaw]] &amp; Irwin [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|JJ]]) increased the sentence imposed by the Crown Court at Inner London on Adam Ahmadzai from four years detention to seven years detention for offences of violent disorder, robbery, burglary and criminal damage committed during the riots on 8 August 2011, after a reference from [[Attorney General of England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Dominic Grieve]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17844425 "London riots: Croydon rioter's jail term extended"], BBC News, (25 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chief Justice stated that the offences were of the "greatest possible seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Theatrical===
[[Tricycle Theatre|The Tricycle Theatre]] in Kilburn presented a piece of new writing, ''[[The Riots (2011 play)|The Riots]]'' by [[Gillian Slovo]], which looked into the events over those days in August and the thoughts and opinions of a range of people directly involved and politicians. It transferred to the [[Bernie Grant Arts Centre]] in Tottenham, about 400 m from where the Mark Duggan protest took place, on 5 January 2012, and was due to run until 15 January.
The piece attempts to show a non-biased look into the events, allowing audience members to hear different views into why it happened and what could have and should now be done. The piece includes community leaders Stafford Scott and Martin Sylvester Brown, police constables on duty that night and a former resident of the Carpet-Right building, the burned remains now providing a highly poignant reminder of the events.
They are combined with the views of [[Diane Abbott]], [[Iain Duncan Smith]], [[Michael Gove]] and Pastor Nims Obunge. It was received well by all critics, with 4 stars from all major press including ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]], [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/23/the-riots-tricycle-review "The Riots – review"].

Australian mod rock band [[The Feldons]] reference the riots in their song London Town from their 2012 album ''Goody Hallett and Other Stories''.

==Suggested contributory factors==
The causes of the 2011 England riots both immediate and long-term have been the subject of media and academic debate. Several speculations have emerged as to what the likely contributory factors might be for the riots; from [[socio-economic]] causes focusing on unemployment and spending cuts, as well as [[social media]], [[gang culture]] and criminal opportunism. The House of Commons Home Affairs select committee will begin examining the police response to the riots in late 2011.
The [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|leader of the Opposition]], [[Ed Miliband]], called for a public inquiry into the wider causes of the riots and has stated that his party would set up such an inquiry if the coalition fails to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Patrick Wintour, political editor, and James Meikle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/12/ed-miliband-links-riots-scandals|title=Ed Miliband promises riots inquiry|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK was shaken by its worst riots in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hounslowandbrentfordtimes.co.uk/uk_national_news/9184613.UK_shaken_by_worst_riots_in_decades/?ref=rss |title=UK shaken by worst riots in decades (from ''Hounslow And Brentford Times'') |publisher=Hounslowandbrentfordtimes.co.uk |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412191316/http://www.hounslowandbrentfordtimes.co.uk/uk_national_news/9184613.UK_shaken_by_worst_riots_in_decades/?ref=rss |archivedate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide-ranging [[London School of Economics|LSE]] study called ''Reading the Riots'' concluded that the major contributory factors were opportunism, perceived social injustice, deprivation, and frustration at the way communities were policed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Introducing phase two of Reading the Riots: police, victims and the courts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/01/introducing-phase-two-reading-riots|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 July 2012|location=London|first1=Paul|last1=Lewis|first2=Tim|last2=Newburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[YouGov]] poll was carried out on 8–9 August 2011 for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' asking what those surveyed believed to be the main cause of the riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/yg-archives-pol-sun-riots-100811.pdf|title=YouGov/The Sun Survey Results|date=8–9 August 2011|work=today.yougov.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110811031843/http://today.yougov.co.uk/sites/today.yougov.co.uk/files/yg-archives-pol-sun-riots-100811.pdf|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, 42% of those polled thought "criminal behaviour" to be the main cause, whilst 26% thought "gang culture" was, 8% thought "government cuts" were, 5% thought "unemployment" was, 5% thought "racial tensions" was and 3% thought "poor policing" was. In a [[ComRes]] poll for the ''Sunday Mirror'' and ''Independent on Sunday'', in which the question was "do you agree or disagree with these statements about the recent riots?", 90% of those polled agreed that the "Police should be allowed {{sic|use|reason="to use water cannon" would be expected}} to water cannon to disperse rioters", 90% agreed that "There is no excuse whatsoever for the violent rioting and looting over the last few days", 61% agreed that "Government ministers failed to return to their desks quickly enough from holidays" and 50% agreed that "The Government's response to the economic crisis (e.g. cuts to services, unemployment, reduced education funding) is helping fuel the rioters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/Ios_SM_LondonRiots_12thAugust11.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017193956/http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/Ios_SM_LondonRiots_12thAugust11.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 October 2012 |title=London Riots Survey |publisher=ComRes |accessdate=29 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who study the causes of political instability suggest that the critical common factor is the density of youths. A nation's extent of political unrest, i.e. its vulnerability to riot, war or regime change, is directly associated with the percentage of 15- to 24-year-olds in its population.
They argue that communities with more than 20% of individuals in this age group run the greatest risk of more frequent and more intense political instability. They describe the phenomena as the "[[Youth bulge|youth bulge theory]]", where the "bulge" refers to the fattening of the population pyramid just before the base of the youngest age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1315481/On-riots-and-youth-bulges.html |title=On riots and youth bulges |work=Significance Magazine |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415203106/http://www.significancemagazine.org/details/webexclusive/1315481/On-riots-and-youth-bulges.html |archivedate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The riots in Tottenham after the death of Mark Duggan were initially blamed on poor relations between the police and the black community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jackson|first=Peter|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14436529|title=London riots: Tensions behind unrest revealed|publisher=BBC|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Over 1,000 Arrested in U.K. as Anger over Inequality, Racism Boils Over into Insurrection|date=10 August 2011|first=Richard|last=Seymour|publisher= DemocracyNow.com|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/10/over_1_000_arrested_in_uk|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Gus John]] has argued that the tactical use of frequent "[[stop and search]]", particularly of young black men, has caused resentment of the police in the black community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZ67UWu3mGjnb3TfN-jVwN77VevQ?docId=CNG.1dbda76336400d092358c2558c36e01d.4e1 |author=Guy Jackson|title=AFP: Depraved or deprived?

According to [[David Lammy]], the MP for Tottenham, the "cracks that already existed between the police and the community became deep fissures".&lt;ref name=lammy /&gt;&lt;ref name="polcl"&gt;{{cite news|title=UK riots: political classes see what they want to see|first=Aditya|last=Chakrabortty|date=10 August 2011|accessdate=12 August 2011|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/10/uk-riots-political-classes|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian''{{'s}} Reading the Riots Survey concluded: "Although rioters expressed a mix of opinions about the disorder, many of those involved said they felt like they were participating in explicitly anti-police riots. They cited 'policing' as the most significant cause of the riots, and anger over the police shooting of Mark Duggan, which triggered initial disturbances in Tottenham, was repeatedly mentioned – even outside London."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/05/anger-police-fuelled-riots-study | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Paul | last1=Lewis | first2=Tim | last2=Newburn | first3=Matthew | last3=Taylor | first4=James | last4=Ball | title=Rioters say anger with police fuelled summer unrest | date=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social exclusion===
Rioters themselves cited exclusion as a reason for their actions. One person, asked by a journalist if rioting was really the best way to accomplish their objectives, responded: "Yes, because if we weren’t rioting, you wouldn’t be talking to us."&lt;ref name=DN10Aug&gt;Richard Seymour, [[Darcus Howe]], and [[Amy Goodman]], [http://www.democracynow.org/2011/8/10/over_1_000_arrested_in_uk "Over 1,000 Arrested in U.K. as Anger over Inequality, Racism Boils Over into 'Insurrection'"], ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Camila Batmanghelidjh]] writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' blames [[social exclusion]] and [[social deprivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/camila-batmanghelidjh-caring-costs-ndash-but-so-do-riots-2333991.html|title=Camila Batmanghelidjh: Caring costs – but so do riots – Commentators, Opinion|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various journalists have identified poverty and the [[Economic inequality|growing gap between rich and poor]] as causative factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Topping| first = Alexandra|title=Looting 'fuelled by social exclusion' |work=The Guardian|date=8 August 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/looting-fuelled-by-social-exclusion|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Ross|first=Monique|title=Blame for riots turns to UK social system|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=10 August 2011|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-10/society-role-in-london-riots/2833168?section=world}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=English riots: The return of the underclass|date=11 August 2011|first=Mark|last=Easton|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14488486|accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a House of Commons debate on the riots Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] stated that the riots were symptomatic of a "wider malaise" including worklessness, illiteracy, and drug abuse but also stated that "Everybody, no matter what their background or circumstances, has the freedom to choose between right and wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/house_of_commons/newsid_9560000/9560113.stm|title=BBC – Democracy Live – In full: MPss debate England riots|publisher=BBC News|date=11 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], writing in ''The Observer'', stated that the riots were not caused by a broken society, but due to a group of young, alienated, disaffected youth who are outside the social mainstream and who live in a culture at odds with any canons of proper behaviour; he added that this is found in virtually every developed nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blair|first=Tony|title=Riots Not Caused By Broken Society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/20/tony-blair-riots-crime-family|accessdate=21 August 2011|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Hastings]] of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' blamed a culture of welfare dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Max Hastings|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2024284/UK-riots-2011-Liberal-dogma-spawned-generation-brutalised-youths.html|title=UK riots 2011: Liberal dogma has spawned a generation of brutalised youths|work=Daily Mail|location=UK|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A journalist on Al Jazeera suggested a similarity to the disenfranchisement behind the [[Arab Spring]] [[revolutionary wave]] of 2011. Links were made to high youth unemployment and general disenfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/08/2011811122931660627.html | title=From the Arab Spring to Liverpool? | work=Aljazeera | date=11 August 2011 | accessdate=20 August 2011 | last=Ryan | first=Yasmin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by The ''[[Financial Times]]'' published in September 2011 found a strong link between rioting and deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/236110aa-d716-11e0-bc73-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1X3nspCJu|title= Rioting link to deprivation revealed|work= [[Financial Times]]|author1=Sally Gainsbury  |author2=Natasha Culzac|date = 4 September 2011|accessdate= 5 September 2011}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family breakdown===
[[Christina Odone]] writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' links the riots to a lack of male role models and argues that "Like the overwhelming majority of youth offenders behind bars, these gang members have one thing in common: no father at home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Odone|first=Cristina|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/cristinaodone/100100154/london-riots-absent-fathers-have-a-lot-to-answer-for|title=London riots: Absent fathers have a lot to answer for|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been linked further with England's having the "worst record in family breakdown in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rioters Are NOT 'Scum'!

===Government cuts===
The spending cuts of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government in the United Kingdom]] have also been cited as a cause.{{refn|&lt;ref name="polcl"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/08/08/uk-britain-disorder-idUKTRE7752QX20110808|title= Riots spread on third night of violence|last1=Hemming|first1=Jon|last2=Ambrogi|first2=Stefano |date=8 August 2011|agency=Reuters|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Croft |first=Adrian |title=Spending cuts, police blamed for London riot |page=B4 |newspaper=The Vancouver Sun |date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44055812/ns/world_news-europe|title=More than 200 thugs arrested in London riots|publisher=MSN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dlammy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/07/tottenham-riot-broadwater-farm|author=David Lammy|title=Tottenham riot: The lesson of Broadwater Farm|date=7 August 2011|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Somaiya|first=Ravi|title=London Sees Twin Perils Converging to Fuel Riot|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/world/europe/08britain.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ken Livingstone, the Labour Candidate for Mayor of London in 2012 has argued that "The economic stagnation and cuts being imposed by the Tory government inevitably create social division."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labourlist.org/ken-livingstone-statement-on-tottenham-riots|title=Ken Livingstone statement on Tottenham riots|publisher=LabourList.org|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328123039/http://labourlist.org/2011/08/ken-livingstone-statement-on-tottenham-riots/ |archivedate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Clegg, the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] and leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats political party]], made it clear that the government's planned cuts to police budgets will go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Meikle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/aug/11/nick-clegg-police-funding-cuts-riots|title=Nick Clegg: police funding cuts will not change despite riots|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local government budget had been cut in the past year so Haringey Council, which includes [[Tottenham]] and [[Tottenham Hale]], decided to close eight of its 13 youth clubs in 2011, rather than save money through increased efficiency or make cuts in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/rolling-back-the-state-only-fans-the-flames-16037110.html#ixzz1VH2JqmoJ |title=Rolling back the state only fans the flames |work=The Belfast Telegraph |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/13/hackney-riots-youth-clubs-closure?intcmp=239 "Hackney riots: 'The message when youth clubs close is that no one cares'"], ''The Observer''. Retrieved 17 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrapping of the [[Education Maintenance Allowance]], removing of funding for courses where the student already has an equal or lower level qualification and trebling of university tuition fees, combined with high youth unemployment has placed the British youth "between a rock and a hard place" alienating and angering the youth population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Young people have no right to riot, but they have a right to be angry|last=Lloyd|first=Saci|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/18/riot-young-people-a-level-school|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 August 2011|accessdate=20 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this argument say that Scottish youth did not riot partly because Scottish students do not have to pay tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A society that is slipping into Dickensian darkness|last=Macwhirter|first=Iain |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/comment/iain-macwhirter/a-society-that-is-slipping-into-dickensian-darkness-1.1118346|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow |date=18 August 2011|accessdate=20 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930190349/http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/a-society-that-is-slipping-into-dickensian-darkness.14772416 |archivedate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Lammy]] MP has said that Tottenham has the highest unemployment rate in London and the eighth highest in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Lammy|title=Response to the Comprehensive Spending Review|accessdate=25 February 2011|url=http://www.davidlammy.co.uk/Respond_to_the_Comprehensive_Spending_Review|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725225202/http://www.davidlammy.co.uk/Respond_to_the_Comprehensive_Spending_Review|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people chasing every one job vacancy in Haringey has been put at 23 and 54 in separate reports, and fears had spread of disorder after youth club closures in recent months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alex|last=Goy|title=The toughest places to get a job in the UK: 6.

===Rioting for fun===

Other academics have pointed to more prosaic causes of the 2011 riots, citing the [[carnivalesque]] atmospheres created through the usual uses of urban space. For example, researchers from the [[University of Birmingham]] noted that ‘another sound could be heard above the mêlée, that of laughter. Above the bark of police dogs, and behind the masked and hooded faces of the throng, were smiles, laughter, and shrieks of joy.’&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com.ezproxyd.bham.ac.uk/doi/abs/10.1080/09627251.2012.670998 "Panic on the streets of Birmingham? Struggles over space and belonging in the Revanchist City"], in ''Justice Matters'', Vol. 87, No. 1 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gang culture===
In a ''[[Newsnight]]'' discussion on 12 August, historian [[David Starkey]] blamed black gangster culture, saying that it had influenced youths of all races.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The BBC received nearly 700 complaints about his statement that the "whites have become black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14542240 | publisher=BBC News | title=Hundreds complain about David Starkey's race comments | date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cottrell-Boyce, writing in the Youth Justice journal, argued that gangs were constructed as a 'suitable enemy' by politicians and the media, obscuring the wider, structural and economic roots of youth violence.&lt;ref name="Cottrell-Boyce"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cottrell-Boyce|first=Joseph|title=Ending Gang and Youth Violence: A Critique|journal=Youth Justice|date=December 2013|volume=13|issue=3|pages=193–206|url=http://yjj.sagepub.com/content/13/3/193.abstract|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal opportunism===
During the riots, on 9 August 2011, UK Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] said: "I think this is about sheer criminality. That is what we have seen on the streets. The violence we've seen, the looting we've seen, the thuggery we've seen – this is sheer criminality, and let's make no bones about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rioting spirals out of control |date=8 August 2011 |work=London Evening Standard |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976590-rioting-spirals-out-of-control.do |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120604014910/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23976590-rioting-spirals-out-of-control.do |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hobbs, London correspondent for [[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] said that looters are not politically motivated and called the riots "recreational violence".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|title=UK riots: 16,000 police on London streets|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/london-riots-military-could-brought-in-4343698|date=9 August 2011|work=TVNZ|accessdate=9 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811182640/http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/london-riots-military-could-brought-in-4343698 |archivedate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Manchester rioter said to a BBC correspondent: "Every time I go into town I just think how the shops got smashed up in 2011 by all of us, I just laugh about it every time I go back in now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/9572763.stm|title= Rioters revel in thrill of seizing Manchester streets|publisher=BBC News - ''Newsnight|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC reported that the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police had stated that he thought that the motivation for rioters targeting the city centre was not anger, but greed.&lt;ref name="greed"&gt;{{cite news |title=How rioting spread around England |publisher=BBC News |date=9 August 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14466477 |accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral decay at the top===
''Daily Telegraph'' columnist [[Peter Oborne]] suggested that moral decay is just as bad at the top of society as it is at the bottom, with the rich and powerful generating anger among the British population. He cited the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|MPs' expenses scandal]], [[bankers' bonuses]], and [[News International phone hacking scandal|the phone hacking scandal]] as setting poor examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The moral decay of our society is as bad at the top as the bottom |last=Oborne |first=Peter |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100100708/the-moral-decay-of-our-society-is-as-bad-at-the-top-as-the-bottom|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Financial Times]]'' cartoonist Ingram Pinn depicted a Union Flag being broken through by a looter in a [[hoodie]] carrying a stolen box of Adidas trainers, preceded by two men in suits carrying piles of cash, one saying "MP's Expenses" and another "Banker's Bonus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://domesticempire.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/broken-britain-riots/ "Broken Britain Riots"], 16 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Failure of the penal system===
[[Kenneth Clarke]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]], writing in ''The Guardian'', described the riots in part as "an outburst of outrageous behaviour by the criminal classes". He drew attention to the statistic that almost three-quarters of the adults who had been charged with offences related to the disorder already had a criminal record.
Clarke characterised this as the legacy of "a broken penal system", one that did not have a good record for preventing reoffending. He stated he is proposing radical new measures intended to focus on robust punishment and on delivering reductions in reoffending.&lt;ref name=G5SEP2011&gt;{{cite news |title=Punish the feral rioters, but address our social deficit too |author=Kenneth Clarke |date=5 September 2011 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/05/punishment-rioters-help |accessdate=6 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream media relationship with the communities===
A conference held in November 2012 and its subsequent report by Dr Leah Bassel of the [[University of Leicester]], entitled ''Media and the Riots – A Call For Action'', examined the relationship between mainstream media and communities affected by the riots.{{vague|date=October 2013}}{{elucidate|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Roy Greenslade, , [https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/jul/31/london-riots-universityofleicester "What the media did wrong in the riots – and how to put it right"], Greenslade Blog, ''The Guardian'', 31 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Wadsworth]], [http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/media-coverage-2011-riots-was-disgraceful "Media Coverage Of 2011 Riots 'Was Disgraceful'"], ''The Voice'', 10 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-latest.com/riots-and-media-report "Special report about media and the riots"], The-Latest.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity involvement==
[[Jamie Waylett]], who played Vincent Crabbe in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series, was charged and sentenced for his participation in the riots.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-17449630|title=London riots: Harry Potter actor Jamie Waylett jailed|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was photographed drinking out of a bottle of stolen champagne, as well as holding a petrol bomb in Camden on the third day of rioting and violence.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; He was given a two-year sentence for violence and [[handling stolen goods]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

'''''A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution and Cooperation''''' is a 1999 book by [[Peter Singer]], in which the author argues that the view of human nature provided by evolution (e.g., [[evolutionary psychology]]) is compatible with and should be incorporated into the ideological framework of the [[Left-Right politics|Left]].

==Summary==
Singer believes that the Left will be better able to achieve its social and economic goals if it incorporates the more accurate view of human nature provided by evolutionary science: "To be blind to the facts about human nature is to risk disaster". For example, Singer argues that the Left's view of human nature as highly malleable, which he identifies with [[Marxism]] and the [[standard social science model]], is incorrect.

Singer argues that evolutionary psychology suggests that humans naturally tend to be self-interested. He further argues that the evidence that selfish tendencies are natural must not be taken as evidence that selfishness is right. He concludes that [[game theory]] (the mathematical study of strategy) and experiments in psychology offer hope that self-interested people will make short-term sacrifices for the good of others, if society provides the right conditions. Essentially Singer claims that although humans possess selfish, competitive tendencies naturally, they have a substantial capacity for [[co-operation (evolution)|cooperation]] that has also been selected for during [[human evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Left Got Darwin Wrong|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-the-left-got-darwin-w|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=25 May 2012|author=Leigh Van Valen|date=June 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosopher [[Philip Kitcher]] has criticised the book's handling of [[sociobiology]], saying that it contains "credulous retailing of sociobiological speculations" while noting that "much of this book is admirable in its clarity, directness, and grasp of central points".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kitcher | first1 = P. | title = Peter Singer, A Darwinian Left: Politics, Evolution, and Cooperation | doi = 10.1086/339782 | journal = Ethics | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 861–863 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33835">{{about|the concept of abstraction in general|specific types of abstraction and other uses of the term|}}

'''Abstraction''' in its main sense is a conceptual process where general [[rule of inference|rules]] and [[concept]]s are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "[[Abstract and concrete|concrete]]") signifiers, [[first principle]]s, or other methods.  

"An abstraction" is the outcome of this process—a concept that acts as a super-categorical noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a ''group'', ''field'', or ''category''.&lt;ref name=Langer&gt;[[Suzanne K. Langer]] (1953), ''Feeling and Form: a theory of art developed from Philosophy in a New Key'' p. 90: "[[Sculpture|Sculptural form]] is a powerful abstraction from actual objects and the three-dimensional space which we construe ... through [[sensory system|touch and sight]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the [[information]] content of a [[concept]] or an observable [[phenomenon]],  selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjectively valued purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a [[ball]] selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding, but not eliminating, the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball.&lt;ref name=Langer/&gt; In a [[type–token distinction]], a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').

Abstraction in its secondary use is a [[#Material process|material process]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alfred Sohn-Rethel, ''Intellectual and manual labour: A critique of epistemology'', Humanities Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; discussed in the [[#Themes|themes below]].

==Origins==
Thinking in abstractions is considered by [[anthropologist]]s, [[archaeologist]]s, and [[sociologist]]s to be one of the key traits in [[modern human behaviour]], which is believed to have developed between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. Its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of human  [[language]], which (whether spoken or written) appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking.

===History===
''Abstraction'' involves induction of ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something. It is the opposite of ''specification'', which is the analysis or breaking-down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete facts. Abstraction can be illustrated with [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (1620), a book of modern scientific philosophy written in the late [[Elizabethan era]]&lt;ref name="Hesse"&gt;Hesse, M. B. (1964), "Francis Bacon's Philosophy of Science", in A Critical History of Western Philosophy, ed. D. J. O'Connor, New York, pp. 141–52.&lt;/ref&gt; of England to encourage modern thinkers to collect specific facts before making any generalizations.

Bacon used and promoted [[inductive reasoning|induction]] as an abstraction tool, and it countered the ancient [[deductive]]-thinking approach that had dominated the intellectual world since the times of Greek philosophers like [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Aristotle]]. Thales (c. 624–546 BCE) believed that everything in the universe comes from one main substance, water. He deduced or specified from a general idea, "everything is water", to the specific forms of water such as ice, snow, fog, and rivers.

Modern scientists can also use the opposite approach of abstraction, or going from particular facts collected into one general idea, such as the motion of the planets ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]] (1642–1727)). When determining that the sun is the center of our solar system ([[Copernicus]] (1473–1543)), scientists  had to utilize thousands of measurements to finally conclude that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit about the sun ([[Kepler]] (1571–1630)), or to assemble multiple specific facts into the law of falling bodies ([[Galileo]] (1564–1642)).

==Themes==

===Compression===
&lt;!--Is this section common knowledge or original research? --&gt;
An abstraction can be seen as a [[data compression|compression]] process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Gregory |last=Chaitin |authorlink=Gregory Chaitin | url=http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165230/http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~chaitin/sciamer3.pdf | archivedate=2015-05-09 |title=The Limits Of Reason |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; mapping multiple different pieces of [[wikt:constituent|constituent]] data to a single piece of abstract data;&lt;ref&gt;[[Murray Gell-Mann]] (1995) "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.6130010105/pdf What is complexity? Remarks on simplicity and complexity by the Nobel Prize-winning author of The Quark and the Jaguar]" ''Complexity'' states the 'algorithmic information complexity' (AIC) of some string of bits is the shortest length computer program which can print out that string of bits.&lt;/ref&gt; based on similarities in the constituent data, for example, many different physical cats map to the abstraction "CAT". This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between "abstract" and "[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]". In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects, and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is [[#Physicality|itself an object]]).
:For example, ''[[#Simplification and ordering|picture 1 below]]''  illustrates the concrete relationship "Cat sits on Mat".
Chains of abstractions can  be [[construe]]d,&lt;ref name = Ross&gt;Ross, L. (1987). The Problem of Construal in Social Inference and Social Psychology. In N. Grunberg, R.E. Nisbett, J. Singer (eds), ''A Distinctive Approach to psychological research: the influence of Stanley Schacter''. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; moving from neural impulses arising from sensory [[perception]] to basic abstractions such as color or [[shape]], to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat, to [[semantic]] abstractions such as the "idea" of a CAT, to classes of objects such as "mammals" and even categories such as "[[#Physicality|object]]" as opposed to "action".
:For example, ''[[#Simplification and ordering|graph 1 below]]''  expresses the abstraction "agent sits on location". This conceptual scheme entails no specific [[hierarchical]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] (such as the one mentioned involving cats and mammals), only a progressive [[#Simplification and ordering|exclusion of detail]].

===Instantiation===

Non-existent things in any particular place and time are often seen as abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times. 

Those abstract things are then said to be ''multiply instantiated'', in the sense of ''picture 1'', ''picture 2'', etc., shown [[#Simplification and ordering|below]]. It is not sufficient, however, to define ''abstract'' ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define ''abstraction'' as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts "cat" and "telephone" abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept "cat" or the concept "telephone". Although the concepts "cat" and "telephone" are ''abstractions'', they are not ''abstract'' in the sense of the objects in ''graph 1''  [[#Simplification and ordering|below]]. We might look at other graphs, in a progression from ''cat'' to ''mammal'' to ''animal'', and see that ''animal'' is more abstract than ''mammal''; but on the other hand ''mammal'' is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to ''[[marsupial]]'' or ''[[monotreme]]''.

Perhaps confusingly, some [[philosophy|philosophies]] refer to ''[[trope (philosophy)|tropes]]'' (instances of properties) as ''[[abstract particular]]s''—e.g., the particular  [[red]]ness of a particular [[apple]] is an ''abstract particular''. This is similar to [[qualia]] and [[sumbebekos]].

===Material process===
Still retaining the primary meaning of 'abstrere' or 'to draw away from', the abstraction of money, for example, works by drawing away from the particular value of things allowing completely incommensurate objects to be compared (see the section on 'Physicality' below). [[Karl Marx]]'s writing on the [[commodity]] abstraction recognizes a parallel process.

The [[state (polity)]] as both concept and material practice exemplifies the two sides of this process of abstraction. Conceptually, 'the current concept of the state is an abstraction from the much more concrete early-modern use as the standing or status of the prince, his visible estates'. At the same time, materially, the 'practice of statehood is now constitutively and materially more abstract than at the time when princes ruled as the embodiment of extended power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In – Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}, pp. 318–19.&lt;/ref&gt; {{further information|Power projection|Display behavior}}

===Ontological status===
The way that physical objects, like rocks and trees, have [[category of being|being]] differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being, for example the way the [[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], [[particular]], [[individual]]s pictured in ''[[#Simplification and ordering|picture 1]]'' exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in ''[[#Simplification and ordering|graph 1]]'' exist. That difference accounts for the [[ontological]] usefulness of the word "abstract". The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.

===Physicality===
{{Further information|History of accounting#Ancient history}}
A physical object (a possible referent of a concept or word) is considered ''concrete'' (not abstract) if it is a ''particular individual'' that occupies a particular place and time. However, in the secondary sense of the term 'abstraction', this physical object can carry materially abstracting processes. For example, record-keeping aids throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in containers. According to {{harvnb|Schmandt-Besserat|(1981)}}, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a [[bill of lading]] or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers for the count, marks were placed on the outside of the containers. These physical marks, in other words, acted as material abstractions of a materially abstract process of accounting, using conceptual abstractions (numbers) to communicate its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Eventually ([http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084757/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html |date=January 30, 2012 }}) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|author-link=Eleanor Robson|year=2008|title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq|isbn=978-0-691-09182-2}}. p. 5: these calculi were in use in Iraq for primitive accounting systems as early as 3200–3000 BCE, with commodity-specific counting representation systems. Balanced accounting was in use by 3000–2350 BCE, and a [[sexagesimal number system]] was in use 2350–2000 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in [[reality]] or exist only as sensory experiences, like the color [[red]]. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like ''God'', ''the number three'', and ''goodness'' are real, abstract, or both.

An approach to resolving such difficulty is to use ''[[predicate (grammar)|predicates]]'' as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g., ''good''). Questions about the properties of things are then [[proposition]]s about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the ''graph 1''  [[#Simplification and ordering|below]], the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates.

===Referencing and referring===
Abstractions sometimes have ambiguous [[referent]]s; for example, "[[happiness]]" (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or [[being|states of being]] which make them happy. Likewise, "[[architecture]]" refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of creation and [[innovation]] which aim at elegant solutions to [[construction]] problems, to the use of space, and to the attempt to evoke an [[emotion|emotional response]] in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.&lt;!--See discussion pages 3 to 12 in Eugene Raskin, ''Architecturally Speaking, 2nd edition'', a Delta book, Dell (1966), trade paperback, 129 pages--&gt;

===Simplification and ordering===
Abstraction uses a [[strategy]] of simplification, wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective [[communication]] about things in the abstract requires an [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient. This is true for all verbal/abstract communication.

[[File:Cat-on-mat.svg|thumb|250px|[[Conceptual graph]] for A Cat sitting on the Mat ''(graph 1)'']]
[[File:JerryFelix.JPG|right|thumb|125px|Cat on Mat ''(picture 1)'']]
For example, many different things can be [[red]]. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in ''picture 1'', to the right). The property of ''[[red]]ness'' and the [[Relation of Ideas|relation]] ''[[sitting|sitting-on]]'' are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram ''graph 1'' identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their five labels), whereas the ''picture 1'' shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.

''Graph 1'' details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example, the arrow between the ''agent'' and ''CAT:Elsie'' depicts an example of an ''[[is-a]]'' relationship, as does the arrow between the ''location'' and the ''MAT''. The arrows between the [[gerund]]/[[present participle]] ''SITTING'' and the [[noun]]s ''agent'' and ''location'' express the [[diagram]]'s basic relationship; ''"agent is SITTING on location"''; ''Elsie'' is an instance of ''CAT''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John F. Sowa|Sowa, John F.]] (1984). ''Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|978-0-201-14472-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the description ''sitting-on'' (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979):&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter]] (1979) ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

::::::(6) my copy of the May 18 edition of ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' as it was when I first picked it up (as contrasted with my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, burning)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no [[loss of generality]]. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about something, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.

===Thought processes===
In [[philosophy|philosophical terminology]], ''abstraction'' is the [[thinking|thought process]] wherein [[idea]]s&lt;ref&gt;But an idea can be [[symbol]]ized. "A symbol is any device whereby we are enabled to make an abstraction." -- p.xi and chapter 20 of [[Suzanne K. Langer]] (1953), ''Feeling and Form: a theory of art developed from '''Philosophy in a New Key''''': New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 431 pages, index.&lt;/ref&gt; are distanced from [[object (philosophy)|objects]].

==As used in different disciplines==

===In art===
{{Main article|Abstraction (art)}}
Typically, ''abstraction'' is used in the arts as a [[synonym]] for [[abstract art]] in general. Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world—it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003405/abstract-art|title=abstract art|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. NY/New Haven: The Drawing Center/Yale University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-300-10826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm National Gallery of Art: Abstraction.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608000000/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer science===
{{Main article|Abstraction (software engineering)}}
[[Computer scientists]] use abstraction to make models that can be used and re-used without having to re-write all the program code for each new application on every different type of computer. They [[communication|communicate]] their solutions with the computer by writing [[source code]] in some particular [[computer language]] which can be translated into [[machine code]] for different types of computers to execute. Abstraction allows program designers to separate categories and concepts related to computing problems from specific instances of implementation. This means that the program code can be written so that it does not depend on the specific details of supporting applications, [[operating system]] software or hardware, but on an abstract concept of the solution to the problem that can then be integrated with the system with minimal additional work.

=== In general semantics ===
Abstractions and levels of abstraction play an important role in the theory of [[general semantics]] originated by [[Alfred Korzybski]]. [[Anatol Rapoport]] wrote: "Abstracting is a mechanism by which an infinite variety of experiences can be mapped on short noises (words)."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===In linguistics===
{{Main article|Abstraction (linguistics)}}
Researchers in [[linguistics]] frequently apply abstraction so as to allow analysis of the phenomena of language at the desired level of detail. A commonly used abstraction, the ''[[phoneme]]'', abstracts [[speech sound]]s in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning. Other analogous kinds of abstractions (sometimes called "[[emic unit]]s") considered by linguists include [[morpheme]]s, [[grapheme]]s, and [[lexeme]]s.

Abstraction also arises in the relation between [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]]. Pragmatics involves considerations that make reference to the user of the language; semantics considers expressions and what they denote (the [[designata]]) abstracted from the language user; and syntax considers only the expressions themselves, abstracted from the designata.

===In mathematics===
{{Main article|Abstraction (mathematics)}}
Abstraction in [[mathematics]] is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.

The advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:
* It reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics
* Known results in one area can suggest [[conjecture]]s in a related area
* Techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in a related area

The main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and require a degree of [[mathematical maturity]] and experience before they can be assimilated.

In music, the term ''abstraction'' can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of [[tonality]]. [[Atonal]] music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM Washington State University: Glossary of Abstraction.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911121123/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/ABSTRACT.HTM |date=September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In neurology===
{{Further information|Intelligence|Mental rotation|Mental operations}}
A recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts. This is because abstract concepts elicit greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts which elicit greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Jing | last2 = Conder | first2 = Julie A. | last3 = Blitzer | first3 = David N. | last4 = Shinkareva | first4 = Svetlana V. | year = 2010 | title = Neural Representation of Abstract and Concrete Concepts: A Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Studies | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 31| issue = 10| pages = 1459–1468| doi = 10.1002/hbm.20950 | pmid = 20108224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research into the [[human brain]] suggests that the left and right hemispheres differ in their handling of abstraction. For example, one meta-analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Lewis "Cortical Networks Related to Human Use of Tools" '''12''' (3): 211–231 ''The Neuroscientist'' (June 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In philosophy===
Abstraction in [[philosophy]] is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in [[concept]] formation of recognizing some set of common features in [[individual]]s, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding [[empiricism]] and the [[problem of universals]]. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under [[predicate abstraction]]. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is [[thought space]].

===In psychology===
[[Carl Jung]]'s definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive, different complementary psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies, such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is [[concretism (psychology)|concretism]]. ''Abstraction'' is one of Jung's 57 definitions in Chapter XI of ''[[Psychological Types]]''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is an abstract ''thinking'', just as there is abstract ''feeling'', ''sensation'' and ''intuition''. Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous ''sensation'' and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic ''intuition''. (Jung, [1921] (1971): par. 678).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In social theory===
In social theory, abstraction is used as both an ideational and material process. [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]], asked "Can there be abstraction other than by thought?"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He used the example of commodity abstraction to show that abstraction occurs in practice as people create systems of abstract exchange that extend beyond the immediate physicality of the object and yet have real and immediate consequences. This work was extended through the 'Constitutive Abstraction' approach of writers associated with the Journal [[Arena (Australian publishing co-operative)|''Arena'']]. Two books that have taken this theme of the abstraction of social relations as an organizing process in human history are {{Cite book |  title= Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community | url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0761950737}}(1996) and the second volume of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community, published in 2006: {{Cite book | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In – Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 }} These books argue that the nation is an abstract community bringing together strangers who will never meet as such; thus constituting materially real and substantial, but abstracted and mediated relations. The books suggest that contemporary processes of globalization and mediatization have contributed to materially abstracting relations between people, with major consequences for how we live our lives.

It can be easily argued that abstraction is an elementary methodological tool in several disciplines of social science. These disciplines have definite and different man concepts that highlight those aspects of man and his behaviour by idealization that are relevant for the given human science. For example, homo sociologicus is the man as sociology abstracts and idealizes it, depicting man as a social being. Moreover, we could talk about homo cyber sapiens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steels |first=Luc |title=The Homo Cyber Sapiens, the Robot Homonidus Intelligens, and the 'Artificial Life' Approach to Artificial Intelligence |location=Brussel |publisher=Vrije Universiteit, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the man who can extend his biologically determined intelligence thanks to new technologies), or homo creativus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Inkinen | first = Sam | year = 2009 | title = Homo Creativus – Creativity and Serendipity Management in Third Generation Science and Technology Parks | url = | journal = Science and Public Policy | volume = 36| issue = 7 | pages = 537–548| doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (who is simply creative).

Abstraction (combined with Weberian [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]]) plays a crucial role in [[economics]]. Breaking away from directly experienced reality was a common trend in 19th century sciences (especially [[physics]]), and this was the effort which was fundamentally determined the way economics tried and still tries to approach the economic aspects of social life. It is abstraction we meet in the case of both Newton’s physics and the neoclassical theory, since the goal was to grasp the unchangeable and timeless essence of phenomena. For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] created the concept of the material point by following the abstraction method so that he abstracted from the dimension and shape of any perceptible object, preserving only inertial and translational motion. Material point is the ultimate and common feature of all bodies. [[Neoclassical economists]] created the indefinitely abstract notion of [[homo economicus]] by following the same procedure. Economists abstract from all individual and personal qualities in order to get to those characteristics that embody the essence of economic activity. Eventually, it is the substance of the economic man that they try to grasp. Any characteristic beyond it only disturbs the functioning of this essential core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbács |first=Peter |chapter=Methodological Principles and an Epistemological Introduction|pages=1–52|title= The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ad hoc'' hypothesis}}
[[File:Leprechaun ill artlibre jnl.png|thumb|200px|If someone wants to believe in [[leprechaun]]s, they can avoid ever being proven wrong by using ''ad hoc'' hypotheses (e.g., by adding "they are invisible", then "their motives are complex", and so on).&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). How to Think Straight About Psychology. Boston: Pearson Education. Pages 19-33&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[science]] and [[philosophy]], an '''''ad hoc'' hypothesis''' is a [[hypothesis]] added to a [[theory]] in order to save it from being [[falsified]]. Often, ''ad hoc'' hypothesizing is employed to compensate for anomalies not anticipated by the theory in its unmodified form.

==In the scientific community==
Scientists are often [[Scientific skepticism|skeptical]] of theories that rely on frequent, unsupported adjustments to sustain them. This is because, if a theorist so chooses, there is no limit to the number of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses that they could add. Thus the theory becomes more and more complex, but is never falsified. This is often at a cost to the theory's [[predictive power]], however.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007"/&gt; ''Ad hoc'' hypotheses are often characteristic of [[pseudoscientific]] subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis." ''The Skeptic's Dictionary''. 22 Jun. 2008 &lt;http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
====Embryos of falsifiable hypotheses and theories====
An ''ad hoc'' hypothesis is not necessarily incorrect; in some cases, a minor change to a theory was all that was necessary. For example, [[Albert Einstein]]'s addition of the [[cosmological constant]] to [[general relativity]] in order to allow a [[static universe]] was ''ad hoc''. Although he later referred to it as his "greatest blunder", it may correspond to theories of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M University. "Einstein's Biggest Blunder? Dark Energy May Be Consistent With Cosmological Constant." ''ScienceDaily'' 28 November 2007. 22 June 2008 &lt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071127142128.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mislabelling criticism of methodology as ad hoc====
The assumption that people are prone to make up ad hoc hypotheses to defend their world views is criticized by a number of [[history of science|historians of science]] and [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] as it can lead to allegations of any valid criticism being an attempt to justify a specific theory that is not there. Such allegations can stand in the way of important criticism of flawed methodologies, thus causing the flawed methods to remain in continued use, by allegations that anyone who point out flaws in the methods doing it to defend a purported worldview. The allegations are made [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and unable to self-correct by explaining away any criticism of the allegations as [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] or [[self-deception]]. The problem includes [[false dichotomy|false dichotomies]] that claim that there is a face-off between two world views, missing the point that any number of hypotheses and theories make some predictions that incidentally happen to overlap with predictions made by other hypotheses or theories while also making some unique predictions (e.g. a partial incidental overlap but also key differences of predictions between the obsolete [[luminiferous aether]] theory and the modern [[vacuum energy]] theory that make the evidence that falsify the former fall outside the predictions made by the latter) which is often confused by "ad hoc" allegers with one hypothesis being a "justification" for another hypothesis with different predictions. False dichotomies cause not only allegations against hypotheses and theories but also against general remarks of flawed methodologies that suggest no specific hypotheses or theories that can dismiss remarks of technical errors in the equipment, remarks of statistical [[confirmation bias]]es that are due to institutional [[publication bias]] between "ordinary claims" and "extraordinary claims" rather than individual brains, remarks of biased searching for other explanations in some cases but not others that lead to false appearances of a phenomenon "really" existing in one group but not in another, and other types of methodological errors. By arguing that a diversity of hypotheses and theories until falsification enhances the possibility of one correct one being among them and surviving future falsification attempts, the distinction between "claimant" individuals and "non-claimant" institutions that is implicit in the concept of [[burden of proof (philosophy)|burden of proof]] is criticized for not being evidence-based and that the same empirical data can falsify many hypotheses and theories with overlapping predictions without the expensive separate testing of each hypothesis that is alleged when claiming that "most hypotheses must be ignored to save money".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Agassi, Abraham Meidan (2016) "Beg to Differ: The Logic of Disputes and Argumentation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Home (2013) "Science under Scrutiny: The Place of History and Philosophy of Science"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaps in knowledge and unclear observations===
Naturally, some gaps in knowledge, and even some observations that contradict a theory, must be temporarily tolerated while research continues. To temper ''ad hoc'' hypothesizing in science, common practice includes [[Falsifiability#Falsificationism|falsificationism]] (somewhat in the philosophy of [[Occam's razor]]). Falsificationism means scientists become more likely to reject a theory as it becomes increasingly burdened by ignored contradicting observations, and by ''ad hoc'' hypotheses.

[[File:No Smoking.svg|thumb|upright|[[Smoking]] is now [[smoking ban|banned]] in public buildings in many parts of the world.]]
A '''ban''' is a formal or informal [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{OED|ban}}&lt;/ref&gt; of something. Bans are formed for the prohibition of activities within a certain political territory. Some see this as a negative act (equating it to a form of [[censorship]] or [[discrimination]]) and others see it as maintaining the "''[[status quo]]''". Some bans in commerce are referred to as [[embargo]]es. ''Ban'' is also used as a verb similar in meaning to "to prohibit".

==Etymology==
{{see|ban (medieval)}}
In current English usage, ''ban'' is mostly synonymous with ''prohibition''. Historically, Old English ''(ge)bann'' is a derivation from the verb ''bannan'' "to summon, command, proclaim" from an earlier [[Common Germanic]] ''*bannan'' "to command, forbid, banish, curse". The modern sense "to prohibit" is influenced by the cognate [[Old Norse]] ''banna'' "to curse, to prohibit" and also from [[Old French]] ''ban'', ultimately a loan from [[Old Frankish]], meaning "[[outlawry]], banishment".&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

The Indo-European etymology of the Germanic term is from a root ''*bha-'' meaning "to speak". Its original meaning was [[magical thinking|magical]], referring to utterances that carried a power to [[curse]].

== Banned political parties ==

In many countries [[political party|political parties]] or groups are banned. Parties may be banned for many reasons, including extremism and anti-democratic ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Issacharoff|first=Samuel|title=Fragile Democracies|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=2007-03-31|volume=120|page=1405}}&lt;/ref&gt; on ethnic or religious grounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogaards|first=Matthijs |author2=Matthias Basedau |author3=Christof Hartmann|title=Ethnic party bans in Africa: an introduction|journal=Democratization|date=2010-07-21|volume=17|issue=4|page=599|doi=10.1080/13510347.2010.491183}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-02-02--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes simply because the group opposes government policies, with the ban sometimes alleging wrongdoing as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/22/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum The Guardian newspaper: Zimbabwe bans political rallies as unrest grows, 22 February 2007]. Example of a ban on political protests declared legal by a court.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]], for instance, has a long history behind its modern practice of banning political parties. The [[Nazi Party]] was banned in 1923; after the Nazi Party came into power in 1933 opposing parties such as the Social Democrats and [[Communist Party]] were banned, the Nazi Party was again banned and the ban on other parties lifted after the Nazi defeat in 1945, and the Communist Party was again banned from 1956 to 1968.

== Banning marriages ==
There have been many bans on marriages, and sometimes other sexual liaisons, between people of different ethnic background or religion, for example between non-Jews and Jews in Nazi Germany, people classified as "white" and non-whites in [[apartheid]] South Africa, etc.

For much of the 1800s and 1900s there were bans on marriage between people of different races ([[interracial marriage]]) in many of the [[United States]]. However, the ban on interracial marriage was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1967 in the landmark [[civil rights]] case ''[[Loving vs. Virginia]]'', in which the Court ruled [[Virginia]]'s [[miscegenation]] law an [[unconstitutional]] violation of the fundamental right to marriage. Historically [[child marriage]] was common, but is now banned in many countries.

== Banned persons ==
{{See also|List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid}}

The [[Imperial ban]] was a form of [[outlaw]]ry in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. At different times, it could be declared by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], by courts including the [[Vehmic court|League of the Holy Court]] ({{lang-de|Vehmgericht}}, {{IPA-de|féːmgəʀɪχt|pron}}) and the {{lang|de|[[Reichskammergericht]]}}, or by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. People under Imperial ban lost all their rights and possessions, and anyone had the right to rob, injure or kill such persons without legal consequences. The Imperial ban automatically followed the [[excommunication]] of a person, and extended to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban.

During the [[apartheid]] régime in [[South Africa]], the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government issued banning orders to individuals seen to be threats to its power — often black politicians or organizations — these banning orders acted as [[suppression order]]s. Individuals banned by the [[Suppression of Communism Act, 1950]] (which effectively defined "Communism" as opposition to the government) could not communicate with more than one person at any time unless at home (thus preventing them from engaging in political activities), travel to areas{{clarify|date=August 2016}} without government approval, or leave the country.

==Censorship==
Existing publications may be banned, and new publications prohibited from discussing certain topics or taking certain viewpoints. [[Censorship]] is the enacting and enforcing of such bans.

==Health and safety==
Bans in various jurisdictions on [[Overview of gun laws by nation|possession of some weapons]], [[Smoking ban|smoking]], and [[Prohibition of drugs|narcotic drugs]] are enacted to exert control over the [[general public]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7193">In [[mathematics]], the [[infinite set|infinite]] [[cardinal number]]s are represented by the [[Hebrew letter]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt; ([[Aleph (letter)|aleph]]) indexed with a subscript that runs over the [[ordinal number]]s (see [[aleph number]]).  The second [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letter]] &lt;math&gt;\beth&lt;/math&gt; ([[bet (letter)|beth]]) is used in a related way, but does not necessarily index all of the numbers indexed by &lt;math&gt;\aleph&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==
To define the '''beth numbers''', start by letting

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_0=\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;

be the cardinality of any [[countably infinite]] [[set (mathematics)|set]]; for concreteness, take the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; of [[natural number]]s to be a typical case. Denote by ''P''(''A'') the [[power set]] of ''A''; i.e., the set of all subsets of ''A''. Then define

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha+1}=2^{\beth_{\alpha}},&lt;/math&gt;

which is the cardinality of the power set of ''A'' if &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of ''A''.

Given this definition,

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_0,\ \beth_1,\ \beth_2,\ \beth_3,\ \dots&lt;/math&gt;

are respectively the cardinalities of

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N},\ P(\mathbb{N}),\ P(P(\mathbb{N})),\ P(P(P(\mathbb{N}))),\ \dots.&lt;/math&gt;

so that the second beth number &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;, the [[cardinality of the continuum]], and the third beth number &lt;math&gt;\beth_2&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of the power set of the continuum.

Because of [[Cantor's theorem]] each set in the preceding sequence has cardinality strictly greater than the one preceding it. For infinite [[limit ordinal]]s λ the corresponding beth number is defined as the [[supremum]] of the beth numbers for all ordinals strictly smaller than λ:

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\lambda}=\sup\{ \beth_{\alpha}:\alpha&lt;\lambda \}.&lt;/math&gt;

One can also show that the [[von Neumann universe]]s &lt;math&gt;V_{\omega+\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; have cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Relation to the aleph numbers ==
Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], infinite cardinalities are [[total order|linearly ordered]]; no two cardinalities can fail to be comparable.  Thus, since by definition no infinite cardinalities are between &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that 
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_1 \ge \aleph_1.&lt;/math&gt;
Repeating this argument (see  [[transfinite induction]]) yields 
&lt;math&gt;\beth_\alpha \ge \aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; 
for all ordinals &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[continuum hypothesis]] is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_1=\aleph_1.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]] says the sequence of beth numbers thus defined is the same as the sequence of [[aleph number]]s, i.e., 
&lt;math&gt;\beth_\alpha = \aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; 
for all ordinals &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Since this is defined to be &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; or [[aleph null]] then sets with cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_0&lt;/math&gt; include:

*the [[natural number]]s '''N'''
*the [[rational number]]s '''Q'''
*the [[algebraic number]]s
*the [[computable number]]s and [[computable set]]s
*the set of [[finite set]]s of [[integer]]s
*the set of [[Multiset|finite multiset]]s of [[integer]]s
*the set of [[finite sequence]]s of [[integer]]s

=== Beth one ===

{{main|cardinality of the continuum}}

Sets with cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt; include:

*the [[transcendental numbers]]
*the [[irrational number]]s
*the [[real number]]s '''R'''
*the [[complex number]]s '''C'''
*the [[uncomputable real number]]s
*[[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
*the [[power set]] of the [[natural number]]s (the set of all subsets of the natural numbers)
*the set of [[sequence]]s of integers (i.e. all functions '''N''' → '''Z''', often denoted '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt;)
*the set of sequences of real numbers, '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt;
*the set of all [[real analytic function]]s from '''R''' to '''R'''
*the set of all [[continuous function]]s from '''R''' to '''R'''
*the set of finite subsets of real numbers
*the set of all [[analytic function]]s from '''C''' to '''C'''

=== Beth two ===
&lt;math&gt;\beth_2&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced ''beth two'') is also referred to as '''2&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;''' (pronounced ''two to the power of c'').

Sets with cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_2&lt;/math&gt; include:

* The [[power set]] of the set of [[real number]]s, so it is the number of [[subset]]s of the [[real line]], or the number of sets of real numbers
* The power set of the power set of the set of natural numbers
* The set of all [[function (mathematics)|functions]] from '''R''' to '''R''' ('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sup&gt;)
* The set of all functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
* The power set of the set of all functions from the set of natural numbers to itself, so it is the number of sets of sequences of natural numbers
* The [[Stone–Čech compactification]]s of '''R''', '''Q''', and '''N'''

=== Beth omega ===
&lt;math&gt;\beth_\omega&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced ''beth omega'') is the smallest uncountable [[strong limit cardinal]].

==Generalization==
The more general symbol &lt;math&gt;\beth_\alpha(\kappa)&lt;/math&gt;, for ordinals α and cardinals κ, is occasionally used. It is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_0(\kappa)=\kappa,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha+1}(\kappa)=2^{\beth_{\alpha}(\kappa)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\lambda}(\kappa)=\sup\{ \beth_{\alpha}(\kappa):\alpha&lt;\lambda \}&lt;/math&gt; if λ is a limit ordinal.

So
:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\alpha}=\beth_{\alpha}(\aleph_0).&lt;/math&gt;

In ZF, for any cardinals κ and μ, there is an ordinal α such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa \le \beth_{\alpha}(\mu).&lt;/math&gt;

And in ZF, for any cardinal κ and ordinals α and β:

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beta}(\beth_{\alpha}(\kappa)) = \beth_{\alpha+\beta}(\kappa).&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] absent [[ur-element]]s with or without the [[axiom of choice]], for any cardinals κ and μ, the equality

:&lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beta}(\kappa) = \beth_{\beta}(\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

holds for all sufficiently large ordinals β (that is, there is an ordinal α such that the equality holds for every ordinal β ≥ α).

This also holds in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with ur-elements with or without the axiom of choice provided the ur-elements form a set which is equinumerous with a [[pure set]] (a set whose [[transitive set#Transitive closure|transitive closure]] contains no ur-elements). If the axiom of choice holds, then any set of ur-elements is equinumerous with a pure set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">In [[Marxism]], '''bourgeois nationalism''' is the practice by the [[ruling class]]es of deliberately dividing people by [[nationality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], or [[religion]], so as to [[distraction|distract]] them from initiating [[class conflict|class warfare]]. It is seen as a [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] [[strategy]] used by the ruling classes to prevent the [[working class]] from uniting against them (hence the Marxist slogan, ''[[Workers of all countries, unite!]]'').

===Soviet Union===

[[File:Leonid Brezhnev Portrait (1).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonid Brezhnev]]]]
After the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] government based its [[Nationality|nationalities]] policy ([[korenization]]) on the principles of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology. According to these principles, all nations should disappear with time, and [[nationalism]] was considered a [[bourgeois]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404100886.html Khiterer, V. (2004) 'Nationalism in the Soviet Union'], in ''Encyclopedia of Russian History'',  Macmillan Reference USA&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Report on the 50th anniversary of the formation of the [[USSR]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]] emphasized: "That is why Communists and all fighters for socialism believe that the main aspect of the national question is unification of the working people, regardless of their national origin, in the common battle against every type of oppression, and for a new social system which rules out exploitation of the working people."&lt;ref&gt;L. I. Brezhnev, ''The 50th Anniversary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'', Moscow, 1972, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:LiuShaoqi_Colour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Liu Shaoqi]]]]
''Bourgeois nationalism'' as a concept was discussed in China by [[Liu Shaoqi]] as follows:
{{quote|The exploitation of wage labour, competition, the squeezing out, suppressing and swallowing of rivals among the capitalists themselves, the resorting to war and even world war, the utilisation of all means to secure a monopoly position in its own country and throughout the world - such is the inherent character of the profit-seeking bourgeoisie. This is the class basis of bourgeois nationalism and of all bourgeois ideologies. [...]
The most vicious manifestations of the development of bourgeois nationalism include the enslavement of the colonial and semi-colonial countries by the imperialist powers, the First World War, the aggression of Hitler and Mussolini and the Japanese warlords during the Second World War, and the schemes for the enslavement of the whole world undertaken by the international imperialist camp, headed by American imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaoqi|first1=Liu|title=Internationalism and Nationalism|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/liu-shaoqi/1952/internationalism_nationalism/ch01.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:VairochanaMingCopper.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vairocana]] as described in the ''Brahmajala Sutra'']]
The '''''{{IAST|Brahmajāla Sūtra}}''''' ({{CJKV|t=梵網經|p=Fànwǎng jīng|r=Bonmōkyō}}), also called the '''''Brahma's Net Sutra''''', is a [[Mahayana]] Buddhist [[Vinaya]] [[Sutra]].  The Chinese translation can be found in the [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]].&lt;ref&gt;Taisho 1484 is found in Volume 24 of the Taisho Tripitaka.{{cite web |url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=T |website=CBETA 漢文大藏經 |script-title=大正新脩大藏經 |title=Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō |language=Chinese |trans-title=Taishō Shinshū Tripitaka |quote=This is an index to the Taisho Tripitaka - nb Volume 24 is listed as the last volume in the 律部 or Vinaya Section.

It is known alternatively as the '''''{{IAST|Brahmajāla Bodhisattva Śīla Sūtra}}''''' ({{CJKV|t=梵網菩薩戒經 |p=Fàn Wǎng Púsà Jiè Jīng}}).

The ''Brahmajāla Sūtra'' is related to the important [[Huayan]] metaphor of [[Indra's net]].

It is not related to the ''[[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutta]]'' of the [[Pāli Canon]] of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]].

==History==
The sutra is traditionally regarded as having been recorded in Sanskrit and then translated into Chinese by [[Kumārajīva]] in 406. Several scholars assume that it was composed in East Asia by unknown authors in the mid-5th century, and is [[Buddhist apocrypha|apocryphal]].&lt;ref name="eob"&gt;Cho, Eunsu.

Therefore the possibility for the Brahmajala Sutra to be an apocryphal sutra is very low.) |page=5,18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
This sutra introduces [[Vairocana]] and his relationship to [[Gautama Buddha]]. It also states [[Bodhisattva Precepts#Brahma Net Sutra|ten major precepts for Bodhisattvas]] ({{CJKV|c=十重戒}}) and the 48 minor precepts to follow to advance along the bodhisattva path.

The bodhisattva precepts of the ''Brahmajala Sutra'' came to be treated in China as a higher ethic a monastic would adopt after ordination in addition to the [[prātimokṣa]] vows. In Japan, the ten precepts came to displace monastic rules almost completely starting with [[Saichō]] and the rise of the [[Tendai]].&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (2008). "Fang wang ching", in A Dictionary of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|0192800620}}, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the sutra derives from the vast net that the god [[Brahma]] hangs in his palace and how each jewel in the net reflects the light of every other jewel:
{{quote| At that time, he [Shakyamuni Buddha] contemplated the wonderful Jewel Net hung in Lord Brahma's palace and preached the Brahmajala Sutta for the Great Assembly. He said: "The innumerable worlds in the cosmos are like the eyes of the net. Each and every world is different, its variety infinite. So too are the Dharma Doors (methods of cultivation) taught by the Buddhas.&lt;ref name="online_sutra"&gt;Sutra Translation Committee of the US and Canada (2000).

The sutra is also noteworthy for describing who Vairocana is as personification of the [[dharma]] or [[Dharmakāya]]:&lt;ref name="online_sutra"/&gt;
{{quote| Now, I, Vairocana Buddha, am sitting atop a lotus pedestal; on a thousand flowers surrounding me are a thousand Sakyamuni Buddhas. Each flower supports a hundred million worlds; in each world a Sakyamuni Buddha appears. All are seated beneath a Bodhi-tree, all simultaneously attain Buddhahood. All these innumerable Buddhas have Vairocana as their original body.&lt;ref name="online_sutra"&gt;Sutra Translation Committee of the US and Canada (2000).

==Bodhisattva Precepts==

The ''Brahmajala Sutra'' has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor rules known as the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S.

Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the 10 Major Precepts are considered the Bodhisattva Precepts. According to the sutra, the 10 Major Bodhisattva Precepts are in summary:&lt;ref name="Thanh 2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thanh |first=Minh |title=The Brahma Net Sutra |year=2000 |url=http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |publisher=New York: Sutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151922/http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Not to kill or encourage others to kill.
# Not to steal or encourage others to steal.
# Not to engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. A monk is expected to abstain from sexual conduct entirely.
# Not to use false words and speech, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to trade or sell alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so.
# Not to broadcast the misdeeds or faults of the Buddhist assembly, nor encourage others to do so.
# Not to praise oneself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to be stingy, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to harbor anger or encourage others to be angry.
# Not to speak ill of the Buddha, the Dharma or the Sangha (lit. the Triple Jewel) or encourage others to do so.

Breaking any of these precepts is described as a prarajika (Skt. Unforgivable) offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ymba.org/books/brahma-net-sutra-moral-code-bodhisattva/brahma-net-sutra/major-precepts |website=Young Men Buddhist Association of America |translator-last1=Thanh |translator-first1=Minh |translator-last2=Leigh |translator-first2=P.D. |title=Brahma Net Sutra:Moral Code of the Bodhisattva |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''CODA System''''' is a [[role-playing game system]] designed by [[Decipher, Inc.]]

==Description==
After [[Last Unicorn Games]] was purchased by [[Wizards of the Coast]] some of the Last Unicorn staff started working for [[Decipher, Inc.]] to create their ''[[Star Trek Roleplaying Game]]'', which used the ''CODA System''.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''CODA System'' was also used, in an altered form, in their ''[[Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]''.  It uses [[dice|six-sided]] dice, to resolve actions. It uses a set of character statistics, as well as skills and ''edges'', that function similarly to the ''[[d20 System]]'' 'Feats' systems.  Characters belong to a class, and can adopt more than one class as they progress.

The ''CODA System'' has characters ''advancing'' and refers to characters as having ''N advancements'', similar to having a particular level in the d20 System.  Advancing gives the player a number of ''picks'' with which to buy upgrades to their character's statistics and abilities.

Characters have a total [[hit point]] pool segmented into health levels; each health level of damage incurred imposes a wound penalty to certain actions.  Characters also have a number of 'weariness' levels; extended or intense activity can result in penalties to certain actions based on the number of weariness levels lost.

A '''charnel ground''' (Devanagari:  श्मशान; Romanized Sanskrit: śmaśān; Tibetan pronunciation: durtrö; {{bo|t=དུར་ཁྲོད|w=dur khrod}}),&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"&gt;Rigpa Shedra (July 2009). 'Charnel ground'. Source: [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Charnel_ground] (accessed: Saturday December 19, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; in concrete terms, is an above-ground site for the putrefaction of bodies, generally human, where formerly living tissue is left to decompose uncovered.  Although it may have demarcated locations within it functionally identified as burial grounds, [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and [[crematorium|crematoria]], it is distinct from these as well as from [[crypt]]s or [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]]s.

In a religious sense, it is also a very important location for [[sadhana]] and ritual activity for Indo-Tibetan traditions of [[Dharma]] particularly those traditions iterated by the [[Tantra|Tantric]] view such as [[Kashmiri Shaivism]], [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] tradition, [[Esoteric Buddhism]], [[Vajrayana]], [[Mantrayana]], [[Dzogchen]], and the [[sadhana]] of [[Chöd]], [[Phowa]] and [[Zhitro]], etc. The charnel ground is also an archetypal [[liminality]] that figures prominently in the literature and liturgy and as an artistic motif in Dharmic Traditions and cultures iterated by the more [[antinomian]] and esoteric aspects of traditional Indian culture.

==India==
Throughout [[History of India|Ancient India]] and [[Medieval India]], charnel grounds in the form of open air [[crematoria]] were historically often located along rivers and many ancient famous charnel sites are now 'sanitized' pilgrimage sites (Sanskrit: [[Tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]]) and areas of significant domestic income through cultural tourism. However, proper "charnel grounds" can still be found in India, specially near large rivers banks and areas where abandoned people (without family) are cremated or simply left to decompose. These areas are often frequented by [[Aghori]]s, a [[Kapalika]] sect, that follows similar meditation techniques, as those thought by the 84 [[Mahasiddha]]s. A typical Aghori sadhana (at the charnel ground) lasts for 12 years.

==Himalayan 'sky burial'==
In the [[Himalaya]] where tillable topsoil for burial and fuel for cremation is scarce and a valuable commodity, the location of a so-called [[sky burial]] is identified with a charnel ground.&lt;ref name="Gold, Peter 1994 p.141"&gt;Gold, Peter (1994). ''Navajo and Tibetan Sacred Wisdom:  The Circle of the Spirit'' (Paperback). Inner Traditions.  {{ISBN|0-89281-411-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-89281-411-4}}, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sutrayana and Early Buddhism==
In the [[Pali Canon]] discourses, the Buddha frequently instructs his disciples to seek out a secluded dwelling (in a forest, under the shade of a tree, mountain, glen, hillside cave, charnel ground, jungle grove, in the open, or on a heap of straw).&lt;ref&gt;In these suttas, the Buddha instructs monks to stay in the forest in order to aid their meditation practice DN 2,DN 11,DN 12,DN 16,  MN 4,MN 10, MN 27,MN 39,MN 60,MN 66,MN 101, MN 105, MN 107, MN 125, AN 4.259, AN 5.75, AN 5.76, AN 5.114, AN 10.60, Sn 1.12, Sn 3.11, SN 11.3, SN 22.80, This list is not exhaustive as there are many more related suttas.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Sutrayana]] tradition of the 'Nine Cemetery Contemplations' (Pali: nava sīvathikā-manasikāra) of the ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' demonstrate that charnel ground meditations were part of [[Early Buddhism]].

'Cemetery contemplations', as described in ''[[Mahasatipatthana Sutta]]'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]]: 22)  and the ''[[Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta]]'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]]: 10):

{{Quote|...have as their objects a corpse one or two or three days old, swollen up, blue-black in colour, full of corruption; a corpse eaten by crows, etc.; a framework of bones; flesh hanging from it, bespattered with blood, held together by the sinews; without flesh and blood, but still held together by the sinews; bones scattered in all direction; bleached and resembling shells; heaped together after the lapse of years; weathered and crumbled to dust.

At the end of each of these contemplations there follows the conclusion: "This body of mine also has this nature, has this destiny, cannot escape it.

Similar are the 10 objects of loathsomeness (asubha q.v.).|&lt;ref&gt;Nyanatiloka (1980). ''Buddhist Dictionary: Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines.'' Fourth Revised Edition edited by Nyanaponika. Kandy, Sri Lanka: Buddhist Publication Society. Source: [http://www.palikanon.com/english/wtb/s_t/siivathikaa.htm] (accessed: Tuesday December 24, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Polysemy and metaphor==
{{cleanup|section|date=March 2012}}
On the face of it or alternatively the cosmetic level, the charnel ground is simply a locality often [[chthonic]] where bodies are disposed of, either by [[cremation]] or [[burial]].&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;  Though the charnel ground is to be understood as a polysemy and metaphor it must be emphasized that holy people as part of their sadhana and natural spiritual evolution grappling with death, impermanence and transition did historically in both India, China and Tibet as well as in other localities, frequent charnel grounds, crematoriums and cemeteries and were often feared and despised by people who did not understand their 'proclivities' (Sanskrit: anusaya).

From a deeper structural significance and getting to the substantive bones of the Vajrayana spiritual point of view however, the charnel ground is full of profound [[Transpersonal psychology|transpersonal]] significance. It represents the 'death of [[Ego (religion)|ego]]' (Sanskrit: atmayajna), and the end of: 
*'''attachment''' (Sanskrit: ''[[Upādāna]]''; Tibetan: ''[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/len_pa len pa]'') to this body and life
*'''craving''' (Sanskrit: ''[[tṛṣṇā|{{IAST|Tṛṣṇā}}]]''; Tibetan: ''[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/sred_pa sred pa]'') for a body and life in the future
*'''fear of death''' (Sanskrit: abhiniveśa)
*'''aversion''' (Sanskrit: dveṣa; Wylie: zhe sdang)  to the decay of 'impermanence' (Sanskrit: [[anitya]]).&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;
It is worth noting that 'attachment', 'craving', 'fear' and 'aversion' above cited in bold font are somewhat standardized and hence less-rich lexical choices for the [[semantic field]] represented by the four of the 'Five Poisons' (Sanskrit: pancha [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesha]]) they denote.

Prior to spiritual realization, charnel grounds are to be understood as terrifying places, full of 'roaming spirits' (Sanskrit: [[gana]]) and '[[hungry ghosts]]' (Sanskrit: [[pretas]]) indeed localities that incite consuming fear. In a charnel ground there are bodies everywhere in different states of decomposition: freshly dead bodies, decaying bodies, skeletons and disembodied bones.&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;

[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown]] (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;127) conveys how the 'charnel ground' experience may present itself in the modern Western [[mindstream]] situations of emotional intensity, protracted peak performance, marginalization and extreme desperation:

{{quote|In contemporary Western society, the charnel ground might be a prison, a homeless shelter, the welfare roll, or a factory assembly line. The key to its successful support of practice is its desperate, hopeless, or terrifying quality. For that matter, there are environments that appear prosperous and privileged to others but are charnel grounds for their inhabitants--Hollywood, Madison Avenue, Wall Street, Washington, D.C. These are worlds in which extreme competitiveness, speed, and power rule, and the actors in their dramas experience intense emotion, ambition, and fear. The intensity of their dynamics makes all of these situations ripe for the Vajrayana practice of the charnel ground.|&lt;ref name="Simmer-Brown 2001 p.127"&gt;[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown, Judith]] (2001). ''Dakini's warm breath: the feminine principle in Tibetan Buddhism''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-920-4}} (paperback), p.127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Denizens and pastimes of the charnel ground==
*[[Shiva]] as [[Bhairava]]
*'Outcastes' (Sanskrit: [[Chandala]]) literally cast out from the castes, outside the [[Varnashrama Dharma]] of the ''[[status quo]]''.

===Dancing===
[[File:GanpatiTibetan.jpg|thumb|left|Ganapati, Maha Rakta]]
Tibetan representations of Ganesha show ambivalent or richly different depictions of him.&lt;ref name="Nagar, p. 185"&gt;Nagar, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In one Tibetan form he is shown being trodden under foot by [[Mahakala|Mahākala]], a popular Tibetan deity.&lt;ref name="Nagar, p. 185"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Getty, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Other depictions show him as the Destroyer of Obstacles, sometimes dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Nagar, pp. 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt; This play of Ganesha as both the "creator and remover of obstacles" as per his [[epithet]] as well in the two Vajrayana iconographic depictions of him as that which consumes (Maha Rakta) and that which is consumed (danced upon by Vignantaka) is key to the reciprocity rites of the charnel ground.

''Ganapati, Maha Rakta'' (Tibetan: tsog gi dag po, mar chen. English: The Great Red Lord of Hosts or [[Gana]]s) is a Tantric Buddhist form of Ganapati ([[Ganesha]]) related to the [[Chakrasamvara]] Cycle of Tantras. The Sanskrit term 'rakta' holds the [[semantic field]] of "blood" and "red''. This form of Ganapati is regarded as an emanation of [[Avalokiteshvara]].

"...beside a lapis lazuli rock mountain is a red lotus with eight petals, in the middle a blue rat expelling various jewels, [mounted on his rat 'steed' (Sanskrit: [[vahana]])] Shri Ganapati with a body red in colour, having an elephant face with sharp white tusks and possessing three eyes, black hair tied in a [[Sikha|topknot]] with a [[cintamani|wishing-gem]] and a red silk ribbon [all] in a bundle on the crown of the head. With twelve hands, the six right hold an axe, [[arrow]], [[ankus|hook]], [[vajra]], sword and spear. The six left [hold] a [[pestle]], bow, [[khatvanga]], [[skullcup]] filled with blood, skullcup filled with human flesh and a shield together with a spear and [[dhvaja|banner]]. The peaceful right and left hands are signified by the vajra and skullcup filled with blood held to the heart. The remaining hands are displayed in a threatening manner. Wearing various silks as a lower garment and adorned with a variety of jewel ornaments, the left foot is extended in a dancing manner, standing in the middle of the bright rays of red flickering light." ([[Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrup]], 1497-1557).&lt;ref&gt;A Gift of Dharma to Kublai Khan By Chogyal Phagpa, Seventh Patriarch of Sakya. Ngorchen Konchog Lhundup, Ngor chos 'byung, folia 323?328. Translated by Jared Rhoton, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vignataka.jpg|thumb|right|Vignantaka trampling or dancing upon Vinayaka]]
This form of Ganapati belongs to a set of three powerful deities known as the 'mar chen kor sum' or the Three Great Red Deities included in a larger set called 'The Thirteen Golden Dharmas' of [[Sakya]]. The other two deities are Kurukulle and Takkiraja.

In depictions of the six-armed protector [[Mahakala]] (Skt: Shad-bhuja Mahakala, Wylie: mGon po phyag drug pa), an elephant-headed figure usually addressed as Vinayaka is seen being trampled by the Dharma Protector, but he does not appear distressed. In [[Vajrayana]] and cognate Buddhist art, He is depicted as a subdued god trampled by Buddhist deities like [[Aparajita]], [[Parnasabari]] and [[Vignataka]].

The Tibetan Ganesha appears, besides bronzes, in the resplendent Thangka paintings alongside the Buddha. In "''Ganesh, studies of an Asian God''," edited by Robert L. BROWN, State University of New York Press, 1992, page 241-242, he wrote that in the Tibetan Ka'gyur tradition, it is said that the Buddha had taught the "Ganapati Hridaya Mantra" (or "Aryaganapatimantra") to disciple [[Ananda]]. The sutra in which the Buddha teaches this mantra can be found here [http://ganesha.bravehost.com/index.html].

The [[lila (divine play)|'pastime' and 'play' (Sanskrit: ''lila'')]] of dancing and its representation in charnel ground literature and visual representations is endemic: [[Ganapati]] as son of Shiva, Ganapati as Lord of Gana, the demonic host of Gana, dancing ganesha, dancing gana, the dance of life and death, what is dance but a continuum of forms, dancing is energetic, dancing is symbolic of spiritual energy in iconography, particularly chthonic imagery of Dharmic Traditions. Energy moves (and cycles) between forms as does dance. The 'wheel' (Sanskrit: [[chakra]], [[mandala]]) in all its permutations and efflorescence is a profound Dharmic cultural artifact enshrining the energetic dance of the Universe. This is particularly applicable in the iconography of [[Nataraja]] and the 'wrathful deities' (Sanskrit: [[Heruka]]) of Vajrayana which are depicted with a flaming [[aureole]], a flaming wheel. This resonates with the deep symbolism of the mystery rite and folklore and folk custom and high culture of [[circle dance]]s which approaches a human [[cultural universal]]. [[Namkhai Norbu]], a famed [[Dzogchen]] master in the [[Bonpo]] tradition and the [[Dharmic Tradition]]s of [[esoteric Buddhism]] has revealed a number of [[terma (Buddhism)|terma]] (Tibetan) of circle dances such as the 'Dance of the [[Six Lokas]] of [[Samantabhadra]]'. The dance is a restricted initiatory rite and its process may not be disclosed as so doing would be a contravention of 'commitments ' (Sanskrit: [[samaya]]) but it may be affirmed that the rite is enacted on a colourful mandala of the [[Five Pure Lights]] and the 'central point' (Sanskrit: [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]]) of the dance mandala is illuminated with a sacred candle known as the 'garbha' (Sanskrit) within the International Dzogchen Community. This terma dance is all clearly applicable to the charnel ground when taken as the 'wheel of becoming' (Sanskrit: [[bhavachakra]]) which generally is demarcated by six distinct 'places' (Sanskrit: [[loka]]).

===Aghora===
[[Dattatreya]] the [[avadhuta]], to whom has been attributed the esteemed nondual medieval song, the'' [[Avadhuta Gita]]'', was a sometime denizen of the charnel ground and a founding deity of the [[Aghor tradition]] according to Barrett (2008: p.&amp;nbsp;33):

{{Quote|...Lord Dattatreya, an antinomian form of Shiva closely associated with the [[cremation ground]], who appeared to Baba Kina Ram atop Girnar Mountain in Gujarat. Considered to be the ''adi guru'' (ancient spiritual teacher) and founding deity of Aghor, Lord Dattatreya offered his own flesh to the young ascetic as ''prasād'' (a kind of blessing), conferring upon him the power of clairvoyance and establishing a guru-disciple relationship between them.|&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Ron (2008). Aghor medicine: pollution, death, and healing in northern India. Edition: illustrated. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-25218-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25218-9}}. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=BSeYR93tIzwC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=dattatreya+aghor&amp;ei=fhCBS-zuIYfulQSl8oCUCg&amp;client=opera&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=dattatreya%20aghor&amp;f=false], p.33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Barrett (2008: p.&amp;nbsp;161) discusses the sadhana of the '[[Aghori|Aghora]]' (Sanskrit; Devanagari: अघोर)&lt;ref&gt;'Aghora' in ''Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' [Online]. Source: [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php] (accessed: Tuesday February 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; in both its left and right-handed proclivites and identifies it as principally cutting through attachments and aversion and foregrounding primordiality, a view uncultured, undomesticated:

{{Quote|The gurus and disciples of Aghor believe their state to be primordial and universal. They believe that all human beings are natural-born Aghori. Hari Baba has said on several occasions that human babies of all societies are without discrimination, that they will play as much in their own filth as with the toys around them. Children become progressively discriminating as they grow older and learn the culturally specific attachments and aversions of their parents. Children become increasingly aware of their mortality as they bump their heads and fall to the ground. They come to fear their mortality and then palliate this fear by finding ways to deny it altogether. In this sense, Aghor ''sādhanā'' is a process of unlearning deeply internalized cultural models. When this ''sādhanā'' takes the form of ''shmashān sādhanā'', the Aghori faces death as a very young child, simultaneously meditating on the totality of life at its two extremes. This ideal example serves as a prototype for other Aghor practices, both left and right, in ritual and in daily life.|&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Ron (2008).

*[[Vetala]] (Sanskrit)
*[[Shaivites]]
*Practitioners of [[Anuyoga]]. The Anuyoga class of tantras of the Nyingmapa is understood as the "Mother Tantras" of the Sarma Schools, this class of literature is also known as "Yogini Tantras" and there is a voluminous Shaivite or Shakta Tantra by the same name, Yoginitantra.
*In the dance of reciprocity that is the beauty and cruelty of the Mystery of living and dying, the rite of [[Ganachakra]] is celebrated, indeed all forms participate in the Ganachakra, there is nothing in the Three Worlds (''[[Trailokya|Triloka]]'') that is not a charnel ground...

Beer (2003: p.&amp;nbsp;102) relates how the symbolism of the [[khatvanga]] that entered [[esoteric Buddhism]] (particularly from [[Padmasambhava]]) was a direct borrowing from the [[Shaivite]] [[Kapalika]]s who frequented places of austerity such as charnel grounds and [[Crossroads (road)|cross roads]] etcetera as a form of 'left-handed path' (Sanskrit: [[vamamarga]]) 'spiritual practice' (Sanskrit: [[sadhana]]):

{{quote|The form of the Buddhist ''khatvanga'' derived from the emblematic staff of the early Indian Shaivite ''yogins'', known as ''kapalikas'' or 'skull-bearers'. The ''kapalikas'' were originally miscreants who had been sentenced to a twelve-year term of penance for the crime of inadvertently killing a Brahmin. The penitent was prescribed to dwell in a forest hut, at a desolate crossroads, in a charnel ground, or under a tree; to live by begging; to practice austerities; and to wear a loin-cloth of hemp, dog, or donkey-skin. They also had to carry the emblems of a human skull as an alms-bowl, and the skull of the Brahmin they had slain mounted upon a wooden staff as a banner.These Hindu ''kapalika'' ascetics soon evolved into an extreme outcaste sect of the 'left-hand' tantric path (Skt. vamamarg) of ''shakti'' or goddess worship. The early Buddhist tantric ''yogins'' and ''yoginis'' adopted the same goddess or ''dakini'' attributes of the ''kapalikas''. These attributes consisted of; bone ornaments, an animal skin loincloth, marks of human ash, a skull-cup, ''damaru'', flaying knife, thighbone trumpet, and the skull-topped tantric staff or ''khatvanga''.|&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (2003).

==Sadhana==
Sadhana in the charnel ground within the Dharmic Traditions may be traced to ancient depictions of the chthonic [[Shiva]] and his [[wikt:chimera|chimeric]] son [[Ganapati]] (Ganesha) who was decapitated and returned to life with the head of an elephant. In certain narratives, Shiva made the Ganesha 'lord of the [[gana]]' (Sanskrit: Ganapati). Such depictions of Shiva, Ganesha and the ganas are evident in literature, architectural ornamentation and iconography, etc. In the Indian traditions of Tantra the charnel ground is very important. In must be remembered that the seat of Shiva and his locality of sadhana is the sacred Mount [[Kailasha]] in the Himalaya. In some non-Buddhist traditions of [[Ganachakra]] such as the Kaula the leader of the rite is known as 'ganapati', which is a title of respect. The Eight Great Charnel Grounds are important in the life of [[Padmasambhava]]. This is one definite way the importance of the charnel ground in sadhana entered and became replicated in the Himalayan Dharmic Tradition. The charnel ground is a particular place that holds powerful teachings on impermanence and is important for slaying the ego. In this, the charnel ground shares with the tradition of [[dark retreat]] that was foregrounded in some Himalayan practice lineages.

[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown]] (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;127) conveys how great [[Mahasiddha]]'s in the [[Nath]] and [[Mantrayana]] [[Buddhadharma]] traditions such as [[Tilopa]] (988–1069) and [[Goraksa|Gorakṣa]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 11th - 12th century) yoked adversity to till the soil of the path and accomplish the fruit, the '[[Ground of Being (Dzogchen)|ground]]' (Sanskrit: āśraya; Wylie: gzhi)&lt;ref&gt;Dudjom Rinpoche and Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje (1991). ''The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: its Fundamentals and History''. Two Volumes. Translated and edited by Gyurme Dorje with Matthew Kapstein. Wisdom Publications, Boston. {{ISBN|0-86171-087-8}}, p.535 Index of Technical Terms&lt;/ref&gt; of realization - worthy case-studies for those with spiritual proclivity:

{{quote|The charnel ground is not merely the hermitage; it can also be discovered or revealed in completely terrifying mundane environments where practitioners find themselves desperate and depressed, where conventional worldly aspirations have  become devastated by grim reality. This is demonstrated in the sacred biographies of the great siddhas of the Vajrayāna tradition. Tilopa attained realization as a grinder of sesame seeds and a procurer for a prominent prostitute. Sarvabhakṣa was an extremely obese glutton, Gorakṣa was a cowherd in remote climes, Taṅtepa was addicted to gambling, and Kumbharipa was a destitute potter. These circumstances were charnel grounds because they were despised in Indian society and the siddhas were viewed as failures, marginal and defiled.|&lt;ref name="Simmer-Brown 2001 p.127"/&gt;}}

==Poetry, song, and literature==
Dyczkowski (1988: p.&amp;nbsp;26) holds that [[Hāla]]'s [[Prakrit literature]] poem the ''[[Gāthāsaptaśati]]'' (third to fifth century CE) is one of the first extant literary references to a [[Kapalika]] where in the poem the Kapalika, who is a female, anoints and besmears her body with the crematory ash from the funeral pyre of her recently deceased lover.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;Dyczkowski, Mark S. G. (1988). ''The canon of the Śaivāgama and The Kubjikā Tantras of the western Kaula tradition''. SUNY series in Kashmir Śaivism. SUNY Press. {{ISBN|0-88706-494-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88706-494-4}} Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=qoZIJMGo4W0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=V%C4%81m%C4%81c%C4%81ra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MfmKHrqqkl&amp;sig=gJGdk8G_oFGes6-jiv8ijNq1lk0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aDFqS_rHCdGTkAWewry2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false] (accessed: Thursday February 4, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This is a literary allusion to the anointing of 'sacred ash' (Sanskrit: [[bhasma]]; [[vibhuti]]) especially associated with [[Shiva]] who applies it all over his body.

Dyczkowski (1988: p.&amp;nbsp;26) relates how [[Krishna Mishra|Kṛṣṇa Miśra]] (c 1050-1100) casts the character of a [[Kāpālika]] in his play, the '' [[Prabodhacandrodaya]]'' and then quotes verbatim a source that renders the creed of this character into English:
{{quote|"My charming ornaments are made from garlands of human skulls." says the Kāpālika, "I dwell in the cremation ground and eat my food from a human skull. I view the world alternately as separate from God ([[Ishvara|Īśvara]]) and one with Him, through the eyes that are made clear with the ointment of yoga... We (Kāpālikas) offer oblations of human flesh mixed with brains, entrails and marrow. We break our fast by drinking liquor ([[Sura (alcoholic beverage)|surā]]) from the skull of a Brahmin. At that time the god Mahābhairava should be worshipped with offerings of awe-inspiring human sacrifices from whose severed throats blood flows in currents."&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt;}}

In Vajrayana poetry, literature and song, particularly that of the '[[songs of realization]]', charnel grounds are often described as containing "rivers of blood", "poisonous waterfalls", and depicted as localities containing dangerous wild beasts. The [[two truths]] doctrine though iterates this view and when perceived differently, charnel grounds are peaceful places of [[beatitude|beatific]] [[solitude]] and this [[chthonic]] symbolism and the [[twilight language]] and iconography accrues a rich [[polysemy]]. When perceived differently, the charnel grounds are places of 'peace' (Sanskrit: ''shanti''), pleasant groves, populated by wildflowers and fruit. [[Songbird]]s, tame lions and tigers, and the vast open vault of the sky, fruit and flowers are often used in Vajrayana iconography and poetry and Beer (1999)&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Beer|Beer, Robert]] (1999). ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'', (Hardcover). Shambhala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-416-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57062-416-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains their symbolism and how they are understood in the tradition in fine detail. They are all included in depictions of the charnel ground.

==Beyond social convention==
In the charnel grounds of Vajrayana, there are no [[social convention]]s to conform to and no distractions to be seduced by for the [[siddha]].&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;  Dakas and [[dakini]]s gather there to celebrate ceremonial tsok 'feasts' (Sanskrit: [[ganachakra]]). The lion's roar of [[Dharma]] discourse resound as do the [[liturgy]] and the specific 'hourglass drums' (Sanskrit: [[damaru]]) of the [[chöd]]pa and the light of the inner 'joy of bliss' (Sanskrit: [[ananda]]) radiates and this dynamic movement is represented iconographically by the 'bliss-whirling' (Sanskrit: [[gankyil|ananda-chakra]]).

In his ''Manual'' on the practice of the ''[[Longchen Nyingtik]]'', [[Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche]] holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Right now, our minds are very fickle. Sometimes you like a certain place, and it inspires, and yet with that same place, if you stay too long, it bores you. […] As you practice more and more, one day this kind of habit, this fickle mind will just go. Then you will search for the bindu interpretation of the right place, and according to the classic tantric texts, that is usually what they call the “eight great charnel grounds”. So then, you have to go to a cemetery, especially to one of the eight cemeteries. There, under a tree, in the charnel ground, wearing a tiger skin skirt, holding a [[kapāla]] and having this indifference between relatives and enemies, indifference between food and shit, you will practise. Then your [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]] will flow. At that time, you will know how to have intercourse between emptiness and appearance."&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, from ''Longchen Nyingtik Practice Manual'' (page 66).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the life in which a [[pratyekabuddha]] attains the fruit of their 'path' (Wylie: lam), they are naturally drawn to charnel grounds. "When reflecting on the bones found there, the pratyekabuddha inquire "Where do these bones come from?"&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;  This [[samyama]] (Sanskrit) on the bones awakens knowledge of their many lifetimes of investigation into the [[Twelve Nidanas|'Twelve Links of Dependent Origination']]. These twelve links then unfold in their [[mindstream]] as a 'blessing' (Sanskrit: [[adhishthana]]), in both forward and reverse sequence and on that foundation they yield 'realisation' (Sanskrit: [[siddhi]]).&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;

==Vajrayana iconography==
The charnel ground, cremation ground and cemetery is evident as a specific region within wrathful Indo-Tibetan [[sand mandala]] iconography. As the anthropologist Gold (1994: p.&amp;nbsp;141) relates in his comparative study drawn from his professional fieldwork into the symbolic universals of the sacred circles and [[sand-painting]]s of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Tibetan people]]s, parses the sacred precinct and motif of the charnel ground as a locality in the symbolic grammar of the Indo-Tibetan 'fierce yidam' or '[[wrathful deities|wrathful deity]]' (Sanskrit: [[heruka]]) sand mandala:

{{Quote|The third concentric ring [from the circumference] is optional, in that it is only used in mandalas representing the reality of deities of fierce power. It represents the charnel grounds wherein bodies are cut up and offered to birds of prey as a "sky burial." This ring signifies the cutting away of the bones and flesh of illusion on the way to the primordial ground at the mandala's center. In some mandalas, it is positioned outside of the Mountain of Fire ring.|&lt;ref name="Gold, Peter 1994 p.141"/&gt;}}

The region of the charnel grounds in many wrathful mandala often hold eight specific charnel grounds where certain key events take place in the life of [[Padmasambhava]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown, Judith]] (2001). ''Dakini's warm breath: the feminine principle in Tibetan Buddhism''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-920-4}} (paperback), p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vajrayana [[wrathful deities|yidam]] [[Citipati (Buddhism)|Citipati]] is said to be the Lord of Charnel Grounds.&lt;ref name="androgynylist"&gt;http://www.androgynylist.com/categories/Essence%20of%20Indistinction/sub/citipati.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood is thematic in Charnel Ground iconography where it may be understood as [[Blood|lifeblood]], a symbol of viscous 'compassion' (Sanskrit: [[Karuṇā|karuna]]) of 'sacrifice' (Sanskrit:[[yajna]]), and attendant with the symbolism of blood, bones ground our shared humanity and solidarity in the wider [[Mandala]] of life and the ancient lineage of '[[ancestors]]' from which all sentient beings are of lineal descent.

The tradition and custom of the 'sky burial' (Tibetan: ''jhator'') afforded [[Traditional Tibetan medicine]] and ''[[thangka]]'' [[iconography]] such as the '[[Tree of physiology]]' with a particular insight into the interior workings of the human body. Pieces of the [[human skeleton]] were employed in ritual tools such as the [[Kapala|skullcup]], [[Kangling|thigh-bone trumpet]], etc.

The 'symbolic bone ornaments' (Skt: {{IAST|aṣṭhiamudrā}}; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya) are also known as "[[mudra]]" or 'seals' are also known as 'charnel ground ornaments'. The ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' identifies the Symbolic Bone Ornaments with the [[Five Wisdoms]] and [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] in his commentary to the ''Hevajra Tantra'' explains this further.&lt;ref name="Kongtrul_2005_493"&gt;{{harvnb|Kongtrul|2005|p=493}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The important Varnamala (or 'garland of [[Bīja|bija]] phonemes' in [[twilight language]] is iconographically represented by a 'garland of severed heads or skulls' (Sanskrit: [[Mundamala]]).

==Padmasambhava==
Beer (1999:  pp.&amp;nbsp;277–278) relates how [[Padmasambhava]] received the siddhi of the [[Kīla (Buddhism)|kīla]] [[esoteric transmission|transmission]] from a gigantic [[scorpion]] at the charnel ground of [[Rajgriha]]:

{{quote|The sting of the scorpion's whip-like tail transfixes and poisons its prey, and in this respect it is identified with the wrathful activity of the ritual dagger or kīla. Padmasambhava's biography relates how he received the siddhi of the kīla transmission at the great charnel ground of Rajgriha from a gigantic scorpion with nine heads, eighteen pincers and twenty-seven eyes. This scorpion reveals the kīla texts from a triangular stone box hidden beneath a rock in the cemetery. As Padmasambhava reads this terma text spontaneous understanding arises, and the heads, pincers, and eyes of the scorpion are 'revealed' as different vehicles or ''yanas'' of spiritual attainment. Here, at Rajgriha, Padmasambhava is given the title of 'the scorpion guru', and in one of his eight forms as Guru Dragpo or Pema Drago ('wrathful lotus'), he is depicted with a scorpion in his left hand. As an emblem of the wrathful kīla  transmission the image of the scorpion took on a strong symbolic meaning in the early development of the Nyingma or 'ancient school' of Tibetan Buddhism...".|&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Beer|Beer, Robert]] (1999).

==Background==
Blacks and whites lived in the area side by side with few problems after the [[American Civil War]].  It wasn't until 1900 that the beach became segregated, due in part to pressures by local businesses.  It remained a ''blacks only'' beach until the passing of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name="blackpast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/chicken-bone-beach-atlantic-city-new-jersey-1900| title=Chicken Bone Beach, Atlantic City, New Jersey (1900- )|website=BlackPast.org|last=Stephens|first=Ronald J.|accessdate=21 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were no signs nor laws prohibiting blacks from enjoying the entirety of the beach, the segregation was rigidly enforced by local authorities or more commonly, white beachgoers.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The Atlantic City Beach Patrol was officially desegregated, but its black members were in practice consigned to Chicken Bone Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=John T.|last2=Cole|first2=Kenneth D.|title=Atlantic City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NQm2sacUfwC&amp;pg=PA50|year=2000|publisher=Arcadia|isbn=9780738504261|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50028">Many [[programming language]] [[type system]]s support [[subtyping]]. '''Variance''' refers to how subtyping between more complex types relates to subtyping between their components. For instance, if the type {{C sharp|Cat}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|Animal}}, then an expression of type {{C sharp|Cat}} can be used wherever an expression of type {{C sharp|Animal}} is used.  How should a list of {{C sharp|Cat}}s relate to a list of {{C sharp|Animal}}s? Or how should a function returning {{C sharp|Cat}} relate to a function returning {{C sharp|Animal}}? Depending on the variance of the [[type constructor]], the subtyping relation of the simple types may be either preserved, reversed, or ignored for the respective complex types. In the [[OCaml]] programming language, for example, "list of Cat" is a subtype of "list of Animal" because the list constructor is '''covariant'''. This means that the subtyping relation of the simple types are preserved for the complex types, while "function from Animal to String" is a subtype of "function from Cat to String" because the function type constructor is '''contravariant''' in the argument type. Here the subtyping relation of the simple types is reversed for the complex types.

A programming language designer will consider variance when devising typing rules for language features such as arrays, inheritance, and generic datatypes. By making type constructors covariant or contravariant instead of invariant, more programs will be accepted as well-typed. On the other hand, programmers often find contravariance unintuitive, and accurately tracking variance to avoid runtime type errors can lead to complex typing rules. In order to keep the type system simple and allow useful programs, a language may treat a type constructor as invariant even if it would be safe to consider it variant, or treat it as covariant even though that could violate type safety.

==Formal definition==

Within the [[type system]] of a [[programming language]], a typing rule or a type constructor is:

* ''covariant'' if it preserves the [[subtype|ordering of types (≤)]], which orders types from more specific to more generic; 
* ''contravariant'' if it reverses this ordering;
* ''bivariant'' if both of these apply (i.e., both {{C sharp|I&lt;A&gt;}} ≤ {{C sharp|I&lt;B&gt;}} and {{C sharp|I&lt;B&gt;}} ≤ {{C sharp|I&lt;A&gt;}} at the same time)&lt;ref&gt;This only happens in a pathological case. For example, &lt;code&gt;type 'a t = int&lt;/code&gt;: any type can be put in for &lt;code&gt;'a&lt;/code&gt; and the result is still &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;;
* ''invariant'' or ''nonvariant'' if neither of these applies.

The article considers how this applies to some common type constructors.

=== C# examples ===

For example, in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], if  {{C sharp|Cat}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|Animal}}, then:
* {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;Cat&gt;}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;Animal&gt;}}. The subtyping is preserved because {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;}} is '''covariant''' on {{C sharp|T}}.
* {{C sharp|Action&lt;Animal&gt;}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|Action&lt;Cat&gt;}}. The subtyping is reversed because {{C sharp|Action&lt;T&gt;}} is '''contravariant''' on {{C sharp|T}}.
* Neither {{C sharp|IList&lt;Cat&gt;}} nor {{C sharp|IList&lt;Animal&gt;}} is a subtype of the other, because {{C sharp|IList&lt;T&gt;}} is '''invariant''' on {{C sharp|T}}.
The variance of a C# generic interface is declared by placing the {{C sharp|out}} (covariant) or {{C sharp|in}} (contravariant) attribute on (zero or more of) its type parameters. For each so-marked type parameter, the compiler conclusively verifies, with any violation being fatal, that such use is globally consistent. The above interfaces are declared as {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;out T&gt;}}, {{C sharp|Action&lt;in T&gt;}}, and {{C sharp|IList&lt;T&gt;}}. Types with more than one type parameter may specify different variances on each type parameter. For example, the delegate type {{C sharp|Func&lt;in T, out TResult&gt;}} represents a function with a '''contravariant''' input parameter of type {{C sharp|T}} and a '''covariant''' return value of type {{C sharp|TResult}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb549151.aspx Func&lt;T, TResult&gt; Delegate] - MSDN Documentation&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[#Interfaces|typing rules for interface variance]] ensure type safety. For example, an {{C sharp|Action&lt;T&gt;}} represents a first-class function expecting an argument of type {{C sharp|T}}, and a function that can handle any type of animal can always be used instead of one that can only handle cats.

==Arrays==

Read-only data types (sources) can be covariant; write-only data types (sinks) can be contravariant. Mutable data types which act as both sources and sinks should be invariant. To illustrate this general phenomenon, consider the [[array data type|array type]].  For the type {{java|Animal}} we can make the type {{java|Animal[]}}, which is an "array of animals".  For the purposes of this example, this array supports both reading and writing elements.

We have the option to treat this as either:
* Covariant: a {{java|Cat[]}} is an {{java|Animal[]}}
* Contravariant: an {{java|Animal[]}} is a {{java|Cat[]}}
* Invariant: an {{java|Animal[]}} is not a {{java|Cat[]}} and a {{java|Cat[]}} is not an {{java|Animal[]}}

If we wish to avoid type errors, then only the third choice is safe. Clearly, not every {{java|Animal[]}} can be treated as if it were a {{java|Cat[]}}, since a client reading from the array will expect a {{java|Cat}}, but an {{java|Animal[]}} may contain e.g. a {{java|Dog}}. So the contravariant rule is not safe.

Conversely, a {{java|Cat[]}} cannot be treated as an {{java|Animal[]}}. It should always be possible to put a {{java|Dog}} into an {{java|Animal[]}}. With covariant arrays this cannot be guaranteed to be safe, since the backing store might actually be an array of cats. So the covariant rule is also not safe&amp;mdash;the array constructor should be ''invariant''. Note that this is only an issue for mutable arrays; the covariant rule is safe for immutable (read-only) arrays.

===Covariant arrays in Java and C#===
Early versions of Java and C# did not include generics, also termed [[parametric polymorphism]]. In such a setting, making arrays invariant rules out useful polymorphic programs.

For example, consider writing a function to shuffle an array, or a function that tests two arrays for equality using the {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Object}}.{{java|equals}} method on the elements. The implementation does not depend on the exact type of element stored in the array, so it should be possible to write a single function that works on all types of arrays. It is easy to implement functions of type:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    boolean equalArrays(Object[] a1, Object[] a2);
    void shuffleArray(Object[] a);
&lt;/source&gt;
However, if array types were treated as invariant, it would only be possible to call these functions on an array of exactly the type {{java|Object[]}}. One could not, for example, shuffle an array of strings.

Therefore, both Java and C# treat array types covariantly.
For instance, in Java {{java|String[]}} is a subtype of {{java|Object[]}}, and in C# {{C sharp|string[]}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|object[]}}.

As discussed above, covariant arrays lead to problems with writes into the array. Java and C# deal with this by marking each array object with a type when it is created. Each time a value is stored into an array, the execution environment will check that the run-time type of the value is equal to the run-time type of the array. If there is a mismatch, an {{java|ArrayStoreException}} (Java) or {{C sharp|ArrayTypeMismatchException}} (C#) is thrown:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    // a is a single-element array of String
    String[] a = new String[1];

    // b is an array of Object
    Object[] b = a;

    // Assign an Integer to b. This would be possible if b really were
    // an array of Object, but since it really is an array of String,
    // we will get a java.lang.ArrayStoreException.
    b[0] = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above example, one can ''read'' from the array (b) safely. It is only trying to ''write'' to the array that can lead to trouble.

One drawback to this approach is that it leaves the possibility of a run-time error that a stricter type system could have caught at compile-time. Also, it hurts performance because each write into an array requires an additional run-time check.

With the addition of generics, Java and C# now offer ways to write this kind of polymorphic function without relying on covariance. The array comparison and shuffling functions can be given the parameterized types
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    &lt;T&gt; boolean equalArrays(T[] a1, T[] a2);
    &lt;T&gt; void shuffleArray(T[] a);
&lt;/source&gt;
Alternatively, to enforce that a C# method accesses a collection in a read-only way, one can use the interface  {{C sharp|IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;}} instead of passing it an array {{C sharp|object[]}}.

==Function types==
Languages with [[first-class function]]s have [[function type]]s like "a function expecting a Cat and returning an Animal" (written {{OCaml|Cat -&gt; Animal}} in [[OCaml]] syntax or {{C sharp|Func&lt;Cat,Animal&gt;}} in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] syntax).

Those languages also need to specify when one function type is a subtype of another&amp;mdash;that is, when it is safe to use a function of one type in a context that expects a function of a different type. 
It is safe to substitute a function ''f'' for a function ''g'' if ''f'' accepts a more general type of arguments and returns a more specific type than ''g''.
For example, both functions of type {{OCaml|Cat -&gt; Cat}} and {{OCaml|Animal -&gt; Animal}} can be used wherever a {{OCaml|Cat -&gt; Animal}} was expected. (One can compare this to the [[robustness principle]] of communication: "be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you produce.") The general rule is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S_1 \rightarrow S_2 \leq T_1 \rightarrow T_2&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;T_1 \leq S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2 \leq T_2&lt;/math&gt;. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Using [[Rule of inference|inference rule notation]] the same rule can be written as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T_1 \leq S_1 \quad S_2 \leq T_2 
\over
S_1 \rightarrow S_2 \leq T_1 \rightarrow T_2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the → type constructor is ''contravariant in the input type'' and ''covariant in the output type''. This rule was first stated formally by [[John C. Reynolds]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference|author=John C. Reynolds |title=The Essence of Algol
 |conference=Symposium on Algorithmic Languages |year=1981 |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Reynolds81.ps |publisher=North-Holland }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further popularized in a paper by [[Luca Cardelli]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference|author=Luca Cardelli |title=A semantics of multiple inheritance |conference=Semantics of Data Types (International Symposium Sophia-Antipolis, France, June 27 – 29, 1984) |year=1984 |url=http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/Inheritance%20(Semantics%20of%20Data%20Types).pdf |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=173 |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/3-540-13346-1_2}}(Longer version in Information and Computation, 76(2/3): 138-164, February 1988.)&lt;/ref&gt;

When dealing with [[higher-order function|functions that take functions as arguments]], this rule can be applied several times. For example, by applying the rule twice, we see that (A'→B)→B ≤ (A→B)→B if A'≤A. In other words, the type (A→B)→B is ''covariant'' in the A position. For complicated types it can be confusing to mentally trace why a given type specialization is or isn't type-safe, but it is easy to calculate which positions are co- and contravariant: a position is covariant if it is on the left side of an even number of arrows applying to it.

== Inheritance in object-oriented languages ==

When a subclass [[Method overriding|overrides]] a method in a superclass, the compiler must check that the overriding method has the right type. While some languages require that the type exactly matches the type in the superclass (invariance), it is also type safe to allow the overriding method to have a "better" type. By the usual subtyping rule for function types, this means that the overriding method should return a more specific type (return type covariance), and accept a more general argument (argument type contravariance). In [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] notation, the possibilities are as follows:

&lt;gallery perrow="5" heights="190" caption="Variance and method overriding: overview"&gt;
Image:Vererbung T.svg|Subtyping of the argument/return type of the method.
Image:Inheritance_invariant.svg|''Invariance''. The signature of the overriding method is unchanged.
Image:Inheritance_covariant_return.svg|''Covariant return type''. The subtyping relation is in the same direction as the relation between ClassA and ClassB.
Image:Inheritance_contravariant_argument.svg|''Contravariant argument type''. The subtyping relation is in the opposite direction to the relation between ClassA and ClassB.
Image:Inheritance_covariant_argument.svg|''Covariant argument type''. Not type safe.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

For a concrete example, suppose we are writing a class to model an [[animal shelter]]. We assume that {{java|Cat}} is a subclass of {{java|Animal}}, and that we have a base class (using Java syntax)

[[File:AnimalShelter.svg|frameless|right|upright|alt=UML diagram]]
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class AnimalShelter {
        Animal getAnimalForAdoption() {
          ...
        }
    
        void putAnimal(Animal animal) {
          ...
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now the question is: if we subclass {{java|AnimalShelter}}, what types are we allowed to give to {{java|getAnimalForAdoption}} and {{java|putAnimal}}?

{{clear}}

===Covariant method return type===

In a language which allows [[covariant return type]]s, a derived class can override the {{java|getAnimalForAdoption}} method to return a more specific type:

[[File:Inheritance covariant return animalshelter.svg|thumb|right|upright|alt=UML diagram]]
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {
        Cat getAnimalForAdoption() {
    	    return new Cat();
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Among mainstream OO languages, [[Java (Programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]] support covariant return types, while [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] does not. Adding the covariant return type was one of the first modifications of the C++ language approved by the standards committee in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Allison |first=Chuck |url=http://www.drdobbs.com/184403580 |title=What's New in Standard C++?}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[D (programming language)|D]]  also support covariant return types.

{{clear}}

===Contravariant method argument type===

Similarly, it is type safe to allow an overriding method to accept a more general argument than the method in the base class:

[[File:Inheritance contravariant argument animalshelter.svg|thumb|right|upright|alt=UML diagram]]
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {
        void putAnimal(Object animal) {
           ...
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Not many object-oriented languages actually allow this. C++ and Java would interpret this as an unrelated method with an [[Function overloading|overloaded]] name.

However, [[Sather]] supported both covariance and contravariance. Calling convention for overridden methods are covariant with ''out'' arguments and return values, and contravariant with normal arguments (with the mode ''in'').

{{clear}}

===Covariant method argument type===

Uniquely among mainstream languages, [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] allows the arguments of an overriding method to have a ''more'' specific type than the method in the superclass (argument type covariance). Thus, the Eiffel version of the following code would type check, with {{java|putAnimal}} overriding the method in the base class:

[[File:Inheritance covariant argument animalshelter.svg|thumb|right|upright|alt=UML diagram]]
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {
        void putAnimal(Cat animal) {
           ...
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

This is not type safe. By up-casting a {{java|CatShelter}} to an {{java|AnimalShelter}}, one can try to place a dog in a cat shelter. That does not meet {{java|CatShelter}} argument restrictions, and will result in a runtime error. The lack of type safety (known as the "catcall problem" in the Eiffel community, where "cat" or "CAT" is a Changed Availability or Type) has been a long-standing issue. Over the years, various combinations of global static analysis, local static analysis, and new language features  have been proposed to remedy it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Static Typing |author=Bertrand Meyer |booktitle=OOPSLA 95 (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications), Atlanta, 1995. |date=October 1995 |url=http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/acm/typing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="competentCompilers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Type-safe covariance: Competent compilers can catch all catcalls |first1=Mark |last1=Howard |first2=Eric |last2=Bezault |first3=Bertrand |last3=Meyer |first4=Dominique |last4=Colnet |first5=Emmanuel |last5=Stapf |first6=Karine |last6=Arnout |first7=Markus |last7=Keller |date=April 2003 |accessdate=23 May 2013 |url=http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/ongoing/covariance/recast.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these have been implemented in some Eiffel compilers.

Despite the type safety problem, the Eiffel designers consider covariant argument types crucial for modeling real world requirements.&lt;ref name="competentCompilers"/&gt; The cat shelter illustrates a common phenomenon: it is ''a kind of'' animal shelter but has ''additional restrictions'', and it seems reasonable to use inheritance and restricted argument types to model this. In proposing this use of inheritance, the Eiffel designers reject the [[Liskov substitution principle]], which states that objects of subclasses should always be less restricted than objects of their superclass.

One other instance of a mainstream language allowing covariance in method arguments is PHP in regards to class constructors.  In the following example, the __construct() method is accepted, despite the method argument being covariant to the parent's method argument.  Were this method anything other than __construct(), an error would occur:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
	interface AnimalInterface {}
	interface DogInterface extends AnimalInterface {}

	class Dog implements DogInterface {}

	class Pet {
		public function __construct(AnimalInterface $animal) {}
	}

	class PetDog extends Pet {
		public function __construct(DogInterface $dog) { parent::__construct($dog); }
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

Another example where covariant arguments seem helpful is so-called binary methods, i.e. methods where the argument is expected to be of the same type as the object the method is called on. An example is the {{java|compareTo}} method: {{java|a.compareTo(b)}} checks whether {{java|a}} comes before or after {{java|b}} in some ordering, but the way to compare, say, two rational numbers will be different from the way to compare two strings. Other common examples of binary methods include equality tests, arithmetic operations, and set operations like subset and union.

In older versions of Java, the comparison method was specified as an interface {{java|Comparable}}:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    interface Comparable {
        int compareTo(Object o);
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

The drawback of this is that the method is specified to take an argument of type {{java|Object}}. A typical implementation would first down-cast this argument (throwing an error if it is not of the expected type):

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class RationalNumber implements Comparable {
        int numerator;
        int denominator;
    
        ...
        
        public int compareTo(Object other) {
            RationalNumber otherNum = (RationalNumber)other;
            return Integer.compare(numerator*otherNum.denominator,
                                   otherNum.numerator*denominator);
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

In a language with covariant arguments, the argument to {{java|compareTo}} could be directly given the desired type {{java|RationalNumber}}, hiding the typecast. (Of course, this would still give a runtime error if {{java|compareTo}} was then called on e.g. a {{java|String}}).

=== Avoiding the need for covariant argument types ===

Other language features can provide the apparent benefits of covariant arguments while preserving Liskov substitutability.

In a language with ''generics'' (a.k.a. [[parametric polymorphism]]) and [[bounded quantification]], the previous examples can be written in a type-safe way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Getting Class Correctness and System Correctness Equivalent - How to Get Covariance Right |author=Franz Weber |year=1992 |booktitle=TOOLS 8 (8th conference on Technology of Object-Oriented Languages and Systems), Dortmund, 1992 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.52.7872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of defining {{java|AnimalShelter}}, we define a parameterized class {{java|Shelter&lt;T&gt;}}. (One drawback of this is that the implementer of the base class needs to foresee which types will need to be specialized in the subclasses).

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class Shelter&lt;T extends Animal&gt; {
        T getAnimalForAdoption() {
          ...
        }
    
        void putAnimal(T animal) {
          ...
        }
    }
    
    
    class CatShelter extends Shelter&lt;Cat&gt; {
        Cat getAnimalForAdoption() {
          ...
        }
    
        void putAnimal(Cat animal) {
          ...
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Similarly, in recent versions of Java the {{java|Comparable}} interface has been parameterized, which allows the downcast to be omitted in a type-safe way:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    class RationalNumber implements Comparable&lt;RationalNumber&gt; {
        int numerator;
        int denominator;
      
        ...
         
        public int compareTo(RationalNumber otherNum) {
            return Integer.compare(numerator*otherNum.denominator, 
                                   otherNum.numerator*denominator);
        }
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Another language feature that can help is ''multiple dispatch''. 
One reason that binary methods are awkward to write is that in a call like {{java|a.compareTo(b)}}, selecting the correct implementation of {{java|compareTo}} really depends on the runtime type of both {{java|a}} and {{java|b}}, but in a conventional OO language only the runtime type of {{java|a}} is taken into account. In a language with [[Common Lisp Object System]] (CLOS)-style [[multiple dispatch]], the comparison method could be written as a generic function where both arguments are used for method selection.

Giuseppe Castagna&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Castagna, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=203096&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=&amp;CFID=15151515&amp;CFTOKEN=6184618 Covariance and contravariance: conflict without a cause], ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Volume 17, Issue 3, May 1995, pages 431-447.&lt;/ref&gt; observed that in a typed language with multiple dispatch, a generic function can have some arguments which control dispatch and some "left-over" arguments which do not. Because the method selection rule chooses the most specific applicable method, if a method overrides another method, then the overriding method will have more specific types for the controlling arguments. On the other hand, to ensure type safety the language still must require the left-over arguments to be at least as general. 
Using the previous terminology, types used for runtime method selection are covariant while types not used for runtime method selection of the method are contravariant. Conventional single-dispatch languages like Java also obey this rule: there only one argument is used for method selection (the receiver object, passed along to a method as the hidden argument {{java|this}}), and indeed the type of {{java|this}} is more specialized inside overriding methods than in the superclass.

Castagna suggests that examples where covariant argument types are superior, particularly binary methods, should be handled using multiple dispatch which is naturally covariant.
However, most programming languages do not support multiple dispatch.

== Generic types ==

In programming languages that support generics (a.k.a. [[parametric polymorphism]]), the programmer can extend the type system with new constructors. For example, a C# interface like {{C sharp|IList&lt;T&gt;}} makes it possible to construct new types like {{C sharp|IList&lt;Animal&gt;}} or {{C sharp|IList&lt;Cat&gt;}}. The question then arises what the variance of these type constructors should be.

There are two main approaches. In languages with ''declaration-site variance annotations'' (e.g., [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]), the programmer annotates the definition of a generic type with the intended variance of its type parameters. With ''use-site variance annotations'' (e.g., [[Java (programming language)|Java]]), the programmer instead annotates the places where a generic type is instantiated.

=== Declaration-site variance annotations ===

The most popular languages with declaration-site variance annotations are [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (using the keywords {{C sharp|out}} and {{C sharp|in}}),
and  [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[OCaml]] (using the keywords {{OCaml|+}} and {{OCaml|-}}).
C# only allows variance annotations for interface types, while Scala and OCaml allow them for both interface types and concrete data types.

==== Interfaces ====

In C#, each type parameter of a generic interface can be marked covariant ({{C sharp|out}}), contravariant ({{C sharp|in}}), or invariant (no annotation). For example, we can define an interface {{C sharp|IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;}} of read-only iterators, and declare it to be covariant (out) in its type parameter.
&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
    interface IEnumerator&lt;out T&gt;
    {
        T Current { get; }
        bool MoveNext();
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
With this declaration, {{C sharp|IEnumerator}} will be treated as covariant in its type argument, e.g. {{C sharp|IEnumerator&lt;Cat&gt;}} is a subtype of {{C sharp|IEnumerator&lt;Animal&gt;}}.

The typechecker enforces that each method declaration in an interface only mentions the type parameters in a way consistent with the {{C sharp|in}}/{{C sharp|out}} annotations. That is, a parameter that was declared covariant must not occur in any contravariant positions (where a position is contravariant if it occurs under an odd number of contravariant type constructors). The precise rule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Lippert|title=Exact rules for variance validity |date=3 December 2009 |accessdate=16 August 2016 |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/12/03/exact-rules-for-variance-validity.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Section II.9.7 in &lt;cite&gt;ECMA International Standard ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) 6th edition (June 2012)&lt;/cite&gt;; [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm available online]&lt;/ref&gt; is that the return types of all methods in the interface must be ''valid covariantly'' and all the method argument types must be ''valid contravariantly'', where ''valid S-ly'' is defined as follows:
* Non-generic types (classes, structs, enums, etc.) are valid both co- and contravariantly.
* A type argument {{C sharp|T}} is valid covariantly if it was not marked {{C sharp|in}}, and valid contravariantly if it was not marked {{C sharp|out}}
* An array type {{C sharp|A[]}} is valid S-ly if {{C sharp|A}} is. (This is because C# has covariant arrays).
* A generic type {{C sharp|G&lt;A1,A2,...,An&gt;}} is valid S-ly if for each argument {{C sharp|Ai}}, 
** Ai is valid S-ly, and the ''i''th parameter to {{C sharp|G}} is declared covariant, or
** Ai is valid (not S)-ly, and the ''i''th parameter to {{C sharp|G}} is declared contravariant, or
** Ai is valid both covariantly and contravariantly, and the ''i''th parameter to {{C sharp|G}} is declared invariant.

As an example of how these rules apply, consider the {{C sharp|IList&lt;T&gt;}} interface. 
&lt;source lang="csharp"&gt;
    interface IList&lt;T&gt;
    {
        void Insert(int index, T item);
        IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator();
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The argument type {{C sharp|T}} of {{C sharp|Insert}} must be valid contravariantly, i.e. the type parameter {{C sharp|T}} must not be tagged {{C sharp|out}}. Similarly, the result type {{C sharp|IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;}} of {{C sharp|GetEnumerator}} must be valid covariantly, i.e. (since {{C sharp|IEnumerator}} is a covariant interface) the type {{C sharp|T}} must be valid covariantly, i.e. the type parameter {{C sharp|T}} must not be tagged {{C sharp|in}}. This shows that the interface {{C sharp|IList}} is not allowed to be marked either co- or contravariant.

In the common case of a generic data structure such as {{C sharp|IList}}, these restrictions mean that an {{C sharp|out}} parameter can only be used for methods getting data out of the structure, and an {{C sharp|in}} parameter can only be used for methods putting data into the structure, hence the choice of keywords.

==== Data ====

C# allows variance annotations on the parameters of interfaces, but not the parameters of classes. Because fields in C# classes are always mutable, variantly parameterized classes in C# would not be very useful. But languages which emphasize immutable data can make good use of covariant data types. For example, both in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] and [[OCaml]] the immutable list type is covariant: &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[Cat]&lt;/source&gt; is a subtype of &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[Animal]&lt;/source&gt;.

Scala's rules for checking variance annotations are essentially the same as C#'s. However, there are some idioms that apply to immutable datastructures in particular. They are illustrated by the following (excerpt from the) definition of the &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[A]&lt;/source&gt; class.

&lt;source lang="scala"&gt;
sealed abstract class List[+A] extends AbstractSeq[A] {
  def head: A
  def tail: List[A]

  /** Adds an element at the beginning of this list. */
  def ::[B &gt;: A] (x: B): List[B] =
    new scala.collection.immutable.::(x, this)

  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

First, class members that have a variant type must be immutable. Here, &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;head&lt;/source&gt; has the type &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;A&lt;/source&gt;, which was declared covariant (&lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;+&lt;/source&gt;), and indeed &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;head&lt;/source&gt; was declared as a method (&lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;def&lt;/source&gt;). Trying to declare it as a mutable field (&lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;var&lt;/source&gt;) would be rejected as type error.

Second, even if a data structure is immutable, it will often have methods where the parameter type occurs contravariantly. For example, consider the method &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;::&lt;/source&gt; which adds an element to the front of a list. (The implementation works by creating a new object of the similarly-named ''class'' &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;::&lt;/source&gt;, the class of nonempty lists). The most obvious type to give it would be 
&lt;source lang=scala&gt;
  def :: (x: A): List[A]
&lt;/source&gt;
However, this would be a type error, because the covariant parameter &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;A&lt;/source&gt; appears in a contravariant position (as a function argument). But there is a trick to get around this problem. We give &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;::&lt;/source&gt; a more general type, which allows adding an element of any type &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;B&lt;/source&gt; 
as long as &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;B&lt;/source&gt; is a supertype of &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;A&lt;/source&gt;. Note that this relies on &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List&lt;/source&gt; being covariant, since 
&lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;this&lt;/source&gt;  has type &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[A]&lt;/source&gt; and we treat it as having type &lt;source lang=scala enclose=none&gt;List[B]&lt;/source&gt;.  At first glance it may not be obvious that the generalized type is sound, but if the programmer starts out with the simpler type declaration, the type errors will point out the place that  needs to be generalized.

==== Inferring variance ====

It is possible to design a type system where the compiler automatically infers the best possible variance annotations for all datatype parameters.&lt;ref name="tamingCombining"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=John Altidor |author2=Huang Shan Shan |author3=Yannis Smaragdakis |title=Taming the wildcards: combining definition- and use-site variance |booktitle=Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGPLAN conference on Programming language design and implementation (PLDI'11) |year=2011 |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~jaltidor/variance_pldi11.pdf }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the analysis can get complex for several reasons. First, the analysis is nonlocal since the variance of an interface {{java|I}} depends on the variance of all interfaces that {{java|I}} mentions.  Second, in order to get unique best solutions the type system must allow ''bivariant'' parameters (which are simultaneously co- and contravariant). And finally, the variance of type parameters should arguably be a deliberate choice by the designer of an interface, not something that just happens.

For these reasons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Covariance and Contravariance in C# Part Seven: Why Do We Need A Syntax At All? |author1= Eric Lippert |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2016
|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2007/10/29/covariance-and-contravariance-in-c-part-seven-why-do-we-need-a-syntax-at-all.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; most languages do very little variance inference. C# and Scala do not infer any variance annotations at all. OCaml can infer the variance of parameterized concrete datatypes, but the programmer must explicitly specify the variance of abstract types (interfaces).

For example, consider an OCaml datatype {{OCaml|T}} which wraps a function
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
type ('a, 'b) t = T of ('a -&gt; 'b) 
&lt;/source&gt;
The compiler will automatically infer that {{OCaml|T}} is contravariant in the first parameter, and covariant in the second. The programmer can also provide explicit annotations, which the compiler will check are satisfied. Thus the following declaration is equivalent to the previous one:
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
type (-'a, +'b) t = T of ('a -&gt; 'b) 
&lt;/source&gt;

Explicit annotations in OCaml become useful when specifying interfaces. For example, the standard library interface {{OCaml|Map.S}} for association tables include an annotation saying that the map type constructor is covariant in the result type.
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
module type S =
  sig
    type key
    type (+'a) t
    val empty: 'a t
    val mem: key -&gt; 'a t -&gt; bool
    ...
  end
&lt;/source&gt;
This ensures that e.g. {{OCaml|cat IntMap.t}} is a subtype of {{OCaml|animal IntMap.t}}.

=== Use-site variance annotations (wildcards) ===

One drawback of the declaration-site approach is that many interface types must be made invariant. For example, we saw above that {{C sharp|IList}} needed to be invariant, because it contained both {{C sharp|Insert}} and {{C sharp|GetEnumerator}}. In order to expose more variance, the API designer could provide additional interfaces which provide subsets of the available methods (e.g. an "insert-only list" which only provides {{C sharp|Insert}}). However this quickly becomes unwieldy.

Use-site variance annotations aim to give users of a class more opportunities for subtyping without requiring the designer of the class to define multiple interfaces with different variance. Instead, each time a class or interface is used in a type declaration, the programmer can indicate that only a subset of the methods will be used. In effect, each definition of a class also makes available interfaces for the covariant and contravariant ''parts'' of that class. Therefore, the designer of the class no longer needs to take variance into account, increasing re-usability.

Java provides use-site variance annotations through [[Wildcard (Java)|wildcards]], a restricted form of [[bounded quantification|bounded]] [[existential type]]s. A parameterized type can be instantiated by a wildcard {{java|?}} together with an upper or lower bound, e.g. {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}} or {{java|List&lt;? super Animal&gt;}}. (A an unbounded wildcard like {{java|List&lt;?&gt;}} is equivalent to {{java|List&lt;? extends Object&gt;}}). Such a type  represents {{java|List&lt;X&gt;}} for some unknown type {{java|X}} which satisfies the bound. For example, if {{java|l}} has type {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}}, then the typechecker will accept
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    Animal a = l.get(3);
&lt;/source&gt;
because the type {{java|X}} is known to be a subtype of {{java|Animal}}, but
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    l.add(new Animal())
&lt;/source&gt;
will be rejected as a type error since an {{java|Animal}} is not necessarily an {{java|X}}. In general, given some interface {{java|I&lt;T&gt;}}, a reference to a {{java|I&lt;? extends A&gt;}} forbids using  methods from the interface where {{java|T}} occurs contravariantly in the type of the method. Conversely, if {{java|l}} had type {{java|List&lt;? super Animal&gt;}} one could call {{java|l.add}} but not {{java|l.get}}.

[[File:Java wildcard subtyping.svg|thumb|right|350px|Wildcard subtyping in Java can be visualized as a cube.]]

While plain generic types in Java are invariant (e.g. there is no subtyping relationship between {{java|List&lt;Cat&gt;}} and {{java|List&lt;Animal&gt;}}), wildcard types can be made more specific by specifying a tighter bound, for example {{java|List&lt;? extends Cat&gt;}} is a subtype of {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}}. This shows that wildcard types are ''covariant in their upper bounds'' (and also ''contravariant in their lower bounds''). In total, given a wildcard type like {{java|C&lt;? extends T&gt;}}, there are three ways to form a subtype: by specializing the class {{java|C}}, by specifying a tighter bound {{java|T}}, or by replacing the wildcard {{java|?}} by a specific type (see figure).

By combining two steps of subtyping, it is therefore possible to e.g. pass an argument of type {{java|List&lt;Cat&gt;}} to a method expecting a {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}}. This is exactly the kind of programs that covariant interface types allow. The type {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}} acts as an interface type containing only the covariant methods of {{java|List&lt;T&gt;}}, but the implementer of {{java|List&lt;T&gt;}} did not have to define it ahead of time. This is use-site variance.

In the common case of a generic data structure {{C sharp|IList}}, covariant parameters are used for methods getting data out of the structure, and contravariant parameters for methods putting data into the structure. The mnemonic for Producer Extends, Consumer Super (PECS), from the book ''Effective Java'' by [[Joshua Bloch]] gives an easy way to remember when to use covariance and contravariance.

Wildcards are flexible, but there is a drawback. While use-site variance means that API designers need not consider variance of type parameters to interfaces, they must often instead use more complicated method signatures. A common example involves the {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Comparable}} interface. Suppose we want to write a function that finds the biggest element in a collection. The elements need to implement the {{java|compareTo}} method, so a first try might be
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt;  T max(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll);
&lt;/source&gt;
However, this type is not general enough&amp;mdash;one can find the max of a {{java|Collection&lt;Calendar&gt;}}, but not a {{java|Collection&lt;GregorianCalendar&gt;}}. The problem is that {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|GregorianCalendar}} does not implement {{java|Comparable&lt;GregorianCalendar&gt;}}, but instead the (better) interface {{java|Comparable&lt;Calendar&gt;}}. In Java, unlike in C#, {{java|Comparable&lt;Calendar&gt;}} is not considered a subtype of {{java|Comparable&lt;GregorianCalendar&gt;}}. Instead the type of {{java|max}} has to be modified:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
    &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt; T max(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll);
&lt;/source&gt;
The bounded wildcard {{java|? super T}} conveys the information that {{java|max}} calls only contravariant methods from the {{java|Comparable}} interface. This particular example is frustrating because ''all'' the methods in {{java|Comparable}} are contravariant, so that condition is trivially true. A declaration-site system could handle this example with less clutter by annotating only the definition of {{java|Comparable}}.

=== Comparing declaration-site and use-site annotations ===

Use-site variance annotations provide additional flexibility, allowing more programs to type-check. However, they have been criticized for the complexity they add to the language, leading to complicated type signatures and error messages.

One way to assess whether the extra flexibility is useful is to see if it is used in existing programs. A survey of a large set of Java libraries&lt;ref name="tamingCombining" /&gt; found that 39% of wildcard annotations could have been directly replaced by a declaration-site annotations. Thus the remaining 61% is an indication on places where Java benefits from having the use-site system available.

In a declaration-site language, libraries must either expose less variance, or define more interfaces. For example, the Scala Collections library defines three separate interfaces for classes which employ covariance: a covariant base interface containing common methods, an invariant mutable version which adds side-effecting methods, and a covariant immutable version which may specialize the inherited implementations to exploit structural sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Scala 2.8 Collections API |author1=Marin Odersky |author2=Lex Spoon |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=16 August 2016 |url=http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/collections.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design works well with declaration-site annotations, but the large number of interfaces carry a complexity cost for clients of the library. And modifying the library interface may not be an option&amp;mdash;in particular, one goal when adding generics to Java was to maintain binary backwards compatibility.

On the other hand, Java wildcards are themselves complex. In a conference presentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joshua Bloch |title=The Closures Controversy [video] |date=November 2007 |place=Presentation at Javapolis'07 |url=http://parleys.com/play/514892250364bc17fc56bb15/chapter0/about |accessdate=May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202190630/http://parleys.com/play/514892250364bc17fc56bb15/chapter0/about |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joshua Bloch]] criticized them as being too hard to understand and use, stating that when adding support for [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] "we simply cannot afford another ''wildcards''". Early versions of Scala used use-site variance annotations but programmers found them difficult to use in practice, while declaration-site annotations were found to be very helpful when designing classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Martin Odersky |author2=Matthias Zenger |title=Scalable component abstractions |booktitle=Proceedings of the 20th annual ACM SIGPLAN conference on Object-oriented programming, systems, languages, and applications (OOPSLA '05) |year=2005 |url=http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/papers/ScalableComponent.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of Scala added Java-style existential types and wildcards; however, according to [[Martin Odersky]], if there were no need for interoperability with Java then these would probably not have been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Purpose of Scala's Type System: A Conversation with Martin Odersky, Part III |author=Bill Venners and Frank Sommers |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=16 August 2016 |url=http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/scalas_type_system.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross Tate argues&lt;ref name="MixedSiteVariance"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Ross Tate |title=Mixed-Site Variance |booktitle=FOOL '13: Informal Proceedings of the 20th International Workshop on Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages |year=2013 |url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ross/publications/mixedsite/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; that part of the complexity of Java wildcards is due to the decision to encode use-site variance using a form of existential types. The original proposals&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference |author1=Atsushi Igarashi |author2=Mirko Viroli |title=On Variance-Based Subtyping for Parametric Types |booktitle=Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP '02) |year=2002 |url=http://www.sato.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/papers/pdf/variance.ecoop02.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622001350/http://www.sato.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~igarashi/papers/pdf/variance.ecoop02.pdf |archivedate=2006-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Kresten Krab Thorup |author2=Mads Torgersen |title=Unifying Genericity: Combining the Benefits of Virtual Types and Parameterized Classes |booktitle=Object-Oriented Programming (ECOOP '99) |year=1999 |url=http://www.daimi.au.dk/~madst/tool/papers/unifying.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; used special-purpose syntax for variance annotations, writing {{java|List&lt;+Animal&gt;}} instead of Java's more verbose {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}}.

Since wildcards are a form of existential types they can be used for more things than just variance. A type like {{java|List&lt;?&gt;}} ("some type of list") lets objects be passed to methods or stored in fields without exactly specifying their type parameters. This is particularly valuable for classes such as {{Javadoc:SE|java/lang|Class}} where most of the methods do not mention the type parameter.

However, [[type inference]] for existential types is a difficult problem. For the compiler implementer, Java wildcards raise issues with type checker termination, type argument inference, and ambiguous programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Taming wildcards in Java's type system |first1=Ross |last1=Tate |first2=Alan |last2=Leung |first3=Sorin |last3=Lerner |booktitle=Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGPLAN conference on Programming language design and implementation (PLDI '11) |year=2011 |url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ross/publications/tamewild/}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In general it is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] whether a Java program using generics is well-typed or not,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author1=Radu Grigore | title=Java generics are turing complete | booktitle=Proceedings of the 44th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL'17) | year=2017 | arxiv=1605.05274 | bibcode=2016arXiv160505274G }}&lt;/ref&gt; so any type checker will have to go into an infinite loop or time out for some programs.) For the programmer, it leads to complicated type error messages. Java typechecks wildcard types by replacing the wildcards with fresh type variables (so-called ''capture conversion''). This can make error messages harder to read, because they refer to type variables that the programmer did not directly write. For example, trying to add a {{java|Cat}} to a {{java|List&lt;? extends Animal&gt;}} will give an error like

 method List.add(capture#1) is not applicable
   (actual argument Cat cannot be converted to capture#1 by method invocation conversion)
 where capture#1 is a fresh type-variable:
   capture#1 extends Animal from capture of ? extends Animal

Since both declaration-site and use-site annotations can be useful, some type systems provide both.&lt;ref name=tamingCombining /&gt;&lt;ref name="MixedSiteVariance" /&gt;

==Origin of the term ''covariance''==

These terms come from the notion of [[covariance and contravariance of functors|covariant and contravariant functors]] in [[category theory]]. Consider the category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; whose objects are types and whose morphisms represent the subtype relationship  ≤. (This is an example of how any partially ordered set can be considered as a category.) Then for example the function type constructor takes two types ''p'' and ''r'' and creates a new type ''p'' → ''r''; so it takes objects in &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; to objects in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. By the subtyping rule for function types this operation reverses ≤ for the first argument and preserves it for the second, so it is a contravariant functor in the first argument and a covariant functor in the second.

Winner of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]'s 2014 Award for Corporate Excellence
,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/ace# |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106173159/https://www.state.gov/e/eb/ace/# |archive-date=January 6, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2010 by Troy Wiseman and Camille Rebelo, EcoPlanet Bamboo has pioneered the industrialization of bamboo as an alternative fiber for timber manufacturing industries. To date the Company has 37,250 acres of bamboo farms under ownership, in Central American, Western and Southern Africa, with larger scale [[plantation]]s underway.

EcoPlanet Bamboo is a privately owned United States Company, registered in Delaware and with corporate headquarters located outside of Chicago, Illinois. It is a US Series LLC allowing each geographic region and individual bamboo plantation to be funded and operated separately but under the same umbrella.

The Company has been recognized for its social impact&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131017005822/en/EcoPlanet-Bamboo-Wins-IAIR-Award-Sustainability|title=EcoPlanet Bamboo Wins IAIR Award for Sustainability|website=Businesswire.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; created more than 750 jobs and operates in some of the poorest parts of the world in [[Nicaragua]], South Africa and [[Ghana]].

EcoPlanet Bamboo plants species of tropical clumping ([[sympodial]]) bamboos, using only highly degraded&lt;ref&gt;''EcoPlanet Bamboo uses the UNFCCC tool for the Identification of Degraded Land.''&lt;/ref&gt; and marginal land to produce a tree free, [[deforestation]] free fiber. The Company has developed a framework for what sustainability means in respect to [[bamboo]]. Farms reach maturity in 5–7 years and the fiber is targeted towards [[Fortune 500|Fortune 500 companies]] dependent on wood and fiber as their raw resource.

The company is highly decentralized with individual bamboo plantations operating under EcoPlanet Bamboo Groups standardized operational framework to achieve [[Forest restoration|Forest Landscape Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etfrn.org/file.php/302/4.6-ecoplanet-bamboo.pdf|format=PDF|title=4.6 Commercial bamboo plantations as a tool for restoring landscapes|website=Etfrn.org|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full set of qualified managerial staff exists on each farm and is overseen by a core managerial team.

==Bamboo in China==
Although bamboo is a plant that has been grown and harvested in China for generations, it occurs only within a smallholder model. There are few commercial or large scale managed plantations. The majority of area under bamboo comprises plots of a few Mu in size, owned by individual farmers or families, and managed as part of a [[Crop diversity|diverse]] mix of livelihood crops. Throughout China bamboo has been planted only in areas not suitable for agriculture, which generally mean mountainous land that is often inaccessible. Most of China's bamboo industry is focused on a single iconic species – [[Phyllostachys edulis|Moso (''Phyllostachys edulis'')]]

The processing of bamboo in China is dominated by low and medium level processing, with a large focus on two very different markets (1) the global handicraft industry and (2) the production of [[Bamboo shoot|edible bamboo shoots]] for the food industry. In recent years there has been an increase in the production of [[bamboo floor]]ing.

EcoPlanet Bamboo is working in a different manner growing certified bamboo fiber for the [[pulp and paper industry]], textiles and [[Engineered wood|engineered timber]].

==Historical barriers to industrialization of bamboo==
EcoPlanet Bamboo claims to have overcome many barriers to industrialize bamboo as a commercial crop:
# A lack of planting material.  See “[[Bamboo#Mass flowering|bamboo mass flowering]]".
# Lack of knowledge on the growth, ecology and yields of bamboos other than Moso.
# High investment required to take bamboo through the 6–7 years required to reach maturity.
# Difficulty of operating in remote parts of the developing world.

==Bamboo sustainability==
EcoPlanet Bamboo is a triple bottom line company promoting the concept of conscious capitalism. The company has pioneered the concept of sustainability certification for commercially produced bamboo. Nicaraguan farms are certified under the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), the [[Verified Carbon Standard]] (VCS) and have gold level Climate Community Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA) stamp of approval. EcoPlanet Bamboo is the first entity to have received these certifications for application to bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121115006752/en/EcoPlanet-Bamboo-Acquires-FSC-Certification-Enabling-Supply|title=EcoPlanet Bamboo Acquires FSC Certification, Enabling Supply of a Sustainable Alternative Fiber to US &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Multinational&amp;nbsp;Manufacturing Industries|website=Bsinesswire.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Company has been insured by the [[Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency|World Bank's Multilateral Insurance Guarantee Agency (MIGA)]], holding a $48&amp;nbsp;million policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agriinvestor.com/miga-increases-ecoplanet-bamboo-guarantee/|title=MIGA increases EcoPlanet Bamboo guarantee - Agri Investor|date=June 25, 2015|website=Agriinvestor.com|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIGA has featured EcoPlanet Bamboo for strong social and environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.miga.org/Lists/General/CustomDisp.aspx?ID=1488|title=General|website=Miga.org|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EcoPlanet Bamboo's farms are examples of private [[Forest restoration#Forest landscape restoration|sector forest landscape restoration]], with planted bamboo [[Habitat conservation|conserving]] and reconnecting remnant forest patches and scattered native vegetation, restoring soil functioning, water tables and carbon sinks.

[[File:1869 Frederic Leighton - Electra at the Tomb of Agamemnon.jpg|thumb|right |upright|''Electra at the Tomb of [[Agamemnon]]'', by [[Frederic Leighton]], c.1869]]
In [[Neo-Freudianism|Neo-Freudian]] [[Ego psychology|psychology]], the '''Electra complex''', as proposed by [[Carl Jung]], is a girl's [[psychosexual development|psychosexual]] competition with her mother for possession of her father. In the course of her psychosexual development, the [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] is the girl's [[phallic stage]]; a boy's analogous experience is the [[Oedipus complex]]. The Electra complex occurs in the third—phallic stage (ages 3–6)—of five [[psychosexual development]] stages: (i) the [[Oral stage|Oral]], (ii) the [[Anal stage|Anal]], (iii) the [[Phallic stage|Phallic]], (iv) the [[Latency stage|Latent]], and (v) the [[Genital stage|Genital]]—in which the source of [[libido]] pleasure is in a different [[erogenous zone]] of the infant’s body.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In classical [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory, the child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Electra complex and of the [[Oedipus complex]]; his and her key psychological experience to developing a mature [[Gender role|sexual role]] and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. [[Sigmund Freud]] instead proposed that girls and boys resolved their [[Complex (psychology)|complexes]] differently—she via [[penis envy]], he via [[castration anxiety]]; and that unsuccessful resolutions might lead to [[neurosis]].
Hence, women and men who are [[Fixation (psychology)|fixated]] in the Electra and Oedipal stages of their [[psychosexual development]] might be considered "father-fixated" and "mother-fixated".

== Background ==
[[File:Electra and Orestes - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumb|right|Electra and Orestes, matricides]]

As a [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] term for daughter–mother psychosexual conflict, the Electra complex derives from the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythologic]] character [[Electra]], who plotted [[Matricide|matricidal]] revenge with [[Orestes]], her brother, against [[Clytemnestra]], their mother, and [[Aegisthus]], their stepfather, for their murder of [[Agamemnon]], their father (cf. ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', by Sophocles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Bruce |year=1996 |title=Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia |edition=4th |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York |page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Robert E. |year=1991 |title=Women of Classical Mythology: A Biographical Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=California |pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hornblower S, Spawforth A |year=1998 |title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization |pages= 254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] developed the female aspects of the [[psychosexual development|sexual development]] theory—describing the [[Id, ego and super-ego|psychodynamics]] of a girl’s sexual competition with her mother for sexual possession of the father—as the '''feminine Oedipus attitude''' and the '''negative Oedipus complex''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freud|first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud|title=On Sexuality |year=1956 |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet it was his collaborator [[Carl Jung]] who coined the term Electra complex in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl (1913). ''The Theory of Psychoanalysis.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Jill |year=2005 |title=Electra after Freud: Myth and Culture |publisher=Cornell University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83JE6sEFP9cC&amp;pg=PA8 |page=8 |isbn=978-0-8014-4261-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Jung|title=Psychoanalysis and Neurosis |year=1970 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud rejected Jung's term as [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytically]] inaccurate: "that what we have said about the Oedipus complex applies with complete strictness to the male child only, and that we are right in rejecting the term 'Electra complex', which seeks to emphasize the analogy between the attitude of the two sexes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freud|first1=Sigmund|title=On Sexuality|date=1991|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In forming a discrete sexual identity ([[Id, ego, and super-ego#Ego|ego]]), a girl's decisive psychosexual experience is the Electra complex—daughter–mother competition for possession of the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sigmund Freud 1856–1939 |year=2000 |work=Encyclopaedia of German Literature |publisher=Routledge |location=London |accessdate=2 September 2009 |url=http://www.credoreference.com.library.capella.edu/entry/routgermanlit/sigmund_freud_1856_1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the [[phallic stage]] (ages 3–6), when children become aware of their bodies, the bodies of other children, and the bodies of their parents that they gratify physical curiosity by undressing and exploring each other and their genitals—the [[Erogenous zone|erogenous center]]—of the phallic stage; thereby learning the [[Human anatomy|physical]] [[gender]] differences between male and female, "boy" and "girl". When a girl's initial sexual attachment to her mother ends upon discovering that she has no [[penis]], she then transfers her [[Libido|libidinal desire]] (sexual attachment) to her father and increases sexual competition with her mother.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Characteristics ==
The psychodynamic nature of the daughter–mother relationship in the Electra complex derives from [[penis envy]], caused by the mother, who also caused the girl's [[Castration anxiety|castration]]; however, upon re-aligning her sexual attraction to her father (heterosexuality), the girl [[Defense mechanism|represses]] the hostile female competition, for fear of losing the love of her mother. This [[internalization]] of "Mother" develops the [[super-ego]] as the girl establishes a discrete sexual identity ([[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]). Without a penis, the girl cannot sexually possess her mother, as the infantile [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] demands. Consequently, the girl redirects her [[libido|desire]] for sexual union upon her father, and thus progresses to [[heterosexual]] femininity, which culminates in bearing a child who replaces the absent [[penis]]. Moreover, after the [[phallic stage]], the girl’s psychosexual development includes transferring her primary [[erogenous zone]] from the infantile [[clitoris]] to the adult [[vagina]]. Freud thus considered the feminine Oedipus attitude ("Electra complex") to be more emotionally intense than the Oedipal conflict of a boy, resulting, potentially, in a woman with a submissive, less confident personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bullock A, Trombley S |year=1999 |title=The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought |publisher=Harper Collins |location=London |pages=259, 705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both sexes, [[defense mechanism]]s provide transitory resolutions of the conflicts between the drives of the Id and the drives of the ego. The first defense mechanism is '''[[Psychological repression|repression]]''', the blocking of memories, emotional impulses, and ideas from the conscious mind; yet it does not resolve the Id–Ego conflict. The second defense mechanism is '''[[Identification (psychology)|identification]]''', by which the child incorporates, to his or her ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent; in so adapting, the girl facilitates identifying with mother, because she understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, thus are not antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, A., Trombley, S. (1999) ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Harper Collins: London pp. 205, 107&lt;/ref&gt; If sexual competition for the opposite-sex parent is unresolved, a phallic-stage [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] might arise, leading a girl to become a woman who continually strives to dominate men (viz. [[penis envy]]), either as an unusually seductive woman (high self-esteem) or as an unusually submissive woman (low self-esteem). In a boy, a phallic-stage fixation might lead him to become a vain, over-ambitious man. Therefore, the satisfactory parental handling and resolution of the Electra complex are most important in developing the infantile [[super-ego]], because, by identifying with a parent, the girl internalizes [[morality]]; thereby, she chooses to comply with societal rules, rather than being reflexively compelled to comply, for fear of punishment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Case studies ==
[[File:Princecharming.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Prince Charming]] hero meets [[Cinderella]] heroine (1912)]]
A 1921 study of patients at a New York state mental hospital, ''On the Prognostic Significance of the Mental Content in Manic-Depressive Psychosis'', reported that of 31 [[Manic depression|manic-depressive]] patients studied, 22 (70%) had been diagnosed as afflicted with an Electra complex; and that 12 of the 22 patients had [[Regression (psychology)|regressed]] to early stages of [[psychosexual development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levin |first=Hyman L. |year=1921 |title=On the prognostic significance of the mental content in manic-depressive psychosis |journal=The State Hospital Quarterly |volume=VII |pages=594–95 |accessdate=2010-11-18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2qpXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electra in fiction ==
Fiction affords people the opportunity to [[Identification (psychology)|identify]] with the protagonists of fantastic stories depicting what might be if they could act upon their [[Libido|desires]]. Often, in aid to promoting social conformity, the [[myth]], story, [[Dramaturgy|stage play]], or [[film]] presents a story meant to frighten people from acting upon their desires.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Arthur Asa. ''Media Analysis Techniques'', 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks:Sage Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of infantile [[socialization]], [[fairy tales]] fulfill said function; boys and girls identify with the [[hero]] and [[heroine]] in the course of their adventures. Often, the travails of hero and heroine are caused by an evil stepmother who is envious of him, her, or both, and will obstruct their fulfilling of desire. Girls, especially in the three-to-six year age range, can especially identify with a heroine for whom the love of a [[prince charming]] will sate her [[penis envy]]. Moreover, stories such as [[Cinderella]] have two maternal figures, the stepmother (society) and the [[fairy godmother]]; stepmother represents the girl's feelings towards mother; the fairy godmother teaches the girl that her (step) mother loves her, thus, to have mother’s love, the girl must emulate the good Cinderella, not the wicked stepsisters.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Arthur Asa ''Media Analysis Techniques'' 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks: Sage Press (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electra in poetry ==
The American poet [[Sylvia Plath]] (1932–1963) acknowledged that the poem ''Daddy'' (1962) is about a woman, afflicted with an unresolved Electra complex, who conflates her dead father and derelict husband in dealing with having been emotionally abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyne, Susan R. ''Sylvia Plath’s Ariel Poems'' Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Her biographers noted a psychologic irony about the life of the poet Plath: she knew her father for only eight years, before he died; she knew her husband for eight years, before she killed herself. Her husband was her substitute father, [[Psychosexual development|psychosexually]] apparent when she addresses him (the husband) as the "vampire father" haunting her since his death. In conflating father and husband as one man, Sylvia Plath indicates their emotional equality in her life; the unresolved Electra complex.&lt;ref&gt;Plath, Sylvia "Daddy" ''Ariel'' Harper &amp; Row:New York (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

On their self-titled album, the [[alternative music]] group [[Ludo (band)|Ludo]] have a song titled, "Electra's Complex".

[[Feminism]] is a collection of movements and ideologies that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve equal political, economic, cultural, personal, and social rights for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawkesworth|first1=M.E.|title=Globalization and Feminist Activism.

A feminist advocates or supports the rights and equality of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooks|first1=Bell|title=Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics|date=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn= 9780745317335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminist movements]] started in the West in the late 19th century and its development has three ways of evolution. [[First-wave feminism]] was about the status of white women of middle and upper-classes, suffrage and their political equality. [[Second-wave feminism]] went further in dealing with inequalities in social and economic spheres. [[Third-wave feminism]] deals with financial, social and cultural inequalities and women’s rights in politics and media.
Feminism may be found almost in each country around the world. This article will focus on the case of [[Latin America]] and peculiarities of feminism there, as well as the concept of Latin American Feminist Theory.

However, there is an opinion that the classical division of the periods taken from the example of the USA does not fit to some extent feminism evolution in Latin America, namely the time of second and third waves in Americas are different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Francesca|title=Latin American Women and the Search for Social Justice|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the one hand, there is an opinion shared by many people that feminism in Latin _America was a western product. On the other hand, some studies, for example, Francesca Miller’s Latin American Women and the Search for Social Justice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Francesca|title=Latin American Women and the Search for Social Justice|date=1991|publisher=University Press of New England}}&lt;/ref&gt; prove that it has been rather an ideology that appeared in the region over the last century. However, evidence also points to Latin American women advocating for equal rights as early as the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mother's Making Latin America: Genders, Households, and Politics since 1825|last=O'Conner|first=Erin|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1118271445|location=US|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a fairly solid consensus among academics and activists that women’s participation in leftist movements has been one of the central reasons for the development of Latin American feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shayne|first1=Julie|title=Feminist Activism in Latin America, in The Encyclopedia of Sociology|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|pages=Vol no. 4: 1685–1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Latin American countries were able to attain legal rights for women in right, conservative contexts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrig|first=Maruja|last2=Beckman|first2=Ericka|year=2001|title=Latin American Feminism|journal=NACLA Report on the Americas|volume=34|issue=5|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Shayne argues that there are 5 factors, which contributed to the emergence of revolutionary feminism: 1) experience in revolutionary movements showed challenge to status-quo perception of gender behaviour; 2) logistical trainings; 3) a political opening; 4) unmet basic needs by revolutionary movements; 5) a collective feminist consciousness.

== Evolution of feminism in Latin America ==

=== 1800s ===
Although the term feminist had not yet been used to describe women’s rights advocates until the 1890s, many women of the nineteenth century, mostly elite or middle class, tried to challenge dominant gender norms.

Born in Quito (now Ecuador), in 1797, Manuela Sáenz was a “precursor to feminism and women’s emancipation. History has both vilified and glorified Manuela Sáenz - for her affair with Simon Bolivar, and for accusations that say she only “manipulated gender norms to advance her person and political interests.” As an early supporter of the independence cause, she spied on Spanish royalty and held intellectual gatherings called ''tertulias''.

Juana Manuela Gorriti, an Argentinian journalist and writer born in 1818, advocated greater rights for women and wrote literary works with women protagonists that were both “romantic and political.” Similar to Sáenz, Gorriti held ''tertulias'' for literary men and women, one of whom included Clorinda Matto de Turner, a novelist sympathetic towards Indians and critical of the priesthood in Peru. Gorriti also worked with Teresa González, an avid writer who ran a girls’ school and advocated education for women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1900s-1920s ===
In the late half of the 19th century there were three main areas of feminists' discussions: [[suffrage]], protective labour laws, and access to education. 1910, Argentina — the first meeting of the organization of International Feminist Congresses (topic of equality). The second meeting was in 1916 in Mexico.

The 1910s saw many women, such as Aleida March, gain prominence during the revolutions of Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Additionally, Amelio Robles, born in 1889, was a notable man in a peasant army and the Confederation of Veterans of the Revolution who by modern United States standards would be considered a trans man.

A prominent international figure born during this time was Gabriela Mistral, who in 1945 won the Nobel prize in literature and became a voice for women in Latin America. She upheld conservative gender norms, even at one point saying, “perfect patriotism in women is perfect motherhood,” and that as a teacher she was “married” to the state. However, feminist theorists contend that her personal experiences contradict her language, because she never married, had a “mannish” appearance, and her close personal relationships with women suggest that she might have been a closet lesbian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1930s-1950s ===
The 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s were full of Latina feminists the pioneered the current Latin American Feminist movement. It was the beginning of the suffragist movement for many Latin American women. The first elected woman major of any major capital city in the Americas, Felisa Rincon de Gautier, was “an active participant in Puerto Rico's women's suffrage movement” that was won in 1932, and her child care programs “inspired the United States' Head Start program."  &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hamptoninstitution.org/latina-feminism.html#.V_xNteArl2x|title=Latina Feminism: National and Transnational Perspectives|last=Charleswell|first=Cherise|date=|year=2014|website=The Hampton Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most women advocating for equal rights had to cling onto femininity to gain respect, but feminist theorist Julia de Burgos used her writings to “openly contest the prevailing notion that womanhood and motherhood are synonymous.” Additionally, Dr. Leila Gonzalez was involved in the “Brazilian Black movement” and helped develop “the practice of Black Feminism in Brazil.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 1960s-1970s ===
At the end of 1960s, many Latin American females started forming groups of reflection and activism for defending women’s rights. Initially those women were from the middle class; a significant part came from the various left groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/07/1963-beginning-feminist-movement|title=Women 1963: 50 years on|last1=Cochrane|first1=Kira}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike their predecessors, Latin American feminists of the 1960s focused on social justice rather than suffrage. They emphasized “reproductive rights, equal pay in the job market, and equality of legal rights.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tobar|first=Ros|year=2003|title=Feminism is Socialism, Liberty, and Much More|journal=Journal of Women's History|volume=15|issue=3|pages=129–134|issn=1042-7961}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that this type of Latin American feminism was a result of Latina women’s activism against their position of sub-ordinance, not a reaction to women gaining more legal rights in the United States and Europe. As Gloria Anzaldúa said, we must put history “through a sieve, winnow out the lies, looks at the forces that we as a race, as women, have been part of.” &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borderlands/La frontera: La nueva mestiza|last=Anzaldúa|first=Gloria|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|year=1999|isbn=|edition=Fourth|volume=1|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such female groups arose amid the sharp radicalization of class struggle in the continent, which resulted in labor and mass rising whose most evident manifestations were the Chilean industrial belts [[Cordón Industrial]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miranda|first1=Nicolás|title=Los cordones industriales, la revolución chilena y el frentepopulismo|url=http://www.rebelion.org/hemeroteca/chile/030904miranda.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cordobazo]] in Argentina (was a civil uprising in the city of Córdoba, Argentina, in the end of May 1969), student mobilizations in Mexico etc. These facts could be regarded as the sharpest experience and numerous movements of urban and rural guerrilla came to the scene.

It is for those reasons that Latin American feminist theorists, such as Ros Tobar, say that Chilean feminism is closely tied to socialism. Authoritarian regimes reinforced “the traditional family, and the dependent role of women, which is reduced to that of mother.” Dictatorships institutionalized social inequality, so many Latin American feminists tie authoritarian governments with less rights for women. Slogans, such as “Women give life, the dictatorships exterminates it,” “In the Day of the National Protest: Let’s make love not the beds,” and “Feminism is Liberty, Socialism, and Much More,” portrayed the demands of many Latin American feminists.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Latin American feminist theorist Nelly Richard of Chile explored how feminism and gay culture broke down rigid structures of life in Chile and was essential to the liberation of women in her novel ''Masculine/Feminine: Practices of Difference''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swarthout|first=Kelley|year=2009|title=Masculine/Feminine: Practices of Difference(s)|journal=RILCE.Revista de Filologa Hispnica|volume=25|issue=2|pages=442–444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There appeared feminist meetings (initially, every two years; later — every three years). They discussed recent accomplishments, strategies, possible future conflicts, ways to enhance their strategies and how to establish through such ways varied, rich and immense coordination between the national and transnational levels.

However, the mid-70s saw the decline of such movements due to the policy of [[neoliberalism]] in the region. Then came dictatorial regimes that settled over the majority of the continent and prevented the development of feminist movements, not only due to the establishment of a reactionary ideology based on the defense of tradition and family, but also due to the political persecution and state terrorism with its consequences such as torture, forced exile, imprisonment, disappearances and murders of political, social and trade union activists.
While the right wing of politicians considered feminists to be subversive and rebellious, the left, by contrast, named them as «small bourgeois».

It also was during this time that leftist feminist organizations gained attention for their efforts. This is most prominently seen in the “Women of Young Lords” of Puerto Rico. The Young Lords were at first'', Boricuan, Afro-Taino'' men who fought for basic human rights and “openly challenged machismo, sexism, and patriarchy.” Bianca Canales, Luisa Capetillo, Connie Cruz, and Denise Oliver became leaders in the Young Lords, and facilitated a “Ten-Point Health Program." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most feminisms in Latin America arose out of the context of military dictatorships and masculine domination. However, a lot of marginalized women began questioning hegemonic feminism in the 1970s.  These women, whether they were Afro-descendant, lesbians, Indigenous, transgender, sex workers, domestic workers, etc., began to look at different, interlocking types of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duarte|first=ngela Ixkic Bastian|year=2012|title=From the Margins of Latin American Feminism: Indigenous and Lesbian Feminisms|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=38|pages=153–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloria Anzaldúa, of Indigenous descent, described her experience with intersectionality as a “racial, ideological, cultural, and biological crosspollination” and called it a “new mestiza consciousness.”  &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Various critiques of “internal colonialism of Latin American states toward their own indigenous populations” and “Eurocentrism in the social sciences” emerged, giving rise to Latin American Feminist Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schutte|first=Ofelia|year=2011|title=Engaging Latin American Feminisms Today: Methods, Theory, Practice|journal=Hypatia|volume=26|issue=4|pages=783–803|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2011.01200.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s ===

The feminist movement returned to be an important protagonist in the early 1980s after the fall of dictatorships and the establishment of the new democratic regimes throughout the region, with the dictatorship managing to interrupt the continuity with the previous stage.
Feminists of 1980s, e.g. Nancy Fraser, referring to violence against women, questioned the established limits of discussion and politicized problems which before had not ever been politicized, expanded their audiences, created new spaces and institutions in which the opposing interpretations could be developed and from where they could reach wider audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edited by Debra Castillo, Mary Jo Dudley and Breny Mendoza |title=Rethinking Feminisms in the Americas |url=http://lasp.einaudi.cornell.edu/system/files/feminisms%20book%20final.pdf |publisher=Latin American Studies Program Cornell University, Ithaca, NY |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615222549/http://lasp.einaudi.cornell.edu/system/files/feminisms%20book%20final.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the repressive period and particularly during the early years of democracy, human rights groups played a major role in the continent. These movements organized to denounce the torture, disappearances, and crimes of the dictatorship, were headed mainly by women (mothers, grandmothers and widowed). In order to understand the change in the language of feminist movements, it is necessary to bear in mind two things: the first is that it was women that headed revelations and subsequent struggle for the punishment of those who were responsible for the state terrorism, and the second is the policy-especially of the United States- to prioritize human rights in the international agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movimiento feminista en América latina|url=http://html.rincondelvago.com/movimiento-feminista-en-america-latina.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists were able to achieve goals because of political parties, international organizations and local labour groups. Latin American feminist movements had two forms: as centers of feminist work, and as part of broad, informal, mobilized, volunteer, street feminist movement.
At the IV meeting in Mexico in 1987 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Espinosa Damián|first1=Gisela|title=Feminismo popular y feminismo indígena.  Abriendo brechas desde la subalternidad|url=http://www.labrys.net.br/labrys19/mexique/espinosa.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was signed a document on the myths of the feminist movement impeding its development. This document has a great impact; it states that feminism has a long way to go because, it is a radical transformation of society, politics and culture.
The myths that were listed are:
• Feminists are not interested in power
• Feminists do politics in a different way
• All feminists are the same
• There is a natural unity for the mere fact of being women
• Feminism exists only as a policy of women towards women
• The movement is a small group
• The women’s spaces ensure for themselves a positive space
• Personal is automatically political
• The consensus is democracy. This is important because each country in Latin America was able to push feminism in different ways – for example, through democracy, socialism, and even under authoritarian regimes (although this was less common).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These myths were commonly disputed at Latin American and Caribbean meetings in the 1980s called ''Encuentros'', a space created to “strengthen feminist networks,” exchange analysis, and confront “conditions of oppression.” Though the ''Encuentros'' constructed a common space, the people there made sure it was a place of political dialogue, not of a sisterhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Elisabeth|title=Feminism Under Construction|journal=NACLA Report on the Americas|volume=47|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few points of unity found during these Encuentros was the effect colonialism and globalization had on their respective countries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1990s ===

The neoliberal policies that began in the late 1980s and reached their peak in the continent during the decade of the 1990s, made the feminist movement fragmented and privatized. Many women began to work in multilateral organizations, finance agencies etc. and became bridges between financing bodies and female movements. It was around this time that many feminists, feeling discomfort with the current hegemonic feminism, began to create their own, autonomous organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1994, the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) became “a catalyst for indigenous women's organization in Mexico” and created “The Women's Revolutionary Law." Their example of indigenous feminism led the way for other indigenous tribes, such as the Mayans, Quechuas, and Quiches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Zapatista women were made public in 1994. They are used as inspiration and symbolic tools to feminists throughout the world, and are often referred to in scholarly essays and articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1086/648538|title = The Emergence of Indigenous Feminism in Latin America|journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume = 35|issue = 3|pages = 539–545|year = 2010|last1 = Hernández Castillo|first1 = R. Aída}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, many feminists tried to bring together these autonomous organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean, which led to the Beijing Global Conference on Women of 1995.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Scholars argue that there is a strong correlation between the improvement of legal rights for Latin American women and the country’s struggle for democracy. For example, because of women’s active protests against President Abdala Bucaram’s government, Ecuador’s Constitution of 1998 saw many new legal rights for women. MUDE, or Women for Democracy, have stated that “what is not good for democracy is not good for women." However, this is not always the case. Peru had an authoritarian regime, but they had a quota for at least thirty percent of candidates in race to be women. It is important to note though, that the advance of Latin American women’s legal equality does not get rid of the social and economic inequality present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Today===
The emergence of economic neoliberal models at the beginning of the 21st century led to a revival of the movement in the world, which was accompanied by an attempt of feminist dialogue with other social movements. A new feature is the feminist participation in global mobilization at different governments meetings and in multinational organizations where there is a discussion of the humanity’s future.

With the rise of globalization and international policies, many feminist political and academic organizations have been institutionalized. The more professional tactics of NGOs and political lobbying has given Latina feminists more influence on public policy, but at the cost of giving up “bolder, more innovative proposals from community initiatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montenegro|first=Marisela|last2=Capdevila|first2=Rose|last3=Sarriera|first3=Heidi Figueroa|year=2012|title=Editorial introduction: Towards a transnational feminism: Dialogues on feminisms and psychologies in a Latin American context|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=220–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current Latin American Feminist Groups include Ecuador’s Flor De Azaela, which started in 1982, making it the oldest movement for sex workers in Latin America. Many Afro-Indigenous women have also created organizations, such as the Fraternal Black Organization of Honduras, that advocate for more land rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://telesurtv.net|title=5 Latin American Feminist Groups You Should Know About|last=Deschamps|first=Marion|date=|website=teleSUR|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ''Colectivo Feminista Sexualidade Saude'' (CFSS ) of Brazil currently “provides health education for women and professionals,” where they encourage self-help and focus on “women's mental health, violence against women, and child mortality.” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Today, there are also feminist groups that have spread to the United States. For example, [[The Latin Feminist Group|The Latina Feminist Group]] formed in the 1990s, composed by women from all places of Latin America. Although groups like these are local, they're all inclusive groups that accept members from all parts of Latin America. Members of the organizations are predominantly from European - Native American backgrounds with some members being completely descendants of Native American people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Telling To Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios|last=The Latina Feminist Group|first=|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0822327653|location=Durham|pages=3|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there is a weak relationship between lesbianism and feminism in Latin America. Since the 1960s, lesbians have become a viable group in Latin America. They have established groups to fight misogynist oppression against lesbians, fight AIDS in the LGBT community, and support one another. However, because of many military coups and dictatorships of Latin America, feminist lesbian groups have had to break up, reinvent, and reconstruct their work. Dictatorships in the 70s and 80s in Chile and Argentina were examples of the resistance to these feminist lesbians groups of Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Miñoso, Yuderkys Espinosa. "The Feminism-Lesbianism Relationship in Latin America: A Necessary Link." In The Politics of Sexuality in Latin America: A Reader on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Rights, edited by Corrales Javier and Pecheny Mario, by Flores Joan, 401-05. University of Pittsburgh Press, 2010. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkfk6.37&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, Latin American feminist groups have set goals for their communities. Such goals call for the consolidation of a more organized LGBT community across Latin America. Other goals overall look to change smaller domestic policies that in any way discriminate to members of the LGBT community. They also aim to have more people on office, to network better with the broader Latin people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrales|first=Javier|date=|title=LGBT Rights and Representation in Latin America and the Caribbean: The Influence of Structure, Movements, Institutions, and Culture|url=https://globalstudies.unc.edu/files/2015/04/LGBT_Report_LatAm_v8-copy.pdf|journal=The University of North Carolina Press|volume=|pages=4–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have set goals to advocate for LGBT rights in the political world, from organizations and political groups to acknowledge their rights, and encourage other countries to protect feminists and other members of the LGBT community in Latin America. Leaders such as Rafael de la Dehesa have contributed to describe early LGBT relations in parts of Latin America through his writings and advocacy. De la Dehesa, a Harvard alumni, has published books as, “Queering the Public Sphere in Mexico and Brazil: Sexual Rights Movements in Emerging Democracies” that advocate for a shift in popular culture that accepts queer Latinos.  His work, "Global Communities and Hybrid Cultures: Early Gay and Lesbian Electoral Activism in Brazil and Mexico" explains the gay communities and puts them in context to coincide with the history of those countries. Rafael has also introduced the idea of normalizing LGBT issues in patriarchal conservative societies such as Mexico and Brazil to suggest that being gay should no longer be considered taboo in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Aguiar, José Carlos G. Revista Europea De Estudios Latinoamericanos Y Del Caribe / European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies, no. 93 (2012): 144-45. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/23294485&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indigenous Feminism in Latin America ==
There are many struggles that Latin American feminists face. For example, they have little to no political representation across all of Latin America. Not until the 2000s, have indigenous feminists leaders gained any political power. By 2006, Bolivia elected Evo Morales for president in 2006. Morales spearheaded a new movement in Bolivia, called the [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]]. This new movement had allowed for Indigenous working-class women to become members of parliament and serve for other branches of the government as well. This important transition of power was more peaceful and much more inclusive than any other country in Latin America. In other countries, obstacles remain for indigenous women to have any representation or political identity. The [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] women that live in Guatemala and parts of southern Mexico have struggled to gain any political mobility over the last few years due to immigration crises, economic and educational disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;Bastian Duarte, Ángela Ixkic. "From the Margins of Latin American Feminism: Indigenous and Lesbian Feminisms." ''Signs'' 38, no. 1 (2012): 153-78. doi:10.1086/665946.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revolutionary/Feminist mobilization ==
[[File:ERP combatants Perquín 1990 24.jpg|thumb|Men and Women both participated in revolutions that presented Revolutionary Feminism. These soldiers are fighting in the civil war in El Salvador.]]
Some experts, for example Julie Shayne, believe that in Latin America the phenomenon of female, feminism movements should be called «revolutionary feminism». Julie Shayne argues that a revolutionary feminism is one born of revolutionary mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shayne J.|title=The Revolution Question: Feminisms in El Salvador, Chile, and Cuba|date=2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Julie Shayne was researching this phenomenon in El Salvador, in the 1980s, she came across Lety Mendez, a former member and head of the women’s secretariat of the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion. Lety Mendez, was at the forefront of the Salvadoran Civil War, and she knew from direct experience how necessary women are to any revolution. However, she believed women are completely forgotten about. Mendez explained that women were one of the sole reasons the Left had support and was able to move through El Salvador.&lt;ref name="Shayne, Julie D 2004"&gt;Shayne, Julie D. The Revolution Question: Feminisms in El Salvador, Chile, and Cuba. New Brunswick, New Jersey, and London: Rutgers University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Sonia|date=Winter 1992|title=Feminisms in Latin America: From Bogota to San Bernardo|jstor=3174469|journal=The University of Chicago Press|volume=12|issue=2|pages=393–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Shayne traveled to Cuba and interviewed Maria Antonia Figueroa. Figeroa and her mother worked alongside Castro during the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Figueroa also described an experience of women essentially carrying a revolution on their backs, but being undermined in the role they played in the revolution or not being to progress past the machismo and sexism, still rampant after their respective revolutions.&lt;ref name="Shayne, Julie D 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Alvarez, Sonia (Winter 1992). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3174469.pdf "Feminisms in Latin America: From Bogota to San Bernardo"] (PDF). ''The University of Chicago Press''. '''12''': 393–434.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of these women's’ feminist ideologies were born out of the needs they saw not being met for equality or simply completely disregarded after their countries’ revolutions or attempted revolutions. This feminism born out of the fight against oppressive regimes has given way to a new look of feminism that can be found throughout Latin America.&lt;ref name="Shayne, Julie D 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The mobilization, or gathering, of feminists can be seen in Shaye’s research of Chilean women and their nation’s government organized mothers’ center. She witnessed that the gathering of these women and the sharing of their stories of oppression and domestic violence lead way to “Strategic (feminist) mobilization”. These gatherings were not only unique to Chile, but were throughout Latin America - Bogota, Colombia (1981), Lima, Perú (1983), Bertioga, Brazil (1985), Taxco, Mexico (1987), and San Bernardo, Argentina (1990) - through the 1980s known as Encuentros. These biannual meetings brought together grassroot and professional feminists that allowed these women to discuss their experiences and the progression of their countries.&lt;ref name="Shayne, Julie D 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

== Issues on agenda ==
Post-suffrage feminism in Latin America covers mainly three big streams: the feminist stream, the stream in political parties and the stream of women from political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vargas. V|title=The Feminist Movement in Latin America: Between Hope and Disenchantment. Development and Change|date=1992|pages=195–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of great concern are: voluntary maternity/responsible paternity, divorce law reform, equal pay, personal autonomy, and challenging the consistently negative and sexist portrayal of women in the media; access to formal political representation, whereas women of the popular classes tend to focus their agendas on issues of economic survival and racial and ethnic justice.

In recent years, the Latin American feminists have also challenged [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] feminist frameworks, promoted literature and art by women of color, and establish their own social groups. They've also sought to challenge traditional nationalists who oppress women and use their political influence to subjugate non-heteosexuals, women, and people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios|last=The Latina Feminist Group|first=|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0822327653|location=Durham|pages=4|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin American feminist theory ==
Because feminist theory often relies on Western literary works rather than personal experiences, Latin American feminist theory is a construct that has appeared only recently in order to give Latina women legitimacy in Eurocentric contexts. Latin American feminist theorists have been known to not only get their sources from Western countries, but also from Latin American history, personal accounts, and research on the social sciences. There is a controversy, called “epistemic privilege,” as to how most Latina feminist philosophers enjoy cultural and economic privilege that distances them from the living conditions of the majority of Latin American women. Ophelia Schutte, a feminist philosopher, has argued that “feminist philosophy requires a home in a broader Latin American Feminist theory and not in the discipline of philosophy in Latin America.” &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu|title=Latin American Philosophy|last=Gracia|first=Jorge|last2=Vargas|first2=Manuel|date=|year=2013|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Latin America is vast, this type of feminist theory is diverse and hard to characterize. However, there are several notable Latin feminist theorists, many of which have already been mentioned in this article, like Ros Tobar, Ophelia Schutte, and Gloria Anzaldúa. Latin American feminist theorist Maria Lugones addressed ethnocentric racism, bilingualism, multiculturalism, and “interlinking registers of address.” Many Latina feminists borrow concepts that Lugones introduced, such as “the role of language, bodies, objects and places.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roelofs|first=Monique|year=2016|title=Navigating Frames of Address: María Lugones on Language, Bodies, Things, and Places|journal=Hypatia|language=English|publication-place=Hoboken|volume=31|issue=2|pages=370–387|doi=10.1111/hypa.12233|issn=0887-5367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graciela Hierro, born in 1928 in Mexico addressed “feminist ethics and the roles of feminism in public and academic spaces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In addition to the support of the scale, there are further large flour sacks with trademarks. About 1551.]]
A '''flour sack''' or '''flour bag''' is a cloth [[bag|sack]], usually made of cheap cotton, used to store [[flour]]. Flour sacks are often printed with simple designs and trademarks to indicate the [[miller]]s and companies making or selling the flour.

==Place names==
Various place names were named after flour sacks, since they were so ubiquitous in so many cultures. [[Blatobulgium]] in Scotland, and [[Pieniężno]] in Poland, for example, are possibly named after words for ''flour sack'' in different languages. The all-white tower in the old city of [[Ravensburg]] in Germany is called ''Mehlsack''.

==Reuel Colt Gridley==
[[File:Reuel Colt Gridley circa 1864.jpg|right|thumbnail|A photo of Reuel Colt Gridley, who became famous in the United States in 1864 by repeatedly selling a sack of flour to raise money for the "Sanitary Fund" (to help wounded U.S. Civil War veterans). This picture was reportedly published in ''Harper's Weekly'' in 1865.]]
[[Reuel Colt Gridley]] famously carried a 50-pound bag of flour on his shoulder after losing a political bet in [[Austin, Nevada]]. The sack of flour was later auctioned off, then re-donated, then re-auctioned again and again to raise money for the [[United States Sanitary Commission]] during the American Civil War. Auctioning this single flour sack eventually raised more than $250,000.

==Clothing==
[[File:Near East relief american flour sacks and the Armenians in syria.png|thumbnail|right|Children's clothing made from the Near East relief flour sacks is a common sight among Armenian refugees in Syria.]]
By the late 19th century, flour sacks were often printed in various colors and designs, and recycled for clothing and other purposes. "With feed sacks and flour bags, farmwomen took thriftiness to new heights of creativity, transforming the humble bags into dresses, underwear, towels, curtains, quilts, and other household necessities."{{attribution needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1105750 "Feedsack Dress"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because they came along with the purchase of essential flour, flour sacks were universally recycled and used by many cultures as a source of free textiles for clothing and other necessities. For refugees, the free cloth that came with flour helped replace worn-out and inadequate clothing.

===Chinese clothing===
During the early parts of the 20th century, Chinese workers made clothing from flour sacks, sometimes called "Hunger clothes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm15799.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll123/id/51801 Unidentified.

Libraries, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph from 1948 shows school children wearing uniforms made of [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] flour sacks.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Fr. Floyd.

===Depression clothing===
During the Great Depression in the US, many families sewed clothing from discarded flour sacks. Often flour would be purchased according to the patterns printed on the bag.&lt;ref&gt;Banning, Jennifer Lynn. [http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-06232005-162008/ "Feed Sack Fashions in South Louisiana, 1949–1968: The Use of Commodity Bags in Garment Construction."] Baton Rouge, La.: Louisiana State University, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacks had so many uses, and the clothing made from them was so common, that flour sacks entered the local folklore. Kendra Brandes found that "as an element of material culture, the clothing and clothing practices of rural populations reflect the life and times of the era to the same extent as that of the general population. However, it is the activities of these farm wives, clothing their families in feed sacks, that offer a view of life that was unique to rural communities during this time period."&lt;ref&gt;Kendra Brandes. [https://dx.doi.org/10.4148/ojrrp.v4i1.59 "Feed Sack Fashion in Rural America: A Reflection of Culture."] ''Online Journal of Rural Research &amp; Policy''. Kansas State University, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people from rural Virginia spoke about their clothes made from sacks during the depression. "Back then, feed was sold in sacks. I believe they held almost 100 pounds of seeds. A number of farmers who didn't sew returned the sacks for resale... I actually made hair bows, pants and dresses from the sacks." "Mama always sewed on a Singer treadle sewing machine and made our dresses from flour sacks. She made sure Dad would get two sacks just alike. That was what the pattern took to make the dresses right." "Mama made me pinafores out of flour sacks. Flour sacks were made of cotton with pretty prints." "Dresses made for my sister and me were sometimes made out of cotton feed bags (I guess my brothers were lucky)." "My mother made shirts out of feed sacks, which a lot of cow feed, came in."&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Todd, and Karen Garvey. ''Flour Sack Dresses and Victory Stamps: Tales from the Good Old Days in Roanoke and the New River Valley of Virginia: a Treasury of 20th Century Memories''. 2016. Pages 63, 117, 134, 161, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 3.5 million women and children wore flour sack clothing during the Great Depression. It just became a way of life, as times were very hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Flour Sack Towels - from 1800's to 1950's [sic]|url=https://www.floursacktowels.com/blogs/news/history-of-flour-sack-towels-from-1800s-to-1950s/|website=Mary's Kitchen flour sack towels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European clothing===
In Europe, flour sacks were used in clothing, quilts, coats and strainers.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw-Smith, David, Conor McAnally, Jolyon Jackson, and Sally Shaw-Smith. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962374633 Irish Patchwork]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gwendolyn Galsworth''' is president and founder of Visual Thinking, Inc. and an author, researcher, teacher, consultant, publisher and thought leader in the field of "visuality" in the workplace. Her books, which have won multiple [[Shingo Prize]] awards in the Research and Professional Publication category, focus on conceptualizing and codifying workplace visuality into a single framework called the "visual workplace".

She was one of the ten original members of the [[Productivity Inc.]] team assembled by [[Norman Bodek]] in the early 1980s to establish that company as the premier resource for books and intelligence from Japan that documented and explained what was then called The Japanese Manufacturing Miracle, and is now widely known as the [[Toyota Production System]]. 
 
Today, she continues to consult, teach, and produce books, videos and webinars in her field. She is a frequent keynote speaker on the business improvement conference circuit, and also hosts a weekly web-based radio show called The Visual Workplace, with over 70,000 listeners monthly.

==Early life and education==
Galsworth was born in upper New York State to Russian mother Geraldine and Swiss father Donato Galsworth, she graduated from Long Branch Senior High school, and four years later graduated from Montclair State Teachers College (New Jersey) at the top of her Latin class.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  After her first year of teaching Latin in Kinnelon, New Jersey, she started an acting career in NYC, studying at the [[Gene Frankel]] Studio. Two years later (1968), Galsworth traveled in Europe for a year and a half, learning French and Italian and continuing to act.

Returning to NYC in the 70s, Galsworth joined an experimental acting group, The Performance Garage, and then traveled back to Europe to study acting with [[Jerzy Grotowski]] in Poland.  That connection brought her to Paris a few months later to audition, by special invitation, for [[Peter Brook]] and his London-based National Repertory Theatre. On her second return to New York, she enrolled in Hunter College for a Master’s in Special Education for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired, with the intention of establishing a theatre where deaf people performed not with the language of signing, such as the National Theatre of the Deaf (NTD) promoted, but through a unique language of physical and sound images that deaf actors would invent from their own expressive needs. Though NTD ultimately dominated the field and Galsworth did not complete this degree, her  interest in visual and sensory language equivalents had begun. 
Galsworth received both her Masters (1981) and PHD in Education and Statistics (1984) from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Productivity, Inc.==
A chance connection in 1983 led her to Productivity, Inc. and the new offices of  [[Norman Bodek]], where she soon became head of Training, Consulting, and Development. Her work as head of training and development at Productivity brought her into close working contact many Japanese master practitioners, including the co-architect of the Toyota Production System, [[Shigeo Shingo]], head of the Shingijutsu Consulting Group Yoshiki Iwata, Sumitomo’s Ryuji Fukuda, as well as [[Mr. Seiichi Nakajima|Seiichi Nakajima]] and Hiroyuki Hirano.

Over the next six years, Galsworth led study missions to Japan, and worked closely with Dr. Ryuji Fukuda to develop his CEDAC methodology into a process that western companies could deploy. In 1988, a year before his passing, Dr. Shigeo Shingo assigned Galsworth the development of his Poka-Yoke/Zero Defect paradigm into a more complete and western-oriented improvement methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitydigest.com/magazine/2008/nov/article/profiles-quality-gwendolyn-d-galsworth-phd.html# |title=Profiles in Quality with Gwendolyn D. Galsworth, Ph.D |publisher=Quality Digest |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality Methods International, Inc.==
Leaving Productivity in 1990, Galsworth formed Quality Methods International (QMI) in order to specialize in the research, articulation, and deployment of workplace visuality as single, sustainable improvement framework. Since then, she has focused on codifying a range of principles and practices, resulting in an array of methods called the technologies of the visual workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualworkplace.com/about_visuality |title=Visual Workplace Consultants &amp;#124; Visual Thinking Training &amp;#124; Visual Lean Office |publisher=Visualworkplace.com |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this same decade, Galsworth became a Malcolm Baldrige Award Examiner and an examiner for The Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence.  She remained a Shingo Examiner through 2009.

In 2009, The Shigeo Shingo Prize Office at Utah State University invited Galsworth to create an online course on the visual workplace as part of its newly launched Shingo Prize E-Curriculum in Operational Excellence. Its title was The Visual Workplace/Visual Thinking Online Course, the first external course in the Shingo Prize curriculum.

==Visual Thinking, Inc==
In 2012, Galsworth changed the name of her company to Visual Thinking, Inc. to more closely align with its purpose. Shortly before, she was invited to host her own weekly internet radio show on [[VoiceAmerica]], named The Visual Workplace/Work That Makes Sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voiceamerica.com/show/1974/the-visual-workplace |title=The Visual Workplace &amp;#124; VoiceAmerica™ |publisher=Voiceamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gynomorph''' ({{lang-grc-gre|γυνόμορφ}}) (''gyno–'' "woman" + ''morph'' "shape", literally "female-like shape") is a Greek word used to describe a male who possessed distinctly feminine features.

==Mythology==
In [[Greek mythology]] and [[Ancient Greek religion|religion]], a gynomorph was a bi-gendered god with both masculine and feminine characteristics. Gynomorphs were portrayed as [[effeminate]] young males, like [[Dionysos]], a masculine god who possessed distinctly feminine features. Gynomorphs retained the creative capacity of female divinities, they had cosmic wombs, but they also possessed the inseminating abilities attributed to male divinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hillman|date=2014|title=Hermaphrodites, Gynomorphs and Jesus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0aLoBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq|publisher=Ronin Publishing|isbn=1579511856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
{{main|Sexual mimicry}}
In [[biology]], a gynomorph is a male that resembles a female, whereas an andromorph is a female that resembles a male. For instance, some female [[damselflies]] show colour variations typically found in males. Andromorphs by resembling males, are thought to benefit from avoiding male harassment. Some authors have proposed that this benefit is offset by a higher probability of detection for andromorphs compared to gynomorphs owing to differences in body colouration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Van Gossum, H|author2=Stoks, Robby|author3=De Bruyn, L|title=Conspicuous body coloration and predation risk in damselflies : are andromorphs easier to detect than gynomorphs?|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/59554|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5994">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hopf lemma''', named after [[Eberhard Hopf]], states that if a continuous real-valued function in a domain in Euclidean space with sufficiently smooth boundary is harmonic in the interior and the value of the function at a point on the boundary is greater than the values at nearby points inside the domain, then the derivative of the function in the direction of the outward pointing normal is strictly positive. The lemma is an important tool in the proof of the [[maximum principle]] and in the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s. The Hopf lemma has been generalized to describe the behavior of the solution to an elliptic problem as it approaches a point on the boundary where its maximum is attained.

==Statement for harmonic functions==
Let Ω be a bounded domain in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with smooth boundary. Let ''f'' be a real-valued function continuous on the closure of Ω and [[harmonic function|harmonic]] on Ω. If ''x'' is a boundary point such that ''f''(''x'') &gt; ''f''(''y'') for all ''y'' in Ω sufficiently close to ''x'', then the (one-sided) [[directional derivative]] of ''f'' in the direction of the outward pointing normal to the boundary at ''x'' is strictly positive.

==Proof for harmonic functions==
Subtracting a constant, it can be assumed that ''f''(''x'') = 0 and ''f'' is strictly negative at interior points near ''x''. Since the boundary of Ω is smooth there is a small ball contained in Ω the closure of which is tangent to the boundary at ''x'' and intersects the boundary only at ''x''. It is then sufficient to check the result with Ω  replaced by this ball. Scaling and translating, it is enough to check the result for the unit ball in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, assuming ''f''(''x'') is zero for some unit vector ''x'' and ''f''(''y'') &lt; 0 if |''y''| &lt; 1.

By [[Harnack's inequality]] applied to −''f''

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{-f(rx)\ge -{1-r\over (1+r)^{n-1}} f(0),}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''r'' &lt; 1. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{f(x)-f(rx)\over 1-r}={-f(rx)\over 1-r} \ge -{1\over (1+r)^{n-1}} f(0)&gt; -{ f(0)\over 2^{n-1}} &gt;0.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the directional derivative at ''x'' is bounded below by the strictly positive constant on the right hand side.

==General discussion==
Consider  a second order, uniformly [[elliptic operator]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt; Lu = a_{ij}(x)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + b_i(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} + c(x)u, \qquad x \in \Omega.&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an open, bounded subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The Weak Maximum Principle states that a solution of the equation &lt;math&gt;Lu=0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; attains its maximum value on the closure &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; at some point on the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be such a point, then necessarily 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}(x_0) \geq 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial\nu&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[outer normal]] [[derivative]].  This is simply a consequence of the fact that &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt; must be nondecreasing as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approach &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The Hopf Lemma strengthens this observation by proving that, under mild assumptions on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}(x_0) &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

A precise statement of the Lemma is as follows.  Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded region in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the operator described above.  Let &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; be of class &lt;math&gt;C^2(\Omega) \cap C^1(\overline{\Omega})&lt;/math&gt; and satisfy the differential inequality 
:&lt;math&gt; Lu \geq 0, \qquad \textrm{in}~ \Omega. &lt;/math&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be given so that &lt;math&gt; 0\leq u(x_0) = \max_{x \in \overline{\Omega}} u(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
If (i) &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, and (ii) &lt;math&gt;c \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then either &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, or &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}(x_0) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the outward pointing unit normal, as above.

The above result can be generalized in several respects.  The regularity assumption on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced with an interior ball condition:  the lemma holds provided that there exists an open ball &lt;math&gt;B \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \partial B&lt;/math&gt;.   It is also possible to consider functions &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; that take positive values, provided that &lt;math&gt;u(x_0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  For the proof and other discussion, see the references below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20488">'''Human rights defenders''' or '''human rights activists''' are people who, individually or with others, act to promote or protect [[human rights]]. They can be journalists, environmentalists, whistle-blowers, trade unionists, lawyers, teachers, housing campaigners, and so on. They can defend rights as part of their jobs or in a voluntary capacity. As a result of their activities, they can sometimes be the subject of reprisals and attacks of all kinds, including smears, surveillance, harassment, false charges, arbitrary detention, restrictions on the right to freedom of association, and physical attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/6011/2017/en/|title=Human rights defenders under threat - A shrinking space for civil society|last=Amnesty International|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration on Human Rights Defenders==
The [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized [[human rights|Human Rights]] and [[fundamental freedoms|Fundamental Freedoms]] (A/RES/53/144) on December 9, 1998, commonly known as the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ishr.ch/un-declaration |title=UN Human Rights Defenders |publisher=Ishr.ch |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; marks a historic achievement in the struggle toward better protection of those at risk for carrying out legitimate [[human rights]] activities and is the first UN instrument that recognizes the importance and legitimacy of the work of human rights defenders, as well as the right and responsibility of all to protect human rights.

The Declaration codifies the international standards that protect the activity of human rights defenders around the world. It recognises the legitimacy of human rights activity and the need for this activity and those who carry it out to be protected. Under the Declaration, a human rights defender is anyone working alone, as part of group or an institution,  working for the promotion and protection of human rights. This broad definition encompasses professional as well as non-professional human rights workers, [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[lawyer]]s and anyone else carrying out, even on an occasional basis, a human rights activity.

The Declaration articulates existing rights in a way that makes it easier to apply them to the situation of human rights defenders. It specifies how the rights contained in the major human rights instruments, including the [[right of free expression]], association and assembly, apply to defenders.

The rights protected under the Declaration include, among others,  the right to develop and discuss new human rights ideas and to advocate their acceptance; the right to criticise government bodies and agencies and to make proposals to improve their functioning; the right to provide legal assistance or other advice and assistance in defence of human rights; the [[right to fair trial|right to observe fair trials]]; the right to unhindered access to and communication with [[non-governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organisations]]; the right to access resources for the purpose of protecting human rights, including the receipt of funds from abroad.

States have a responsibility to implement and respect all the provisions of the Declaration. In particular, states have the duty to protect human rights defenders against any violence, retaliation and intimidation as a consequence of their human rights work.

==Protection instruments==
Following the adoption of the Declaration on human rights defenders in 1998, a number of initiatives were taken, both at the international and regional level, to increase the protection of defenders and contribute to the implementation of the Declaration. In this context, the following mechanisms and guidelines were established:

*The mandate of the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on human rights defenders (2000)
*The mandate of the Special Rapporteur of the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] on human rights defenders (2004)
*The Human Rights Defenders Unit of the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (2001)
*The [[European Union]] Guidelines on human rights defenders (2004)
*The Declaration of the Committee of Ministers on Council of Europe action to improve the protection of human rights defenders and promote their activities [https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805d3e52] (2008)
*The European Union Human Rights Defenders mechanism, which is implemented by civil society organizations, [https://protectdefenders.eu/en/ ProtectDefenders.eu] (2015)

In 2008, the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (FIDH) and the [[World Organisation Against Torture]] (OMCT), took the initiative to gather all the human rights defenders’ institutional mandate-holders (created within the United Nations, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union) to find ways to enhance coordination and complementarities among themselves and with NGOs. In 2010, a single inter-mechanisms website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights-defenders.org humanrights-defenders.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was created, gathering all relevant public information on the activities of the different human rights defenders’ protection mandate-holders. It aims to increase the visibility of the documentation produced by the mechanisms (press releases, studies, reports, statements), as well as of their actions (country visits, institutional events, trials observed).

In 2016, the [[International Service for Human Rights]] published the 'Model National Law on the Recognition and Protection of Human Rights Defenders'.[https://www.ishr.ch/news/model-law] This document provides authoritative guidance to states on how to implement the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders at the national level. It was developed in collaboration with hundreds of defenders and endorsed by leading human rights experts and jurists.

Several countries have introduced national legislation or policies to protect human rights defenders, such as Colombia Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, but key challenges in implementation remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr01/6211/2017/en/|title=Americas: State protection mechanisms for human rights defenders|last=Amnesty International|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Human rights lawyer Emil Kurbedinov,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/business/russian-held-crimea-lawyer-fights-repression-crimean-tatars.html|title=In Russian-held Crimea, lawyer fights repression against Crimean Tatars - Apr. 03, 2017|date=2017-04-03|work=KyivPost|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Crimean Tartar, won the 2017 Award for Frontline Human Rights Defenders at Risk. Kurbedinov has been an avid defender of civil society militants, mistreated Crimean Tartars, and members of the media. He documents violations of human rights during searches of activists’ residences as well as emergency responses. In January 2017, the Crimean Center for Counteracting Extremism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1490184936|title=Menacing FSB interrogations of Ukrainian Cultural Centre activists in Russian-occupied Crimea - Human Rights in Ukraine|work=Human Rights in Ukraine|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrested and detained the lawyer. He was taken to a local facility of the Russian Federal Security Service&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://government.ru/en/department/113/|title=Federal Security Service - The Russian Government|website=government.ru|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for questioning.  A district tribunal ruled that Kurbedinov was guilty of doing propaganda work for terrorist groups and organizations. He was sentenced to 10 days of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightsinrussia.info/person-of-the-week/emilkurbedinov-1|title=Person of the Week: Emil Kurbedinov - Rights in Russia|website=www.rightsinrussia.info|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the same year, female activists who were killed because of their advocacies and activities in defending human rights were honored during the International Women Human Rights Defenders’ Day. Those murdered criticized corruption and other forms of injustice, protect their lands from governments and multinational corporations, and upheld the rights of lesbians, gays and transgender individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/nov/29/remembering-women-killed-fighting-for-human-rights-in-2017|title=Remembering women killed fighting for human rights in 2017|last=Sekyiamah|first=Nana Darkoa|last2=Ford|first2=Liz|date=2017-11-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by the Business and Human Rights Resource Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/581|title=Business and Human Rights Resource Centre {{!}} UN Global Compact|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented a 34 percent increase worldwide in attacks against human rights activists in 2017. The figures included 120 suspected murders and hundreds of incidents that involved assault, bullying, and threats. There were 388 attacks in 2017 compared to only 290 in 2016. The same study identified human rights defenders connected to agribusiness, mining, and renewable energy sectors as those in greatest danger. Lawyers and members of environmental groups were also at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/09/human-rights-activists-growing-risk-attacks-and-killings-study-claims|title='Attacks and killings': human rights activists at growing risk, study claims|last=Kelly|first=Annie|date=2018-03-09|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards for human rights defenders==
*The [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]] in 1998.
*The [[Martin Ennals Award]], a collaboration of several human rights NGOs. [[Martin Ennals]] was a renowned human rights defender and secretary general of [[Amnesty International]]. Its secretariat is located at the [[OMCT]] office in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinennalsaward.org/en/winners/index.html|title=Winner of the Martin Ennals Award 1994-2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award carries a grant of at least 20,000 [[Swiss Francs]] (about 20,000 [[US dollars]]) to be used for further work in the field of human rights.
*The [[Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award]], established in 1984.
*The [[Sakharov Prize]], established in 1998 by the [[European Parliament]].  Laureates include: [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Malala Yousafzai|Malala Yousafza]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;i, the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]], [[Raif Badawi]].
*The [[Human rights defenders tulip|Human Rights Defenders Tulip]], established by the [[Netherlands]] government in 2008.
*Several human rights defenders have received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], such as imprisoned [[China|Chinese]] human rights activist [[Liu Xiaobo]] who won the [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize]] for his "long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China".
*The [[Front Line Defenders|Front Line Defenders Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk]], established in 2005 to 'honour the work of a human rights defender who, through non-violent work, is courageously making an outstanding contribution to the promotion and protection of the human rights of others.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Front Line Defenders Award|url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/front-line-defenders-award-human-rights-defenders-risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Ginetta Sagan]] award for Women Human Rights Defenders, established in 1997 "to help women throughout the world in their struggle to overcome oppression, to let them know that they are not alone".[https://www.amnestyusa.org/about-us/grants-and-awards/ginetta-sagan-award/] Awardees include [[Hina Jilani]], [[Sonia Pierre]], [[Lydia Cacho]], Julienne Lusenge.

==Transnational advocacy networks==
Margaret E. Keck and Kathryn Sikkink, in “Activists Beyond Borders” define transnational advocacy networks as “…networks of activists, distinguishable largely by the centrality of principled ideas or values in motivating their formation.”&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." [[Cornell University Press]], 1998,p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This definition can be seen in many human rights organizations.

Keck and Sikkink write from a context before the universal availability of information technology and at this point the main actors are the States.&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The boomerang pattern, argued by Keck and Sikkink, is a model of advocacy where a State A causes “blockage” by not protecting or violating rights.  Non-state actors provide other non-state actors from a State B with information about the blockage and those non-state actors inform State B.  State B places pressure on State A and/or has intergovernmental organizations place pressure on State A to change its policies.&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to facilitate transnational advocacy networks, the network needs to have common values and principles, access to information and be able to effectively use that information, believe their efforts will cause change and effectively frame their values.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Information use is historically very important to human rights organizations. Human rights methodology is considered “promoting change by promoting facts.”&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  By using facts, state and non-state actors can use that viable information to pressure human rights violators.

Human rights advocacy networks focus on either countries or issues by targeting particular audiences in order to gain support.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  To gain audience support human rights organizations need to cultivate relationships through networking, have access to resources and maintain an institutional structure.&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists commonly use four tactics in their advocacy efforts: 1) Information politics provides comprehensive and useful information on an issue that otherwise might not be heard from sources who otherwise might be overlooked; 2) Symbolic politics uses powerful symbolic events as a way to increase awareness surrounding an issue; 3) Leverage politics utilizes material leverage (examples such as goods, money, or votes), moral leverage (the "mobilization of shame") or both in order to gain influence over more powerful actors; 4) Accountability politics holds those who make commitments to a cause accountable for their actions or lack thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks i2International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information technology and networked advocacy==
The widespread availability of the internet, mobile telephones, and related [[information and communications technology|communications technologies]] enabling users to [[Networked advocacy|overcome the transaction costs of collective action]] has begun to change the previous models of advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clay Shirky|Shirky, Clay]]. ''[[Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations]]''. New York: Penguin Group, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to information technology and its ability to provide an abundance of information, there are fewer to no costs for group forming.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Shirky, Clay. Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations. New York: Penguin Group, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Coordination is now much easier for human rights organizations to track human rights violators and use the information to advocate for those in need.

One effect is that it is harder for governments to block information they do not want their citizens to obtain.  The increase in technology makes it nearly impossible for information not to penetrate everyone around the globe making it easier for human rights organizations to monitor and ensure rights are being protected.

In addition, the fact that the Internet provides a platform for easy group forming, the use of an institutional organization is not essential.  With social networking sites and blogs, any individual can perpetuate collective action with the right tools and audience.  The need for a hierarchy is diminishing with the great abundance of information available.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Electronic mapping==
Electronic mapping is a newly developed tool using electronic networks and [[satellite imagery]] and tracking.  Examples include tactical mapping, crisis mapping and geo-mapping.  Tactical mapping has been primarily used in tracking human rights abuses by providing visualization of the tracking and implementation monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Movements.org.  “Maptivism: Mapping Information for Advocacy and Activism."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ikee''' was a [[Computer worm|worm]] that spread by means of SSH Connections between [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken]] iPhones and stole [[Apple Inc|Apple]] ID's and passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/08/11/android-heart-app-virus-spreads-quickly-author-arrested-within-17-hours/ |title= First worm for IOS|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://gigaom.com/2009/11/12/ikee-iphone-worm-progeny-not-so-harmless/ |title= ikee iPhone Worm - Not So Harmless|accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in 2009 and changed wallpapers to a photo of [[Rick Astley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/A-Safe-Mobile-Device-Starts-with-Its-Owner-475184.shtml|title= Ikee iPhone virus of 2009|accessdate=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
iPhone owners of [[Australia]] reported that smart phones had been infected by a worm that changed their iPhone wallpaper to Rick Astley, a 1980s pop singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/source-code-for-ikee-iphone-worm-in-the-wild/|title= Ikee worm targeting customers of Australian mobile carriers|accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affected smartphones if the owner did not change their default password after installation of SSH. Once the Ikee worm infected, it would find other iPhones on the [[Cellular network|mobile network]] which were vulnerable and infect them as well. The worm wouldn’t affect users who hadn't jailbroken or installed SSH on their iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2009/11/08/iphone-worm-discovered-wallpaper-rick-astley-photo/|title= First iPhone worm discovered – ikee |accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worm does nothing more than changing the infected user’s lock [[Wallpaper (computing)|screen wallpaper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.computerweekly.com/news/1280091290/First-ever-iPhone-worm-Ikee-unleashed-by-Aussie-hacker|title= First ever iPhone worm Ikee unleashed by Aussie hacker|accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[source code]] of the ikee worm says it was written by Ikex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.sophos.com/en-us/press-office/press-releases/2009/11/iphone-worm-job.aspx|title= Ikee worm author wins job at iPhone app firm|accessdate=2009-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">'''Ikigai''' (生き甲斐,) is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for "a reason for being." The word ‘Ikigai’ usually refers to the source of value in one's life or the things that make one's life worthwhile.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakanishi|first=N|date=1999-05-01|title='Ikigai' in older Japanese people|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/28.3.323|journal=Age and Ageing|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=323–324|doi=10.1093/ageing/28.3.323|issn=1468-2834}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word roughly translates to the "thing that you live for"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-japanese-concept-ikigai-is-a-formula-for-happiness-and-meaning-8e497e5afa99|title=The Japanese Concept ‘Ikigai’ is a Formula for Happiness and Meaning|date=2017-11-30|work=Better Humans|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it also has the nuance of "the reason for which you wake up in the morning" similar to a daily purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theascent.pub/the-japanese-secret-to-finding-ones-purpose-is-forgetting-oneself-6828edf58310|title=The Japanese Secret to Finding One’s Purpose is Forgetting Oneself|date=2018-09-25|work=The Ascent|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual's ikigai is personal to them and specific to their lives, [[Value (ethics)|values]] and [[Belief|beliefs]]. It reflects the [[Self-realization|inner self]] of an individual and expresses that faithfully, while simultaneously creating a [[mental state]] in which the individual feels at ease. Activities that allow one to feel ikigai are never forced on an individual; they are often spontaneous, and always undertaken willingly, giving the individual satisfaction and a sense of meaning to life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Overview==
The term ''ikigai'' [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] two Japanese words: {{nihongo|''iki''|[[wikt:生き]]}} meaning "life; alive" and ''kai'' ([[wikt:甲斐|甲斐]]) meaning "(an) effect; (a) result; (a) fruit; (a) worth; (a) use; (a) benefit; (no, little) avail" ([[rendaku|sequentially voiced]] as ''gai'') to arrive at "a reason for living [being alive]; a meaning for [to] life; what [something that] makes life worth living; a raison d'etre".&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe Toshirō (渡邊敏郎), Edmund R. Skrzypczak, and Paul Snowden, eds. (2003), ''[[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]]'' (新和英大辞典), 5th edition, Kenkyusha, pp. 127, 459, 130. In the game [[Go (game)|go]], ''iki'' especially means "[[Life and death|alive]]" (able to remain on the board indefinitely): "in go normally a situation in which a connected group of stones of any size contains at least two independent liberties [''me''] and so cannot be captured by an opponent".&lt;/ref&gt;

In the culture of [[Okinawa]], ''ikigai'' is thought of as "a reason to get up in the morning"; that is, a reason to enjoy life. In a [[TED Talk]], [[Dan Buettner]] suggested ''ikigai'' as one of the reasons people in the area had such long lives.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100?language=en&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''ikigai'' usually is used to indicate the source of value in one's life or the things that make one's life worthwhile.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chaaipani.com/ikigai/|title=Ikigai – What makes you come alive?|last=|first=|date=|website=Chaaipani|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the word is used to refer to mental and spiritual circumstances under which individuals feel that their lives are valuable. It's not linked to one's financial status&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Even if a person feels that the present is dark, but they have a goal in mind, they may feel ''ikigai''.  Behaviours that make one feel ''ikigai'' are not actions one is forced to take—these are natural and spontaneous actions.

In the article titled {{nihongo|''Ikigai — jibun no kanosei, kaikasaseru katei''|}} ("Ikigai: the process of allowing the self's possibilities to blossom") Kobayashi Tsukasa says that "people can feel real ikigai only when, on the basis of personal maturity, the satisfaction of various desires, love and happiness, encounters with others, and a sense of the value of life, they proceed toward self-realization."&lt;ref name="JapAm"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520201330|title=What Makes Life Worth Living?: How Japanese and Americans Make Sense of Their Worlds|last=Mathews|first=Gordon|publisher=University of California Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kobayashi |first=Tsukasa |date=1990-04-04 |title={{nihongo|Ikigai — jibun no kanosei, kaikasaseru katei|}}

{{About|a step in the removal of a public official|challenging a witness in a legal proceeding|Witness impeachment}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Presidente da Coreia do Sul, Park Geun-hye, visita o Brasil.jpg|thumb|250px|Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]] and South Korean President [[Park Geun-hye]] were both impeached.]]
'''Impeachment''' is the process by which a [[legislative body]] levels [[Indictment|charges]] against a government official. It does not mean removal from office; it is only a statement of charges, akin to an [[indictment]] in [[criminal law]]. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction by a legislative vote, which judgment entails removal from office.

Because impeachment and conviction of officials involve an overturning of the normal constitutional procedures by which individuals achieve high office (election, ratification, or appointment) and because it generally requires a [[supermajority]], they are usually reserved for those deemed to have committed serious abuses of their office. In the [[United States]], for example, impeachment at the federal level is limited to those who may have committed "[[high crimes and misdemeanors]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erskine|first=Daniel H.|date=2008|title=The Trial of Queen Caroline and the Impeachment of President Clinton: Law As a Weapon for Political Reform|url=http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_globalstudies/vol7/iss1/2/|journal=Washington University Global Studies Law Review|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=|issn=1546-6981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impeachment exists under constitutional law in many countries around the world, including [[Brazil]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[India]], the [[Philippines]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]].

==Etymology and history==
The word "impeachment" derives from Old French ''empeechier'' from Latin ''impedicare'' expressing the idea of becoming caught or entrapped, and has analogues in the modern [[French Language|French]] verb ''empêcher'' (to prevent) and the modern [[English Language|English]] ''impede''. Medieval popular etymology also associated it (wrongly) with derivations from the Latin ''impetere'' (to attack). (In its more frequent and more technical usage, [[Witness impeachment|impeachment]] of a [[witness]] means challenging the honesty or credibility of that person.)

Impeachment was first used in the British political system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Specifically, the process was first used by the English "[[Good Parliament]]" against [[William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer|Baron Latimer]] in the second half of the 14th century. Following the British example, the constitutions of Virginia (1776), Massachusetts (1780) and other states thereafter adopted the impeachment mechanism, but they restricted the punishment to removal of the official from office. As well, in private organizations, a [[motion to impeach]] can be used to prefer charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=265|edition=1969|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In various jurisdictions==

===Austria===
The [[President of Austria|Austrian Federal President]] can be impeached by the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] (''Bundesversammlung'') before the Constitutional Court. The constitution also provides for the recall of the president by a [[referendum]]. Neither of these courses has ever been taken. This is likely because while the President is vested with considerable powers on paper, they act as a largely ceremonial figurehead in practice, and are thus hardly in a position to abuse their powers.

===Brazil===
{{See also|Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|Impeachment proposals against Michel Temer}}
The [[President of the Federative Republic of Brazil]], state governors and municipal mayors may be impeached by the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] and tried and removed by the [[Federal Senate]]. Upon conviction, the officeholder has his political rights revoked for eight years—which has the effect of barring him from running for any office.

[[Fernando Collor de Mello]], the 32nd President of Brazil, resigned in 1992 amidst impeachment proceedings. Despite his resignation, the Senate nonetheless voted to convict him and bar him from holding any office for eight years, due to evidence of [[bribery]] and misappropriation.

In 2016, the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] initiated [[Impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff|an impeachment case]] against President [[Dilma Rousseff]] on allegations of budgetary mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew Jacobs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/world/americas/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-vote.html |title=Brazil's Lower House of Congress Votes for Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 17, 2016 |accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her conviction, she was replaced by Vice President [[Michel Temer]], who had served as [[Acting (law)|acting]] president while Rousseff's case was pending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36273916 |title=Brazil's Dilma Rousseff to face impeachment trial |date=May 12, 2016 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
The [[President of Bulgaria]] can be removed only for [[high treason]] or violation of the constitution. The process is started by a two-thirds majority vote of the [[Parliament of Bulgaria|Parliament]] to impeach the President, whereupon the Constitutional Court decides whether the President is guilty of the crime of which he is charged. If he is found guilty, he is removed from power. No Bulgarian President has ever been impeached. The same procedure can be used to remove the [[Vice President of Bulgaria]], which has also never happened.

===Croatia===
The process of impeaching the [[President of Croatia]] can be initiated by a two-thirds majority vote in favor in the [[Sabor]] and is thereafter referred to the [[Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia|Constitutional Court]], which must accept such a proposal with a two-thirds majority vote in favor in order for the president to be removed from office. This has, however, never occurred in the history of the Republic of [[Croatia]]. However, in case of a successful impeachment motion a president's constitutional term of five years would be terminated and an election called within 60 days of the vacancy occurring. During the period of vacancy the presidential powers and duties would be carried out by the [[Speaker of the Croatian Parliament]] in his/her capacity as Acting President of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/fgs.axd?id=17074|title=Constitution of Croatia|at=§ 105|format=PDF|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
Prior to 2013 the [[President of the Czech Republic]] could be impeached only for an act of high [[treason]] (which is not defined in the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] itself). The process has to start in the [[Senate of the Czech Republic]] which only has the right to impeach the president, this passes the case to the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]] which has to decide whether the President is guilty or not. If the Court decides that the President is guilty then the President loses his office and the ability to be elected President of the Czech Republic ever again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/docs/laws/constitution.html Ústava České republiky]. Psp.cz. Retrieved 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; No Czech president has ever been impeached, though, members of the Senate [[Impeachment of Václav Klaus|sought to impeach President Vaclav Klaus in 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Czech President Vaclav Klaus faces treason charge |date=March 4, 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21660234 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case was dismissed by the court reasoning that his mandate has expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Constitutional Court throws out treason charges against ex-president Klaus |author=Rob Cameron |date=March 28, 2013 |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/constitutional-court-throws-out-treason-charges-against-ex-president-klaus |publisher=[[Radio Praha]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the constitution changed; now the process can be started by at least three-fifths of present senators and must be approved by at least 
three-fifths of all members of Parliament. Also, the President can be impeached not only for high treason (newly defined in the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]]) but also for a serious infringement of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/docs/laws/constitution.html Ústava České republiky]. Psp.cz. Retrieved on 2016-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The [[President of Germany|Federal President of Germany]] can be impeached both by the [[Bundestag]] and by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] for willfully violating Federal law. Once the Bundestag or the Bundesrat impeaches the president, the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] decides whether the President is guilty as charged and, if this is the case, whether to remove him or her from office. The Federal Constitutional Court also has the power to remove federal judges from office for willfully violating core principles of the [[Grundgesetz|federal constitution]] or a [[states of Germany|state]] constitution. The impeachment procedure is regulated in Article 61 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]].

===Hong Kong===
The [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] can be impeached by the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]]. A motion for investigation, initiated jointly by at least one-fourth of all the legislators charging the Chief Executive with "serious breach of law or dereliction of duty" and refusing to resign, shall first be passed by the Council. An independent investigation committee, chaired by the [[Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal]], will then carry out the investigation and report back to the Council. If the Council find the evidence sufficient to substantiate the charges, it may pass a motion of impeachment by a two-thirds majority.&lt;ref name=HKSAR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html |title=Basic Law of Hong Kong |website=basiclaw.gov.hk |publisher=Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government |date= |accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Article 73(9)}}

However, the Legislative Council does not have the power actually to remove the Chief Executive from office, as the Chief Executive is appointed by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government]]. The Council can only report the result to the Central People's Government for its decision.&lt;ref name=HKSAR/&gt;{{rp|Article 45}}

===India===
The [[President of India|president]], judges including chief justice of [[Supreme Court of India|supreme court]] and high courts can be impeached by the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] before the expiry of the term for violation of the Constitution. Other than impeachment, no other penalty can be given to a president in position for the violation of the Constitution under [[s:Constitution of India/Part XIX|Article 361]] of the constitution. However a president after his term/removal can be punished for his already proven unlawful activity under [[Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971|disrespecting constitution]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prevention of Insults to National Honour (Amendment) Act of 1971|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/pdf/Prevention_Insults_National_Honour_Act1971.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; No president has faced impeachment proceedings. Hence, the provisions for impeachment have never been tested. The president in position cannot be charged and needs to step down in order for that to happen.

===Iran===
The [[Assembly of Experts]] can impeach the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] and appoint a new one, although the Supreme Leader elects half the Assembly.

The [[President of Iran]] can be impeached jointly by the members of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran|Assembly (Majlis)]] and the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]. A new presidential election is then triggered. [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], Iran's first president, was impeached in June 1981 and removed from the office. [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]] was elected as the new president.

Cabinet ministers can be impeached by the members of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran|Assembly]]. Presidential appointment of a new minister is subject to a parliamentary [[vote of confidence]]. Impeachment of ministers has been a fairly commonly used tactic in the power struggle between the president and the assembly during the last several governments.

===Ireland===
{{anchor|Ireland}}{{anchor|Republic of Ireland}}In the [[Republic of Ireland]] formal impeachment only applies to the [[President of Ireland|Irish president]]. Article 12 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]] provides that, unless judged to be "permanently incapacitated" by the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], the president can only be removed from office by the houses of the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) and only for the commission of "stated misbehaviour". Either house of the Oireachtas may impeach the president, but only by a resolution approved by a majority of at least two-thirds of its total number of members; and a house may not consider a proposal for impeachment unless requested to do so by at least thirty of its number.

Where one house impeaches the president, the remaining house either investigates the charge or commissions another body or committee to do so. The investigating house can remove the president if it decides, by at least a two-thirds majority of its members, both that the president is guilty of the charge, and that the charge is sufficiently serious as to warrant the president's removal. To date no impeachment of an Irish president has ever taken place. The president holds a largely ceremonial office, the dignity of which is considered important, so it is likely that a president would resign from office long before undergoing formal conviction or impeachment.

The Republic's Constitution and law also provide that only a joint resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas may remove a judge. Although often referred to as the "impeachment" of a judge, this procedure does not technically involve impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004843561|title=LOCK HIM UP : impeachments in the united states.|last=DON.|first=RILEY,|date=2017|publisher=LULU COM|isbn=9781365960857|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1004843561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In Italy, according to Article 90 of the Constitution, the President of the Republic can be impeached through a majority vote of the Parliament in joint session for high treason and for attempting to overthrow the Constitution. If impeached, the President of the Republic is then tried by the Constitutional Court integrated with sixteen citizens older than forty chosen by lot from a list compiled by the Parliament every nine years.

Italian press and political forces made use of the term "impeachment" for the attempt by some members of parliamentary opposition to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 90 against Presidents [[Francesco Cossiga]] (1991),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/13/world/president-of-italy-is-making-political-waves.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Napolitano]] (2014)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics/italy-parliament-rejects-bid-to-impeach-president-napolitano-idUSBREA1A0VH20140211&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sergio Mattarella]] (2018)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/world/europe/italy-sergio-mattarella-carlo-cottarelli.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liechtenstein===
Members of the Liechtenstein Government can be impeached before the State Court for breaches of the Constitution or of other laws.&lt;ref name=liechtensteinConstitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/liechtenstein-constitution.pdf |title=Constitution of the Principality of Liechtenstein |publisher=Legal Service of the Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein |website=hrlibrary.umn.edu |date=2003 |accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Article 62}} As a [[hereditary monarchy]] the [[Monarchy of Liechtenstein|Sovereign Prince]] can not be impeached as he "is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts and does not have legal responsibility".&lt;ref name=liechtensteinConstitution/&gt;{{rp|Article 7}} The same is true of any member of the [[House of Liechtenstein|Princely House]] who exercises the function of head of state should the Prince be temporarily prevented or in preparation for the Succession.&lt;ref name=liechtensteinConstitution/&gt;{{rp|Article 7}}

===Lithuania===
In the [[Republic of Lithuania]], the President may be impeached by a three-fifths majority in the [[Seimas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/home/Konstitucija/Constitution.htm|accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Rolandas Paksas]] was removed from office by impeachment on April 6, 2004 after the [[Constitutional Court of Lithuania]] found him guilty of having violated his oath and the constitution. He was the first European [[head of state]] to have been impeached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lithuanian Parliament Removes Country's President After Casting Votes on Three Charges|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/07/world/lithuanian-parliament-removes-country-s-president-after-casting-votes-three.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 7, 2004|accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{Main|Impeachment (Norway)}}

Members of government, representatives of the national assembly (Stortinget) and Supreme Court judges can be impeached for criminal offenses tied to their duties and committed in office, according to the Constitution of 1814, §§ 86 and 87. The procedural rules were modeled after the US rules and are quite similar to them. Impeachment has been used eight times since 1814, last in 1927. Many argue that impeachment has fallen into [[desuetude]]. In cases of impeachment, an appointed court (Riksrett) takes effect.

===Pakistan===
The country's ruling coalition said on August 7, 2008, that it would seek the impeachment of [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]], alleging the U.S.-backed former general had "eroded the trust of the nation" and increasing pressure on him to resign. He resigned on August 18, 2008. Another kind of impeachment in Pakistan is known as the vote of less-confidence or vote of mis-understanding and has been practiced by provincial assemblies to weaken the national assembly.

Impeaching a president requires a two-thirds majority support of lawmakers in a joint session of both houses of Parliament.

===Philippines===
{{main|Impeachment in the Philippines}}
Impeachment in the Philippines follows procedures similar to the [[United States]]. Under Sections 2 and 3, Article XI, [[Constitution of the Philippines]], the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]] has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment against the [[President of the Philippines|President]], [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]], members of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], members of the Constitutional Commissions ([[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]], [[Civil Service Commission (Philippines)|Civil Service Commission]] and the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]]), and the [[Philippine Ombudsman|Ombudsman]]. When a third of its membership has endorsed the impeachment articles, it is then transmitted to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] which tries and decide, as impeachment tribunal, the impeachment case.&lt;ref name="Article XI"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.chanrobles.com/article11.htm|title= The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines - Article XI|accessdate= 2008-07-25|author= Chan-Robles Virtual Law Library|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A main difference from US proceedings however is that only one third of House members are required to approve the motion to impeach the President (as opposed to a simple majority of those present and voting in their US counterpart). In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the Senators act as judges with the Senate President presiding over the proceedings (the Chief Justice jointly presides with the Senate President if the President is on trial). Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two thirds (i.e. 16 of 24 members) of all the Members of the Senate vote in favor of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.

====Impeachable offenses and officials====
The 1987 Philippine Constitution says the grounds for impeachment include culpable violation of the Constitution, bribery, [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and corruption, and betrayal of public trust. These offenses are considered "high crimes and misdemeanors" under the Philippine Constitution.

The President, Vice President, Supreme Court justices, and members of the Constitutional Commission and Ombudsman are all considered impeachable officials under the Constitution.

====Impeachment proceedings and attempts====
President [[Joseph Estrada]] was the first official [[Trial of Joseph Estrada|impeached]] by the House in 2000, but the trial ended prematurely due to outrage over a vote to open an envelope where that motion was narrowly defeated by his allies. Estrada was deposed days later during the [[2001 EDSA Revolution]].

In 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, impeachment complaints were filed against President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], but none of the cases reached the required endorsement of 1/3 of the members for transmittal to, and trial by, the Senate.

In March 2011, the House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Merceditas Gutierrez|impeached]] [[Ombudsman of the Philippines|Ombudsman]] [[Merceditas Gutierrez]], becoming the second person to be impeached. In April, Gutierrez resigned prior to the Senate's convening as an impeachment court.

In December 2011, in what was described as "blitzkrieg fashion", 188 of the 285 members of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] [[Impeachment of Renato Corona|voted]] to transmit the 56-page [[Articles of Impeachment against Chief Justice Renato Corona|Articles of Impeachment]] against [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Renato Corona]].

To date, three officials had been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives, and two were not convicted. The latter, [[Renato Corona|Chief Justice Renato C. Corona]], on May 29, 2012 has been convicted by the Senate guilty under Article II of the Articles of Impeachment (of betraying public trust), with 20-3 votes from the Senator Judges.

===Poland===
In Polish law there is no impeachment procedure defined, as it is present in the other countries. Infringements of the law can be investigated only by special Parliament's Committee or (if accusations involve people holding the highest offices of state) by the [[State Tribunal (Poland)|State Tribunal]]. The State Tribunal is empowered to rule for the removal of individuals from public office but it is not a common practice.

===Romania===
The [[President of Romania|President]] can be impeached by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] and is then suspended. A referendum then follows to determine whether the suspended President should be removed from office. President [[Traian Băsescu]] was impeached twice by the Parliament: in 2007 and more recently in July 2012. [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2007|A referendum was held]] on May 19, 2007 and a large majority of the electorate voted against removing the president from office. For the most recent suspension [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2012|a referendum was held]] on July 29, 2012, but was invalidated due to low turnout, however the results were heavily against the president (&lt;ref&gt;[[:ro:Referendumul pentru demiterea președintelui României, 2012]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2017}})

===Russia===
The [[President of Russia]] can be impeached if both the [[State Duma]] (which initiates the impeachment process through the formation of a special investigation committee) and the [[Federation Council of Russia]] vote by a two-thirds majority in favor of impeachment and, additionally, the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation|Supreme Court]] finds the President guilty of [[treason]] or a similarly heavy crime against the nation and the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation|Constitutional Court]] confirms that the constitutional procedure of the impeachment process was correctly observed. In 1995&amp;ndash;1999, the Duma made several attempts to impeach then-President [[Boris Yeltsin]], but they never had a sufficient number of votes for the process to reach the Federation Council.

===South Korea (Republic of Korea)===
{{See also|Impeachment of Park Geun-hye}}
According to the Article 65 Clause 1 of [[Constitution of South Korea]], if President, Prime Minister, or other state council members including Supreme Court and Constitutional court members, violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them. Clause 2 states the impeachment bill may be proposed by one third or more of the total members of the National Assembly, and shall require majority voting and approved by two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly. This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising his power until the impeachment has been adjudicated and shall not extend further than removal from public office. Provided, That it shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability.

Two presidents have been impeached since the foundation of the Sixth Republic of Korea and adoption of the new [[Constitution of South Korea]] in 1987. [[Roh Moo-hyun]] in 2004 was impeached by the National Assembly but was overturned by the Constitutional Court. [[Park Geun-hye]] in 2016 was impeached by the National Assembly, and the impeachment was confirmed by the Constitutional Court on March 10, 2017.

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], according to the [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]], impeachment of the president or the vice president by the [[Legislative Yuan]] shall be initiated upon the proposal of more than one-half of the total members of the Legislative Yuan and passed by more than two-thirds of the total members of the Legislative Yuan, whereupon it shall be presented to the grand justices of the [[Judicial Yuan]] for adjudication.

===Ukraine===
During the crisis which started in November 2013, the increasing political stress of the face-down between the protestors occupying Independence Square in Kiev and the State Security forces under the control of [[President Yanukovych]] led to deadly armed force being used on the protestors. Following the negotiated return of Kiev's City Hall on February 16, 2014, occupied by the protesters since November 2013, the security forces thought they could also retake "Maidan", Independence Square. The ensuing fighting from 17 through 21 February 2014 resulted in a considerable number of deaths and a more generalised alienation of the population, and the withdrawal of President Yanukovych to his support area in the East of Ukraine.
 
In the wake of the President's departure, Parliament convened on February 22; it reinstated the 2004 Constitution, which reduced Presidential authority, and voted impeachment of President Yanukovych as ''[[de facto]]'' recognition of his departure from office as President of an integrated Ukraine. The President riposted that Parliament's acts were illegal as they could pass into law only by Presidential signature.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]] anybody may be prosecuted and tried by the two Houses of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for any crime.&lt;ref name=UK0001 &gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02666|title=Standard Note SN/PC/2666: Impeachment|format=PDF|last=Gay|first=Oonagh|date=November 30, 2004|publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Library|accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded impeachment is that of [[William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer]] during the [[Good Parliament]] of 1376. The last was that of [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]] in 1806.&lt;ref name=UK0001 /&gt;

====Procedure====
The [[House of Commons]] holds the power to impeach. Any member may make an accusation of any crime. The member must support the charge with evidence and [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|move]] for impeachment. If the Commons carries the motion, the mover receives orders to go to the bar at the [[House of Lords]] and to impeach the accused "in the name of the House of Commons, and all the commons of the United Kingdom."

The mover must tell the Lords that the House of Commons will, in due time, exhibit particular articles against the accused, and make good the same. The Commons then usually selects a committee to draw up the charges and create an "Article of Impeachment" for each. (In the case of [[Warren Hastings]], however, the drawing up of the articles preceded the formal impeachment.) Once the committee has delivered the articles to the Lords, replies go between the accused and the Commons via the Lords. If the Commons have impeached a peer, the Lords take custody of the accused; otherwise, custody goes to [[Black Rod#Black Rod in the United Kingdom|Black Rod]]. The accused remains in custody unless the Lords allow bail. The Lords set a date for the trial while the Commons appoints managers, who act as prosecutors in the trial. The accused may defend by counsel.

The House of Lords hears the case. The procedure used to be that the [[Lord Chancellor]] presided (or the [[Lord High Steward]] if the defendant was a [[peerage|peer]]); but this was when the Lord Chancellor was both the Lords' presiding officer and head of the judiciary of England and Wales. Since both these roles were removed from that office by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], which created the [[Lord Speaker]] to preside over the Lords and made the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] head of the judiciary, it is not certain who would preside over an impeachment trial today. If Parliament is not in session, then the trial is conducted by a "Court of the Lord High Steward" instead of the House of Lords (even if the defendant is not a peer). The differences between this court and the House of Lords are that in the House all of the peers are judges of both law and fact, whereas in the Court the Lord High Steward is the sole judge of law and the peers decide the facts only; and the bishops are not entitled to sit and vote in the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-419.htm ''Commentaries on the Laws of England,] [[William Blackstone]], vol. 4 chapter 19 (1769)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, peers would wear their parliamentary robes during the hearings.

The hearing resembles an ordinary trial: both sides may call witnesses and present evidence. At the end of the hearing the lords vote on the verdict, which is decided by a simple majority, one charge at a time. Upon being called, a peer must rise and declare "guilty, upon my honour" or "not guilty, upon my honour". After voting on all of the articles has taken place, and if the Lords find the defendant guilty, the Commons may move for judgment; the Lords may not declare the punishment until the Commons have so moved. The Lords may then decide whatever punishment they find fit, within the law. A royal [[pardon]] cannot excuse the defendant from trial, but a pardon may reprieve a convicted defendant. However, a pardon cannot override a decision to remove the defendant from the public office they hold.

====History====

Parliament has held the power of impeachment since medieval times. Originally, the House of Lords held that impeachment could apply only to members of the [[peerage]], as the nobility (the Lords) would try their own peers, while commoners ought to try their peers (other commoners) in a [[jury]]. However, in 1681, the Commons declared that they had the right to impeach anyone, and the Lords have respected this resolution. Offices held "during good behaviour" are terminable by the writ of either ''[[quo warranto]]''&lt;ref&gt;eg. [[R v Richardson]]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[scire facias]]'', which has even been employed by and against well-placed judges.&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Berger, ''Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems'' p. 132 (1974, Harvard University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reign of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], impeachment fell into disuse, the [[bill of attainder]] becoming the preferred form of dealing with undesirable subjects of the Crown. However, during the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] and thereafter, impeachments became more popular, as they did not require the assent of the Crown, while bills of attainder did, thus allowing Parliament to resist royal attempts to dominate Parliament. The most recent cases of impeachment dealt with [[Warren Hastings]], [[Governor-General of India]] between 1773 and 1786 ([[Impeachment of Warren Hastings|impeached in 1788]]; the Lords found him not guilty in 1795), and [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], in 1806 (acquitted). The last attempted impeachment occurred in 1848, when [[David Urquhart]] accused [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] of having signed a secret treaty with [[Imperial Russia]] and of receiving monies from the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar]]. Palmerston survived the vote in the Commons; the Lords did not hear the case.

=====Queen Caroline=====
{{main|Pains and Penalties Bill 1820}}
[[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]], consort of [[George IV of Great Britain|King George IV]], was tried by the House of Commons and acquitted. The process began as impeachment proceedings, but then became a different procedure as a [[bill of attainder|bill of pains and penalties]].

====Modern politics====
The procedure has, over time, become rarely used and some legal authorities (such as [[Halsbury's Laws of England]]) consider it to be probably obsolete. The principles of "responsible government" require that the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and other executive officers answer to Parliament, rather than to the Sovereign. Thus the Commons can remove such an officer through a [[motion of no confidence]] without a long, drawn-out impeachment. However, it is argued by some that the remedy of impeachment remains as part of British constitutional law, and that legislation would be required to abolish it. Furthermore, impeachment as a means of punishment for wrongdoing, as distinct from being a means of removing a minister, remains a valid reason for accepting that it continues to be available, at least in theory.

The Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1967 recommended "that the right to impeach, which has long been in disuse, be now formally abandoned".&lt;ref&gt;"Report from the Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege", HC 34 1967-68 para 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Their recommendation not having been implemented in the meantime, the Select Committee on Privileges in 1977 declared it "to be of continuing validity" and again urged that it be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;"Third report from the Committee of Privileges: Recommendations of the Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege", HC 417 1976-77 para 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before this report was issued, in April 1977 the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]]' annual conference unanimously passed a motion calling on [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[David Steel]] to move for the impeachment of [[Ronald King Murray, Lord Murray|Ronald King Murray]] QC, the [[Lord Advocate]], over his handling of the [[Patrick Meehan]] miscarriage of justice affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liberals confident of victory on petrol duty |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=April 11, 1977 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel did not move any such motion but Murray (now Lord Murray, a former [[List of Senators of the College of Justice|Senator of the College of Justice]] of Scotland) agreed that the power still existed.

The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1999 noted the previous recommendations to formally abandon the power impeachment, and stated that "The circumstances in which impeachment has taken place are now so remote from the present that the procedure may be considered obsolete".&lt;ref&gt;"Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege report", HC 214 1998-99, para 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, on August 25, 2004, [[Plaid Cymru]] MP [[Adam Price]] announced his [[Impeach Blair campaign|intention to move for the impeachment]] of [[Tony Blair]] for his role in involving Britain in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He asked the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] [[Peter Hain]] whether he would confirm that the power to impeach was still available, reminding Hain that as President of the Young Liberals he had supported the attempted impeachment of Murray. Hain responded by quoting the 1999 Joint Committee's report, and the advice of the Clerk of the House of Commons that impeachment "effectively died with the advent of full responsible Parliamentary government".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040909/debtext/40909-08.htm#40909-08_spnew15 Hansard]'' HC 6ser vol 424 col 871.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[election court]] has some of the powers associated with impeachment cases in other countries, and can remove elected officials from office in the case of [[electoral fraud]]. [[Lutfur Rahman (politician)|Lutfur Rahman]] was the [[directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets]], in London until he was removed from office for breaching electoral rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tower Hamlets election fraud mayor Lutfur Rahman removed from office|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32428648|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Impeachment in the United States}}

[[File:Senate in session.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The impeachment trial of President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999, Chief Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] presiding. The House managers are seated beside the quarter-circular tables on the left and the president's personal counsel on the right, much in the fashion of [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|President Andrew Johnson's trial]].]]
Similar to the British system, [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] gives the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment and the Senate the sole power to try impeachments of [[Officer of the United States|officers of the U.S. federal government]]. (Various [[U.S. state|state]] constitutions include similar measures, allowing the state legislature to impeach the governor or other officials of the state government.) In contrast to the British system, in the United States impeachment is only the first of two stages, and conviction during the second stage requires "the concurrence of two thirds of the members present."&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. Constitution. Article I, § 3, clause 6|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impeachment does not necessarily result in removal from office; it is only a legal statement of charges, parallel to an [[indictment]] in [[criminal law]]. An official who is impeached faces a second legislative vote (whether by the same body or another), which determines conviction, or failure to convict, on the charges embodied by the impeachment. Most constitutions require a [[supermajority]] to convict. Although the subject of the charge is criminal action, it does not constitute a criminal trial; the only question under consideration is the removal of the individual from office, and the possibility of a subsequent vote preventing the removed official from ever again holding political office in the jurisdiction where he or she was removed. Impeachment with respect to political office should not be confused with [[witness impeachment]].

====Impeachable offenses====
The Constitution defines impeachment at the federal level and limits impeachment to "The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States" who may be impeached and removed only for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors".&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleii.html#section4 U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Several commentators have suggested that [[United States Congress|Congress]] alone may decide for itself what constitutes a "high crime or misdemeanor", especially since ''[[Nixon v. United States]]'' stated that the Supreme Court did not have the authority to determine whether the Senate properly "tried" a defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1970, then-[[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] [[Gerald R. Ford]] defined the criterion as he saw it: "An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ford.utexas.edu/LIBRARY/speeches/700415f.htm Gerald Ford's Remarks on the Impeachment of Supreme Court Justice William Douglas, April 15, 1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713115859/http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/speeches/700415f.htm |date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Officials subject to impeachment====
The central question regarding the Constitutional dispute about the impeachment of members of the legislature is whether members of Congress are officers of the United States. The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach "The President, the Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States."&lt;ref name="law.cornell.edu"/&gt; It has been suggested that members of Congress are not officers of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YvtLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA486&amp;lpg=PA486&amp;dq=%22members+of+Congress+are+not+officers+of+the+United+States%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22members%20of%20Congress%20are%20not%20officers%20of%20the%20United%20States%22|title=Principles of the Constitutional Law of the United States|last=Willoughby|first=Westel Woodbury|date=1917|publisher=Baker, Voorhis &amp; Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, believe that members are civil officers and are subject to impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=04naCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3196&amp;dq=%22members+of+Congress+are+officers+of+the+United+States%22+and+subject+to+impeachment#v=onepage&amp;q=%22members%20of%20Congress%20are%20officers%20of%20the%20United%20States%22%20and%20subject%20to%20impeachment|title=American International Law Cases: Fourth series|last=Oceana|date=2007|publisher=Oceana|isbn=9780195372892|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Representatives impeached Senator [[William Blount]] in 1798,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm#4 Senate List of Impeachment trials] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uplUoEZt?url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm |date=December 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in his expulsion. However, after initially hearing his impeachment, charges were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wxx-6rwQCe8C&amp;dq=%22the+first+impeachment%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 |title=The First Impeachment |author=Buckner F. Milton |year=1998 |publisher=Mercer University Press |isbn=9780865545977}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} Left unsettled was the question whether members of Congress were civil officers of the United States. The House has not impeached a Member of Congress since Blount. As each House has the authority to expel its own members without involving the other chamber, expulsion has been the method used for removing Members of Congress.

[[Jefferson's Manual]], which is integral to the Rules of the House of Representatives,&lt;ref&gt;House Rules {{cite web|url=http://www.rules.house.gov/house_rules_precedents.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212085230/http://www.rules.house.gov/house_rules_precedents.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that impeachment is set in motion by charges made on the floor, charges proferred by a memorial, a member's resolution referred to a committee, a message from the president, or from facts developed and reported by an investigating committee of the House. It further states that a proposition to impeach is a question of high privilege in the House and at once supersedes business otherwise in order under the rules governing the order of business.

====Process====
At the federal level, the impeachment process is a two-step procedure. The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] must first pass, by a simple majority of those present and voting, articles of impeachment, which constitute the formal allegation or allegations. Upon passage, the defendant has been "impeached". Next, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] tries the accused. In the case of the impeachment of a president, the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] presides over the proceedings. For the impeachment of any other official, the Constitution is silent on who shall preside, suggesting that this role falls to the Senate's usual presiding officer, the President of the Senate who is also the [[Vice President of the United States]].

In theory at least, as President of the Senate, the [[Vice President of the United States]] could preside over their own impeachment, although legal theories suggest that allowing a defendant to be the judge in their own case would be a blatant [[conflict of interest]]. If the Vice President did not preside over an impeachment (of anyone besides the President), the duties would fall to the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]].

To convict an accused, "the concurrence of two thirds of the members present" is required.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt; Conviction removes the defendant from office. Following conviction, the Senate may vote to further punish the individual by barring him or her from holding future federal office, elected or appointed. Conviction by the Senate does not bar criminal prosecution. Even after an accused has left office, it is possible to disqualify the person from future office or from certain emoluments of his prior office (such as a pension). If there is no charge for which a [[two-thirds majority]] of the senators present vote "guilty", the defendant is acquitted and no punishment is imposed.

====History of federal impeachment proceedings in the United States====
Congress regards impeachment as a power to be used only in extreme cases; the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has initiated impeachment proceedings only 64 times since 1789 (most recently the 2010 impeachment, then removal from office, of Judge [[Thomas Porteous]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]]) with only the following 19 of these proceedings actually resulting in the House's passing Articles of Impeachment:

* Two presidents:
** [[Andrew Johnson]], Democrat/National Union, was [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeached]] on  February 24, 1868, by the House of Representatives after violating the newly created [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]] by a  126 to 47 vote. President Johnson was acquitted by the Senate, which voted 35–19 in favor of conviction, falling one vote short of the necessary two-thirds needed to remove him from office. The Tenure of Office Act would later be found unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in [[obiter dictum|dicta]].
** [[Bill Clinton]], Democrat, was [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] on December 19, 1998, by the House of Representatives on articles charging [[perjury]] (specifically, lying to a federal [[grand jury]]) by a 228–206 vote and [[obstruction of justice]] by a 221–212 vote. The House rejected other articles: one was a count of [[perjury]] in a civil deposition in [[Paula Jones]]' [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit against Clinton (by a 205–229 vote), the second accused Clinton of [[abuse of power]] (by a 148–285 vote). President Clinton was acquitted by the Senate. The votes to remove him from office fell short of the necessary two-thirds: 45–55 on obstruction of justice and 50–50 on perjury.
* [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|Impeachment proceedings]] against [[Richard Nixon]] were referred to the full House of Representatives for consideration and ended with his resignation.
* In 1876, [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] officer [[William W. Belknap]] (former Secretary of War), resigned before his trial and was later acquitted. Allegedly, most of those who voted to acquit him believed that his resignation had removed their jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* One [[United States Senate|Senator]], [[William Blount]], in 1797. He was expelled by the Senate, which declined to try the impeachment. This established the precedent that Members of Congress are not subject to impeachment, as they can be removed by action of the House of which they are members without impeachment or any other action being necessary.
* One Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], [[Samuel Chase]], impeached in 1804, was acquitted by the Senate.
* Fourteen&lt;!-- Fourteen includes Thomas Porteous, please don't increase this number unless and until another judge is impeached. --&gt; other [[federal judge]]s. Eight of these have been convicted by the Senate and removed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Impeachment|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/impeach.html |title=Impeachment History|website= Infoplease|accessdate= 2013-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Alcee Hastings]], who was impeached and convicted in 1989 for taking over $150,000 in bribe money in exchange for sentencing leniency. The Senate did not bar Hastings from holding future office, and Hastings won election to the House of Representatives in Florida. Hastings' name was mentioned as a possible Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence but was passed over by House Speaker-designate [[Nancy Pelosi]], presumably because of his previous impeachment and removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm |title=U.S. Senate: 1 Briefing on Impeachment |publisher=Senate.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uplUoEZt?url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Impeachment_Role.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State governors====
Three state governors  have been impeached and removed from office:
* [[Jack C. Walton]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Governor of Oklahoma]], was impeached for a variety of crimes including illegal collection of campaign funds, padding the public payroll, suspension of habeas corpus, excessive use of the pardon power, and general incompetence. In November 1923, Walton was convicted and removed from office.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, Larry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2062">The '''Jewish poll tax''' ({{lang-pl|poglówne żydowskie}}) was a [[poll tax]] imposed on the [[Jews]] in [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was later absorbed into the ''[[hiberna]]'' tax. &lt;ref name=scep&gt;''Scepter of Judah: The Jewish Autonomy in the Eighteenth-Century Crown Poland'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=1fGQfpMdp84C&amp;pg=PA15 pp. 15-16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=camb&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture, p. 118 ([https://www.scribd.com/document/245942663/The-Cambridge-Dictionary-of-Judaism-and-Jewish-Culture browse for "skhumot" online])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jews were exempt from other state and municipal taxes, which often caused protests from Polish city dwellers.&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;

Initially the collection of the tax was a duty of Jewish Councils ([[Council of Four Lands]], [[Council of the Land of Lithuania]]). Sometimes it was paid to the royal treasury, other times in was paid directly to the military units funded from this tax.&lt;ref name=camb/&gt;

The Jewish councils divide the tax into smaller internal divisions called "portions" (Hebrew: ''skhumot'', Polish: ''sympla'').&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;&lt;ref name=camb/&gt; The sum of the portions was always larger than the state-imposed amount, and the council used the surplus for the needs of Jewish community and the council apparatus. This practice was common for non-Jewish taxes as well,  and the Crown was aware of it.&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;

By early 17th century the duty of Jewish poll tax was transferred to ''[[sejmik]]s'', later to Polish military, and by mid-17th century it was absorbed into the ''hiberna''.&lt;ref name=scep/&gt;

It is the most severe sentence imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils, which also impose lesser sanctions such as fines or public shaming. According to a 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' report describing the increasing importance of customary law in Indonesia since 1998, "in a society where the entire cycle of life and religion is tied to ancestral villages, kasepekang is likened to a social and spiritual death sentence."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7935">In a [[Theory of relativity|relativistic theory]] of [[physics]], a '''Lorentz scalar''' is an expression, formed from items of the theory, which evaluates to a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], [[invariant (physics)|invariant]] under any [[Lorentz transformation]]. A Lorentz scalar may be generated from e.g., the scalar product of vectors, or from contracting tensors of the theory. While the components of vectors and tensors are in general altered under Lorentz transformations, Lorentz scalars remain unchanged.

A Lorentz scalar is not always immediately seen to be an invariant scalar in the [[Scalar (mathematics)|mathematical sense]], but the resulting scalar value is invariant under any basis transformation applied to the vector space, on which the considered theory is based. A simple Lorentz scalar in [[Minkowski spacetime]] is the ''spacetime distance'' ("length" of their difference) of two fixed events in spacetime. While the "position"-4-vectors of the events change between different inertial frames, their spacetime distance remains invariant under the corresponding Lorentz transformation. Other examples of Lorentz scalars are the "length" of 4-velocities (see below), or the [[Ricci curvature]] in a point in spacetime from [[General relativity]], which is a contraction of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] there.

==Simple scalars in special relativity==

===The length of a position vector===

[[Image:Fermi walker 1.png|frame|left|World lines for two particles at different speeds.]]
In [[special relativity]] the location of a particle in 4-dimensional [[spacetime]] is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; x^{\mu} = (ct, \mathbf{x} )&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v} t &lt;/math&gt; is the position in 3-dimensional space of the particle, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in 3-dimensional space and &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].

The "length" of the vector is a Lorentz scalar and is given by

:&lt;math&gt; x_{\mu} x^{\mu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} x^{\mu} x^{\nu} =  (ct)^2 -  \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  (c\tau)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the proper time as measured by a clock in the rest frame of the particle and the [[Minkowski metric]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu\nu} =\eta_{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a time-like metric.

Often the alternate signature of the [[Minkowski metric]] is used in which the signs of the ones are reversed.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu\nu} =\eta_{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a space-like metric.

In the Minkowski metric the space-like interval &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; x_{\mu} x^{\mu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} x^{\mu} x^{\nu} =   \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x} - (ct)^2 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  s^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

We use the space-like Minkowski metric in the rest of this article.

===The length of a velocity vector===

[[Image:Fermi walker 2.png|frame|left|The velocity vectors in spacetime for a particle at two different speeds. In relativity an acceleration is equivalent to a rotation in spacetime]]

The velocity in spacetime is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; v^{\mu} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {dx^{\mu} \over d\tau} = \left (c {dt \over d\tau},  { dt \over d\tau}{d\mathbf{x} \over dt} \right ) =  \left ( \gamma c,  \gamma { \mathbf{v} }  \right ) = \gamma \left (  c, { \mathbf{v} }  \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   { 1 \over {\sqrt {1 - {{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} } \over c^2} } } } &lt;/math&gt;.

The magnitude of the 4-velocity is a Lorentz scalar,

:&lt;math&gt; v_{\mu} v^{\mu} = -c^2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, c is a Lorentz scalar.

===The inner product of acceleration and velocity===

The 4-acceleration is given by

:&lt;math&gt; a^{\mu} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {dv^{\mu} \over d\tau} &lt;/math&gt;.

The 4-acceleration is always perpendicular to the 4-velocity

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = {1 \over 2} {d \over d\tau} \left ( v_{\mu}v^{\mu} \right ) = {d v_{\mu} \over d\tau}  v^{\mu} = a_{\mu} v^{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, we can regard acceleration in spacetime as simply a rotation of the 4-velocity. The inner product of the acceleration and the velocity is a Lorentz scalar and is zero. This rotation is simply an expression of energy conservation:

:&lt;math&gt; {d E \over d\tau} = \mathbf{F} \cdot { \mathbf{v}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a particle and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt; is the 3-force on the particle.

==Energy, rest mass, 3-momentum, and 3-speed from 4-momentum==

The 4-momentum of a particle is

:&lt;math&gt; p^{\mu} = m v^{\mu} =   \left ( \gamma m c,  \gamma {  m \mathbf{v} }  \right ) = \left ( \gamma m c,   {   \mathbf{p} }  \right ) = \left ( {E \over c } ,   {   \mathbf{p} }  \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; is the particle rest mass, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} &lt;/math&gt; is the momentum in 3-space, and

:&lt;math&gt; E = \gamma m c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

is the energy of the particle.

===Measurement of the energy of a particle===

Consider a second particle with 4-velocity &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and a 3-velocity &lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{u}_2 &lt;/math&gt;. In the rest frame of the second particle the inner product of &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the energy of the first particle

:&lt;math&gt; p_{\mu} u^{\mu} = -  { E_1}  &lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript 1 indicates the first particle.

Since the relationship is true in the rest frame of the second particle, it is true in any reference frame. &lt;math&gt; E_1 &lt;/math&gt;, the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle, is a Lorentz scalar. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;  { E_1} =  \gamma_1 \gamma_2 m_1 c^2 - \gamma_2 \mathbf{p}_1 \cdot \mathbf{u}_2  &lt;/math&gt;

in any inertial reference frame, where &lt;math&gt;  E_1 &lt;/math&gt; is still the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle .

===Measurement of the rest mass of the particle===

In the rest frame of the particle the inner product of the momentum is

:&lt;math&gt; p_{\mu} p^{\mu} = - (mc)^2  \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the rest mass (m) is a Lorentz scalar. The relationship remains true independent of the frame in which the inner product is calculated.
In many cases the rest mass is written as &lt;math&gt; m_{0} &lt;/math&gt; to avoid confusion with the relativistic mass, which is &lt;math&gt; \gamma m_{0} &lt;/math&gt;

===Measurement of the 3-momentum of the particle===

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;  \left ( p_{\mu} u^{\mu} /c \right )  ^2  + p_{\mu} p^{\mu} = { E_1^2 \over c^2 } -(mc)^2 = \left ( \gamma_1^2 -1 \right ) (mc)^2 = \gamma_1^2 { {\mathbf{v}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_1 } }m^2 = \mathbf{p}_1 \cdot \mathbf{p}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The square of the magnitude of the 3-momentum of the particle as measured in the frame of the second particle is a Lorentz scalar.

===Measurement of the 3-speed of the particle===

The 3-speed, in the frame of the second particle, can be constructed from two Lorentz scalars

:&lt;math&gt; v_1^2 = \mathbf{v}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_1  = { { \mathbf{p}_1 \cdot \mathbf{p}_1 c^4 } \over  { E_1^2  } } &lt;/math&gt;.

==More complicated scalars==

Scalars may also be constructed from the tensors and vectors, from the contraction of tensors (such as &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;), or combinations of contractions of tensors and vectors (such as &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}x^{\mu}x^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;).

'''Mathematical exposure modeling''' is an indirect method of determining [[exposure assessment|exposure]], particularly for human exposure to [[pollution|environmental contaminants]].  It is useful when direct measurement of pollutant concentration is not feasible because direct measurement sometimes requires skilled professionals and complex, expensive laboratory equipment.  The ability to make inferences in the absence of direct measurements, makes exposure modeling a powerful tool for predicting exposures by exploring hypothetical situations.  It allows researchers to ask [[sensitivity analysis|"what if"]] questions about exposure scenarios.

== Modeling indoor air ==

Mathematical modeling is commonly used to determine human exposure to indoor air pollution.  Studies have shown that humans spend about 90% of their time indoors, and contaminant levels may be as high or higher inside than outside, due to the presence of multiple indoor contaminant sources, in combination with poor ventilation.  Indoor air modeling requires information on a number of parameters including the air exchange rate, [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition rate]], source emission rate, and physical volume of the indoor setting.  Indoor environments can basically be thought of as [[closed systems]], so models describing them are usually based on the "[[mass balance]]" equation.  It is also assumed that a pollutant emitted into an indoor environment instantly spreads uniformly throughout the system, so that the concentration is the same at any point in space at any point in time.  Mathematically, the total pollutant mass emitted inside a chamber during time T can be expressed as&lt;br&gt;
::G&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{T} g(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::G&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = total mass contributed by the source over time T (e.g., mg)
::g(t) = emission flow rate as a function of time t (e.g., mg/min)

The total mass lost during time T can be expressed as&lt;br&gt;
::Q&lt;sub&gt;lost&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{T} wx(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::Q&lt;sub&gt;lost&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = total mass lost from the chamber over time T (e.g., mg)
::x(t) = concentration of pollutant in the air exiting the chamber (e.g., mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
::w = flow rate of air exiting the chamber (e.g., m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min)

Following the principle of the "mass balance" equation, the total mass in the chamber at time T, is the difference between the two equations above, mass generated during time T minus mass lost during time T.  This value may also be calculated from the equation&lt;br&gt;
::Total mass inside the chamber at time T = vx(T)

== Modeling human exposure to air pollution ==
There are two critical pieces of information that are needed to calculate human exposure.  These include data on 1) the whereabouts of the individual or individuals being exposed and 2) the concentration of the pollutants in the different locations.  This can be expressed mathematically as the sum of the products of time spent by a person in those different locations by the time-averaged [[air pollutant concentrations]] occurring in those locations.&lt;br&gt;
::E&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^m&lt;/math&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;''pi''&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;''pi''&lt;/sub&gt;
:where
::T&lt;sub&gt;''pi''&lt;/sub&gt; is the time spent by person ''p'' in microenvironment ''i'', and C&lt;sub&gt;''pi''&lt;/sub&gt; is the concentration of the air pollutant that person ''p'' experiences in microenvironment ''i'', E&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the integrated exposure for person ''p'' and ''m'' is the number of different microenvironments.

As mentioned above, knowing the whereabouts of the individual or individuals, is very important when trying to determine air pollution exposure.  In the absence of data obtained from direct observation, human activity pattern data may be used.  This data can be found in several reports conducted by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].  The data was collected through the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), and contains a representative cross-section of 24-hour daily activity patterns.  This data can be used to create inhalation exposure models which can serve as useful public health tools for [[epidemiology]], education, intervention, [[risk assessment]], and creation of air quality guidelines.

Romanian [[conceptual art]]ist, [[poet]], [[List of essayists|essayist]]. A gifted colorist in his first paintings, he became more attracted towards experimenting with various forms and materials. Familiar with the rural wood culture, he intended to follow in the footsteps of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Constantin Brâncuşi]], combining the spirit of the local folk culture with the trends of modern and contemporary art. Intending to take further the great sculptor's experience, Olos transformed the spindle-head – a miniature of the nail-less junctions in the architecture of the wooden churches of [[Maramureș|Maramureş]] – into a constructive module for the project of a universal city he called “Olospolis” that he theorized and represented in different forms and materials. While living and working in [[Baia Mare]] – an art center famous for its school of painting – he became first known due to paintings labeled as constructivist and his happenings, being classified among the neo-avangard Romanian artists during the seventies. Even though his first solo show in Rome (1969) had been a success, one of his silver medaled sculptures was included in the [[Tokyo Fuji Art Museum|Fuji Museum]] collection in [[Tokyo]], and his wooden sculptures were appreciated by the American artist and [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] scholar [[Athena Tacha|Athena Tacha Spear]], his real recognition abroad begun with [[Joseph Beuys]]' remarking that he was a 'genuine artist' (“Endlich, ein Künstler!”) when Olos presented his concept of the Universal City and drew his module on a blackboard at one of the Free University seminars in Kassel, in 1977. Consequently, Beuys included the blackboard with the drawing in his “Das Kapital” shown in the main pavilion of the 1980 Venice Biennial. Olos' six month teaching at the “Justus Liebig” University in Giessen, his successful performances, solo shows in Wickstadt and [[Giessen]] and later on in the [[Netherlands]], made him realize that his work and ideas could have a better audience abroad. Thus, also due to the political turmoil in [[Romania]] after 1989, the artist moved his residence in the south-west of [[Germany]], continuing to exhibit in his native and neighboring countries. In the last decade of his life, finally recognizing his importance as an international artist, he was honored in his country of birth with a diploma, an anniversary show in [[Baia Mare]] and another one in the [[Brukenthal National Museum|Brukenthal Contemporary Art Museum]] from [[Sibiu]]. In the autumn following his death, the curators of the [[Timișoara|Timişoara]] 2015 International Art Encounters exhibition showed his work in a special gallery. But only the posthumous extensive exhibition at the [[National Museum of Contemporary Art (Romania)|National Museum of Contemporary Art]], Bucharest (May 2016 - October 2017, curator Călin Dan) offered an insight into the variety, extent, and quality of his work, setting the basis of the future development of his generous, inclusive constructive concept of the Universal City. Reticent to sell during his lifetime, there are still few state (among these about 30 in the Baia Mare Art Museum) and private collections owning his work, the greatest number being still in the possession of the estate curated by Plan B Gallery. The latest art fairs – in Madrid, [[The Armory Show (art fair)|Armory Show]] in New York, [[Art Basel|ArtBasel]] in Switzerland and ArtBasel in Hong Kong – have shown an increase in museums' and collectors' interest in his work, and the 2018 autumn show in [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] workshop at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Pompidou Center]] in Paris will mark the real acknowledgment of the importance of his work.

=== Place, time, and name as markers. Happy Childhood in the village (1940-1953) ===
Mihai Olos's family roots are connected to the picturesque county [[Maramureş]] from north-western Romania. The ethnographic zone of his birthplace [[Ariniș]] (its older name being“Ardihat”) is that of the sub-Codru (sub-forest) zone, connected with the culture of wood. If geographically the village is situated close to the central point of [[Europe]], historically it is on the borders of the ancient [[Dacia]], on the limes (limits or borders) of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] colonization, with some [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] remains still visible in some circular stone crosses still extant also in the churchyard of the artist's birthplace. The recent archaeological discoveries have brought up remains of an important neolithic culture as well. The inhabitants are proud of their noble origins certified in the [[Maramureș|Maramureş]] “Diplomas”, of their contribution to the development of nation building. Their opposition to denationalization during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[Vienna Award|Vienna Diktat]], and, with less success, during the years of the totalitarian regime have to be remembered as well. They are also proud for having contributed to the formation of the national language, with the oldest codex of written language found in a monastery from the region.

Mihai, the second son of a Romanian family, was baptized after his father known as “Mihaiu Florii Vilii” in village because there was an other unrelated family also called Olos.{{efn|This family name is uncommon not only in the region, being at times mistaken for names of Hungarian origin such as “Oros(z)” (Russian), “Ollos” (Shearmen), or “Olasz” (Italian). The label “Mantova-Galizia stramport (sic!)” used to be attached to the family, suggesting that their ancestors had been immigrants of Italian origin, settled in Maramureș during the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. The connection to Galizia becomes plausible when one thinks of the name being quite frequent in nowadays Poland.}} The artist was proud of his father's maternal family being elated to [[Gheorghe Pop de Băsești|George Pop de Băsești]], a politician, vice-president of the Transylvanian National Party at the end of the 19th century. Still, while elaborating his future concept of universal city, he liked to connect his family name to the word's meaning in ancient Greek, i.e. “universal” or “total”.

His mother Ana, coming from the [[Borşa]] family (or clan) of noble origin, was born in [[Crucișor|Poiana Codrului]] (Forest Clearing), in the full of mysteries zone of wood culture. Among the inhabitants of [[Crucișor|Poiana Codrului]] there were also German settlers, employed in the glass factory. His mother's blue eyes and fair hair might suggest also a Germanic ancestry.

Mihai's childhood had started as happily in a still unaltered natural and cultural environment with archaic roots as concerns the organization of the homestead, interior decoration of the home, the authenticity of the household object, customs and faith. A beautiful baby with white skin, dark eyes and curly hair, whom his proud father used to show to those around raising him above his head and boasting with his vigor that showed him older than his real age. They used to give him to brides to hold in order to have as beautiful babies as he.

Since his father was most of the time away selling cattle at fairs, the baby boy spent his time with his mother and in the company of the village women. He saw them at work and witnessed their gatherings where sewing, spinning or other household activities were accompanied by singing, the reciting of folk poetry, the telling of tales. The secret practice of charms and witchcraft was still alive those days. The boy with an excellent memory and beautiful voice learned everything he could from the women and in no time became their favorite, imbued with all their knowledge. From his three years older brother and the village boys he learned their games and the making of hair balls, wooden toys, musical instruments from reed or corn stalks, of tree bark or young offspring, wooden skates or even sleighs a.s.o. His father's being a tradesman influenced him in making rosewater and sell it to the girls in the village. Later on he wrote the girls' letters to their lovers in the army or composed little poems, drew images and texts for their wall-cloths for a modest return. Taking the cattle to the pasture, participating in the farm work from sowing to harvest and the preparation for the next crop, he was also involved in the rural rites around the year. From time to time, when the cattle fair happened to be in their village at crossroads, he was a witness to men's stories, those of the tradesmen coming also from other counties. He learned from them communication skills and the love of conviviality and this whetted his appetite to explore the world.

His early childhood, as he recalled it in his stories, appeared less marked by the war or the experiences of the [[Transylvania|Transylvanian's]] who had to leave their homes during the [[Vienna Award|Vienna Diktat]]. Living in the child 's closed universe, at that time he was unaware of what was happening in the rest of the world. His father hadn't been conscripted to go to war. No one from the family died on the battle fields. The only tragic event he remembered was that one of his uncles coming home from the war died the day after his arrival and his daughter went after him.

The changes in the family's fate came after the war when, according to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement]] the country fell under the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence. The falsified elections from 1946, the installment of a communist government, the forced abdication of the king at the end of 1947, affected the child through their consequences. He remembered his father's loss of all the money he had earned selling cattle, due to the stabilization of currency in 1948. With the family's shaken material status, the two sons had to become their father's helpers in the everyday choirs, whether working in the field or taking care of animals. Going to school and joining the community of the other children from the village came as a compensation. Starting school attendance at six, due to his interest in learning while seeing his elder brother' progress, Mihai became a dedicated pupil, determined to learn an discover all the secrets hidden in the world of books. Even if this period changed his orientation from the traditional multifaceted visual and oral culture towards what McLuhan call “the Gutenberg Galaxy”, the archaic archetypal elements of folk culture and mentality would company alter on the artist in his encounters with the western urban culture.

=== Estrangement from the village. Secondary school in the provincial town of Baia Mare (1953-1956) ===
A radical change in Mihai's life happened on September 11, 1950, when his mother died in childbirth, a death he never forgot. Their father's remarriage came as another shock to the boys and Mihai's elder brother, Vasile, was the first one to run away from home, followed by Mihai in 1953. Without any material support from home, the boys had no right to receive a scholarship because of their father's refusal to join the collective farm in the village. So they had to take their lives in their own hands. Mihai begun to teach private lessons and during the school holidays worked as a courier at the local newspaper. Learning the '''ABC of journalism''', he was sent to the countryside as a cub reporter, meeting various categories of people. This experience served him later on, when writing for the press and giving a theoretical grounding to his theories about art and the concept of the Universal City.

=== A wild interlude – substitute teacher in Oaş&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;(1956-1959) ===
After graduating high-school and with his experience in private tutoring, Mihai applied for a teaching job. The school was in a remote village in [[Oaș Country|Oaş county]], [[Călinești-Oaș|Pășunea Mare]] (Big Pasture). The zone had a specific ethnographic character, with extremely proud people who still practiced the vendetta. The women wore vividly colored skirts and scarves. The men used to wear on the top of their head a little straw hat embellished with beads. They were renowned woodcutters but there was no land good to farm. Poor eaters but great drinkers they wouldn't accept a refusal when they offered a drink to their guests. Mihai got lodging for free in the house of violinist (“ceteraș”, from the name of the violin called “cetera”) and as a young school master he often accompanied the violinist to wedding feasts and round dances, playing the contra. The dances were full of rhythm, the singing with hollers, shriek, piercing interventions. Later on he will practice this kind of shriek singing – hollering – many times in his life, making himself remarked. For the young man who was not even seventeen when he arrived there, it was a capital experience from many points of view. With the permanent presence of death as he could have been killed if interfering in their feuds, this period could be compared to an initiation rite. As these remote villages from Oaş had also served as refuge for many fine intellectuals belonging to the former regime, these political refugees were the first to make known to him the names of the great Romanian writers never mentioned in school or those of important European or American authors and artists.

The gains of the years spent in different places from were counterbalanced by the harsh conditions of life and the poverty of the villagers. The improper living conditions and the poor diet affected the feeble young man's health. The occasion to leave was offered by the newly founded teachers training colleges all over the country and he chose to go.

=== Student in the cultural capital of Transylvania (1959-1963) ===
Advised by the intellectuals he had met and befriended in [[Oaș Country|Oaș]], he chose to go to [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], the cultural capital of [[Transylvania]], instead of going to a closer town, such as [[Baia Mare]]. The years spent in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], first as a student in the teacher training college then in painting section of the newly founded pedagogical institute, were decisive for his career. More important than the educational institutions he had attended, it was the cultural milieu in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]. The city had impressive buildings and churches, a national theater, a philharmonic, a long academic tradition, with various higher educational institutions, humanities, arts, music, a medical school of world renown, an excellent polytechnic, a wonderful botanical garden and a marvelous university library, important literary magazine. There were also the great professors and artists populating the town and these institutions, though some of the great personalities were still prosecuted. Among these were the great poet and philosopher [[Lucian Blaga]] who had been given a humble job at the university library and, the more visible for his patriarchal appearance, prose writer [[Ion Agârbiceanu]]. The city was accommodating thousands of students coming from different parts of the country, some of them, like himself, born in peasant families and determined to become intellectuals according to the traditional Transylvanian respect for learning.{{efn|Mihai Olos' article written to commemorate his friend “Pictorul Cornelius Brudașcu la cei 70 de ani ai săi”, Transilvania, 6/2007, 93-96, give a vivid description of this period.}}

As much as he would have wished to become a student at the “Ion Andreescu” art academy, it had been impossible for him to survive without any material support during the six years of study required there. Nevertheless, he was lucky to have at the pedagogical institute a good professor of art, Coriolan Munteanu, renowned painter of churches, who recognized his students' personality and did not bridle their independent spirit with academic rules.

With his health problems aggravating, Mihai, like many other students, was lucky to be interned for long periods of time at the university clinic's student “preventorium”. There, he got not only treatment but escaped from having to provide for himself. Other advantages were the presence of the doctors, some of them great intellectuals, and the contact with a variety of interesting or picturesque patients, among whom there were also some hiding from prosecutions. These counterbalanced the daily presence of death as TB was still an incurable disease, the use of streptomycin being only experimental.

The artist relates about a night in a moment when he had given up all hope to get well, depressed after his brother's death by drowning, in May 1962. In despair he decided to enjoy the remaining time exploring the city's night life, eloping from the ward and climbing over the fence surrounding the garden. The waiters in the restaurant offered him drinks and food for free on condition he entertained their clients singing the way he had learned in [[Oaș Country|Oaș]]. He used to return to the preventorium secretly before dawn and sleep off his tiredness during the day. Whether due to these escapades or the use of streptomycin, he got well to the doctors' and nurses' amazement. His escape from death had the subtext of a Faustian pact allowing him to pursue his artistic destiny.

== Settling down in [[Baia Mare]], first trip westward, and first shows (1963-1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muzartbm.ro/the-baia-mare-artistic-centre-1896-2013/|title=The Baia Mare Artistic Centre (1896 – 2013)|last=Alexa|first=Tiberiu|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

=== The Baia Mare Artistic Center in the sixties ===
After his graduation in 1963, he was hired as a teacher of painting at the so-called “popular” art school in [[Baia Mare]], with night classes for art amateurs from different walks of life. The school was another project of the regime to educate people but also keep them busy and under surveillance. Even though this job was not at the extant art school in town, it gave the young painter more freedom and time to work during the day and prepare for the annual art shows where he had shown his paintings also as an undergraduate, since 1962.

An exhibition catalog from 1966 shows who were those who held the power to direct the local arts after the dissolution of the old traditional painting school. The president of the jury was sculptor [[Géza Vida]], People's Artist, and laureate of the State Prize, with a privileged political status as a former participant in the International Brigades during the Spanish civil war. The jury members were: graphic artist, Paul I. Erdös, laureate of the State Prize (a Holocaust victim), painter Lidia Agricola, laureate of the State Prize (in her youth connected with the illegal communist party, widow of a painter victim of the Nazi's), and the older painter Andrei Mikola, Emeritus Artist who had studied in France. The others were the director of the local art museum, the representatives of the regional and county committee for culture and art, two so-called art critics with no special studies in the field of art, and finally a younger painter Traian Hrişcă, who had studied at the Bucharest art academy. Besides the artists already mentioned, among those who participated in the regional show in 1966, there were two other sculptors: Ştefan Şainelic and the now forgotten Maria Gyerkö, 12 graphic artists with 27 works, some of them, like Nicolae Apostol, Zoltan Bitay later better known as painters; 12 painters besides those mentioned, with 38 paintings, the best known being Iosif Balla, Alexandru Şainelic, Iuliu Dudás, Traian and Mircea Hrişcă, Ileana Krajnic, Augustin Véső, Imola Várhelyi, Ion Sasu from [[Satu Mare]], and Natalia Grigore from [[Sighetu Marmației|Sighet]].

After what he learned in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] about the Romanian modern artists and western art, the impressionism enjoyed by the local public did not suit the young artist. Neither did the official style of “socialist realism” imposed by the party as meant to glorify the new building sites and the achievements of the workers and peasants in the country appeal to him. But Mihai Olos was not the only one to disagree with the party's directions. The younger painters who had closer connection with western art were also discontent with the outdated style and the themes officially imposed. Thus, on the occasion of the Hungarian master Barcsay Jenő's visit to his native village Nima, near [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], at Augustin Vésö's initiative, a group of young artists simply kidnapped the painter and brought him to see their work. Mihai Olos was among those who met him.

=== A window opened westward&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
In the autumn of 1964, the young teacher of amateur artists fell in love with Ana, one of his pupils. She was a teacher of English at the local Pedagogical Institute whose father owned carpenters workshop in [[Timișoara|Timişoara]] that would provide him with frames and panel for his paintings and logs for his sculptures. Raised in the still patriarchal village community Mihai considered having a family and offsprings as a condition of personal fulfillment. Moreover, meeting a young woman bearing his mother's name took it as a good omen. The parents' wedding gift was a [[Trabant]], a much despised car brand those days and was left for the time being to rust in the street. So the young couple's honeymoon was spent as a train trip to [[Hungary]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. In [[Budapest]], they visited the art museum, impressed by the collection of [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]], and, more important, they visited Jenő Barcsay's studio. The old master, a great admirer of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] art, was already acknowledged as a great artist. He became world-famous especially due to his monumental Anatomy of the Artist translated into various languages. He was then working on a project to decorate the national theater in Budapest and showed them his sketches. But the real highlight of the journey abroad was an exhibition of modern art in [[Bratislava]], with works of painters well known to the artist from albums but with the original paintings seen for the first time: [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Paul Klee|Klee]], [[André Derain|Derain]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] a.s.o. The most impressive experience in [[Prague]] had been the visit to the [[Náprstek Museum|ethnological museum Náprstek]], with its excellent collection of primitive art.

This first trip abroad, even if in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] zone, strengthened the artist's determination to travel westward. For this he had to become known and find supporters among the critics and the leaders of the Painters Union in [[Bucharest]]. Still, he did not desire to move to the capital for had the conviction, coming from what he knew about [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] art, that he had to keep close to his roots and the folk traditions of the county where he was born.

After becoming a member on probation of the Romanian Artists Union he got he the right to rent a studio and being married he could apply for an apartment in one of the newly built blocks of flats. Moreover, marriage and the birth of children would entitle the artist to get a passport to visit also other countries in the West.

=== Constantin Brâncuşi – Master Model and “Recommander” to Critics ===
[[File:Sculpture in wood by Mihai Olos.jpg|alt=Sculpture in wood by Mihai Olos|thumb|'''Sculpture in wood by Mihai Olos''']]
Mihai Olos was only seventeen when the great sculptor died in Paris and he must have heard the rumors about the communist government's refusal to accept [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] studio and bring home his work. Thus the artist's inheritance remained to the France whose citizen he had become a year before his death. Mihai Olos must have read also the articles published by the art critics [[Barbu Brezianu]] and [[Petru Comarnescu]] about the sculptor. Reading [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] biography, the young artist was impressed by the similitude with his own life-story: orphan at an early age (though it had been [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] father who had died), he ran away from home when he was eleven; he had a beautiful voice, he had suffered of [[tuberculosis]] and feeble health; he was fond of company, sang well, had been admired and loved by women etc. Moreover, Mihai realized that when he left his beard grow there was a shocking resemblance between him and the great sculptor, a resemblance he stressed wearing white folk garments and making people observe this similitude. The great sculptor's work – especially his birds and the [[Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuși at Târgu Jiu|Endless column]] – had been inspired by elements of folk carvings. Exploiting the folk art Mihai so well knew, with its abstract symbolism, seemed the best source of inspiration to circumvent and counteract the officially imposed style. Nevertheless, avoiding to become just an imitator of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] model, Mihai Olos had to find some original element becoming his own. If [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] had found inspiration in the wooden pillars from [[Oltenia]] and the wooden birds on pillars representing the soul of the deceased in country churchyards, Mihai remembered the combination of wooden pillars from the architecture of the churches in [[Maramureș|Maramureş]] and discovered an ingenious miniature replica of these wooden structures, replacing the little wheel at the end of the wooden spindles used by women when spinning. Moreover, some of these miniature structures at the end of the spindles had pebbles in the middle which made a rattling sound while the woman was spinning.

His admiration for [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] personality and art made Mihai Olos approach those who had known and written about the master and who would recognize his physical resemblance to him as a guarantee of his also becoming a great artist. The most important among these [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] scholars was art critic [[Petru Comarnescu]] living in the capital city who – after a long period of prosecution for having been member, together with [[Mircea Eliade]], of a right-wing group of intellectuals – got back the right to publish under his own name, during the mid nineteen-sixty's political thaw. The first great show of notice he organized was that of [[Ion Țuculescu|Ion Ţuculescu's]] paintings which had no connection with socialist realism, an exhibition he will itinerate in the [[United States]].

Mihai's trips to [[Bucharest]], multiply and [[Petru Comarnescu]] includes him among the young artist deserving to be encouraged. The critic not only accepts him in his home with the other young artists, but after testing him to see whether he deserves his confidence, receives him as his friend, lets him sleep on the couch in the entrance hall, allows him to look at his art collection, his books, to read some of the letters he used to get from his friends living abroad, among them [[Eugène Ionesco|Eugène Ionesco]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Emil Cioran]], as well as other members of the [[Diaspora]].

The desire to exhibit in [[Bucharest]] became even stronger for the artist when the Baia Mare art museum opened a group show of [[Bucharest]] painters: Spiru Chintilă (b. 1921) from an older generation, who had had a solo show in [[Baia Mare]] in 1959, Mihai Danu (b.1926), Ion Pacea (b.1924) and Ion Gheorghiu (b.1929). If Chintila's paintings hinted at cubism, Gheorgiu and Pacea had both, among other paintings, landscapes from Italy, as they had represented Romania at the [[Venice Biennale|Venice Biennial]] in 1964.

=== First shows: figurative, abstract, and stained-glass paintings (1965) ===
In order to exhibit in [[Bucharest]], the artist had to show his work in his home town. Since 1962, while still a student, Mihai Olos had been present with his work in all local and regional collective art shows in [[Baia Mare]]. The first of these was in the company of graphic artist Cornel Ceuca. As its modest catlog shows, it was under the patronage of the Plastic Artists Union, and was opened at the Regional Museum in [[Baia Mare]], in the summer of 1965.

As seen in the exhibition catalog,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Expoziţie de pictură şi grafică: Mihai Olos şi Cornel Ceuca|last=|first=|publisher=Editura UAP|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihai Olos had on show 12 paintings in oil, most of them square (around 50x50). He chose themes that permitted abstract representations like “'''Archaeology'''”, “'''Fire place'''”, “'''Reel'''”, “'''Homage'''”. But also paintings with themes from the country-side, like “'''Village band'''”, “'''Women from Lăpuş''' '''County'''” etc.. Even his women's portraits were far from realistic. Besides his oil paintings, there were also 11 small dimension stained-glass paintings imitating the technique of the folk icons still to be found in villagers' houses and old churches. Though religious themes were banned those days of official atheism, he still dared to hint at his source by entitling one of them “Biblical”. Others of Mihai Olos' paintings represented a series of '''children's games''' from the countryside. The following one man show was in [[Borșa|Borşa]] and another in [[Baia Mare]], without printed catalogs.

In 1965, he made his first abstract '''wooden sculpture''' he entitled “'''The secret of the heart'''” inspired from the joints in the local wooden architecture and the rattling wooden knot at the end of the spindle that will later on become the module for his “Universal City”. Though not accepted by the jury, he succeeded to put his sculpture in one of the showrooms promising a prize to anyone succeeding to dismantle the sculpture. But no one succeeded.

=== The Brâncuşi Colloquium in [[Bucharest]] (1967) ===
An important or rather crucial event in the young artist's life was the Brâncuşi Colloquium organized in [[Bucharest]] in 1967, ten years after the great sculptor's death in Paris. Since the [[International Association of Art Critics]] acted as a partner, its then president Jacques Lassaigne was invited to attend. Besides him, the most important critics of the master's work had come to [[Bucharest]]. Among them were: [[Werner Hofmann (art historian)|Werner Hoffman]] from Vienna, [[Palma Bucarelli]], Giuseppe Marchiori and [[Giulio Carlo Argan|Carlo Giulio Argan]] from Italy, Carola Giedion Welcker from Switzerland. Still none of the Romanian art critics from the diaspora – among whom we should mention Ionel Jianu – had been invited.

To honor this occasion, the Romanian Artists Union opened various exhibitions with the work of young artists. Mihai Olos had been included with some of his paintings on wood panels, in the group of thirteen artists whose work was shown at the “Kalinderu” art gallery. Critic Dan Grigorescu sees the group as a generation of “very young” artists, and lists the participants: [[Henry Mavrodin]], Şerban Gabrea, Barbu Niţescu, Ion Bănulescu, Mihai Olos, Gabriel Constantinescu, Carolina Iacob, Adrian Benea, Paula Ribariu, Mircea Milcovici, [[Horia Bernea]], Florin Ciubotaru, Ion Stendl and Marin Gherasim. Other groups of artists were shown at the more visible Dalles art gallery and at the Art Museum, as one can learn from [[Ion Frunzetti|Ion Frunzetti's]] review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Moment plastic|last=|first=|date=1967|work=Arta Plastica|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|quote=Ion Frunzetti p.21-24, Ion Grigorescu, p. 25-26, Vasile Drăguţ,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olos had been invited together with other young artists to the reception [[Petru Comarnescu]] offered at his home, 10 Icoanei street. Carola Giedeon Welcker mentioned the event in her introduction to [[Petru Comarnescu|Comarnescu's]] book on [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]], published after the critic's death.{{efn|Petru Comarnescu, Letter in Ana Olos' archive.}} On [[Petru Comarnescu|Comarnescu's]] advice, Olos offered three of his paintings on wood as gifts to critics Welcker, [[Palma Bucarelli|Buccarelli]], [[Giulio Carlo Argan|Giulio Argan]].

The presence of the Italian art critics inspired the young artist, who had reached the age when [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] had left the country, to take his first trip west to Italy. It had been the destination [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] himself had had first in mind, though his destiny took him first to Vienna, then to Germany and finally to Paris. But before showing his work abroad, Mihai Olos was expected to exhibit in the capital of his home-country.

In a letter dated 1 November 1967, Petru Comarnescu was informing his protégé about some Swedish art critics intending to organize an exhibition in Stockholm. They were selecting young artists and therefore visited various shows and young artists' studios. In the same letter Comarnescu was advising the young artist to continue to work in the abstract-folkloric style, because the critic's firm conviction was that the complementarity of the folkloric elements and modernism in [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] work was the secret of his greatness and success. There are also hints to Olos' planned exhibition in the capital.

== Travels, Works, and Shows (1968-1974) ==
Since his first solo show in Rome, it would be difficult to separate the artist's life from his work for all his experiences serves to the development of his art. In the same way, the different forms of art, painting, sculpture, decorative or experimental art work develop almost simultaneously, most of them concerned with the development of his module, the knot, at the basis of progressions that should lead to materialization of his future project of the Universal City.

=== First solo show in [[Bucharest]] (1968) ===
Local or Transylvanian critics began to write about Mihai Olos' art beginning with the first shows of his work in [[Maramureș|Maramureş]]. His inclusion among the 13 artists shown at “Kalinderu Gallery”, had been an incentive to [[Petru Comarnescu|Petru Comarnescu's]] and other critics to publish in [[Bucharest]] art magazines about his work, while his presence at the Brâncuşi Colloquium imposed him to public attention. This reputation helped him to open his first one-man show at a central art gallery on [[Bulevardul Magheru|Magheru boulevard]] in [[Bucharest]], in January 1968.

There were 26 oil paintings with different themes (the best known among them: “Dance from Oaş” and “Pipers”), most of them abstract. There were also 37 mixed technique paintings on wood, and 5 banners hinting at church ceremonials. One of the paintings included in the catalog represented a stylized crucifixion.{{efn|Exhibiton catalogue. Ana Olos' family archive}} The show was a success with quite a number of critical articles in the press, not only in [[Bucharest]] but also in the provinces, among the authors, besides [[Petru Comarnescu]], being sculptor Ion Vlasiu, art critics Olga Buşneag, Eduard Constantinescu, and younger critic [[Radu Varia]] who will become one of his friends.

The same year he had four sculptures exhibited at the [[Milan Triennial|Triennial of Milan]]. Unfortunately, the show was devastated by rioters and it was closed down. Nevertheless, the artist succeeded to recover his sculptures. This success encouraged the artist to apply for a passport in order to visit Italy as a tourist.

=== Visiting the 1968 Venice Biennial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Anonimat şi efemer: Avangarda plastică Italiană|last=Olos|first=Mihai|date=1969|work=Echinox I/ 7-8|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
His frequent trips to [[Bucharest]], since the time he had been a student, and his contact with various people while he had been teaching in [[Oaș Country|Oaş]], some of these already in the surveillance files of the secret police, the much feared [[Securitate]], and especially his contact with the foreign participants who attended the Brâncuşi Colloquium brought the young artist also to the secret police's attention. Thus it was of almost impossible for him to get a passport to go abroad.

But one of their family's friends, writer and critic Monica Lazar, sent a letter asking one of her friends in [[Bucharest]] who held a high position in the ministry of foreign affairs to support the artist's application for a passport. Still he artist received the permission to leave the country only a months after their baby daughter's birth, in July 1968.

Mihai Olos left for [[Italy]] just a days before the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Treaty's]] troops (except [[Romania]] and [[Albania]]) invaded [[Czechoslovakia]] on the night of 20–21 August. The most important event for his artistic career was his visit of the 34th [[Venice Biennale|Venice Biennial]]. He was happy to lay hands on the bulky second, corrected, revised and amplified edition of the catalog that had been printed in August at Fantoni Artegrafica Venezia, its “copertina” reproducing the Biennial's manifesto “ideato da Mario Cresci”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catalogo della XXXIV Espozitione Biennale Internazionale d'Arte Venezia. 18.06 – 16.10, 1968. Secondo edizione ampliata, riveduta e corretta.|last=|first=|publisher=Fantoni Artegrafica, Alfieri – Edizione d'arte|year=|isbn=|location=Venezia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “catalogo” opened with its president Giovanni Favaretto Fisca's Preface and G.A. Dell'Aqua's “Introduzione” he had no need to read then but which are important in retrospect.

Both texts underline the renewal of the oragnizers' vision since the first after-war edition in 1948. The organizers were under the pressure of many protests and the actual changes in society and art. The artists couldn't be anymore classified simply into two categories, “figurative” or “abstract”, as some of them came with completely new innovative practices in art (XXIII).

The organizers had intended to show in the central pavilion, on the one hand, the four major representatives of the first Italian futurismo – [[Giacomo Balla|Giacommo Balla]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Luigi Russolo]] and [[Gino Severini]], [[Umberto Boccioni|Boccioni]] having been on show in the previous edition. On the other hand, they had prepared a large international show e titled “Linea della ricerca contemporanea – Dall' Informale alle nuove strutture”. This had to show the most representative artists, exponents of the successive tendencies from 1950 to 1965. “Informal” had been used with the widest sense of the word referring to “materials, corporeal language, 'gesto', signs and 'scrittura'; new [[abstractionism]] referred to “space, geometry, color”; perceptive structures: rhythm, movement, light. The new figuration, starting from expressionism and surrealism, included figures, grotesque forms and visions; objectual realism: things, persons, signals; the new dimensions of space: object-paintings, environmental work, primary structures a.s.o. Furthermore, they had wanted to include minor art forms such as ceramics, or other forms of visual arts, like stage design, photography, [[advertising]] and [[industrial design]], poesia visiva etc.

Moreover, they had intended to invite four contemporary architects – [[Franco Albini]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], and [[Carlo Scarpa]] – to show their specific way of imagining and configuring space.

Mihai Olos had not recorded in writing his observations about the Biennale, probably thinking that he would never forget what he saw, one could just suppose the huge visual impact the show had on him. Some representative artist's names appearing in the catalog were: [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francnis Bacon]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Willi Baumeister]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Kasimir Malevich]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Ben Nicholson]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Antoni Tàpies|Antonio Tapies]], [[Günther Uecker|Gunther Uecker]], [[Victor Vasarely|Viktor Vasarely]], and among others [[Wolf Vostell|Wolf Vostel]] with his “happening”. To these, one should add what the 34 national pavilions contained. The Italian Pavilion presented 23 artists, most of them considered of no great importance by the contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7438933/Una_Pagina_Dimenticata_-_Analisi_delle_Tensioni_Artistiche_e_Sociali_alla_Biennale_Veneziana_del_1968|title=Una Pagina Dimenticata. Analisi delle Tensioni Socilai alla Biennale Veneziana 1968|last=di Stefano|first=Chiara|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mihai Olos was happy to see that among those who introduced the artists in the catalog were the names of the two critics he had met in [[Bucharest]] the previous year. [[Giulio Carlo Argan]] wrote about [[Mario Nigro]] whose “Dallo 'spazio totale'” (1954) with its gridwork had caught his eyes. While [[Palma Bucarelli|Palma Buccarelli]] was enthusiastically introducing [[Pino Pascali]], as the “wonder child” of Italian art, with his use of combinations of traditional and new industrial materials (for example “steel wool” or plastic brushes) in achieving some unusual pieces of artworks like his huge “worm” of the mushroom-like “Pelo” (“Hair) and “Contropelo”(Counterhair) – an evident reference to the American “tribal” love-rock musical.

[[Palma Bucarelli|Bucarelli]] showed the connection between “ homo lundens” and “homo faber” in [[Pino Pascali|Pino Pascali's]] personality and underlined the artist's ironic titles illustrating his love of puns. She considered him to represent the new artists protesting against the consumerism of the society and the commodification of art. The tragic death of [[Pino Pascali]] in a motorcycle accident at the beginning of September attracted even more attention to his work and he became the Biennial's laureate. Touched by [[Pino Pascali|Pascali's]] tragic death, Mihai Olos will include in the catalog of his show in [[Rome]] the mirror image of his poem written in homage to the Italian artist.

The 1968 [[Venice Biennale]] is remembered also due to the students' protests and the organizers involving a great number of policeman and agents to keep order, that led to other protests, refusals to open certain shows, closing individual shows (Gastone Novelli, Achille Perilli or [[Nicolas Schöffer|Nicolas Scöffer]]) or national pavilions (e.g. the Swedish) or individual gestures of protest like turning the face of the paintings towards the wall and showing the back of the painted canvases.

Romania's commissar had been [[Ion Frunzetti]] and the artists on show: Virgil Almăşanu (b. 1926) with 32 oil paintings, [[Octav Grigorescu]] (b.1933) with 36 drawings, tempera and water color paintings, and sculptor [[Ovidiu Maitec]] (b. 1925) with 11 wooden sculptures and a bronze, each of the artists with two black and white photos in the show's catalog. If Almăşanu's abstract paintings were nothing new to the Mihai Olos. But [[Ovidiu Maitec|Ovidiu Maitec's]] use of wood for his sculptures must have made Olos think of this successfully relating to rural architecture in Romania. [[Ovidiu Maitec|Maitec's]] heavy winged “Bird” intentionally different from [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] birds resembled the massive hinges of a double gate, or to a magnified wooden hinge held together by a wooden nail. [[Ovidiu Maitec|Maitec's]] use of wood most probably gave Olos the idea to make himself some wooden sculptures there in [[Rome]], though smaller in dimension, for his show at Felluca Gallery.

=== First international solo show: Rome,“Felluca Gallery”(1969) ===
Arriving in the Italian capital, Mihai Olos got accommodation and the possibility to work at the [[Romanian Academic Society|Romanian Academy's]] subsidiary, where another artist, Petru Achiţenie was spending the time of his scholarship. Olos came with letters of recommendation to the members of the Romanian diaspora received from [[Petru Comarnescu]]. Among these, journalist Horia Roman and his daughter Cecilia (who became his closest friends), painter Vasile Drăguţescu, journalist Mircea Popescu and others. But Olos met and visited also Italian personalities in Romance studies like Rosa del Conte and others. As it is well known this was the period of students movements and it was a hard time for academics.

In just a period of some months, the young artist succeeded to set up his one-man show at “Felluca” art gallery. The well-organized '''opening''' – that could be considered a '''performance, as the artist clad in a hairy peasant's coat from Maramureș (“guba”), sang folk songs and hollered --''' proved to be a great success. The Romanian Embassy was represented by its Cultural Ataché, there were actors from the Cinecitta, artists, critics, diplomats, and, naturally, members of the Romanian diaspora. The show consisted in small stained glass paintings and small wooden sculptures whose forms already show the structural elements of the module for his universal city. Comments on the show appeared in the most important dailies and weeklies in Rome, such as ''Momento-sera, Il Tempo, Il Giornale d'Italia, Il mesagero, This Week in Rome.'' Among those who signed articles, besides the gallery owners, Derna and Vittore Querrel, had been also Lorenza Trucchi, an important art critic.

Besides his visit of Biennial and the promotion of his work, his stay in Italy had a profound impact on the artist. Starting with all that could be seen in Rome, he succeeded to go also to other important Italian cities. He visit the most important museums, churches and historical monuments, and saw the mot famous Italian artists' work. He also met or at least saw the work of the important artists of the day. It is no wonder that he did not hurry to return home. But the news from home – his father's being prosecuted for not having joined the collective farm and his wife being questioned about the date of his return – made him shorten his stay.{{efn|According to Mihai Olos, Letter to his friend Ion Vultur. No date. Copy in Ana Olos' archive.}}

Why did he not remain in Italy for good? Ceauşescu's refusal to join the Warsaw-pact troops at the invasion of Czechoslovakia had changed the perception of Romania in a favorable way in the eyes of the west. Thus the artist accepted the idea to return home in the hope that there would be other opportunities to leave the country.

=== Great expectations at home. Installations: “Dacia” Cinema and the Youth Club, Baia Mare (1969-1970) ===
Returning home with the glory of his success in Rome echoed in the Italian press and his own articles, Mihai Olos was commissioned with the decoration of a huge wall on the first floor of the '''entrance hall of “Dacia” cinema'''. His decorative work covering a surface of 120² m. was a visually impressive sequence of convex square aluminum plates, with inserts of smaller round mobile elements, alluding to Vasarely's op art as well as to his stables and mobiles. (The upper freeze was decorated with sculptor Valentina Boştină's work also with metal pieces.) During the nineties, the ones who bought the building tore down their work apparently with an intent to renovate the building, something they have not done.

Mihai Olos was also commissioned with the '''interior decoration of the local youth club.''' The decoration was, on the one hand, of rural inspiration with wooden tables and benches covered with red and black woolen rugs woven in the countryside, alluding to the striped front and back apron-like decorative pieces covering women's skirt in the village, called “zadie”. But the most spectacular part of the decoration were the huge round mirrors which had been made in the glass factory from Poiana Codrului (his mother's birthplace), reflecting and multiplying the space and giving depth and mystery to the rather small room. But this work has not been preserved either.

As a recognition of these achievements he received the Plastic Artists Union's '''youth prize''' and, in 1970, he was included – with a short presentation and the black-and-white reproduction of one of his painting's on wood – among the artists in the album with 1111 reproductions of Romanian painter's work edited by four critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pictura românească în imagini. 111 reproduceri.|last=Drăguţ|first=Vasile|last2=Florea|first2=Vasile|last3=Grigorescu|first3=Dan|last4=Mihalache|first4=Marina|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=|location=Bucuresti|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was characterized as a blending of the real and fabulous, as an expression of his tumultuous character, reminding of Rouault's expressionism. Still, the roots of his art were traced back to his native Maramureş, with the intention to modernize folk art.

Though cautioned by Petru Comarnescu to keep a low profile, the artist had confidence in his tremendous energy and capacity to impose his talent. Unaware of the “tall poppy syndrome” of those who couldn't accept other people's being successful, the artist believed that his show in Rome was just the first of a series of coming great successes. Believing that he could show at home and impose some of the new forms of art he had witnessed in Italy, he was expecting too much from the provincial public.

=== First happening / installation: “25” (1969) ===
His first happening entitled just '''“25”''' (that could be classified also as an installation), was on August 24, 1969, like an ironic counterpoint to the parades celebrating the country's “liberation” from fascism by the Soviet Army. For Olos' symbolic event was evidently meant to make people think about the victims of the recent floods in the country. It consisted in showing in the local art gallery{{efn|The art gallery was situated on the ground floor of one of the first `high-risers in [[Baia Mare]]. Its curator was the local older painter Iozsef Balla's wife, who used to talk and serve her friends with a cup of coffee behind a curtained partition of the gallery.}} two long flat metal vessels resembling baking tins, one containing water, where the visitors were supposed to throw coins (reminding of the Fontana Trevi), and the other with mud and green nettles. It is evident that he was echoing Pino Pascali's 32 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; di mare with trays painted in blue he had seen in Italy. The event was not commented upon in the press and his interview with a local reporter showed his disappointment at people's reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boitor|first=George|date=|title=Interviu cu Mihai Olos|url=|journal=Astra|volume=IV, 9 (40)|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained also a quite subversive reference to Constantin Virgil Gheorghiu's book The 25th Hour, a novel that had been published in French translation in 1949, and had inspired Carlo Ponti's film (1967) directed by Henri Verneuil and starring Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi.{{efn|As it appears in the Wikipedia article about him,Virgil Gheorghiu, then an orthodox priest in Paris Romanian, living in exile since 1944.

But the hint to Gheorghiu's novel or to Ponti's film could have been remarked by just very few people if any in the context of cultural isolation from the west in those days.}}

=== Going Eastward via The Soviet Union to Japan. The Osaka “Expo” and Japanese architecture (1970)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
The decoration of the movie theater came also with a financial gain that allowed the artist to pay his ticket for an excursion to Japan organized by the communist youth's travel agency. The same decision had been taken by his colleague Nicolae Apostol and both of them were accepted to join the group visiting the 1970 Osaka Expo.

The idea to visit Japan had come to the artist's mind already in 1967, when he met and interviewed anthropologist Tadao Takemoto who came to visit Maramureş. But now, the opportunity to see the Osaka International Fair came also with the thrill to see an event similar to the Montreal Expo that had celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Canadian confederation almost simultaneous with the Bucharest Brâncuşi Colloquium. As seen in the articles in the Artists Union's monthly Arta Plastică (12/1967) commenting on both events, the idea of associating sculpture with architecture was surfacing as a new idea in both events. in [[Bucharest]], it had been as an echo of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] work, while in Montreal it was suggested by the Expo's general theme: “The human being and the Environment”. The Romanian reporter commenting on the Montreal show mentioned Tingueley's kinetic sculpture and Niki de Sain-Phalle's huge figures in the French Pavilion. The illustrations showed sculptures by Henry Moore, Calder etc., other images gave an idea of the futuristic sites of the new cities with the branching modular structures of the Canadian Moshe Safdie's “Habitat '67”, the experimental “Lego architecture” (nowadays a favorite among children's toy boxes), the idea of “ephemeral cities”, and the presence of Buckminster Fuller in Montreal. All these made the artist look forward to this trip to Japan.

Among the novelties the Osaka Expo showed in the field of architecture were the Telecommunication Pavilion, Midori-Kan's “Astrorama”, the image of the multidimensional world, the Toshiba Pavilion, and the Takara Group's “The Joy of Being Beautiful”. As he would later on mention it to Joseph Beuys at Kassel, Krebs had also there his laser sculptures. But what captivated the artist's attention in Japan more than the Osaka Expo was the use of wood in architecture, not much different from that in the Romanian villages. The artist will publish his observations in an article with his “super-expressions”, upon his return home.

Going to Japan by train via the Soviet Union allowed the group to visit also Leningrad and Moscow and the art museums there. It was also an opportunity to travel through the Russian taiga and Siberia, experiences which enriched the young artist's perception of the world.

His connection with Japan will be resumed later on when with other Romanian artists he will send some of his work to art shows in Japan and one of his wooden sculptures would get a prize.

=== Being informed – the provincial artist's secret. Approaches to urbanism&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ===
The artist who in his childhood had instinctively absorbed the message what his father's raising him above his head meant, became aware first of all that residing in a provincial town, before starting his way out, he had to know everything possible about the international art scene. During the period of thaw after Gheorge Gheorghiu- Dej's death, there was the possibility to subscribe to various publication from the neighboring Soviet-block countries and the artist could read or at least look at the name of the artists and their work in art magazines like the Hungarian ''Müvészet, Vytvarne umenie'' from Czechoslovakia, the embassy's' publications like ''La Pologne,'' the German ''Prisma,'' or the American ''Sinteza.'' If from England one could receive only their communist party's ''the Daily Worker'', one could freely subscribe to a series of French publications. Among these the hebdomadaire ''Les lettres françaises'' came with weekly fresh information in the field of art, with Jean Bouret's “Sept jour avec le peinture” and theoretical articles or even special issues dedicated to an artist with colored reproductions of his work. Less informative about the arts, the monthly ''Europe'' had also special issues dedicated to artists. A special art magazine like ''Cimaise'' or ''Arts-loisirs'' were more expensive and more difficult to subscribe to. One could also find in bookshops albums printed in France and could buy Albert Skira art albums of the greatest artists or collections of texts referring to a certain art trends, like Surrealism, for instance.

The Romanian ''Arta plastică'' was bringing information about what was happening in the country but also news of the art-world abroad. The monthly ''Secolul 20,'' whose director since 1963 had been art critic and later president of the art critics international association, Dan Hăulică, would contribute to inform on what was happening in contemporary culture. As the period of the thaw was encouraging translations in the field of arts as well, the Meridiane Press started to publish an important collection of books and also anthologies with texts on currents in art as well as syntheses.

On the occasion of their first trips abroad, the artist and his wife would always bring new art books and magazines. Thus his wife returned from her tourist visit to England with subscriptions to ''Burlington Art Magazine'' and ''Studio International,'' one of its issues containing a review of Athena Tacha's ''Brancusi's Birds''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brancusi's Birds|last=Tacha Spear|first=Athena|publisher=New York University Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' This had been the starting point not only of the negotiation for the translation of the book but also of a long friendship. The American professor and sculptor of Greek/Vlach origin became the main provider of American art magazines (''Art International,'' ''Art and Artists, Art in America'' and ''Artforum''). Later on the artist would receive from Germany the similarly well informed ''Art Kunst''.

Even if the Romanian art magazine ''Arta plastică'' was the most important source of information about what was happening in the country, another important monthly world literature magazine, ''Secolul 20'' whose editors (like artist Geta Brătescu or its later editor-in-chief art critic Dan Hăulică), tried to bring into their readers attention what was actually happening in the western culture. This was also a period when publishing houses offered their readers translations of the most important books, at least those accepted for the party's cultural policy.

Among these books one of the most important proved to be an anthology of texts by Le Corbusier compiled so as to give a general image of the architect's life and work, introduced and translated by architect Michael Melicson, published by Meridiane art press in 1971. The very first page of Le Corbusier's presentation caught the artist's attention. It showed that although the French architect had no diploma and academic training in the field, he succeed to become more than that, “the only one who was in the same time architect, urbanist, poet, painter and writer, desiring to be a complete human being and artist, following the example of the Renaissance citizen-artists”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Corbiusier, poet al bucuriilor esenţiale|last=Melicson|first=Marcel|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1971|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction, Melicson, himself a well informed architect, attracted his readers' attention on the fact that Le Corbusier was not the only a great architect of the period contributing to the formation of a new architectural vision. He provided names neglected by the “usual” dictionaries, such as: Adolf Loos, Walter Gropius, Frank Lloyd Wright, Alvar Aalto or Mies van der Rohe.

Among the artist's notes from the beginning of the 1970s – for in his “imitatio Brâncuşi” he used to put down his own cogitations, there is one idea he had pondered much upon. It gives the definition of a provincial artist as one who knows everything about the other artists but nobody knows him. (During the years he would discover that this is true – or at least it was true in those years with no access to information on the Internet – for all artists who did not live in great art centers. While preparing his show in the Nijmegen art gallery in 1989, his exhibition's curator, Van den Grinten, will show him a catalog published in 1964, with the work of an older Dutch sculptor, [[Erwin Heerich]] (b.1922). Among Heerich's experimental pieces, Mihai Olos will discover two with the cube, made of paper in 1962, identical with his own experimental forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Erwin Heerich. Plastiken, Bilder, Zeichnungen, Teppiche.(Ein Dokimentation zur 17 Ausstellung im Hausen van der Grinten|last=van der Grinten|first=Franz Josef|publisher=|year=1964|isbn=|location=Kranenburg|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The year 1970 came with a great loss for the artist: his great supporter, art critic [[Petru Comarnescu|Petru Comarnescu's]] death. But he had already become “visible” in the artworld of Bucharest and especially among the literati. The artist capable to not only to sing but also recite from Romanian or other great poets for hours had been accepted as one of them, a remarkable poet himself still more an artist for he had no ambition to collect his poems in a volume.

If the artist was remarked at first sight for his good looks, unconventional clothing either with original pieces from the countryside, or just inspired from the folk costumes from his region of birth or [[Oaș Country|Oaş]], sometimes tailored by himself, in conversation he would impress his partners with information coming from various fields, his wide knowledge of poetry – for he first had wanted to become a poet –, arts and philosophy, and also his interest in sciences. Since he had learned to read, books played an important place in his life. While a student, he not only visited art shows and museums but spent time in libraries as well, reading art history, studying reproductions in albums, including books on the index from which he made notes for later on.

Having read the Romanian Andrei Oţetea's general presentation of the [[Renaissance]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Renaşterea|last=Oţetea|first=Andrei|publisher=Editura ştiinţifică|year=1964|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the translation of [[Giorgio Vasari|Giorgio Vasari's]] lives of painters and sculptors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vieţile pictorilor, sculptorilor şi arhitecţilor, vol I-III|last=Vasari|first=Giorgio|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1968|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; having seen albums with reproductions, Mihai Olos had gone to Italy knowing lots of things about the [[Italian Renaissance]] and its artists. After his return he felt a need to confront his own impressions with those who wrote about Italian art. The first book he read was [[Jacob Burckhardt|Jakob Burckhardt's]] comments on [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultura Renaşterii|last=Burchhardt|first=Jakob|publisher=Editura pentru literatură|year=1969|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=|translator-last=Balotă|translator-first=Nicolae|translator-last2=Ciorogaru|translator-first2=Gheorghe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irina Mavrodin's translation of Élie Faure's history of Italian art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Istoria artei şi arta Renaşterii|last=Faure|first=Élie|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1970|isbn=|volume=vol.

Nevertheless, what had made the greatest impact on Mihai Olos was [[Paul Valéry|Paul Valéry's]] ''Introduction to Leonardo da Vinci's Method''. He read the Romanian version&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducere în metoda lui Leonardo da Vinci|last=Valéry|first=Paul|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1969|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=|translator-last=Foarțǎ|translator-first=Şerban}}&lt;/ref&gt; dwelling upon the text as well as on the marginal notes. He read with the same curiosity books on modern art. Giulio Carlo Argan's essays on the fall and salvation of modern art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Căderea şi salvarea artei moderne|last=Argan|first=Giulio Carlo|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1970|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=|translator-last=Lăzărescu|translator-first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; that came with the presentation of important artists, and also [[Jean Grenier|Jean Grenier's]] essayas on contemporary art. In the Meridiane Press' collection of currents and synthesis, the young artist found the Romanian version of [[Nicolas Schöffer]]'s Le nouvel esprit artistique. The chapters on the three stages of dynamic sculpture, spatial dynamism, open structures, events and suspense, the suppression of the object and the illustrations representing Schöffer's cybernetic tower and other projects were of great interest to Mihai Olos. He was only happy to insert his own mark, a drawing that represents his essential structure, onto an open space in the chapter on cybernetics.

Even though for the artist living far from the capital there were no hopes to find sponsors or get funding for environmental sculptures, he could still receive at times invitations to send of his work to art shows abroad. Thus, Olos had the chance to send one of his sculptures to Japan, where it got into the collection of the [[Tokyo Fuji Art Museum|Fuji museum]]. Still, the artist felt the need to get personally in contact with the art world abroad. He was also frustrated because it was difficult to find among the artists living in [[Baia Mare]] partners to discuss with, in comparison with the four or five large cities in the country, like Timişoara etc. where young artists had succeed to have groups sharing their wish to change traditional arts and experiment.

Following the changes in the country's cultural policy after [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Ceausescu's]] return from his visit to [[China]] in 1971, the artists would begin to use, like many of the writers in the country, the so-called “double language”. It was meant to evade the more and more severe censorship, but was perfectly understood by those who knew how to read between the lines. For the Romanian artists the adoption of other forms of art, many of them experimental, in consensus with the young critics, was in order to evade the officially accepted “socialist realism”. Alexandra Titu's well-researched book on the experimental arts in Romania after 1960 (published only in 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experimentul în arta româneascã dupã 1960|last=Titu|first=Alexandra|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=2003|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a full-extent image of the phenomenon.

It would be mistaken to think that Mihai Olos was content “to serve” just one teacher or master. His natural curiosity and his fight against the provincial complex had led to his determination to know as much as possible about the ideas haunting him and made him look for several sources of information. Among these, with the effect of a master class, was [[Bruno Munari]]'s ''Design e comunicatione visiva'', whose first version Olos must have seen in Italy and whose fourth edition he had received from a friend in 1972.{{efn|Bruno Munari, Design e comunicatione visiva Design e comunicatione visiva contributo a una metodologia didactica, Editori Laterz, Bari, 1972. It is not sure, though one may suppose that Olos must have seen the first edition of the book published in october 1968, not long after his arrival his in Italy. He will refer to Munari in his Murska-Sobota manifesto as well.}} The book had been written as a practical guide with many illustrations, resulting from the lectures [[Bruno Munari|Munari]], visiting professor at Harvard, had given at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, in the spring of 1967. It had been already about computer graphics, modulation in four dimensions, Retrogardia, Avanguardia, optical effects, ambiguity, visual codes, impossible figures a.s.o.. Olos was shocked by the similitude between the module he had discovered and the serialization of cubic structures by two less known Dutch artists, Jan Slothouber and William Graatsma - a visually less impressive structure than the one the rattling spindle's knot had inspired him. Nevertheless, the principle that admits the proliferation of the module represented more evidently the idea of unity as well as that of inclusion. But he found also another type of combination of the basic elements, with the ends of the elements pointing outside, with a mouth-like opening or the end of the joint representing a cross. Other illustrations in [[Bruno Munari|Munari']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s book were representing experiments from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], or images of pavilions from the [[Expo 67|Montreal Expo]] of 1967.

The Romanian artist's interest in architecture made him approach the group of architects working in [[Baia Mare]] who had at their department office their “internal” informative publications. They willingly shared them with the young artist who had already seen with his eyes some of the great art monuments of the world.

In 1972 he succeeded to buy Michel Ragon's book about the world history of architecture connected to modern urbanism. Its second tome was referring to practices and methods during 1911-1971.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historie mondiale de l'architecture et de l'urbanisme modernes|last=Michel|first=Ragon|publisher=Casterman|year=1972|isbn=|volume=no.2 - Pratique et méthodes 1911-1971|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapters presenting the most interest for the artist were those referring to urbanims and the recent approaches to it. In a sub-chapter referring to urbanism in the European “peoples democracies”(Poland, Romania, [[Czechoslovakia]] and Yugoslavia), Olos found references to the “industrialization of architecture” using prefabricates in the building of large living ensembles, like districts Floreasca-Tei in [[Bucharest]], the ensemble from Balta-Alba, built for 10,000 inhabitants, or architects N. Kepes' and N. Porumbescu's plans of urbanism, and those of Sully Bercovici in architecture. Among the new buildings from the Romanian capital, Ragon mentioned Ascanio Damian's grand round exhibition hall and the building of the State Circus by Porumbescu, Rula, Bercovici and Prunku. Cesar Lăzăresu's name appeared referring to the Mamaia open air theater. In another chapter Ragon mentioned Martin Pichis' research prospective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A sub-chapter in Ragon's book of great interest to Olos was the one connecting urbanism and the environment, human geography, biology, ecology, zoology etc. This was again an opportunity to remember the wisdom that governed the organization of the rural communities' life so as to preserve the purity of their resources and avoid damaging the ecological balance. The artist became aware of the long-time danger of the pollution with exhaust gases from the local chemical combine. This brought about, later on, his more vocal protests against this chemical pollution as well as against the “pollution” of the traditional rural culture with implants from urban culture by the former peasants who commuted to their jobs in towns or cities. In order to attract people's attention to their connection with the ancestral agrarian culture from their country, besides the conferences he started in the countryside, Olos projected two new happenings meant to attract the participants in a kind of initiation ritual which, instead of telling them, would involve the participants emotionally and “show” them things connected both to their work but also to their ancient culture.

=== Second happening:“Gold and Wheat”(Herja, 1972) ===
His success in Italy got the dimension of a legend in [[Baia Mare]]. His decorative work in the local “Dacia” movie theatre, the echoes of his trip to Japan, his presence in the local press with articles as well as with poems in local anthologies, his studio open to his friends, admirers and visitors from all over the country and sometimes foreigners, made Mihai Olos visible in the eyes of the local community and gave him also a prestige in the eyes of the apparatchiks. At that time, most of these came from modest urban or rural backgrounds, some of them still catching up with their secondary school studies. Still, looking back at those times, it seems that the artist had the power of a mentalist or magician to convince the local authorities to accept his idea of a quite unusual or rather singular happening, the event “Herja” Mine (November 1972), then just mentioned in the local press, but with a wide national echo in later years.

The happening, at about 500 meter underground in the pit of the mine Herja, had been programmed by the artist during the miners' exchange of shifts. It consisted in the 25 ingots brought over from the Baia Mare subsidiary of the National Bank and set on a table covered with wheat grains in the form of the structure become now his module, Olos constructive pattern of the “universal city”. It is difficult to imagine the event's impact on the miners since besides the artist's glosses on Herja (the name of the mine), there was just another evasive article in the local press.

Apparently, it was a homage paid to the miners who had to work in the darkness under earth to bring up to light the precious metal and having never seen the ingots kept in banks. It was symbolically connecting their work to the agrarian myth of the grain and its cycles between death and life. Nevertheless, the event's subtext was certainly a hint to the many political prisoners who had worked and perished in the mines from the region during communism.

The way he used to experiment with the same idea as transposed in different media, the artist gave a painterly representation of the happening some years later. In comparison with the somewhat linear disposition of the miners in the photographic representation, in the painting the miners become a more compact group around the central point with the ingots. The strange thing is that the miners with the protection casks on their head recall the figures of the Italian futurists Boccioni and Marinetti from a 1915 photograph representing them in motorcycling costume and protective glasses on their caps, reproduced in Michel Ragon's book.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is difficult to tell whether this be just a coincidence sending the researcher just to the event's photographic representation, or whether it was intentional or just a trick played by the artist's remarkable visual memory.

=== Land art / Intervention:“The Earth”(Cuhea, 1973) ===
In the meantime, the artist had been experimenting with other materials besides wood – like foam, paper, hay, transparent Plexiglas, a.s.o.– in reproducing the same structure or variations of the module. One of those pieces made of foam for instance, in 1973, accommodates in the middle his little son and another module is held up by his daughter. The same motif will appear in the late '80s, in a painting with a woman and a man (a hint to Adam and Eve, or possibly to himself and his wife) entrapped among the 6 “clutches” of the totalitarian structure.

As an acknowledgment of his module originating in the folk architecture from Maramureş, ''Tribuna României –'' a multilingual monthly advertising Romanian realities to readers living abroad and severely criticized by the diaspora for its beautifying Romanian realities – published an article on Olos, entitled “Maramureş – a starting point of the planetary city”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anghel|first=Petre|date=1 December 1975|title=Entire journal|url=|journal=Tribuna României|volume=II, 26|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his being advertised in this context, could have made the artist suspect in the eyes of the Romanians from the diaspora. And this is probably why he would be received with reserve by the members of the Romanians around Monica Lovinescu in Paris when visiting Paris.

Exploring the “negative” of the structure, the artist prepared a new happening, actually an experiment in land art entitled concisely as “The Earth”, in village Cuhea, in 1973. The digging up of earth so that the negative of the structure should remain in the pit, was another attempt for the artist to synchronize his art with that of the other experimental artists in the country and abroad. Though the personal legend he attaches to this earth-work later on, is his feeling of premonition regarding his father's death.

Some of his paintings dated also 1973, now in the collection of the Baia Mare Art Museum, illustrating the event bear the title of “Spatial construction I”,“Spatial construction II”, and “Ritual”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Centrul artistic Baia Mare 1896-1996|last=Alexa|first=Tiberiu|last2=Moldovan|first2=Traian|last3=Muscă|first3=Mihai|publisher=Muzeul Judeţean Maramureş|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year 1973, he will accompany philosopher Constantin Noica (who had accepted in 1971 to become the artist's elder son's God father), on a ritual trip to Maramureș, reporting on their discussion in the local daily.

=== The 13th Colloquium of the “Mihai Eminescu” Society from Freiburg in [[Baia Mare]] ===
His knowledge of the region, seen also his articles on folk art and the folklore published in the local press made of Mihai Olos an excellent guide and discussion partner for visitors coming from the capital or abroad. One of these was Benjamin Suchoff from the Bartok Institute in New York, another the Japanese anthropologist mentioned before. This is why Mihai Olos had been asked to be the secretary of the folklore section in the conference the “Mihai Eminescu” society from the Freiburg University had organized together with the University of Iași, the Philology departments of the Suceava and Baia Mare Institutes of higher education. The theme of the symposium was “Maramureş, a model for the culture of south-eastern Europe”.

Besides the local participants, the organizers invited to [[Baia Mare]] first-rank personalities of the Romanian academia, such as ethnologist Mihai Pop, professor in [[Bucharest]], ethno-musician Harry Brauner a.s.o.. Among those coming from Germany were professors Klaus Heitman, Paul Miron and his assistant Elsa Lüder, and some of their students. While accompanying them on their visit to the countryside, Mihai Olos convinced them of his wide range of knowledge in various fields and need to be given new opportunities to further study. Besides, the university of Freiburg had a geographically favorable position to let him visit also the neighboring countries.

=== Art interventions:{{efn|Later on, the artist referred to them as “actions”, as it is seen in his Murska-Sobota Manifesto.}}“A Statue Ambles through Europe”(1974-1988) ===
At the end of 1974, with two small children and a pregnant wife, he was allowed to leave the country on a round trip, taking him through Yugoslavia, to Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. And this had been also the starting point of his ritual journey that lasted some years “A Statue Ambles through Europe”.

The “declared” intention of his action-journey entitled “A statue ambles through Europe”– a parody of “a ghost ambles through Europe”, the well-known phrase from Marx and Engels' Manifesto of the Communist Party – was “ to confront” a scepter-sculpture made by Mihai Olos with the “values” of the European art from different countries, including also the happenings or incidents on the road. Nevertheless, the idea of these interventions could have been inspired by a political event. In March 1974, when Ceauşescu, besides being the Party's Prime secretary, in his wish to have absolute power, made himself elected also as president of the republic. Most of papers in the country published the photograph of the moment when the presidential scepter was handed over to him. The news had an international echo and Salvador Dalí sent a telegram to congratulate (most probably with an ironic intention) the communist leader for transforming the symbol of monarchy into that of a republic. Dali's telegram was republished in the party's daily and reproduced in other newspapers as well. The photographs with Mihai Olos raising his wooden scepter-sculpture above his head during his “interventions” on the road could be viewed as alluding to the leader and his travels abroad. Nevertheless, a later painting in which the artist represented the presidential couple dressed in peasants costume, with the leader holding as scepter Mihai Olos' sculpture with the knot of the spindle, has been interpreted as a compromise.

The action continued along the years, the artist's following journeys including the meetings at Rochamps, Vesuv, Olimpos, Acropole, the Arta and Bosporus bridges, Cappadochia, Gordion, Gaudi's works in Barcelona and “the meeting” with Joseph Beuys, though never shown in its entire development, and ended with the picture taken at the rune stone from Felling in Denmark (1988).

=== Paris - an unfulfilled promise ===
[[File:Sculpture in stone by Mihai Olos.jpg|alt=Sculpture in stone by Mihai Olos|thumb|Sculpture in stone by Mihai Olos]]
The artist's travel to France and his contact with all that Paris could offer in the field of art, including his beloved painters Matisse, Picasso, Braque etc. and most of all to see [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] heritage meant a lot to him. Traveling via Germany, Olos arrived in Paris with Constantin Noica's recommendations finding accommodation at one of the philosopher's cousins. Nevertheless, he was lucky to find in Paris the famous historian of religions and writer Mircea Eliade, to whom he had been recommended by Petru Comarnescu some years before, when the critic organized the exhibitions promoting Ţuculescu's paintings in the United States. Mihai Olos met the most important representatives of the diaspora as introduced to them by Mircea Eliade. Among them, Emil Cioran, Moninca Lovinescu and Virgil Ierunca, the couple whose programs broadcast by Free Europe or articles in the French or diaspora press were harshly critical as regards the Romanian leader's policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovinescu|first=Monica|date=12 July 1973|title=Tribuna ipocriziei|url=|journal=Limite|location=Paris|volume=|pages=1–2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; unmasking the impoverishment of the population, the control of their possessions and income with new trials and imprisonments. The response to these broadcasts had been the sending of agents to threaten the members of the diaspora and Monica Lovinescu being almost killed in 1977 by a bomb hidden in a package addressed to her.

Among the most important for the artist meetings in Paris had been his discovery of the work of two Romanian philosophers, Ştefan Odobleja – whose Consonantist Psychology in two volumes published in 1938 and 1939 he brought home to study – and Ştefan Lupaşcu&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'énergie et la matière phsychique|last=Lupasco|first=Stéphane|publisher=Juillard|year=1974|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he visited and whose theories about the psychic system and the importance of contradiction and antagonism, the structure of the system of systems etc. had a great impact on the artist's thinking.

== Theories on art and first recognition as a conceptual artist ==
“Rostirea”(“the utterance”) as concept and constructive principle

Still in the sixties, during philosopher Constantin Noica's visit to a friend in [[Baia Mare]], Mihai Olos had been introduced to him and became one of his admirers, though not one of the “philosophers' pupils”. Nevertheless, the artist found in Noica's references to what he called the “Romanian philosophical utterance” a biblical term he will use from now on, i.e.“rostirea”(utterance),{{efn|he English translation “utterance” does not convey the connotations of the Romanian “rostirea”.}} instead of the common and restrictive term “language”, in insisting upon the primordiality of the spoken/oral aspect. Olos used the word “rostirea” in its meaning of “joining”, corresponding to the combining of concrete elements so as to form a whole. This was also an opportunity for the fond of word games artist to engage into finding a pair to the word, namely “rotirea”–“turning round”–, suggesting the circular movement of the spindle. Thus, if “rostirea” was referring to the elementary structure he had discovered in the little wooden knot on the wheel at the end of the spindle representing an atomic image of the world,“rotirea” was referring to its revolving around, reproducing the planets' motions. Though the artist knew about the philosophy of structuralism, he preferred to adhere to constructivism, and its connection to architecture. Nevertheless,“Rosturi” will become title of some of his paintings with “progressions”, during the sixties.

=== The knot – key element of Olos' art ===
[[File:Mihai Olos Sculpture Exhibition.jpg|alt=Mihai Olos Sculpture Exhibition|thumb|'''Mihai Olos Sculpture Exhibition''']]
If in his childhood the future artist had unconsciously registered the colors, forms and structures present in his environment – the geometrical elements in the carpets and rugs and also in the decorative elements, on the geometrically cut items of clothing, in religious paintings and architecture – in his first wooden sculpture he reproduced the knot-structure of the spindle consciously of its artistic value. Later on he will discover or consciously look for such structures in other artists' work. In this respect, his contact with Italian art had been extremely important. He had become more attentive to details and the geometrical elements appearing in figurative painting as well. His readings at his return home will only clarify his observations.

Since his graduation, as a teacher at the people's art school and as occasional speaker at the people's university in [[Baia Mare]], Mihai Olos continued to publish in the local press about folk art, comments on artists' shows, interviews and book reviews, alongside with his “glosses” on art, informing the readers about contemporary art and about his own projects. One of these glosses had been given a generous space in the local daily's supplement and was entitled “Urbanism”.{{efn|Recorded in the section “Artiole publicate”, in Ana Olos: Mihai Olos. A Chronological Bibliography. Unpublished typescript}} Seen in retrospect, it has an evident relation to what was going on in the country in the process of forced urbanization. But the idea of the “universal city” the artist will later on call “Olospolis”– that may be compared to the western “counter-architecture”– had been locally accepted due to its exulting a symbolic structure having its origin in the ancient peasant wooden architecture.

In Ragon's book, in he chapter about a new type of architecture referring to new techniques, he read about A. Foppl's old notion of “reticular structure”(1882), Graham Bell's experimenting in Canada with “floating” structures composed tetrahedrons, and about Robert Le Ricolais' essay on reticular systems in three dimensions, as a new language in architecture. The tridimensional, or bi-, tri- or quadri-directional structures realized of different materials have a knot which is the key element of spatial structures. The idea, as important as it had been, brought no fame and recognition to the unknown French architect (b. 1894) though his influence on avanguard architecture should be considered as important as that of Buckminaster-Fuller's who emigrated to the US in 1951, to teach at the university of Pennsylvania. Olos was also impressed by Le Ricolais' use of topologie and mathematics. Besides stressing the importance of the noed / the knot as basic constructive module, there were some convincing illustrations like maquettes for spatial and mobile cities by Yona Friedman, Ph. Lucien Hervé, Walter Jonas's maquette for an “intrapolis” or Isozaki's and Ph.O. Murai's spatial structure,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; references to electric urbanism, Inis Xenakis' publishing his project for a “cosmic city”, and even Dan Giuresco's inclusion with his “Alpha city”,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; that became important sources for further meditations.

But it will be in Gustave René Hocke's book about mannerism Die Welt als Labyrinth he read in Romanian translation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lumea ca labirint. Manieră şi manie în arta europeană. De la 1520 pînă la 1650 şi în prezent.|last=Hocke|first=René|publisher=Editura Meridiane|year=1973|isbn=|location=Bucureşti|pages=|translator-last=Adrian|translator-first=Victor}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he found some comments on Leonardo to confirm many of his ideas concerning the deeper meanings of the structure he had discovered and its being a cultural archetype. In the chapter entitled “Maps of the mystery”(172 et passim) he finds mentioned Leonardo's only six knitted- or braided-drawings similar to those that he had seen on the fresco decorating the ceiling of the Sforza castle in Milan. It was evident that Leonardo had used some abstract configurations as organizing principles of the intricate chaotic lines underlying the variety of forms in the visible universe, suggesting universal harmony. In the following chapter about the roundabout ways to reach the central point (176-181) Olos discovered the existence of such labyrinthine structures in the oldest cultures beginning with the stone age as well as in the medieval cathedrals as archetypes of salvation. But it was Leonardo with whom the abstract intertwined labyrinth had become a map of the world's mystery, a criptographic symbol of the cosmological representation of the “knotted” universe. The idea originating from Gnosticism reappears in the neo-Platonism of the Renaissance in different philosophical and metaphysical contexts (174). Hocke quotes Dante who considered that even God could be symbolized by those “nodi strani”. He also quotes the occult experiments with knots, threads or bands the artist knew so well from the old magic practices and interdictions in the villages where he had lived or visited later. He had seen the spindle used not only for spinning but also in magic rituals still alive. But Hocke reminded him that words and names were also knots.

Among the references in the chronology at the end of Ragon's book, the artist underlined Lewis Mumford's The Story of Utopias that hints at the fact that he himself considered the idea of a universal city for the time being just a utopia. He underlined with red Einstein's theory of the unitary space (champ) reminding that he had made some notes on the physicist's theory of relativity. Olos underlines as important for him also Le Corbusier's plan for a linear industrial city in Alger and the “Modulor”, Buckmister Fuller with his first geodesic domes, or J. C. Bernard's obtaining the Prix de Rome for his project for a “total city”(ville totale).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Le Corbusier's death in 1965 is encircled in a special frame. As the year coincides with his own first experiments with the structure, Mihai Olos used to tell about a premonitory dream he had had on the night of Corbusier's death. Anyhow, whether it was a true remembrance or just something conveniently imagined,“si non e vero, e ben trovato” as it is said in Italian.

Writing about Urbanism, semantics, semiology, mathematics and information theory, Ragon mentioned G. Kepes', Langue de la vision, published in 1944. But more important than this should be Module. Proportion. Symmetry, Rhythm, a richly illustrated book Gyorgy Kepes edited in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Module. Proportion. Symmetry, Rhythm|last=Kepes|first=Gyorgy|publisher=George Braziller|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and owned by Olos. He read the book in the second half of the sixties and it contains the artist's marginal notes in pencil, and translations of the captions of the illustrations. Among the contributors to Kepes' book, Phillip Morrison writes about the modularity of knowledge (1-19), Stansilav Ulam comments upon the growth patterns of figures, on mathematical aspects of modular idea in science and arts etc.(64-101), Richaer P. Lohse's “Standard, Series, Module: New Problems and Tasks of Painting”(128-1610. Anthony Hill writes about the structural syndrome in constructive art (162-173), the volume including also comments on the music of Béla Bartok and John Cage, etc..

As a conclusion to his readings and personal meditations, the artist will publish his own ideas about urbanism first in the local paper and its literary and art supplement Maramureş, refer to them in his interviews and later on summarize them in his Murska-Sobota Manifesto 55.

First recognition as a conceptual artist in the Bucharest show “Art and the city”(1974)

After Petru Comarnescu's death, among the young critics closer to the new generation of artists had been Mihai Drişcu. He would be one of the new commentators and supporters of Mihai Olos' art, inviting him to the shows he organized in [[Bucharest]]. The ample exhibitions “Art and the City” which echoed the idea of the relationship between art and the environment included Mihai Olos with paintings, sculptures, maquettes and projects of his future work, as a first recognition of its importance.

The subversive message of the show was directed against the project of systematization launched by the regime at the beginning of 1973. As an echo of the party's national conference, Professor of architecture, Cezar Lăzărescu, Rector of the “Ion Mincu” Institute of architecture had tried to give a theoretical foundation to the conception and principles of this long-time project in an article published in the party's Central Committee's theoretical and socio/political magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lăzărescu|first=Cezar|date=1973|title=Sistematizarea teritoriului – concepţie şi principii|url=|journal=Era socialistã|volume=1/LIII|pages=45–47|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way Mihai Olos had underlined in red pencil some of the ideas in the article and his marginal notes show his reserve as concerns the rather superficial presentation of the topic with no reference to what was happening in other countries.

=== Art Interventions at the Brâncuși Centenary and in the Sighetu Marmaţiei Ethnographic Museum (1976) ===
After his return from Bucharest, the artist continued to work in order to prepare another show. The following year, in 1976, on the occasion of the Centenary of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] birth, the American sculptor and [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] scholar Athena Tacha Spear – whose book on [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] Birds had been published in the meantime by the Meridiane Press – was expected to come and visit Maramureş.

Together with his friend, poet Dumitru Iuga (Ion Bogdan), Mihai Olos prepared a special publication entitled Măiastra in homage to [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] to be taken to Bucharest and be distributed among the participants to the events of the Centenary. Besides quotes from acknowledged critics' books or articles on the great sculptor and some of the great sculptors' memorable sayings, the issue contained Mihai Olos' homage to Petru Comarnescu, a collection of poems dedicated to the Master's birds along with folk poetry from Maramures about birds translated into English by his wife, Ana. The illustrations underlined the same idea, alternating images of [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] sculptures with samples of folk art from Maramures, wooden churches and carvings. Among them, the large photo of two rattling spindles suggested a relationship between them and [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] Endless Column. The message of Mihai Olos' article “Between Maramureş and Brâncuşi” was also the connection between Romanian folk art and [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] work. Though not mentioning Sidney Geist's name, Olos was actually hinting at the controversy between the American critic who denied any connection between the great sculptor's work and Romanian folk art. Olos' explanation was that the critics who denied [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi's]] roots were doing it because, living in an urban environment, they simply did not understand what the Romanians meant by folk art. And he was only right, for the confusion must have originated in the translation into English of the Romanian “artă populară”(folk art) by “popular art”, that was instantly associated with the American “popular culture” referring actually to an urban “sub-culture”. The publication of Măiastra was meant as a manifesto underlyning the great sculptor's genuine Romanian roots and in the same time advertising the county of Maramureş as a space in which the culture of wood was still alive and could be a source of inspiration for contemporary artists.

In 1976, the centenary was planned and organized by the Party Committee of Gorj county in order to make critics focus their comments on the “Endless Column” and the “Table of Silence” in Tg. Jiu, the only treasures the country could offer in order to show that [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] belonged to the Romanian culture.

After the trip to Tg. Jiu, the American sculptor and professor Athena Tacha Spear, as she had promised, came to Maramureş and visited also Ethnographic Museum in Sighet. Though the Olos' paintings and sculptures were listed and some of them reproduced in a separate catalog, they were actually scattered among the regular exhibits of the museum. Putting down her impressions in order to be included later on a separate sheet in the catalog, Athena T. Spear was describing the way Olos' work, after a first moment of confusion, made viewers realize the similitude and differences between the artist's paintings and the patterns on folk textiles and rugs, as well as the relationship between the sculptures and the utilitarian objects made of wood still in use in the villages of Maramureş. Among the exhibits there was also a guash representing Olos' project for the universal city, superimposed on Le Corbusier's project for Algiers.

=== The 1977 Earthquake in Bucharest ===
The beginning of March 1977 found Mihai Olos in a hotel in [[Bucharest]]. In January he had participated at a round table about winter customs in the countryside and a reporter of the Contemporanul cultural magazine published an interview with him. He was preparing again to leave for Germany.

On the 4th of March he went to visit his friend sculptor Ion Vlasiu who – as the artist would later remember – told him about a strange dream he had had during the night and his bad forebodings. The unpleasant feeling transmitted to the young artist was accompanied by the sight of Vlasiu's sculpture whose theme was war. It was only in the evening that the explanation of their unpleasant feelings got an answer. The terrible earthquake caught Mihai Olos in his hotel room. He was witnessing how the walls split apart in the midst of the shrieks of those running in the corridor on the shattered glass splinters. He was lucky to escape alive though deeply marked, like all the other survivors, by this closeness of death. During the night, and on his way on foot to the airport, in the morning, he had witnessed the apocalyptic sight of the city. This cauchemaresque experience had a longtime effect on the artist.

After the terrible spring when many of the artist's friends had found their death in the earthquake, Mihai Olos decided he had to go by any means to the Kassel Documenta 6. The international art event was limited to 100 days, since midsummer to the beginning of October. That year the number of participants was 655, including some of the greatest artists, such as Francis Bacon, Marcel Duchamp, Sol LeWit, Lucio Fontana, Nam June Pike and many others, and there were 2700 exhibits. The Documenta featured the first international telecast by artists and some of the performances were to be transmitted to over 25 countries. One of the greatest attraction of the Documenta was the Free International University where the famous conceptual artist Joseph Beuys was addressing directly the participants elaborating on his theory of “social sculpture”, crucial for his art project. Olos had already become an admirer of Beuys' art when he saw one of the German artist's drawings on a crumpled piece of paper at a museum in Paris.

Arrived in Kassel, Olos did not hesitate to approach the famous German artist. During one of Beuys's seminars, he took the chance to draw on a blackboard the sketch of his own project of the universal city. Without a proper knowledge of any international language, still he was able to expose his theory of the Universal City so as to be understood by the participants. Afterwards, he proudly used to quote the German artist who, looking at his drawing had exclaimed:“Finally, an artist!”. The blackboard with Olos' drawing was included – with Beuys having drawn over it a swan – in the installation with blackboards entitled “The Capital”(hinting at Marx) shown at the next Venice Biennial and reproduced in Beuys' booklet entitled Das Kapital Raum 1970-77.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Kapital Raum 1970-77.

Another meeting with Beuys was in Düsseldorf, on 26 June 1980, when Olos asked the German artist to make an intervention on one of his work. Accepting, Beuys cut off some spindle-knots from one of the Romanian artist's sculptures. The intervention had been recorded on photos.

The artist will describe his experience at Documenta 6 in an article published in Romanian Arta,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;{{efn|and commented upon in his interview with Mariana Ioescu in Romania Today, No.2/1980, p. 60, 62. The reporter quotes from the artist's“Meditations on a Spindle”. The magazine reproduces photographs with Beuys and from the opening of Olos' show in Giessen}} in 1978, while his meetings with Beuys and his parting from Beuys could be found in two of his notebooks, after Beuys' death in January 1986.

=== An Interlude:Analysis of the Structure”. The Study – Bastion Art Galleries, Timişoara (April–May 1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studiul - Catalogue|last=|first=|publisher=Uniunea Artiştilor Plastici din România şi Comitetul de Culturã şi Educaţie a Judeţului Timiş|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
One of the important collective shows in which the artist had been included among the most representative artists alive was the thematically entitled Studiul, jointly organized by the Union of the Plastic Artists from Romania and the Cultural and Educational Committee of Timiş County. The catalog has three introductory statements. After Titus Moroccan's “Art as Study”(a.1-3), with rather dry and unimaginative considerations about the theme, Andrei Plexus's short essay “About Study”(a.5-6) contains unusual for the epoch reflections about various rituals eastern and western artists used to perform when preparing for the act of creation. Among the one's Pleşu mentions are the “dhyana”, prayers, later influences of the tantric way, or what the alchemists had called “the humid way”(i.e. the consumption of alcohol, drugs, etc.), Salvador Dalí being the only one quoted from among the contemporary artists to follow such practices. Coriolan Babeţi – the local organizer – glosses (“Studiu despre studiu”, a.7-11) on the origin of the word and the evolution of the concept along the centuries, stressing the importance of “study” especially for the conceptual artists. He shows how important study had become in the process of communication during the nineteen sixties and seventies, and how drawing had been included in shows like Documenta 3 ( 1964) and Documenta 6 (1977), or the International Exhibition of Drawing from Darmstadt (1970). These observations must have remained in the artist's mind and may have unconsciously led him to give more importance to his drawings and open his own show “Continuous Drawing” a decade later.

Another important thing to observe is that the organizers of Studiul had divided the living artists into seven categories: 1. Utopia as an investment for research; 2. Analyses of the structure; 3. Symbolic configurations; 4. Conceptualizing forms of visual perception; 5.The depth of memory signified in the image; 6. The study of nature and ways of interpretation; 7. Integration and implication in the social space. Mihai Olos was included in the second group, together with other fourteen artists, among them, just to mention a few, were Şerba Epure, Mihai Horea, Toma Roatã, Doru Tulcan etc.. Nevertheless, in the catalog, with the artists arranged in an alphabetical order, there is no comment attached to the illustration reproducing one of Mihai Olos' oil paintings “Structure Study”(c.28, the only explanation being that he had not sent it to be exhibited).

=== Lectureship in Germany. Solo shows in Wickstad and Giessen.“A Homage to Rilke”– performance and film ===
Some art professors seeing Olos's presentation at Beuys' seminar, invited him for a “Lehrautrag” at the “Justus Liebig” university in Giessen. He spent there a semester teaching seminars to the students and working on his new sculptures. This was an important stage in the artist's evolution. The position of visiting artist with a generous allowance permitted him a longer stay. The contact with the students and their professors, as well as with some fellow artists, allowed him to better understand the western artists' relationship with their public. Mo rover, he had been given a place where to work and wood for his sculptures. After his stay in Italy this was one of the best periods for his work.

The shows he opened at Wickstadt, in 1978, and then in the town-hall in Giessen, in 1980, had been well-received and commented on in the German press and also in the Bucharest German Embassy's monthly ''Prisma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fessler|first=Helga|date=Summer 1980|title=Expoziție Mihai Olos|url=|journal=Prisma|volume=XII| issue = 7|pages=35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there had been also articles published in Romanian newspapers and journals.

Wanda Mihuleac (who with a high rank father had a privileged situation), retells in a recent interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWClg_f47Vg|title=Mărturii XXI|last=Mihuleac|first=Wanda|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; how Mihai Olos, on his return from Germany (probably in 1980), came one day to her studio to show a film made on the occasion of his happening dedicated to Rilke's memory. The film showed the artist and his partner both nude, giving each other roses with long thorny stalks which at times drew blood. The following morning, Wanda Mihuleac was called to the securitate and was reprimanded for letting such a film be shown at her place. They had been only five persons the night before, good friends, and so one of them proved to be an informer.

== A dark decade for the artist that ends well (1980-1989) ==

=== Happening:“Against pollution”(Baia Mare, December 1979) ===
[[File:Mihai Olos Happening.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Mihai Oloș Happening (1980)]]
Though cured of his lung disease, the artist had breathing problems whenever the Baia Mare chemical plant exhausts poisoned gases in the air. Besides the various constatative articles published by researches of the phenomenon of environmental pollution with chemical exhausts and mining residues, Olos was the first artist to protest in his articles published in the local paper. Nevertheless, his 1979 happening in [[Baia Mare]] he entitled “Against pollution”, consisted in his sweeping the wheat grains which carried to or from a neighboring mill had fallen from a truck earlier in the morning and scattered on the carriage way in the street facing his studio. The artist told to a journalist the story of how it happened: a pigeon with a grain in its beak attracted his attention to the criminal waste of the precious wheat, associated in peasants' mind in with gold, as a solar symbol.

The artist's longer stay in Germany, his contact with artists and especially his meeting Joseph Beuys had been a great gain for Mihai Olos not only as an artist but also as a human being, getting an insight into western human relations, learning about democracy and, last but not least, about the opportunities western artists enjoyed for their developing their art. Still, he could not decide to deflect, though after the scandal produced by the head of the Romanian secret service, Mihai Pacepa's deflection, it became clear that things in the country were going to deteriorate and it would be more difficult to leave the country from then on.

Ceuşescu's re-election as president of the “socialist republic”, and his picture holding the scepter being reproduced on the first page of the Artists Union's review Arta (3/1980), seemed to put an end to any hope for change. The artist and his family, with the three children growing, had material difficulties and the artist himself had to look again for a job. This was when, being sure that the painting would be bought, he made the faux pas to paint the presidential couple in the context of his universal city putting in the dictator's hand his version of the scepter. Moreover, he had the bad inspiration to publish the painting's photo in a folklore almanac – Calendarul Maramureşului – he edited together with his friends Dumitru Iuga and Nicoară Timiş. Though viewed by some of the artist's nowadays critics as a concession to the regime, the consequences had been actually the reverse than expected. Another faux pas viewed in retrospect, was his relationship with poet Adrian Păunescu and the artist's acceptance to sing in one of the Flacăra shows organized by the poet. In 1982 he was awarded the Flacăra prize by the magazine patronized by the poet who, as seen after the change in 1989, was brandished as one of the dictator's main flatterers.

With his travels abroad Mihai Olos was under the securitate's surveillance since his travel to Italy .{{efn|As recorded in his CNSAS file on show at his Bucharest retrospectiv exhibition entitled -- with one of his code names from the file –“The Ephemerist” at MNAC, in [[Bucharest]] (2016-17)}}Olos' art intervention journey with the scepter statue must have been also watched and commented upon in the informers' reports. The relationship between the artist's journey and the painting in which the artist had dared to put his own statue in the president's hand could have been interpreted both ways: either as a flattery or as an insolence. It was a period when many intellectuals had become informers and consequently the younger generation agents were chosen and trained so as to understand the language of the artists they were watching. Some of these were first served in bookshops with books and albums common people had few chances to lay hands on. So one can expect that some of these had the pretense to be literary and art critics as well. And what a chance for them to discover subtleties and suggest interpretations they considered valid. In their case there was also the feeling of the power to aid or destroy an artist's career which must have played an important part in their reports, sometimes as a compensation of their own frustration to play a part behind the stages. And one may suppose that Mihai Olos' lack of discretion in showing off with his successes must have offended their feelings on many occasions.

=== The tall poppy syndrome ===
With Ceauşescu's developing megalomania and his idea that the country's external debts should be paid, the economic situation deteriorated and the surveillance system increased, even if the methods used to reprimand any attempt to criticize the regime have become more sophisticated.

In 1983, the local daily from Baia Mare, published a Bucharest reporter's extremely nasty article meant to demolish Mihai Olos's intellectual prestige as an artist. The pretext had been the artist's article in which he had called the traditional Christmas caroling in the country-side as a “begging-ritual”. It is hard to say whether the artist had really intended to hint at the terrible poverty of the population, but someone certainly did find a relationship.

The artist so successful abroad and thus too visible in the local context had become dangerous, especially because his influence on his group of admirers. His studio, visited by many great personalities from Romania along the years since he moved in it, had become a meeting place for young poets and artists who saw in these meetings an opportunity to feel free. The article's true aim had been to compromise or rather destroy his status as an opinion leader and authority by shattering their confidence in his professional status, trying to suggest that he was just an impostor, a drunkard with rude manners. Even if some of those who knew well the artist showed their indignation, the local daily did not publish any response to this article.

With his family's increasing financial difficulties, in 1980 he succeeded to get back his teaching job at the people's university. As he was unable to resist more than two semesters, he applied for a curator position at the county museum. But his contract was severed in the summer of 1984, being left with no personal income.

=== Eros in the Universal City: The “Mandragora” series of paintings /“The Grass Inferno” ===
In the meantime he returned for a while to painting in the hope to sell at least some of his work. But what he had started as a desperate effort to get rid of his memories of the earthquake developed in a series or rather cycle of closely connected canvases on the theme of an ancient ritual that had been described by Mircea Eliade in his History of Religions but was still alive in Maramureș. Mihai Olos would show a part of this new thematic cycle of 44 acrylic paintings illustrating the ancient rite of the Mandrake at the Museum of Romanian Literature in [[Bucharest]]. In her comment on the show, entitled “The Grass Inferno”, critic Olga Buşneag wrote about the artist and performer's return on a higher level to his first show imbued with folk rites and magic, adding his knowledge of contemporary art and his own experimenting. According to the critic, Olos imagines a planetary erotic scenario of the pagan ritual of the picking of mandragora in a stream-fresco of violent blue bodies on the green blaze of the grass, recreating a Walpurgis night blended with a Garden of Delights. She sees in these paintings a “dialogue” between the Pollockian intricacies of the winding lines and the simplicity of human figuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buşneag|first=Olga|date=1983|title=Olos în infernul de iarbă|url=|journal=Arta|volume=XXX, 12|pages=30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these paintings had a small image of his module as the artist's signature. Moreover, as some of the witnesses who saw the pieces of the paintings arranged on the floor of the artist's stdio like the pieces of a completed puzzle, with the white lines covering the background images like laser beams crossing each other and drawing the outline of a sketch of the Universal City, the whole should be viewed from above.{{efn|According to Ana Olos' conclusion to what she learned from the Baia Mare artist Liviu Rața who had tried to reconstitute the overall image from the extant photographs.}}
[[File:Mihai Olos - ceramics.jpg|alt=Mihai Olos - ceramics|thumb|Mihai Olos - ceramics]]

=== The Module in Ceramics ===
In 1984 Mihai Olos participated in a pottery symposium held at the local factory in [[Baia Mare]] that would lead to other experimentation. The most remarkable among the pieces created there, with its image illustrating Gheorghe Vida's article on the symposium, was a representation of his planetary city's module on colored ceramic plates .{{efn|The plates have been saved by painter Nicolae Suciu from the ruis of the former “Faimar” factory and installed as a decoration on the wall facing the entrance hall of the building housing the art section of the Faculty of Letters,#20, Crişan street, Baia Mare. Information in Ana Olos.}} The three dimensional pieces are smaller, made each of the two extant of detachable elements of the module installed on a round plate. Another round plate had on it the severed head of John the Baptist.

With no chances to get on otherwise, the artist tried to get again a passport to leave for Germany. On September 7, 1984, in a note (No. 5344/7.09.1984) addressed to the passport service of the Home Ministry's inspectorate from Baia Mare, Viorel Mărginean, then president of the Romanian Artists Union, was recommending Mihai Olos for a 90 days study trip to Germany, in order to collect his sculptures and paintings left behind in Giessen and open with them his personal shows in Berlin, France and Italy. It is shown that he has no access to state documents, presents moral and political guarantees, while the trustee for the payment of this debts to the Artists Union was his wife.

=== Continuous Drawing as Therapy (1987) ===
[[File:Drawing by Mihai Olos.jpg|alt=Drawing by Mihai Olos|thumb|Drawing by Mihai Olos]]
At his return from Germany, with the situation becoming more and more oppressive and his health deteriorating, the artist decided to quit smoking making of this another happening, since as a cure of chain-smoking, he will be chain-drawing, to prove that artistic gesture can replace a vicious habit, being a therapy through art. The opening was planned as a homage to [[Constantin Brâncuși|Brâncuşi]] on the 111th anniversary of his birth, in February 1987 and the show consisted in 1275 ink drawings of various dimensions. They drawings for the show had been selected by the members of the family from the thousands of drawings he had made along the years, according to certain themes suggested by the artist. Among them were portraits, nudes, human and animal figures, sketches for his paintings or sculptures, of his past or future projects, such as his project for a monument of Voevod Bogdan of Maramureş (of which there had been also tridimensional pieces made of clay) made later on by one of the younger sculptors, and naturally, of his Universal City. Some of these drawings were ironic or humorous. The artist would continue his drawing all his lifetime, in his later years learning also computer design.

As concerns the fate of his drawings, some of them had been reproduced in literary or art magazines during the artist's lifetime, scattered pieces or whole booklets appropriated by the visitors of his studio, later on reproduced without permission.

=== Sculptures and paintings in Nijmeegs Museum 'Commanderie van Sint-Jan'(Netherlands, 1989) ===
As G. Lemmens, the museum director states in his Foreword to the excellent bilingual, fully illustrated exhibition catalog,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mihai Olos. Houten en schilderijen. Holzskulpturen und Bilder|last=van der Grinten|first=Hans|publisher=Nijmeegs Museum 'Commanderie Sint-Jan”|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum had intended to organize an exhibition with Mihai Olos' 1976 “Progressions”(Rosturi) in 1987. Besides a presentation of the artist, the first section of the catalog contains the Dutch and German versions of Mihai Olos' article “Between Maramureş and Brâncuşi” he had written for the Centenary. Hans van der Grinten's comments on the exhibits – a selection of the artist's best sculptures (46 pieces) and paintings (37) illustrating also his concept of the Universal City, stressing their connection both with the culture of his native county and the art of his great predecessor. The exhibits were a prof not only of the visual beauty of his work, but gave a real insight into the possibilities of future development of his project for what he called his Olospolis.

Due to the historical events that occupied people and the press those days – the fall of the Berlin wall in November, the dissolution of the Soviet block and the revolution in Romania in December – Olos' show in Nijmeeg had just a feeble echo. The artist had to return in his home-country without having the opportunity to enjoy the success of the exhibition.

'''Work in Germany - Shows Abroad (1992-2015)'''

By the end of 1992, after an enthusiastic episode of involvement in politics in support of the National Christian Democratic Peasants Party, utterly disappointed of the outcomes and discontent with the situation at home, decided to settle in Germany, though not giving up his workshop at the painters center in [[Baia Mare]]. But as his friend Paul Neagu had told Olos' son Constantin visiting him in London,{{efn|Constantin Olos, Letter from London (1993) to Ana Olos.}} the idea to settle in a village in south-eastern Germany, rather isolated from the great art centers, was not the best place for the artist to make himself known. With all the previous success he had had in Germany, paradoxically, an overview of the artist's portfolio of the following decades seems to show that Paul Neagu had been right. Not that the artist did not continue his work. But he lacked the contact with his many friends and admirers from his native country. Therefore, he used to return in [[Baia Mare]] from time to time, continuing to exhibit at the regional shows and collaborating with articles in the local papers and literary magazines in the country.

Following his decision to stay and work in Germany, Olos married his longtime supporter, translator and secretary in Germany, Ms Helga Fessler, graduate of Romance languages at the University of Freiburg, whom he had first met in Romania during the seventies. He continued to work on his project realizing other modules of smaller dimension.

Adapting to the new technologies, he learned computer design and this made him pass to the practice of digital art. Nevertheless, this was actually continuing his experiments with the module in another medium. Besides, especially when his health began to decline, the medium he adopted was paper, creating a great number of origami-like small modules.

=== The “ Berlin Golden Tripod” and poetry at Wiepersdorf Artists Castle (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fessler|first=Helga|date=1993|title=Tripodul de aur de la Berlin. Mihai Olos la Wiepersdorf|url=|journal=Prisma|volume=XXV| issue = 1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
In the autumn of 1992, invited to stay at the literary institute housed in Wipersdrof Castle, Mihai Olos work on a new project, he entitled this time '''“ A statue sits in Europe”''', inspired by the idea of the three-legged golden bridge “Deutschland”, a symbol of the unification of Germany. He exposed his ideas to the those who were at the Schloss and made a series of large paintings illustrating his ideas, one of them included in Hans van der Grienten's collection at Moyland Castel.

Mihai Olos had written and recited poems ceaselessly since his youth, some of them published in various literary magazines and anthologies, but those he collected in a volume remained unpublished till his death. He, like his friend the acclaimed poet Nichita Stănescu, used even to dictate his poems to members of his audience. Thus, while working at the Wiepersdorf Schloss, he had a close collaboration in writing poetry in German with the acknowledged poet Lioba Happel. The poems written together have been published in the 6th section of Lioba Happel's volume Der Schlaf über Eis{{efn|The poems were first published as: Lioba Happel.“ Das kalte Prinzip. 12 Gedichten nach gemeinsamen Niederschriften von Gesprächen mit Mihai Olos. Neue Literatur, 1/1994. Then in book form: Lioba Happel. Der Schlaf überm Eis. Gedichte. Schöffing &amp;Co. Frankfurt am Main, 1995,“Das kalte Prinzip. In Zuzammenarbeit mit Mihai Olos”, p.53-67.}}

=== Solo show in Vác – Hungary ===
On the 4th of July 1992 Olos gave a performance “Poetica” in the Hungarian town Vác. The success of it made Jozsef Bárdosi, art historian and curator at the Greek Church Museum, organize a solo show with Olos' work, authoring also the exhibition catalog. The show opened on the 16th of October 1993, and among those present had been also a group of the artist's friends coming from Baia Mare. Bárdosi gave an overview of Olos' life and work –“Turning structure into myth – On the sculptures of Mihai Olos”, included quotes about the artist and from his statements, photos and reproductions of his work listed in the bilingual catalog. A comparison with the Nigmeegs exhibition catalog shows that sculptures and paintings on show were mostly the same, though less in number. Olos' painting “The double Bridge”( 1975) is listed as already belonging to the Dutch museum. This was the artist's last grand show during his lifetime.

=== Included in important group shows in Romania ===
Less is known about his work in the periods when he returned to his studio in [[Baia Mare]]. Most probably he painted to exhibit at the yearly or seasonal, regional and local art shows, as their catalogs record his presence, spending the rest of the time socializing with his friends in town or visiting those in the countryside.

The way the organizers included him as a sign of recognition in thematic shows while still residing in Romania – e.g.“Tapestry – Wood”(Bucharest, 1973, curator M. Oroveanu), the aforementioned “Studiul” in Timişoara, or “ Place, Deed and Metaphor”(Village Museum, Bucharest, 1983), he appeared as a representative artist in the show critic Alexandra Titu organized on the occasion of launching her book about experimental artists at the National Theater in [[Bucharest]], in 1997.

Another important exhibition was that Ruxandra Garofeanu, Dan Hăulică, and Paul Gherasim organized in [[Bucharest]], in 2012 –&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; The Artist and the Power”-- covering the period 1950-1990, intending to show the artists' relationship to the polilical power during communism. Olos was included both in the section of the Baia Mare painting school, and that of the experimental artists.

=== The 2001 Murska-Sobota Triannial of small sculpture show in Slovenia ===
The artists' presence at Murska-Sobota show has a special place in his career, as it included the presentation of a „Manifesto”, an artistic statement that summed up his meditations on art and his „Olospolis”. Having the dimensions of a booklet entitled in the original Romanian version as „Carta”, and was published in the literary and cultural magazine Verso. Remembering those who had influenced his artistic progress and criticizing the artists who had not succeeded to find a similarly simple principle like the one he had found in structure of the spindle-knot. The artist who in his youth was open to any new trend in art seems less open to the postmodernist trend in arts.

'''Miniwaste&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miniwaste.eu/?lang=EN#/ Miniwaste website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acrplus.org/miniwaste/ ACR+ - Miniwaste project presentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921091134/http://www.acrplus.org/miniwaste |date=2011-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''' was a European project operated from January 2010 to December 2012, designed to "bring bio-waste back to life". In other words, it was intended to demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of bio-waste at a local level. The project was co-funded by the LIFE+ programme of the European Commission. The project emphasized the efficiency and sustainability of bio-waste reduction actions at source, in particular by organising demonstration actions and trainings for the population, and by offering a better way of evaluating and controlling waste prevention.

==Main goals==

The project endeavors to demonstrate, in accordance with the recent [[Waste Framework Directive]], that it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of organic waste (also called "[[bio-waste]]", covering both food and green waste) at the source in a sustainable way, and to monitor actions for waste reduction in an efficient manner.

The Miniwaste project has four main objectives:
* to gather and share good practices and case studies, which allow to reduce bio-waste and are implemented by European local and regional authorities (for instance, composting);
* to reduce bio-waste in the partner countries (namely France, Portugal and the Czech Republic), by implementing '''demonstration actions''' at different scales;
* to develop and implement monitoring procedures, such as a computerised tool, allowing to assess the quality and the quantity of the compost;
* to disseminate the deliverables and results obtained by the partners, in order to provide guidance for European authorities in terms of bio-waste reduction.

==Partners==

The Miniwaste partners are the local authorities of [[Rennes Métropole]] (project leader, France), [[Brno]] (Czech Republic) and Lipor (urban area of Porto, Portugal), together with [http://www.acrplus.org/ ACR+] (Association of Cities and Regions for Recycling and Sustainable Resource Management) and [[Cemagref]] (a French composting research centre). Within the project, the three local authorities will seek, test and disseminate appropriate tools that will allow implementation and monitoring of actions for organic waste reduction on their territories. The project thus presents a way of integrating demonstrative actions at different scales (from pilot actions to large-scale actions) with different European partners.

==Events==

Apart from setting up a set of communication tools (project website, leaflet, newsletter, final report), two key events will take place in the course of the project:
* A technical workshop, which was held on 12–13 September in Brno (Czech Republic);
* Miniwaste final conference, which will take place on 20–21 November 2012 in Rennes (France).

==Reduction of bio-waste==

[[Bio-waste]] is kitchen waste (raw or cooked food waste) and green waste (garden and park waste). Reducing bio-waste can mainly be obtained by limiting food waste and by practicing collective or individual composting of food and green waste. According to studies, an average European produces between 100&amp;nbsp;kg and 250&amp;nbsp;kg of organic waste per year. 10% of this waste can be avoided by limiting food waste and almost 30 to 70% can be composted, including at source.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17733">{{See also|Mixture model|Compound probability distribution}}
In [[probability]] and [[statistics]], a '''mixture distribution''' is the [[probability distribution]] of a [[random variable]] that is derived from a collection of other random variables as follows: first, a random variable is selected by chance from the collection according to given probabilities of selection, and then the value of the selected random variable is realized. The underlying random variables may be random real numbers, or they may be [[random vector]]s (each having the same dimension), in which case the mixture distribution is a [[multivariate distribution]].

In cases where each of the underlying random variables is [[Continuous random variable|continuous]], the outcome variable will also be continuous and its [[probability density function]] is sometimes referred to as a '''mixture density'''. The [[cumulative distribution function]] (and the [[probability density function]] if it exists) can be expressed as a [[convex combination]] (i.e. a weighted sum, with non-negative weights that sum to 1) of other distribution functions and density functions. The individual distributions that are combined to form the mixture distribution are called the '''mixture components''', and the probabilities (or weights) associated with each component are called the '''mixture weights'''.  The number of components in mixture distribution is often restricted to being finite, although in some cases the components may be [[countable|countably infinite]]. More general cases (i.e. an [[uncountable]] set of component distributions), as well as the countable case, are treated under the title of '''[[compound probability distribution|compound distributions]]'''.

A distinction needs to be made between a [[random variable]] whose distribution function or density is the sum of a set of components  (i.e. a mixture distribution) and a random variable whose value is the sum of the values of two or more underlying random variables, in which case the distribution is given by the [[convolution]] operator.  As an example, the sum of two [[Multivariate normal distribution|jointly normally distributed]] random variables, each with different means, will still have a normal distribution.  On the other hand, a mixture density created as a mixture of two normal distributions with different means will have two peaks provided that the two means are far enough apart, showing that this distribution is radically different from a normal distribution.

Mixture distributions arise in many contexts in the literature and arise naturally where a [[statistical population]] contains two or more [[subpopulation]]s. They are also sometimes used as a means of representing non-normal distributions. Data analysis concerning [[statistical model]]s involving mixture distributions is discussed under the title of [[mixture model]]s, while the present article concentrates on simple probabilistic and statistical properties of mixture distributions and how these relate to properties of the underlying distributions.

== Finite and countable mixtures ==
[[Image:Gaussian-mixture-example.svg|thumb|Density of a mixture of three normal distributions (μ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, 10, 15, σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) with equal weights. Each component is shown as a weighted density (each integrating to 1/3)]]

Given a finite set of probability density functions ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), …, ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), or corresponding cumulative distribution functions  ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), …, ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') and '''weights''' ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''w&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that {{nowrap|''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ 0}} and {{nowrap|∑''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 1, }} the mixture distribution can be represented by writing either the density, ''f'',  or the distribution function, ''F'', as a sum (which in both cases is a convex combination):
:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, P_i(x), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, p_i(x) .&lt;/math&gt;
This type of mixture, being a finite sum, is called a '''finite mixture,''' and in applications, an unqualified reference to a "mixture density" usually means a finite mixture. The case of a countably infinite set of components is covered formally by allowing &lt;math&gt; n = \infty\!&lt;/math&gt;.

== Uncountable mixtures ==
{{Main article|Compound distribution}}

Where the set of component distributions is [[uncountable]], the result is often called a [[compound probability distribution]]. The construction of such distributions has a formal similarity to that of mixture distributions, with either infinite summations or integrals replacing the finite summations used for finite mixtures.

Consider a probability density function ''p''(''x'';''a'') for a variable ''x'', parameterized by ''a''. That is, for each value of ''a'' in some set ''A'', ''p''(''x'';''a'') is a probability density function with respect to ''x''. Given a probability density function ''w'' (meaning that ''w'' is nonnegative and integrates to 1), the function

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \int_A \, w(a) \, p(x;a) \, da &lt;/math&gt;

is again a probability density function for ''x''. A similar integral can be written for the cumulative distribution function. Note that the formulae here reduce to the case of a finite or infinite mixture if the density ''w'' is allowed to be a [[generalized function]] representing the "derivative" of the cumulative distribution function of a [[discrete distribution]].

==Mixtures within a parametric family==
The mixture components are often not arbitrary probability distributions, but instead are members of a [[parametric family]] (such as normal distributions), with different values for a parameter or parameters. In such cases, assuming that it exists, the density can be written in the form of a  sum as:
:&lt;math&gt; f(x; a_1, \ldots , a_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, p(x;a_i) &lt;/math&gt;
for one parameter, or
:&lt;math&gt; f(x; a_1, \ldots , a_n, b_1, \ldots , b_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, p(x;a_i,b_i) &lt;/math&gt;
for two parameters, and so forth.

== Properties ==

=== Convexity ===
A general [[linear combination]] of probability density functions is not necessarily a probability density, since it may be negative or it may integrate to something other than 1. However, a [[convex combination]] of probability density functions preserves both of these properties (non-negativity and integrating to 1), and thus mixture densities are themselves probability density functions.

=== Moments ===
Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denote random variables from the ''n'' component distributions, and let ''X'' denote a random variable from the mixture distribution. Then, for any function ''H''(·) for which &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[H(X_i)]&lt;/math&gt; exists, and assuming that the component densities ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') exist,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[H(X)] &amp; = \int_{-\infty}^\infty H(x) \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i p_i(x) \, dx \\
&amp; = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \int_{-\infty}^\infty p_i(x) H(x) \, dx = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \operatorname{E}[H(X_i)].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is a trivial matter to note that the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; moment about zero (i.e. choosing {{nowrap|''H''(''x'') {{=}} ''x&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;''}}) is simply a weighted average of the ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; moments of the components.  Moments about the mean {{nowrap|''H''(''x'') {{=}} (''x − μ'')&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;}} involve a binomial expansion:&lt;ref&gt;Frühwirth-Schnatter (2006, Ch.1.2.4)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\operatorname{E}[(X - \mu)^j] &amp; = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \operatorname{E}[(X_i - \mu_i + \mu_i - \mu)^j] \\
&amp; = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=0}^j \left( \begin{array}{c} j \\ k \end{array} \right) (\mu_i - \mu)^{j-k} w_i \operatorname{E}[(X_i- \mu_i)^k],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the mean of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component.

In case of a mixture of one-dimensional distributions with weights ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', means ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and variances ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the total mean and variance will be:
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[X] = \mu = \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \mu_i ,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}[(X - \mu)^2] = \sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i(\mu_i^{2} + \sigma_i^2) - \mu^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

These relations highlight the potential of mixture distributions to display non-trivial higher-order moments such as [[skewness]] and [[kurtosis]] ('''[[fat tail]]s''') and multi-modality, even in the absence of such features within the components themselves.  Marron and Wand (1992) give an illustrative account of the flexibility of this framework.&lt;ref name="Marron92"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Exact Mean Integrated Squared Error |first1=J.

===Modes===

The question of [[Multimodal distribution|multimodality]] is simple for some cases, such as mixtures of [[exponential distribution]]s: all such mixtures are [[Unimodality|unimodal]].&lt;ref&gt;Frühwirth-Schnatter (2006, Ch.1)&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the case of mixtures of [[normal distribution]]s, it is a complex one. Conditions for the number of modes in a multivariate normal mixture are explored by Ray and Lindsay&lt;ref name=rayLindsay&gt;{{citation

Here the problem of evaluation of the modes of a ''n'' component mixture in a ''D'' dimensional space is reduced to identification of critical points (local minima, maxima and saddle points) on a [[manifold]] referred to as the ridgeline surface, which is the image of the ridgeline function
:&lt;math&gt; x^{*}(\alpha) = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \Sigma_i^{-1} \right]^{-1} \times \left[  \sum_{i=1}^{n}  \alpha_i \Sigma_i^{-1} \mu_i \right],
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''α'' belongs to the {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} dimensional '''unit simplex'''
&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}_n  = 
 \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n: \alpha_i \in [0,1], \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i = 1 \}
&lt;/math&gt;
and {{nowrap|Σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''D'' × ''D''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;}} correspond to the covariance and mean of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; component.  Ray and Lindsay{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} consider the case in which {{nowrap|''n'' − 1 &lt; ''D''}} showing a one-to-one correspondence of modes of the mixture and those on the '''elevation function''' {{nowrap|''h''(''α'') {{=}} ''q''(''x*''(''α''))}}
thus one may identify the modes by solving  &lt;math&gt;  \frac{d h(\alpha)}{d \alpha} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;  with respect to ''α'' and determining the value ''x*''(''α'').

Using graphical tools, the potential multi-modality of {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} {2, 3}}} mixtures is demonstrated; in particular it is shown that the number of modes may exceed ''n'' and that the modes may not be coincident with the component means.   For two components they develop a graphical tool for analysis by instead solving the aforementioned differential with respect to ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and expressing the solutions as a function Π(''α''), {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ [0, 1]}} so that the number and location of modes for a given value of ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the number of intersections of the graph on the line {{nowrap|Π(''α'') {{=}} ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  This in turn can be related to the number of oscillations of the graph and therefore to solutions of &lt;math&gt; \frac{d \Pi(\alpha)}{d \alpha} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; leading to an explicit solution for a two component [[homoscedastic]] mixture given by
:&lt;math&gt;  1 - \alpha(1-\alpha) d_M(\mu_1, \mu_2, \Sigma)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where {{nowrap|''d&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''(''μ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Σ) {{=}} (''μ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt;Σ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''μ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the [[Mahalanobis distance]].

Since the above is quadratic it follows that in this instance there are at most two modes irrespective of the dimension or the weights.

== Examples ==

Simple examples can be given by a mixture of two normal distributions. (See [[Multimodal distribution#Mixture of two normal distributions]] for more details.)

Given an equal (50/50) mixture of two normal distributions with the same standard deviation and different means ([[homoscedastic]]), the overall distribution will exhibit low [[kurtosis]] relative to a single normal distribution – the means of the subpopulations fall on the shoulders of the overall distribution. If sufficiently separated, namely by twice the (common) standard deviation, so &lt;math&gt;\left|\mu_1 - \mu_2\right| &gt; 2\sigma,&lt;/math&gt; these form a [[bimodal distribution]], otherwise it simply has a wide peak.&lt;ref name="Schilling2002"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is Human Height Bimodal?|first1=Mark F. |last1=Schilling |first2= Ann E.| last2=Watkins|author2-link=Ann E. Watkins |first3=William |last3=Watkins| journal=[[The American Statistician]]| doi=10.1198/00031300265 |volume=56 |year=2002| pages=223–229 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variation of the overall population will also be greater than the variation of the two subpopulations (due to spread from different means), and thus exhibits [[overdispersion]] relative to a normal distribution with fixed variation &lt;math&gt;\sigma,&lt;/math&gt; though it will not be overdispersed relative to a normal distribution with variation equal to variation of the overall population.

Alternatively, given two subpopulations with the same mean and different standard deviations, the overall population will exhibit high kurtosis, with a sharper peak and heavier tails (and correspondingly shallower shoulders) than a single distribution.

== Applications ==
{{details|Mixture model}}
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
Mixture densities are complicated densities expressible in terms of simpler densities (the mixture components), and are used both because they provide a good model for certain data sets (where different subsets of the data exhibit different characteristics and can best be modeled separately), and because they can be more mathematically tractable, because the individual mixture components can be more easily studied than the overall mixture density.

Mixture densities can be used to model a [[statistical population]] with [[subpopulation]]s, where the mixture components are the densities on the subpopulations, and the weights are the proportions of each subpopulation in the overall population.

Mixture densities can also be used to model [[experimental error]] or contamination – one assumes that most of the samples measure the desired phenomenon,

Parametric statistics that assume no error often fail on such mixture densities – for example, statistics that assume normality often fail disastrously in the presence of even a few [[outliers]] – and instead one uses [[robust statistics]].

In [[meta-analysis]] of separate studies, [[study heterogeneity]] causes distribution of results to be a mixture distribution, and leads to [[overdispersion]] of results relative to predicted error. For example, in a [[statistical survey]], the [[margin of error]] (determined by sample size) predicts the [[sampling error]] and hence dispersion of results on repeated surveys. The presence of study heterogeneity (studies have different [[sampling bias]]) increases the dispersion relative to the margin of error.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51459">'''Modal logic''' is a type of [[mathematical logic#Formal logic|formal logic]] primarily developed in the 1960s that extends classical [[Propositional logic|propositional]] and [[predicate logic]] to include operators expressing [[Linguistic modality|modality]]. A modal—a word that expresses a modality—qualifies a statement. For example, the statement "John is happy" might be qualified by saying that John is [[usually]] happy, in which case the term "usually" is functioning as a modal. The traditional [[alethic modality|alethic modalities]], or modalities of truth, include [[Logical possibility|possibility]] ("Possibly, ''p''", "It is possible that ''p''"), necessity ("Necessarily, ''p''", "It is necessary that ''p''"), and impossibility ("Impossibly, ''p''", "It is impossible that ''p''").&lt;ref&gt;"Formal Logic", by A. N. Prior, Oxford Univ. Press, 1962, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Other modalities that have been formalized in modal logic include [[Temporal Logic|temporal]] modalities, or modalities of time (notably, "It was the case that ''p''", "It has always been that ''p''", "It will be that ''p''", "It will always be that ''p''"),&lt;ref&gt;"Temporal Logic", by Rescher and Urquhart, Springer-Verlag, 1971, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Past, Present and Future", by A. N. Prior, Oxford Univ. Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deontic logic|deontic]] modalities (notably, "It is obligatory that ''p''", and "It is permissible that ''p''"), [[Epistemic logic|epistemic]] modalities, or modalities of knowledge ("It is known that ''p''")&lt;ref&gt;"Knowledge and Belief", by Jaakko Hinntikka, Cornell Univ. Press, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doxastic logic|doxastic]] modalities, or modalities of belief ("It is believed that ''p''").&lt;ref&gt;"Topics in Philosophical Logic", by N. Rescher, Humanities Press, 1968, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

A formal modal logic represents modalities using [[modal operator]]s. For example, "It might rain today" and "It is possible that rain will fall today" both contain the notion of possibility. In a modal logic this is represented as an operator, "Possibly", attached to the sentence "It will rain today".

It is fallacious to confuse necessity and possibility. In particular, this is known as the [[modal fallacy]].

The basic [[Unary operation|unary]] (1-place) modal operators are usually written "□" for "Necessarily" and "◇" for "Possibly". In a [[classical modal logic]], each can be expressed by the other with [[negation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Diamond P \leftrightarrow \lnot \Box \lnot P;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Box P \leftrightarrow \lnot \Diamond \lnot P.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus it is ''possible'' that it will rain today if and only if it is ''not necessary'' that it will ''not'' rain today, and it is ''necessary'' that it will rain today if and only if it is ''not possible'' that it will ''not'' rain today. Alternative symbols used for the modal operators are "L" for "Necessarily" and "M" for "Possibly".&lt;ref&gt;So in the standard work ''A New Introduction to Modal Logic'', by G. E. Hughes and  M. J. Cresswell, Routledge, 1996, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of modal logic==
In addition to his non-modal syllogistic, [[Aristotle]] also developed a modal syllogistic in Book I of his ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' (chs 8–22), which [[Theophrastus]] attempted to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=logic-ancient |title=Ancient Logic |last=Bobzien |first=Susanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also passages in Aristotle's work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' §9, that are now seen as anticipations of the connection of modal logic with [[potentiality]] and time. In the Hellenistic period, the logicians [[Diodorus Cronus]], [[Philo the Dialectician]] and the Stoic [[Chrysippus]] each developed a modal system that accounted for the interdefinability of possibility and necessity, accepted axiom '''T''' (see [[#Axiomatic systems|below]]), and combined elements of modal logic and [[temporal logic]] in attempts to solve the notorious [[Diodorus Cronus#Master Argument|Master Argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Bobzien, S. (1993). "Chrysippus' Modal Logic and its Relation to Philo and Diodorus", in K. Doering &amp; Th. Ebert (eds), ''Dialektiker und Stoiker'', Stuttgart 1993, pp. 63–84.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [[Avicenna]], who ultimately developed a theory of "[[Temporal logic|temporally]] modal" syllogistic.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Modal logic as a self-aware subject owes much to the writings of the [[Scholastics]], in particular [[William of Ockham]] and [[John Duns Scotus]], who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about [[essence]] and [[accident (philosophy)|accident]].

[[C. I. Lewis]] founded modern modal logic in his 1910 Harvard thesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | type=Ph.D. thesis | url= | author=Clarence Irving Lewis | title=The Place of Intuition in Knowledge | institution=Harvard University | year=1910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a series of scholarly articles beginning in 1912. This work culminated in his 1932 book ''Symbolic Logic'' (with [[Cooper Harold Langford|C. H. Langford]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= | isbn= | author=Clarence Irving Lewis and Cooper Harold Langford | title=Symbolic Logic  | location= | publisher=Dover Publications | edition=1st | year=1932 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the five systems ''S1'' through ''S5''.

Ruth C. Barcan (later [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]]) developed the first axiomatic systems of quantified modal logic — first and second order extensions of Lewis' ''S2'', ''S4'', and ''S5''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ruth C. Barcan | title=A Functional Calculus of First Order  Based on Strict Implication | journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume=11 | number=1 | pages=1&amp;mdash;16 | date=Mar 1946 | doi=10.2307/2269159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ruth C.

The contemporary era in modal semantics began in 1959, when [[Saul Kripke]] (then only a 19-year-old [[Harvard University]] undergraduate) introduced the now-standard [[Kripke semantics]] for modal logics. These are commonly referred to as "possible worlds" semantics. Kripke and [[A. N. Prior]] had previously corresponded at some length. Kripke semantics is basically simple, but proofs are eased using semantic-tableaux or [[analytic tableaux]], as explained by [[Evert Willem Beth|E. W. Beth]].

[[A. N. Prior]] created modern [[temporal logic]], closely related to modal logic, in 1957 by adding modal operators [F] and [P] meaning "eventually" and "previously". [[Vaughan Pratt]] introduced [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] in 1976. In 1977, [[Amir Pnueli]] proposed using temporal logic to formalise the behaviour of continually operating concurrent programs. Flavors of temporal logic include [[propositional dynamic logic]] (PDL), [[propositional linear temporal logic]] (PLTL), [[linear temporal logic]] (LTL), [[computation tree logic]] (CTL), [[Hennessy–Milner logic]], and ''T''.{{clarify|reason=Add a wikilink, give a longer name, or give a reference for the 'T' logic.|date=November 2016}}

The mathematical structure of modal logic, namely [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s augmented with [[unary operation]]s (often called [[modal algebra]]s), began to emerge with [[J.C.C. McKinsey|J. C. C. McKinsey]]'s 1941 proof that ''S2'' and ''S4'' are decidable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McKinsey, J. C. C.|title=A Solution of the Decision Problem for the Lewis Systems S2 and S4, with an Application to Topology|journal=J. Symb. Log.|year=1941|volume=6|issue=4|pages=117–134|jstor=2267105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached full flower in the work of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his student [[Bjarni Jónsson]] (Jónsson and Tarski 1951–52). This work revealed that ''S4'' and ''S5'' are models of [[interior algebra]], a proper extension of Boolean algebra originally designed to capture the properties of the [[interior operator|interior]] and [[closure operator]]s of [[topology]]. Texts on modal logic typically do little more than mention its connections with the study of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and [[topology]]. For a thorough survey of the history of formal modal logic and of the associated mathematics, see [[Robert Goldblatt]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldbaltt, [http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~rob/papers/modalhist.pdf Mathematical Modal Logic: A view of it evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantics==

===Model theory===
The semantics for modal logic are usually given as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Fitting and Mendelsohn. ''First-Order Modal Logic''. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1998. Section 1.6&lt;/ref&gt; First we define a ''frame'', which consists of a non-empty set, ''G'', whose members are generally called possible worlds, and a binary relation, ''R'', that holds (or not) between the possible worlds of ''G''. This binary relation is called the ''[[accessibility relation]]''.  For example, ''w R u'' means that the  world ''u'' is accessible from world ''w''. That is to say, the state of affairs known as ''u'' is a live possibility for ''w''. This gives a pair, &lt;math&gt;\langle G, R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Some formulations of modal logic also include a constant term in ''G'', conventionally called "the actual world", which is often symbolized as &lt;math&gt;w*&lt;/math&gt;.

Next, the ''frame'' is extended to a ''model'' by specifying the [[truth-value]]s of all propositions at each of the worlds in ''G''. We do so by defining a relation ''v'' between possible worlds and positive literals. If there is a world ''w'' such that &lt;math&gt;v(w, P)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''P'' is true at ''w''. A model is thus an ordered triple, &lt;math&gt;\langle G, R, v \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we recursively define the truth of a formula at a world in a model:

* if &lt;math&gt;v(w, P)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;w \models P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w \models \neg P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w \not \models P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w \models (P \wedge Q) &lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w \models P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w \models Q&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w \models \Box P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every element ''u'' of ''G'', if ''w R u'' then &lt;math&gt;u \models P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;w \models \Diamond P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for some element ''u'' of ''G'', it holds that ''w R u'' and &lt;math&gt;u \models P&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\models P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;w* \models P&lt;/math&gt;

According to these semantics, a truth is ''necessary'' with respect to a possible world ''w'' if it is true at every world that is accessible to ''w'', and ''possible'' if it is true at some world that is accessible to ''w''. Possibility thereby depends upon the accessibility relation ''R'', which allows us to express the relative nature of possibility. For example, we might say that given our laws of physics it is not possible for humans to travel faster than the speed of light, but that given other circumstances it could have been possible to do so. Using the accessibility relation we can translate this scenario as follows: At all of the worlds accessible to our own world, it is not the case that humans can travel faster than the speed of light, but at one of these accessible worlds there is ''another'' world accessible from ''those'' worlds but not accessible from our own at which humans can travel faster than the speed of light.

It should also be noted that the definition of □ makes vacuously true certain sentences, since when it speaks of "every world that is accessible to ''w''" it takes for granted the usual mathematical interpretation of the word "every" (see [[vacuous truth]]). Hence, if a world ''w'' doesn't have any accessible worlds, any sentence beginning with □ is true.

The different systems of modal logic are distinguished by the properties of their corresponding accessibility relations. There are several systems that have been espoused (often called ''frame conditions''). An accessibility relation is:

* '''[[reflexive relation|reflexive]]''' [[iff]] ''w R w'', for every ''w'' in ''G''
* '''[[symmetric relation|symmetric]]''' iff ''w R u'' implies ''u R w'', for all ''w'' and ''u'' in ''G''
* '''[[transitive relation|transitive]]''' iff ''w R u'' and ''u R q'' together imply ''w R q'', for all ''w'', ''u'', ''q'' in ''G''.
* '''[[serial relation|serial]]''' iff, for each ''w'' in ''G'' there is some ''u'' in ''G'' such that ''w R u''.
* '''[[euclidean relation|Euclidean]]''' iff, for every ''u'', ''t'', and ''w'', ''w R u'' and ''w R t'' implies ''u R t'' (note that it also implies: ''t R u'')

The logics that stem from these frame conditions are:
*'''K''' := no conditions
*'''D''' := serial
*'''T''' := reflexive
*'''B''' := reflexive and symmetric
*'''S4''' := [[preorder|reflexive and transitive]]
*'''S5''' := reflexive and [[euclidean relation|Euclidean]]

The Euclidean property along with reflexivity yields symmetry and transitivity. (The Euclidean property can be obtained, as well, from symmetry and transitivity.) Hence if the accessibility relation ''R'' is reflexive and Euclidean, ''R'' is provably [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]] as well. Hence for models of S5, ''R'' is an [[equivalence relation]], because ''R'' is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

We can prove that these frames produce the same set of valid sentences as do the frames where all worlds can see all other worlds of ''W'' (''i.e.'', where ''R'' is a "total" relation). This gives the corresponding ''modal graph'' which is total complete (''i.e.'', no more edges (relations) can be added). For example, in any modal logic based on frame conditions:
: &lt;math&gt;w \models \Diamond P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for some element ''u'' of ''G'', it holds that &lt;math&gt;u \models P&lt;/math&gt; and ''w R u''.

If we consider frames based on the total relation we can just say that
: &lt;math&gt;w \models \Diamond P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for some element ''u'' of ''G'', it holds that &lt;math&gt;u \models P&lt;/math&gt;.
We can drop the accessibility clause from the latter stipulation because in such total frames it is trivially true of all ''w'' and ''u'' that ''w R u''. But note that this does not have to be the case in all S5 frames, which can still consist of multiple parts that are fully connected among themselves but still disconnected from each other.

All of these logical systems can also be defined axiomatically, as is shown in the next section. For example, in S5, the axioms &lt;math&gt;P \implies \Box\Diamond P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Box P \implies \Box\Box P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Box P \implies P&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to ''symmetry'', ''transitivity'' and ''reflexivity'', respectively) hold, whereas at least one of these axioms does not hold in each of the other, weaker logics.

===Axiomatic systems===
The first formalizations of modal logic were axiomatic. Numerous variations with very different properties have been proposed since [[C. I. Lewis]] began working in the area in 1910. [[George Edward Hughes|Hughes]] and [[Max John Cresswell|Cresswell]] (1996), for example, describe 42 [[normal modal logic|normal]] and 25 non-normal modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes some systems Hughes and Cresswell omit.

Modern treatments of modal logic begin by augmenting the [[propositional calculus]] with two unary operations, one denoting "necessity" and the other "possibility". The notation of [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C. I. Lewis]], much employed since, denotes "necessarily ''p''" by a prefixed "box" (□''p'') whose scope is established by parentheses. Likewise, a prefixed "diamond" (◇''p'') denotes "possibly ''p''". Regardless of notation, each of these operators is definable in terms of the other in classical modal logic:
* □''p'' (necessarily ''p'') is equivalent to {{math|¬◇¬''p''}} ("not possible that not-''p''")
* ◇''p'' (possibly ''p'') is equivalent to {{math|¬□¬''p''}} ("not necessarily not-''p''")
Hence □ and ◇ form a [[duality (mathematics)#Duality in logic and set theory|dual pair]] of operators.

In many modal logics, the necessity and possibility operators satisfy the following analogues of [[de Morgan's laws]] from [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]:

:"It is '''not necessary that''' ''X''" is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to "It is '''possible that not''' ''X''".
:"It is '''not possible that''' ''X''" is logically equivalent to "It is '''necessary that not''' ''X''".

Precisely what axioms and rules must be added to the [[propositional calculus]] to create a usable system of modal logic is a matter of philosophical opinion, often driven by the theorems one wishes to prove; or, in computer science, it is a matter of what sort of computational or deductive system one wishes to model.  Many modal logics, known collectively as [[normal modal logic]]s, include the following rule and axiom:
* '''N''', '''Necessitation Rule''': If ''p'' is a [[theorem]] (of any system invoking '''N'''), then □''p'' is likewise a theorem.
* '''K''', '''Distribution Axiom''': {{math|□(''p'' → ''q'') → (□''p'' → □''q'').}}

The weakest [[normal modal logic]], named ''K'' in honor of [[Saul Kripke]], is simply the [[propositional calculus]] augmented by □, the rule '''N''', and the axiom '''K'''. ''K'' is weak in that it fails to determine whether a proposition can be necessary but only contingently necessary. That is, it is not a theorem of ''K'' that if □''p'' is true then □□''p'' is true, i.e., that necessary truths are "necessarily necessary". If such perplexities are deemed forced and artificial, this defect of ''K'' is not a great one. In any case, different answers to such questions yield different systems of modal logic.

Adding axioms to ''K'' gives rise to other well-known modal systems. One cannot prove in ''K'' that if "''p'' is necessary" then ''p'' is true. The axiom '''T''' remedies this defect:
*'''T''', '''Reflexivity Axiom''': {{math|□''p'' → ''p''}} (If ''p'' is necessary, then ''p'' is the case.) 
'''T''' holds in most but not all modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes a few exceptions, such as ''S1&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''.

Other well-known elementary axioms are:
*'''4''': &lt;math&gt; \Box p \to \Box \Box p&lt;/math&gt;
*'''B''': &lt;math&gt; p \to \Box \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;
*'''D''': &lt;math&gt; \Box p \to \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;
*'''5''': &lt;math&gt; \Diamond p \to \Box \Diamond p &lt;/math&gt;

These yield the systems (axioms in bold, systems in italics):
*''K'' := '''K''' + '''N'''
*''T'' := ''K'' + '''T'''
*''S4'' := ''T'' + '''4'''
*''S5'' :=  ''S4'' + '''5'''
*''D'' := ''K'' + '''D'''.
''K'' through ''S5'' form a nested hierarchy of systems, making up the core of [[normal modal logic]]. But specific rules or sets of rules may be appropriate for specific systems. For example, in deontic logic, &lt;math&gt; \Box p \to \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt; (If it ought to be that ''p'', then it is permitted that ''p'') seems appropriate, but we should probably not include that &lt;math&gt; p \to \Box \Diamond p&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, to do so is to commit the [[naturalistic fallacy]] (i.e. to state that what is natural is also good, by saying that if ''p'' is the case, ''p'' ought to be permitted).

The commonly employed system ''S5'' simply makes all modal truths necessary. For example, if ''p'' is possible, then it is "necessary" that ''p'' is possible. Also, if ''p'' is necessary, then it is necessary that ''p'' is necessary. Other systems of modal logic have been formulated, in part because ''S5'' does not describe every kind of modality of interest.

===Structural proof theory===
Sequent calculi and systems of natural deduction have been developed for several modal logics, but it has proven hard to combine generality with other features expected of good [[structural proof theories]], such as purity (the proof theory does not introduce extra-logical notions such as labels) and analyticity (the logical rules support a clean notion of [[analytic proof]]).  More complex calculi have been applied to modal logic to achieve generality.

===Decision methods===
[[Analytic tableaux]] provide the most popular decision method for modal logics.

==Alethic logic==
{{main|Alethic modality}}
Modalities of necessity and possibility are called ''alethic'' modalities.  They are also sometimes called ''special'' modalities, from the [[Latin]] ''species''. Modal logic was first developed to deal with these concepts, and only afterward was extended to others.  For this reason, or perhaps for their familiarity and simplicity, necessity and possibility are often casually treated as ''the'' subject matter of modal logic. Moreover, it is easier to make sense of relativizing necessity, e.g. to legal, physical, nomological, epistemic, and so on, than it is to make sense of relativizing other notions.

In [[classical modal logic]], a proposition is said to be
*'''possible''' if it is ''not necessarily false'' (regardless of whether it is actually true or actually false);
*'''necessary''' if it is ''not possibly false'' (i.e. true and necessarily true);
*'''contingent''' if it is ''not necessarily false'' and ''not necessarily true'' (i.e. possible but not necessarily true);
*'''impossible''' if it is ''not possibly true'' (i.e. false and necessarily false).

In classical modal logic, therefore, the notion of either possibility or necessity may be taken to be basic, where these other notions are defined in terms of it in the manner of [[De Morgan duality]]. [[Intuitionistic modal logic]] treats possibility and necessity as not perfectly symmetric.

For example, suppose that while walking to the convenience store we pass Friedrich's house, and observe that the lights are off. On the way back, we observe that they have been turned on.
* "Somebody or something turned the lights on" is ''necessary''.
* "Friedrich turned the lights on", "Friedrich's roommate Max turned the lights on" and "A burglar named Adolf broke into Friedrich's house and turned the lights on" are ''contingent''.
* All of the above statements are ''possible''.
* It is ''impossible'' that [[Socrates]] (who has been dead for over two thousand years) turned the lights on.
(Of course, this analogy does not apply alethic modality in a ''truly'' rigorous fashion; for it to do so, it would have to axiomatically make such statements as "human beings cannot rise from the dead", "Socrates was a human being and not an immortal vampire", and "we did not take hallucinogenic drugs which caused us to falsely believe the lights were on", ''ad infinitum''. Absolute certainty of truth or falsehood exists only in the sense of logically constructed abstract concepts such as "it is impossible to draw a triangle with four sides" and "all bachelors are unmarried".)

For those with difficulty with the concept of something being possible but not true, the meaning of these terms may be made more comprehensible by thinking of multiple "possible worlds" (in the sense of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) or "alternate universes"; something "necessary" is true in all possible worlds, something "possible" is true in at least one possible world.  These "possible world semantics" are formalized with [[Kripke semantics]].

===Physical possibility===
Something is physically, or nomically, possible if it is permitted by the [[physical law|laws of physics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} For example, current theory is thought to allow for there to be an [[atom]] with an [[atomic number]] of 126,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Superheavy Element 114 Confirmed: A Stepping Stone to the Island of Stability|url=http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2009/09/24/114-confirmed/|work=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|date=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if there are no such atoms in existence.  In contrast, while it is logically possible (i.e. probably via [[Alcubierre drive]] or [[worm holes]]){{Clarify|date=February 2014}} to accelerate beyond the [[speed of light]],&lt;ref name="Feinberg67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feinberg |first=G. |year=1967 |title=Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=159 |issue=5 |pages=1089–1105 |bibcode=1967PhRv..159.1089F |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089}} See also Feinberg's later paper: Phys. Rev. D 17, 1651 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; modern science stipulates that it is not physically possible for material particles or information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Einstein | first = Albert | authorlink = Albert Einstein | title = Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 17 | pages = 891–921 | date = 1905-06-30|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..891E |doi = 10.1002/andp.19053221004 | issue = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical possibility===
[[Philosophers]]{{who|date=April 2012}} ponder the properties that objects have independently of those dictated by scientific laws. For example, it might be metaphysically necessary, as some who advocate [[physicalism]] have thought, that all thinking beings have bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stoljar|first1=Daniel|title=Physicalism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/physicalism/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can experience the passage of [[time]]. [[Saul Kripke]] has argued that every person necessarily has the parents they do have: anyone with different parents would not be the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Saul Kripke. ''Naming and Necessity''. Harvard University Press, 1980. pg 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysical possibility has been thought to be more restricting than bare logical possibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=Judith and Alex Byrne|title=Content and Modality : Themes from the Philosophy of Robert Stalnaker|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXeOkXnCwb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., fewer things are metaphysically possible than are logically possible). However, its exact relation (if any) to logical possibility or to physical possibility is a matter of dispute. Philosophers{{who|date=April 2012}} also disagree over whether metaphysical truths are necessary merely "by definition", or whether they reflect some underlying deep facts about the world, or something else entirely.

==Epistemic logic==
{{Main|Epistemic logic}}

'''Epistemic modalities''' (from the Greek ''episteme'', knowledge), deal with the ''certainty'' of sentences.  The □ operator is translated as  "x knows that…", and the ◇ operator is translated as "For all x knows, it may be true that…"  In ordinary speech both metaphysical and epistemic modalities are often expressed in similar words; the following contrasts may help:

A person, Jones, might reasonably say ''both'': (1) "No, it is ''not'' possible that [[Bigfoot]] exists; I am quite certain of that"; ''and'', (2) "Sure, it's ''possible'' that Bigfoots could exist". What Jones means by (1) is that, given all the available information, there is no question remaining as to whether Bigfoot exists. This is an epistemic claim. By (2) he makes the ''metaphysical'' claim that it is ''possible for'' Bigfoot to exist, ''even though he does not'': there is no physical or biological reason that large, featherless, bipedal creatures with thick hair could not exist in the forests of North America (regardless of whether or not they do). Similarly, "it is possible for the person reading this sentence to be fourteen feet tall and named Chad" is ''metaphysically'' true (such a person would not somehow be prevented from doing so on account of their height and name), but not ''alethically'' true unless you match that description, and not ''epistemically'' true if it's known that fourteen-foot-tall human beings have never existed.

From the other direction, Jones might say, (3) "It is ''possible'' that [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true; but also ''possible'' that it is false", and ''also'' (4) "if it ''is'' true, then it is necessarily true, and not possibly false". Here Jones means that it is ''epistemically possible'' that it is true or false, for all he knows (Goldbach's conjecture has not been proven either true or false), but if there ''is'' a proof (heretofore undiscovered), then it would show that it is not ''logically'' possible for Goldbach's conjecture to be false—there could be no set of numbers that violated it. Logical possibility is a form of ''alethic'' possibility; (4) makes a claim about whether it is possible (i.e., logically speaking) that a mathematical truth to have been false, but (3) only makes a claim about whether it is possible, for all Jones knows, (i.e., speaking of certitude) that the mathematical claim is specifically either true or false, and so again Jones does not contradict himself.  It is worthwhile to observe that Jones is not necessarily correct: It is possible (epistemically) that Goldbach's conjecture is both true and unprovable.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Goldbach's conjecture#Origins|Goldbach's conjecture – Origins]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Epistemic possibilities also bear on the actual world in a way that metaphysical possibilities do not. Metaphysical possibilities bear on ways the world ''might have been,'' but epistemic possibilities bear on the way the world ''may be'' (for all we know). Suppose, for example, that I want to know whether or not to take an umbrella before I leave. If you tell me "it is ''possible that'' it is raining outside" – in the sense of epistemic possibility – then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella. But if you just tell me that "it is ''possible for'' it to rain outside" – in the sense of ''metaphysical possibility'' – then I am no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment.

Some features of epistemic modal logic are in debate. For example, if ''x'' knows that ''p'', does ''x'' know that it knows that ''p''? That is to say, should □''P'' → □□''P'' be an axiom in these systems? While the answer to this question is unclear,&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Blindsight]] and [[Subliminal perception]] for negative empirical evidence&lt;/ref&gt; there is at least one axiom that is generally included in epistemic modal logic, because it is minimally true of all normal modal logics (see [[Modal logic#Axiomatic systems|the section on axiomatic systems]]):
* '''K''', ''Distribution Axiom'': &lt;math&gt; \Box (p \to q) \to (\Box p \to \Box q)&lt;/math&gt;.

It has been questioned whether the epistemic and alethic modalities should be considered distinct from each other. The criticism states that there is no real difference between "the truth in the world" (alethic) and "the truth in an individual's mind" (epistemic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Eschenroeder |first=Erin |author2=Sarah Mills |author3=Thao Nguyen |title=The Expression of Modality|editor=William Frawley|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter| date=2006-09-30 |series=The Expression of Cognitive Categories|pages=8–9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=72URszHq2SEC&amp;pg=PT18| isbn=3-11-018436-2 | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities are formally distinguished, as by the means of a [[grammatical mood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuyts|first=Jan|title=Epimestic Modality, Language, and Conceptualization: A Cognitive-pragmatic Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Co|date=November 2000|series=Human Cognitive Processing|page=28|isbn=90-272-2357-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal logic==
{{Main|Temporal logic}}

Temporal logic is an approach to the semantics of expressions with [[Grammatical tense|tense]], that is, expressions with qualifications of when.  Some expressions, such as  '2 + 2 = 4', are true at all times, while tensed expressions such as 'John is happy' are only true sometimes.

In temporal logic, tense constructions are treated in terms of modalities, where a standard method for formalizing talk of time is to use ''two'' pairs of operators, one for the past and one for the future (P will just mean 'it is presently the case that P'). For example:

:'''F'''''P'' : It will sometimes be the case that ''P''
:'''G'''''P'' : It will always be the case that ''P''
:'''P'''''P'' : It was sometime the case that ''P''
:'''H'''''P'' : It has always been the case that ''P''

There are then at least three modal logics that we can develop. For example, we can stipulate that,

:&lt;math&gt; \Diamond P &lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' is the case at some time ''t''
:&lt;math&gt; \Box P &lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' is the case at every time ''t''

Or we can trade these operators to deal only with the future (or past). For example,

:&lt;math&gt; \Diamond_1 P &lt;/math&gt; = '''F'''''P''
:&lt;math&gt; \Box_1 P &lt;/math&gt; = '''G'''''P''

or,

:&lt;math&gt; \Diamond_2 P&lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' and/or '''F'''''P''
:&lt;math&gt; \Box_2 P &lt;/math&gt; = ''P'' and '''G'''''P''

The operators '''F''' and '''G''' may seem initially foreign, but they create [[normal modal logic|normal modal systems]]. Note that '''F'''''P'' is the same as ¬'''G'''¬''P''. We can combine the above operators to form complex statements. For example, '''P'''''P'' → □'''P'''''P'' says (effectively), ''Everything that is past and true is necessary''.

It seems reasonable to say that possibly it will rain tomorrow, and possibly it won't; on the other hand, since we can't change the past, if it is true that it rained yesterday, it probably isn't true that it may not have rained yesterday. It seems the past is "fixed", or necessary, in a way the future is not. This is sometimes referred to as [[accidental necessity]]. But if the past is "fixed", and everything that is in the future will eventually be in the past, then it seems plausible to say that future events are necessary too.

Similarly, the [[problem of future contingents]] considers the semantics of assertions about the future: is either of the propositions 'There will be a sea battle tomorrow', or 'There will not be a sea battle tomorrow' now true?  Considering this thesis led [[Aristotle]] to reject the [[principle of bivalence]] for assertions concerning the future.

Additional binary operators are also relevant to temporal logics, ''q.v.'' [[Linear Temporal Logic]].

Versions of temporal logic can be used in [[computer science]] to model computer operations and prove theorems about them. In one version, ◇''P'' means "at a future time in the computation it is possible that the computer state will be such that P is true"; □''P'' means "at all future times in the computation P will be true". In another version, ◇''P'' means "at the immediate next state of the computation, ''P'' might be true"; □''P'' means "at the immediate next state of the computation, P will be true". These differ in the choice of [[Accessibility relation]]. (P always means "P is true at the current computer state".) These two examples involve nondeterministic or not-fully-understood computations; there are many other modal logics specialized to different types of program analysis. Each one naturally leads to slightly different axioms.

==Deontic logic==
{{Main|Deontic logic}}

Likewise talk of morality, or of [[obligation]] and [[norm (philosophy)|norms]] generally, seems to have a modal structure.  The difference between "You must do this" and "You may do this" looks a lot like the difference between "This is necessary" and "This is possible".  Such logics are called ''[[deontic logic|deontic]]'', from the Greek for "duty".

Deontic logics commonly lack the axiom '''T''' semantically corresponding to the reflexivity of the accessibility relation in [[Kripke semantics]]: in symbols, &lt;math&gt;\Box\phi\to\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Interpreting □ as "it is obligatory that", '''T''' informally says that every obligation is true. For example, if it is obligatory not to kill others (i.e. killing is morally forbidden), then '''T''' implies that people actually do not kill others. The consequent is obviously false.

Instead, using [[Kripke semantics]], we say that though our own world does not realize all obligations, the worlds accessible to it do (i.e., '''T''' holds at these worlds). These worlds are called idealized worlds. ''P'' is obligatory with respect to our own world if at all idealized worlds accessible to our world, ''P'' holds. Though this was one of the first interpretations of the formal semantics, it has recently come under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite journal |first=Sven |last=Hansson |title=Ideal Worlds—Wishful Thinking in Deontic Logic |journal=Studia Logica |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=329–336 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11225-006-8100-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One other principle that is often (at least traditionally) accepted as a deontic principle is ''D'', &lt;math&gt;\Box\phi\to\Diamond\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to the seriality (or extendability or unboundedness) of the accessibility relation. It is an embodiment of the Kantian idea that "ought implies can". (Clearly the "can" can be interpreted in various senses, e.g. in a moral or alethic sense.)

===Intuitive problems with deontic logic===
When we try and formalize ethics with standard modal logic, we run into some problems. Suppose that we have a proposition ''K'': you have stolen some money, and another, ''Q'': you have stolen a small amount of money. Now suppose we want to express the thought that "if you have stolen some money, it ought to be a small amount of money". There are two likely candidates,
: (1) &lt;math&gt;(K \to \Box Q)&lt;/math&gt;
: (2) &lt;math&gt;\Box (K \to Q)&lt;/math&gt;

But (1) and ''K'' together entail □''Q'', which says that it ought to be the case that you have stolen a small amount of money. This surely isn't right, because you ought not to have stolen anything at all. And (2) doesn't work either: If the right representation of "if you have stolen some money it ought to be a small amount" is (2), then the right representation of (3) "if you have stolen some money then it ought to be a large amount" is &lt;math&gt;\Box (K \to (K \land \lnot Q))&lt;/math&gt;. Now suppose (as seems reasonable) that you ought not to steal anything, or &lt;math&gt;\Box \lnot K&lt;/math&gt;. But then we can deduce &lt;math&gt;\Box (K \to (K \land \lnot Q))&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;\Box (\lnot K) \to \Box (K \to K \land \lnot K)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Box (K \land \lnot K \to (K \land \lnot Q)) &lt;/math&gt; (the [[contrapositive]] of &lt;math&gt;Q \to K&lt;/math&gt;); so sentence (3) follows from our hypothesis (of course the same logic shows sentence (2)). But that can't be right, and is not right when we use natural language. Telling someone they should not steal certainly does not imply that they should steal large amounts of money if they do engage in theft.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Sider's ''Logic for Philosophy'', unknown page. http://tedsider.org/books/lfp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doxastic logic ==
{{Main|Doxastic logic}}

''Doxastic logic'' concerns the logic of belief (of some set of agents). The term doxastic is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] ''doxa'' which means "belief". Typically, a doxastic logic uses □, often written "B", to mean "It is believed that", or when relativized to a particular agent s, "It is believed by s that".

==Other modal logics==
{{See also|Intensional logic}}
Significantly, modal logics can be developed to accommodate most of these idioms; it is the fact of their common logical structure (the use of "intensional" sentential operators) that make them all varieties of the same thing.

== The ontology of possibility ==
{{Further| Accessibility relation|Possible worlds}}
In the most common interpretation of modal logic, one considers "[[logically possible]] worlds". If a statement is true in all [[possible worlds]], then it is a necessary truth. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is not true in all possible worlds, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some possible world (not necessarily our own) is called a possible truth.

Under this "possible worlds idiom," to maintain that Bigfoot's existence is possible but not actual, one says, "There is some possible world in which Bigfoot exists; but in the actual world, Bigfoot does not exist". However, it is unclear what this claim commits us to. Are we really alleging the existence of possible worlds, every bit as real as our actual world, just not actual? [[Saul Kripke]] believes that 'possible world' is something of a misnomer – that the term 'possible world' is just a useful way of visualizing the concept of possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Naming and Necessity''. (1980; Harvard UP), pp. 43–5.&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the sentences "you could have rolled a 4 instead of a 6" and "there is a possible world where you rolled a 4, but you rolled a 6 in the actual world" are not significantly different statements, and neither commit us to the existence of a possible world.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Naming and Necessity''. (1980; Harvard UP), pp. 15–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], on the other hand, made himself notorious by biting the bullet, asserting that all merely possible worlds are as real as our own, and that what distinguishes our world as ''actual'' is simply that it is indeed our world – ''[[Indexicality|this]]'' world.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis, ''On the Plurality of Worlds'' (1986; Blackwell)&lt;/ref&gt; That position is a major tenet of "[[modal realism]]". Some philosophers decline to endorse any version of modal realism, considering it ontologically extravagant, and prefer to seek various ways to paraphrase away these ontological commitments. [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] holds that 'possible worlds' are better thought of as 'world-stories', or consistent sets of propositions. Thus, it is possible that you rolled a 4 if such a state of affairs can be described coherently.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2214751 ''Theories of Actuality'']. Noûs, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Sep., 1974), particularly pp. 225–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer scientists will generally pick a highly specific interpretation of the modal operators specialized to the particular sort of computation being analysed.  In place of "all worlds", you may have "all possible next states of the computer", or "all possible future states of the computer".

==Further applications==
Modal logics have begun to be used in areas of the humanities such as literature, poetry, art and history.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.estherlederberg.com/EImages/Extracurricular/Dickens%20Universe/Counter%20Factuals.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew H.

==Controversies==
[[Nicholas Rescher]] has argued that [[Bertrand Russell]] rejected modal logic, and that this rejection led to the theory of modal logic languishing for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Bertrand Russell Memorial Volume|year=1979|publisher=George Allen and Unwin|location=London|pages=146|editor=George W. Roberts|chapter=Russell and Modal Logic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jan Dejnozka]] has argued against this view, stating that a modal system which Dejnozka calls ''MDL'' is described in Russell's works, although Russell did believe the concept of modality to "come from confusing propositions with [[propositional function]]s," as he wrote in ''The Analysis of Matter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Dejnozka |first=Jan|title=Ontological Foundations of Russell's Theory of Modality|journal=Erkenntnis| year=1990| volume=32| pages=383–418 |url=http://www.members.tripod.com/~Jan_Dejnozka/onto_found_russell_modality.pdf|accessdate=2012-10-22|doi=10.1007/bf00216469}}; quote is cited from {{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=The Analysis of Matter|year=1927|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Norman Prior]] warned [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] to prepare well in the debates concerning quantified modal logic with [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], due to the biases against modal logic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], ''Modalities: Philosophical Essays'', Oxford University Press, 1993, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nepalese stone linga SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|Four-faced Mukhalinga, 10th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]]]]

In [[Hindu iconography]], '''Mukhalinga''' or '''Mukhalingam''' (literally "''linga with a face''", {{IAST|mukhaliṅga}}) is a [[linga]] with one or more human faces. The linga is an aniconic representation of the Hindu god [[Shiva]]. Mukhalingas may be of stone or can be made of a metal sheath, which covers the normal linga.

The mukhalinga generally has one, four or five faces. Mukhalingas having four faces are also regarded to have an invisible fifth face at the top of the linga. The four- and five-faced mukhalingas represent the five aspects of Shiva, which also relate to the classical elements and the cardinal directions.

The omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient God Siva for facilitating the individual souls to worship him has manifested himself into different forms.Among them the formless form of Sivalinga is classified as "Nishkala". And the Shivalingas with the head of Shiva on their face are called as Mukhalinga and are classified as "Sakala nishkala" form.&lt;ref name="alayam"&gt;ALAYAM : The Hindu Temple;An Epitome of Hindu Culture; G.Venkataramana Reddy; Published by Adhyaksha; Sri Ramakrishna Math; {{ISBN|978-81-7823-542-4}} ; Page 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography of stone Mukhalingas in texts==
The iconography and making of the mukhalinga is prescribed in the [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and the [[Tantras]].&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"&gt;Rao pp. 86-88&lt;/ref&gt; These sculptured lingas fall under the classification of ''manusha-linga'' ("man-made lingas"), the other category being [[Swayambhu]] or naturally occurring lingas.&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"/&gt; A ''manusha-linga'' has three parts: the ''Brahma-bhaga'', the lowest part of the linga which is a square platform; ''Vishnu-bhaga'' - the middle section of the linga with a pedestal or ''pitha'' and ''Rudra-bhaga'', the topmost part of the central shaft with a rounded tip.&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"/&gt; Mukhalinga should be ''sarvasama'' ("all-equal"), where the three parts are equal. On the topmost ''rudra-bhaga'' or ''puja-bhaga'', one face and a maximum of five faces may be carved. If the sanctum (''[[garbhagriha]]'') has only one door, then the linga should have only one face on the front (the east), facing the door. In case of two doors, it should have two faces - front and back - facing the doors in the east and the west. In case of three doors, the linga should have three faces, except in the west. When the shrine has four doors, the linga may have four or five faces. The four faces should face the doors in the four cardinal directions; in addition if a fifth face exists, it should be carved on the top and face the front, the east. When mukhalinga is four-faced, instead of only faces, the [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]]s of the deities are carved on the four side; each having two arms.&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"/&gt;

The stone mukhalingas may be depicted comprising just of the central shaft, but may be part of the full assemble, where the shaft is embedded in the ''pitha'' pedestal, denoting the [[yoni]], the female sexual organ.&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kossak143"&gt;Kossak p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

==Mukhalingas as metal sheaths==

A normal linga may be converted into a mukhalinga by covering with a ''kavacha'' ("armour"), a metal (generally gold) covering carved in the shape of the head of Shiva. It has displays the [[third eye]] of Shiva on the forehead, the crescent moon over his head and a crown.&lt;ref name="Daniélou1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Alain Daniélou]]|title=The Phallus: Sacred Symbol of Male Creative Power|date=1995|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-1-59477-731-8|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The covering or sheath is also known as a ''kosha'' or ''linga-kosha'', and can be called of metal alloys, gold or silver or&lt;ref name="HardyCucarzi2009"/&gt; copper.&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt; Another form of cover is carved in shape of a linga, with a rounded top, with four faces carved on four sides.&lt;ref name="Pal1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pratapaditya Pal|title=Art of Nepal: A Catalogue of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zt9e6Ttr_IcC&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 January 1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-05407-3|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==One-faced Mukhalinga==
The one-faced mukhalinga is called ''eka-mukhalinga'', "linga with a single face". The face is created in high relief. He wears his hair piled on his head like a bun, while longer hair flow over his shoulders.&lt;ref name="Kossak94"&gt;Kossak p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; He may also wear earrings and a necklace and have the crescent moon on his head and the third eye on the forehead.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; The faces of Shiva are carved generally from the ear onwards, emerging from the linga.&lt;ref name="Kramrisch178"&gt;Kramrisch  p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mukhalingam from Kunnath Thali mahadeva TempleDSC 2043.jpg|Mukhalinga from Kunnath Thali Mahadeva Temple Kerala|thumb|right]]
The five-faced mukhalinga is called ''pancha-mukhalinga''. The five faces relate Shiva to the classical elements, the directions, the five senses and five parts of the body. These represent Shiva's five aspects: [[Sadyojata]], [[Vamadeva]], [[Bhairava|Aghora]], [[Tatpurusha]] and [[Ishana]].&lt;ref name="Daniélou1995"/&gt; A four-faced linga is said also to represent the five aspects of Shiva, the fifth aspect is center, the shaft itself or is assumed to be emerging from the top of the shaft and denotes the [[Nirguna Brahman|formless Absolute]].&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal1985"/&gt; Thus, a four-faced mukhalinga can be also called a ''pancha-mukhalinga'' ("linga with five faces" of Shiva).&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt; These four-faced lingas are the most commonly found mukhalingas.

The 13th Century A.D. pancha mukha sivalinga is in Kalahasti, [[Andhra Pradesh]].The fifth face would not be shown to highlight the Nishkala character of Sivalinga.&lt;ref&gt;ALAYAM : The Hindu Temple;An Epitome of Hindu Culture; G.Venkataramana Reddy;  Published by Adhyaksha; Sri Ramakrishna Math; {{ISBN|978-81-7823-542-4}} ; Page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The top face is known as Ishana or Sadashiva, who is rarely depicted and governs zenith and the sky ([[Akasha]]). The east face is Sadyojata or Mahadeva, the regent of the earth ([[Prithvi]]). The west face is Tatpurusha or [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] (Shiva's bull mount) or Nandivaktra (the face of Nandi), denoting the wind, [[Vayu]]. While Vamadeva or Uma ([[Parvati]], Shiva's consort) or Umavaktra (the face of Parvati) or Tamreshvara (water, [[Ap (water)|Ap]]) faces north, Aghora or [[Bhairava]] looks south (fire, [[Agni]]). In some texts, the east face is called Tatpurusha and the western one Sadyojata.&lt;ref name="Rao97ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kossak139"&gt;Kossak p.139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal1985"/&gt; The icon of the five aspects represents the entire universe.&lt;ref name="Pal1985"/&gt;

In Nepal, the four aspects have similar faces. They wear similar crowns and hairstyles and have Shiva's third eye. Mahadeva may have a moustache and has matted hair piled up on his head. Nandi bears on the forehead the sectarian mark ([[tilaka]]) of the [[Shaiva]]s (worshippers of Shiva) and floral earrings. The face of [[Uma (goddess)|Uma]] also bears the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] mark and depicts Shiva as [[Ardhanarishvara]], the composite androgynous form of Shiva and Parvati. The right half is the male Shiva with a moustache, while the left half is the female Parvati; the eyes, the lips, the earrings (a serpent and floral earring) as well as the sides of the crown may differ in the halves. [[Bhairava]], the terrible form of Shiva, is generally depicted angry; however may have a gentler expression. He wears serpent-earrings or asymmetrical earrings and has curled hair. All of them are depicted with two hands, carrying a [[akshamala]] (rosary) in the right and a water pot in the left. The rosary-bearing hand is held in [[abhayamudra]], gesture of assurance. The rosary signifies Death or Time, while the water-pot stands for its antithesis, ''[[amrita]]'', the elixir of life. The hands indicates that Shiva will lead his devotees to [[moksha]], emancipation.&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pal1985"/&gt;

Eight faced shivalinga is located at Mandsaur (Madhya Pradesh) along the banks of River Shivana locally known as "Ashtamukhi Pashupatinath" which is claimed to be unique in terms of its sculpture. The eight faces carved on the lingam exhibit eight moods / facial expressions facing the four directions , two each in one direction placed one above the other.

==Evolution==
Mukhalingas are found throughout India&lt;ref name="Daniélou1995"/&gt; and Nepal.&lt;ref name="Kossak139"/&gt; They also appear in the former [[Champa]] kingdom, presently in [[Vietnam]] as well as [[Cambodia]] and [[Borneo]] in the south east Asia&lt;ref name="HardyCucarzi2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew David Hardy|author2=Mauro Cucarzi|author3=Patrizia Zolese|title=Champa and the Archaeology of Mỹ Sơn (Vietnam)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fj8l8v_yP5oC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2009|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=978-9971-69-451-7|pages=138, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1961/JSS_054_1e_OConnor_EkamukhalingaFromPeninsularSiam.pdf | title=AN EKAMUKHALINGA FROM PENINSULAR SIAM | publisher=The Siam Society | work=The Journal of the Siam Society | date=1961 | accessdate=2 July 2014 | author=O'Connor, S.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Afghanistan to the west of India.&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philippe De Montebello|title=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide|year=1994|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-710-5|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of earliest specimen of a mukhalinga is a five-faced one in Bhita, which is dated to second century BCE.

[[Alain Daniélou]] says that mukhalingas of Shiva resemble similar depictions of phalluses with carved faces from Greece and those from [[Celts|Celtic]] Europe. He also notes the phalluses with full human figures are also found in France and India, citing the second-century icon of [[Gudimallam]] as an early example.&lt;ref name="Daniélou1995"/&gt;

An example of a Möbius strip can be created by taking a paper strip and giving it a half-twist, and then joining the ends of the strip to form a loop. However, the Möbius strip is not a surface of only one exact size and shape, such as the half-twisted paper strip depicted in the illustration.  Rather, mathematicians refer to the closed Möbius band as any surface that is [[homeomorphic]] to this strip.  Its boundary is a simple closed curve, i.e., homeomorphic to a circle. This allows for a very wide variety of geometric versions of the Möbius band as surfaces each having a definite size and shape.   For example, any rectangle can be glued to itself (by identifying one edge with the opposite edge after a reversal of orientation) to make a Möbius band.  Some of these can be smoothly modeled in  [[Euclidean space]], and others cannot.

A half-twist [[clockwise]] gives an embedding of the Möbius strip different from that of a half-twist counterclockwise – that is, as an embedded object in Euclidean space, the Möbius strip is a [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] object with right- or left-handedness. However, the underlying [[topological space]]s within the Möbius strip are homeomorphic in each case. An infinite number of topologically different embeddings of the same topological space into three-dimensional space exist, as the Möbius strip can also be formed by twisting the strip an odd number of times greater than one, or by knotting and twisting the strip, before joining its ends.  The complete open Möbius band is an example of a topological surface that is closely related to the standard Möbius strip, but that is not homeomorphic to it.

Finding [[algebraic variety|algebraic equations]], the solutions of which have the topology of a Möbius strip, is straightforward, but, in general, these equations do not describe the same geometric shape that one gets from the twisted paper model described above.  In particular, the twisted paper model is a [[developable surface]], having zero [[Gaussian curvature]].  A system of [[differential-algebraic equation]]s that describes models of this type was published in 2007 together with its numerical solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Starostin E.L. |author2=van der Heijden G.H.M. | title=The shape of a Möbius strip | journal=[[Nature Materials]] | url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v6/n8/abs/nmat1929.html | year=2007 | doi=10.1038/nmat1929 | volume = 6 | pages = 563–7 | pmid=17632519 | issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Euler characteristic]] of the Möbius strip is [[zero]].

==Properties==
[[File:Moebiusband-1s.svg|thumb|once cut Möbius strip: one non Möbius strip]]
[[File:Moebiusband-2s.svg|thumb|twice cut Möbius strip: one Möbius strip (purple), one non Möbius strip]]
The Möbius strip has several curious properties. A line drawn starting from the seam down the middle meets back at the seam, but at the other side. If continued, the line meets the starting point, and is double the length of the original strip. This single continuous curve demonstrates that the Möbius strip has only one [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]].

Cutting a Möbius strip along the center line with a pair of scissors yields one long strip with two full twists in it, rather than two separate strips; the result is not a Möbius strip. This happens because the original strip only has one edge that is twice as long as the original strip.  Cutting creates a second independent edge, half of which was on each side of the scissors. Cutting this new, longer, strip down the middle creates two strips wound around each other, each with two full twists.

If the strip is cut along about a third of the way in from the edge, it creates two strips: One is a thinner Möbius strip – it is the center third of the original strip, comprising one-third of the width and the same length as the original strip. The other is a longer but thin strip with two full twists in it – this is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the edge of the original strip, and it comprises one-third of the width and twice the length of the original strip.

Other analogous strips can be obtained by similarly joining strips with two or more half-twists in them instead of one. For example, a strip with three half-twists, when divided lengthwise, becomes a twisted strip tied in a [[trefoil knot]]. (If this knot is unravelled, the strip has eight half-twists.)  A strip with ''N'' half-twists, when bisected, becomes a strip with ''N'' + 1 full twists.  Giving it extra twists and reconnecting the ends produces figures called [[paradromic ring]]s.

[[File:MöbiusStripAsSquare.svg|thumb|To turn a [[rectangle]] into a Möbius strip, join the edges labelled ''A'' so that the directions of the arrows match.]]

One way to represent the Möbius strip as a subset of three-dimensional Euclidean space is using the parametrization:

:&lt;math&gt;x(u,v)= \left(1+\frac{v}{2} \cos \frac{u}{2}\right)\cos u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y(u,v)= \left(1+\frac{v}{2} \cos\frac{u}{2}\right)\sin u&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z(u,v)= \frac{v}{2}\sin \frac{u}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;0 \le u&lt; 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-1 \le v\le 1&lt;/math&gt;. This creates a Möbius strip of width 1 whose center circle has radius 1, lies in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt;-plane and is centered at &lt;math&gt;(0, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; runs around the strip while &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; moves from one edge to the other.

In [[cylindrical coordinates|cylindrical polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(r, \theta, z)&lt;/math&gt;, an unbounded version of the Möbius strip can be represented by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\log(r)\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta\right)=z\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}\theta\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Widest isometric embedding in 3-space ===
If a smooth Möbius strip in three-space is a rectangular one – that is, created from identifying two opposite sides of a geometrical rectangle with bending but not stretching the surface – then such an embedding is known to be possible if the aspect ratio of the rectangle is greater than the square root of three. (Note the shorter sides of the rectangle are identified to obtain the Möbius strip.) For an aspect ratio less than or equal to the square root of three, however, a smooth embedding of a rectangular Möbius strip into three-space may be impossible.

As the aspect ratio approaches the limiting ratio of {{sqrt|3}} from above, any such rectangular Möbius strip in three-space seems to approach a shape that in the limit can be thought of as a strip of three equilateral triangles, folded on top of one another so that they occupy just one equilateral triangle in three-space.

If the Möbius strip in three-space is only once continuously differentiable (in symbols: C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), however, then the theorem of Nash-Kuiper shows that no lower bound exists.

A method of making a Möbius strip from a rectangular strip too wide to simply twist and join (e.g., a rectangle only one unit long and one unit wide) is to first fold the wide direction back and forth using an even number of folds—an "accordion fold"—so that the folded strip becomes narrow enough that it can be twisted and joined, much as a single long-enough strip can be joined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Barr  |first = Stephen  |title = Experiments in Topology  |year = 1964 |publisher = Thomas Y. Crowell Company |location = New York |pages = 48,200–201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two folds, for example, a {{nowrap|1 × 1}} strip would become a {{nowrap|1 × ⅓}} folded strip whose [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is in the shape of an 'N' and would remain an 'N' after a half-twist. This folded strip, three times as long as it is wide, would be long enough to then join at the ends. This method works in principle, but becomes impractical after sufficiently many folds, if paper is used. Using normal paper, this construction can be [[Mathematics of paper folding#Flat folding|folded flat]], with all the layers of the paper in a single plane, but mathematically, whether this is possible without stretching the surface of the rectangle is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Fuchs and [[Serge Tabachnikov]], ''Mathematical Omnibus: Thirty Lectures on Classic Mathematics'', 2007, page 199, at http://www.math.psu.edu/tabachni/Books/taba.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Topology ===
[[Topology|Topologically]], the Möbius strip can be defined as the [[square (geometry)|square]] &lt;math&gt;[0, 1] \times [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; with its top and bottom sides [[Quotient space (topology)|identified]] by the relation &lt;math&gt;(x, 0) \sim (1 - x, 1)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le 1&lt;/math&gt;, as in the diagram on the right.

A less used presentation of the Möbius strip is as the topological quotient of a torus.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Phillips, ''[http://www.ams.org/mathmedia/archive/10-2006-media.html Tony Phillips' Take on Math in the Media],'' [[American Mathematical Society]], October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A torus can be constructed as the square &lt;math&gt;[0, 1] \times [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; with the edges identified as &lt;math&gt;(0, y) \sim (1, y)&lt;/math&gt; (glue left to right) and &lt;math&gt;(x, 0) \sim (x, 1)&lt;/math&gt; (glue bottom to top). If one then also identified {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'') ~ (''y'', ''x'')}}, then one obtains the Möbius strip. The diagonal of the square (the points {{nowrap|(''x'', ''x'')}} where both coordinates agree) becomes the boundary of the Möbius strip, and carries an orbifold structure, which geometrically corresponds to "reflection" – [[geodesic]]s (straight lines) in the Möbius strip reflect off the edge back into the strip. Notationally, this is written as T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – the 2-torus quotiented by the [[group action]] of the [[symmetric group]] on two letters (switching coordinates), and it can be thought of as the [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of two unordered points on the circle, possibly the same (the edge corresponds to the points being the same), with the torus corresponding to two ordered points on the circle.

The Möbius strip is a two-dimensional [[compact manifold]] (i.e. a [[Surface (topology)|surface]]) with boundary. It is a standard example of a surface that is not [[orientable manifold|orientable]]. In fact, the Möbius strip is the epitome of the topological phenomenon of [[Orientability|nonorientability]].  This is because two-dimensional shapes (surfaces) are the lowest-dimensional shapes for which nonorientability is possible and the Möbius strip is the '''only''' surface that is topologically a subspace of '''every''' nonorientable surface. As a result, any surface is nonorientable if and only if it contains a Möbius band as a subspace.

The Möbius strip is also a standard example used to illustrate the mathematical concept of a [[fiber bundle]]. Specifically, it is a nontrivial bundle over the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a fiber the [[unit interval]], {{nowrap|1=''I'' = [0, 1]}}. Looking only at the edge of the Möbius strip gives a nontrivial two point (or '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;!-- What is Z2??--&gt;) bundle over ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Computer graphics ===
A simple construction of the Möbius strip that can be used to portray it in computer graphics or modeling packages is:
* Take a rectangular strip. Rotate it around a fixed point not in its plane. At every step, also rotate the strip along a line in its plane (the line that divides the strip in two) and perpendicular to the main orbital radius. The surface generated on one complete revolution is the Möbius strip.
* Take a Möbius strip and cut it along the middle of the strip.  This forms a new strip, which is a rectangle joined by rotating one end a whole turn.  By cutting it down the middle again, this forms two interlocking whole-turn strips.

=== Open Möbius band ===
The '''open Möbius band''' is formed by deleting the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the standard Möbius band. It is constructed from the set {{nowrap|1=''S'' = { (''x'', ''y'') ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; : 0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1 and 0 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 1 } }} by identifying (glueing) the points {{nowrap|(0, ''y'')}} and {{nowrap|(1, 1 − ''y'')}} for all {{nowrap|1=0 &lt; ''y'' &lt; 1}}.

It may be constructed as a surface of constant positive, negative, or zero (Gaussian) [[Gaussian curvature|curvature]]. In the cases of negative and zero curvature, the Möbius band can be constructed as a (geodesically) complete surface, which means that all geodesics ("straight lines" on the surface) may be extended indefinitely in either direction.

'''Constant negative curvature:'''
Like the plane and the open cylinder, the open Möbius band admits not only a complete metric of constant curvature 0, but also a complete metric of constant negative curvature, say −1.  One way to see this is to begin with the [[Poincaré half-plane model|upper half plane (Poincaré) model]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] ℍ, namely {{nowrap|1=ℍ = { (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{pipe}} ''y'' &gt; 0} }} with the [[Riemannian metric]] given by {{nowrap|(''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +  ''dy''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) / ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The orientation-preserving isometries of this metric are all the maps {{nowrap|''f'' : ℍ → ℍ}} of the form {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') := (''az'' + ''b'') / (''cz'' + ''d'')}}, where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' are real numbers satisfying {{nowrap|1=''ad'' − ''bc'' = 1}}. Here ''z'' is a complex number with {{nowrap|Im(''z'') &gt; 0}}, and we have identified ℍ with {{nowrap|{''z'' ∈ ℂ {{pipe}} Im(''z'') &gt; 0} }} endowed with the Riemannian metric that was mentioned.  Then one orientation-reversing isometry ''g'' of ℍ given by {{nowrap|1=''g''(''z'') := -conj(''z'')}}, where conj(''z'') denotes the complex conjugate of ''z''.  These facts imply that the mapping {{nowrap|''h'' : ℍ → ℍ}} given by {{nowrap|1=''h''(''z'') := −2⋅conj(''z'')}} is an orientation-reversing isometry of ℍ that generates an infinite cyclic group ''G'' of isometries. (Its square is the isometry  {{nowrap|1=''h''(''z'') := 4⋅z}}, which can be expressed as {{nowrap|1=(''2z'' + ''0'') / (''0z'' + ''1/2'')}}.) The quotient {{nowrap|ℍ / ''G''}} of the action of this group can easily be seen to be topologically a Möbius band. But it is also easy to verify that it is complete and non-compact, with constant negative curvature −1.

The group of isometries of this Möbius band is 1-dimensional and is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group SO(2).

'''(Constant) zero curvature:'''
This may also be constructed as a complete surface, by starting with portion of the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; defined by {{nowrap|0 ≤ y ≤ 1}} and identifying {{nowrap|(''x'', 0)}} with {{nowrap|(−''x'', 1)}} for all ''x'' in '''R''' (the reals). The resulting metric makes the open Möbius band into a (geodesically) complete flat surface (i.e., having Gaussian curvature equal to 0 everywhere). This is the only metric on the Möbius band, up to uniform scaling, that is both flat and complete.

The group of isometries of this Möbius band is 1-dimensional and is isomorphic to the orthogonal group SO(2).

'''Constant positive curvature:'''
A Möbius band of constant positive curvature cannot be complete, since it is known that the only complete surfaces of constant positive curvature are the sphere and the [[Real projective plane|projective plane]].  The projective plane '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of constant curvature +1 may be constructed as the quotient of the unit sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by the antipodal map ''A'': ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, defined by {{nowrap|1=''A''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') = (−''x'', −''y'', −''z'')}}.  The open Möbius band is homeomorphic to the once-punctured projective plane, that is, '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with any one point removed.  This may be thought of as the closest that a Möbius band of constant positive curvature can get to being a complete surface: just one point away.

The group of isometries of this Möbius band is also 1-dimensional and isomorphic to the orthogonal group O(2).

The space of unoriented lines in the plane is [[diffeomorphic]] to the open Möbius band.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Phillip|year=1993|title=Spaces of Geodesics|journal=Aportaciones Matemáticas|series=Notas de Investigación|pages=67–79|publisher=UASLP|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/~pparker/research/sog.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see why, let ''L''(''θ'') denote the line through the origin at an angle ''θ'' to the positive x-axis.  For each ''L''(''θ'') there is the family ''P''(''θ'') of all lines in the plane that are perpendicular to ''L''(''θ'').  Topologically, the family ''P''(''θ'') is just a line (because each line in ''P''(''θ'') intersects the line ''L''(''θ'') in just one point).  In this way, as ''θ'' increases in the range {{nowrap|0° ≤ ''θ'' &lt; 180°}}, the line ''L''(''θ'') represents a line's worth of distinct lines in the plane. But when ''θ'' reaches 180°, ''L''(180°) is identical to ''L''(0), and so the families ''P''(0°) and ''P''(180°) of perpendicular lines are also identical families.  The line ''L''(0°), however, has returned to itself as ''L''(180°) ''pointed in the opposite direction''. Every line in the plane corresponds to exactly one line in some family ''P''(''θ''), for exactly one ''θ'', for {{nowrap|0° ≤ ''θ'' &lt; 180°}}, and ''P''(180°) is identical to ''P''(0°) but returns pointed in the opposite direction.  This ensures that the space of all lines in the plane – the union of all the ''L''(''θ'') for {{nowrap|0° ≤ ''θ'' ≤ 180°}} – is an open Möbius band.

The group of bijective linear transformations {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}} of the plane to itself (real {{nowrap|2 × 2}} matrices with non-zero determinant) naturally induces bijections of '''the space of lines in the plane''' to itself, which form a group of self-homeomorphisms of the space of lines.  Hence the same group forms a group of self-homeomorphisms of the Möbius band described in the previous paragraph.  But there is no metric on the space of lines in the plane that is invariant under the action of this group of homeomorphisms. In this sense, the space of lines in the plane has no natural metric on it.

This means that the Möbius band possesses a natural 4-dimensional [[Lie group]] of self-homeomorphisms, given by {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}}, but this high degree of symmetry cannot be exhibited as the group of isometries of any metric.

===Möbius band with round boundary===
The edge, or [[boundary (topology)|boundary]], of a Möbius strip is [[homeomorphic]] (topologically equivalent) to a [[circle]].  Under the usual embeddings of the strip in Euclidean space, as above, the boundary is not a true circle.  However, it is possible to [[embedding|embed]] a Möbius strip in three dimensions so that the boundary is a perfect circle lying in some plane.  For example, see Figures 307, 308, and 309 of "Geometry and the imagination".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A much more geometric embedding begins with a minimal [[Klein bottle]] immersed in the 3-sphere, as discovered by Blaine Lawson.  We then take half of this Klein bottle to get a Möbius band embedded in the 3-sphere (the unit sphere in 4-space). The result is sometimes called the "Sudanese Möbius Band"
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |author1=Dan Asimov |author2=Doug Lerner | title = Issue 17 SIGGRAPH '84 Electronic Theater
 | year = 1984
 | url = http://www.siggraph.org/publications/video-review/1_36.php}}
&lt;/ref&gt; where "sudanese" refers not to the country [[Sudan]] but to the names of two topologists, Sue Goodman and Daniel Asimov.  Applying stereographic projection to the Sudanese band places it in 3-dimensional space, as can be seen below – a version due to George Francis can be found [http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/graphics/pix/Special_Topics/Differential_Geometry/illiview.html here].

From Lawson's minimal Klein bottle we derive an embedding of the band into the [[3-sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, regarded as a subset of '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is geometrically the same as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.  We map angles ''η'', ''φ'' to complex numbers ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;z_1 = \sin\eta\,e^{i\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_2 = \cos\eta\,e^{i\varphi/2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here the parameter ''η'' runs from 0 to ''π'' and ''φ'' runs from 0 to 2''π''. Since {{nowrap|1={{abs|&amp;thinsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + {{abs|&amp;thinsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}, the embedded surface lies entirely in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The boundary of the strip is given by {{nowrap|1={{abs|&amp;thinsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;}} = 1}} (corresponding to {{nowrap|1=''η'' = 0, ''π''}}), which is clearly a circle on the 3-sphere.

To obtain an embedding of the Möbius strip in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; one maps ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; via a [[stereographic projection]]. The projection point can be any point on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that does not lie on the embedded Möbius strip (this rules out all the usual projection points). One possible choice is &lt;math&gt;\left\{1/\sqrt{2},i/\sqrt{2}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;. Stereographic projections map circles to circles and preserves the circular boundary of the strip. The result is a smooth embedding of the Möbius strip into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with a circular edge and no self-intersections.

[[File:MobiusSnail2B.png|center|580px]]

The Sudanese Möbius band in the three-sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is geometrically a fibre bundle over a great circle, whose fibres are great semicircles.  The most symmetrical image of a stereographic projection of this band into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is obtained by using a projection point that lies on that great circle that runs through the midpoint of each of the semicircles. Each choice of such a projection point results in an image that is congruent to any other. But because such a projection point lies on the Möbius band itself, two aspects of the image are significantly different from the case (illustrated above) where the point is not on the band: 1) the image in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is not the full Möbius band, but rather the band with one point removed (from its centerline); and 2) the image is unbounded – and as it gets increasingly far from the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, it increasingly approximates a plane.  Yet this version of the stereographic image has a group of 4 symmetries in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (it is isomorphic to the [[Klein 4-group]]), as compared with the bounded version illustrated above having its group of symmetries the unique group of order 2. (If all symmetries and not just orientation-preserving isometries of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are allowed, the numbers of symmetries in each case doubles.)

But the most geometrically symmetrical version of all is the original Sudanese Möbius band in the three-sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where its full group of symmetries is isomorphic to the Lie group O(2). Having an infinite cardinality (that of the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]]), this is far larger than the symmetry group of any possible embedding of the Möbius band in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Related objects==
A closely related 'strange' geometrical object is the [[Klein bottle]]. A Klein bottle can be produced by gluing two Möbius strips together along their edges; this cannot be done in ordinary three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] without creating self-intersections.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Going in the other direction, if one glues a disk to a Möbius strip by identifying their boundaries, the result is the projective plane. To visualize this, it is helpful to deform the Möbius strip so that its boundary is an ordinary circle (see above). The real projective plane, like the Klein bottle, cannot be embedded in three-dimensions without self-intersections.

In [[graph theory]], the [[Möbius ladder]] is a [[cubic graph]] closely related to the Möbius strip.

In 1968, Gonzalo Vélez Jahn (UCV, Caracas, Venezuela) discovered three dimensional bodies with Möbian characteristics;&lt;ref&gt;[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/VelezJahnsMoebiusToroidalPolyhedron/ Wolfram Demonstration Project:  Vélez-Jahn's Möbius Toroidal Polyhedron]&lt;/ref&gt; these were later described by [[Martin Gardner]] as prismatic rings that became toroidal polyhedrons in his August 1978 [[Mathematical Games column]] in Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;This was the third time Gardner had featured the Möbius strip in his column.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Moebiusstripscarf.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Mathematics and art|Mathematical art]]: a [[scarf]] designed as a Möbius strip]]
There have been several technical applications for the Möbius strip.  Giant Möbius strips have been used as [[conveyor belt]]s that last longer because the entire surface area of the belt gets the same amount of wear, and as continuous-loop recording tapes (to double the playing time).  Möbius strips are common in the manufacture of fabric computer printer and [[typewriter ribbon]]s, as they let the ribbon be twice as wide as the print head while using both halves evenly.&lt;ref&gt;Hogarth, Ian W. and Kiewning, Friedhelm. (1991) "Typewriter or printer ribbon and method for its manufacture" {{US Patent|5062725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Möbius resistor]] is an electronic circuit element that cancels its own inductive reactance. [[Nikola Tesla]] patented similar technology in 1894:&lt;ref&gt;Tesla, Nikola (1894) "Coil for Electro-Magnets" {{US Patent|512340}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Coil for Electro Magnets" was intended for use with his system of global transmission of electricity without wires.

The Möbius strip is the [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of two unordered points on a circle.  Consequently, in [[music theory]], the space of all two-note chords, known as [[Dyad (music)|dyads]], takes the shape of a Möbius strip; this and generalizations to more points is a significant [[Orbifold#Music theory|application of orbifolds to music theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080507-math-music.html Clara Moskowitz, Music Reduced to Beautiful Math, LiveScience]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Dmitri Tymoczko |title= The Geometry of Musical Chords |date= 7 July 2006 |volume= 313 |issue= 5783 |pages= 72–4 |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |doi= 10.1126/science.1126287 |pmid= 16825563|bibcode= 2006Sci...313...72T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In stage magic ===
The Möbius strip principle has been used as a method of creating [[Magic (illusion)|the illusion of magic]]. The trick, known as the Afghan bands, was very popular in the first half of the twentieth century. Many versions of this trick exist and have been performed by famous illusionists such as [[Harry Blackstone Sr.]] and [[Thomas Nelson Downs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://magicperspectives.net/afghan-bands/|title=The Möbius Strip in Magic: A Treatise on the Afghan Bands|last=Prevos|first=Peter|publisher=Third Hemisphere|year=2018|isbn=|location=Kangaroo Flat|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mathematics, Magic and Mystery|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=Dover Books|year=1956|isbn=|location=New York|pages=70-73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6263">The '''Phineas Priesthood''' or '''Phineas Priests''' (also spelled '''Phinehas''') are [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|American domestic terrorists]] who follow the [[ideology]] set forth in the 1990 book, ''Vigilantes of Christendom: The Story of the Phineas Priesthood'' by [[Richard Kelly Hoskins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Extremism in America: Richard Kelly Hoskins |url= http://www.adl.org/Learn/ext_us/Hoskins.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=Hoskins |publisher= [[Anti-Defamation League]] |accessdate= November 28, 2015 |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and activity==
The ideology set forth in Hoskins' book includes [[Christian Identity]] beliefs which oppose [[Miscegenation|interracial relationships]], the mixing of [[race (human classification)|races]], [[homosexuality]], and [[abortion]]. It is also marked by [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], and anti-[[multiculturalism]].

According to the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), "Many people mistakenly believe that there is an actual organization called the Phineas Priesthood, probably because there was a group of four men in the 1990s who called themselves Phineas Priests. The men carried out bank robberies and a series of bombings in the Pacific Northwest before being sent to prison. But there is no evidence that their organization was any larger than those four individuals."

The Phineas Priesthood is not considered an organization because it is not led by a governing body, its members do not hold gatherings, and it does not have a membership process. One simply becomes a Phineas Priest by adopting the Priesthood's beliefs and acting upon them. Adherents of the Phineas Priesthood ideology are considered [[Terrorism|terrorists]] because among other things, their crimes include numerous [[anti-abortion violence|abortion clinic bombings]] in 1996, the 1996 bombing of ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'' newspaper in [[Spokane]], [[bank robberies]], and plans to blow up [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] buildings.&lt;ref name=Spokane&gt;{{Cite web| title= Phineas Priests Arrested in Spokane Robberies| work= MHRN| publisher= Montana Human Rights Network| accessdate= March 13, 2011| date= 1996| url= http://www.mhrn.org/newsarchive/1096phineas.html| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5x9xBRDR4| archivedate= March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four members of this organization were convicted of crimes including bank robbery and bombing, with each sentenced in 1997 and 1998 to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://preps.spokesman.com/stories/1997/nov/01/sentencing-delayed-for-valley-bomber-but-no-third/ |title=Sentencing Delayed For Valley Bomber, But No Third Trial Charles H.

On November 28, 2014, 49-year-old Larry Steven McQuilliams fired more than 100 rounds at a federal courthouse, a Mexican consulate building (which he also tried to set on fire), and a police station in [[Austin, Texas]]; he was shot in the heart by a police officer firing from some 300 feet away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kxan.com/2014/12/01/chief-on-austin-gunman-hate-was-in-his-heart/ |title= Chief on Austin gunman: 'Hate was in his heart' |first1= Patrick |last1= Tolbert |first2= Chris |last2= Sadeghi |date= December 1, 2014 |publisher= KXAN |accessdate= June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of Hoskins' book was found in McQuilliams' home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/12/01/police-austin-shooter-belonged-to-an-ultra-conservative-christian-hate-group/ |title= Police: Austin shooter was a 'homegrown American extremist' |publisher= The Washington Post |first1= Abby |last1= Ohlheiser |first2= Elahe |last2= Izadi |date= December 1, 2014 |accessdate= June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The Phineas Priesthood is named for the Israelite [[Phinehas, son of Eleazar|Phinehas]], grandson of [[Aaron]] ({{Bibleverse|Numbers|25:7}}). According to Numbers 25, Phineas personally [[executed]] [[Zimri (prince)|Zimri]], an [[Israelite]] man, and a [[Midianite]] woman while they were together in the man's tent, running a spear through the two and ending a plague sent by God to punish the Israelites for intermingling sexually and religiously with the Midianite [[Baal]]-worshipers. Phineas is commended for having stopped Israel's fall to [[idolatrous]] practices brought in by Midianite women, as well as for stopping the desecration of God's sanctuary. [[Yahweh]] commends Phineas through [[Moses]] as zealous, gives him a "covenant of peace," and grants him and "his seed" an everlasting priesthood. This passage was cited in Hoskins' book as a justification for using violent means against interracial relationships and other forms of alleged [[immorality]].

'''Positive mental attitude''' ('''PMA''') is a concept first introduced in 1937 by [[Napoleon Hill]] in the book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]''.  The book never actually uses the term, but discusses about the importance of [http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/chi-primetime-pma-022611-story.html positive thinking] as a contributing factor of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Napoleon|title=Think and grow rich|year=1960|publisher=Fawcett Crest|location=Greenwich, Conn.|isbn=0449214923|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Napoleon, along with [[W. Clement Stone]], founder of [[Combined Insurance]], later wrote ''Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude,'' defines positive mental [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] as comprising the 'plus' characteristics represented by words as faith, integrity, hope, optimism, courage, initiative, generosity, tolerance, tact, kindliness and good common sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Napoleon|title=Success through a positive mental attitude|year=1987|publisher=Pocket Books|location=New York|isbn=0671743228|author2=Stone, W. Clement Stone  |author3=preface by Og Mandino  |author4= with a new introduction by W. Clement }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kotekar|first=Vivek|date=2017|title=Positive Mental Attitude: A Need of Time|url=http://www.ijip.in/Archive/v4i2/18.01.053.20170402.pdf|journal=The International Journal of Indian Psychology|volume=4|pages=97-102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4760272/ Positive mental attitude] is that philosophy which asserts that having an [[Optimism|optimistic]] disposition in every situation in one's life attracts positive changes and increases achievement. Adherents employ a state of mind that continues to seek, find and execute ways to win, or find a desirable outcome, regardless of the circumstances.  This concept is the opposite of negativity, defeatism and hopelessness. Optimism and hope are vital to the development of PMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=edited by Edward C.|title=Optimism &amp; pessimism implications for theory, research, and practice|year=2001|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-55798-691-6|pages=101–125|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
PMA is under the umbrella of [[positive psychology]].  In positive psychology, high self-efficacy can help in gaining learned optimism which ultimately leads to PMA.  PMA is considered an internal focus of control that influences external factors.  Research has shown that through emotional intelligence training and positive psychology therapy, a person's attitudes and perceptions can be modified to improve one's personal and professional life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Ross|author2=Ryan, J. A.|title=Emotional Intelligence and Positive Psychology: Therapist Tools for Training/Coaching Clients to Move Beyond Emotional Relief|journal=Annals of the American Psychotherapy Assn|year=2005|volume=8|issue=3|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
A study of [[Major League Baseball]] players indicated that a key component that separates major league players from the minor leagues and all other levels is their ability to develop mental characteristics and mental skills.  Among them were mental toughness, confidence, maintaining a positive attitude, dealing with failure, expectations, and positive self-talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Kimberly|title=The mental skills and characteristics related to a major league baseball player's performance: A qualitative study|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|year=2011|volume=71|issue=8-B|pages=5150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Many studies have been done regarding PMA and its effects on health, specifically with people of serious illnesses such as cancer and kidney disease. Cancer specifically has received a lot of attention since Lance Armstrong, along with other survivors, have given their stories.  People with PMA have a significantly higher chance of survival and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rom|first=S. A.|author2=Miller, L. |author3=Peluso, J. |title=Playing the game: Psychological factors in surviving cancer|journal=International Journal of Emergency Mental Health|year=2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=25–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study comparing people with chronic kidney disease with people kidney disease free showed that there was a significant difference between the groups.  The kidney disease free group rated much higher in PMA.  There was no difference found in spirituality and females with chronic kidney disease were found to be significantly more superstitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Subha|first=T. G.|author2=Mukherjee, Tilottama|title=Optimism, superstitious beliefs and spirituality in chronic kidney disease|journal=Indian Journal of Community Psychology|date=September 2010|volume=6|issue=2|pages=262–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A study done with HIV-positive individuals found that a high health self-efficacy, a task-oriented coping style, and a positive mental attitude were strong predictors for a health-promoting lifestyle which has a significant effect on overall health (coping and surviving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larry|first=R. S.|title=Exploring the relationships between perceived health self-efficacy, coping and health-promoting behaviors among non-substance abusing vs. substance abusing patients with HIV disease|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|year=2010|volume=71|issue=1-B|pages=661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Critics of PMA argue that it is not the secret to success but a by-product of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=G.|title=Positive mental bulldust|journal=Australian Journal of Clinical Hypnotherapy|date=March 1980|volume=1|issue=1|pages=40–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "self-help" industry has been criticized as a scam for authors to make money due to its simplistic writing and principles.  There is little evidence, however, that self-help books, life coaching, and motivational speaking are harmful; a study of 100 psychotherapy patients found that of the 43 patients reading books (e.g. PMA, religious texts, Alcoholics Anonymous texts, etc.) 4 reported "mild harm or distress" while 34 reported "benefit without harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halliday|first=G.|title=Psychological self-help books--How dangerous are they?|journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training|year=1991|volume=28|issue=4|pages=678–680|doi=10.1037/0033-3204.28.4.678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4105">'''Reactive devaluation''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that occurs when a proposal is devalued if it appears to originate from an antagonist. The bias was proposed by [[Lee Ross]] and Constance Stillinger (1988).&lt;ref name=RossStillinger1988/&gt;

Reactive devaluation could be caused by [[loss aversion]] or [[attitude polarization]],&lt;ref name=Ross1995/&gt; or [[naïve realism (psychology)|naïve realism]].&lt;ref name=RossWard1996/&gt;

==Studies==
In an initial experiment, Stillinger and co-authors asked pedestrians in the US whether they would support a drastic bilateral [[nuclear arms]] reduction program. If they were told the proposal came from President [[Ronald Reagan]], 90 percent said it would be favorable or even-handed to the United States; if they were told the proposal came from a group of unspecified policy analysts, 80 percent thought it was favorable or even; but, if respondents were told it came from [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] only 44 percent thought it was favorable or neutral to the United States.&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt;

In another experiment, a contemporaneous controversy at [[Stanford University]] led to the university divesting of [[South Africa]]n assets because of the [[apartheid]] regime. Students at Stanford were asked to evaluate the university's divestment plan ''before'' it was announced publicly and ''after'' such. Proposals including the actual eventual proposal were valued more highly when they were hypothetical.&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt;

In another study, experimenters showed [[Israel]]i participants a peace proposal which had been actually proposed by Israel. If participants were told the proposal came from a Palestinian source they rated it lower than if they were told (correctly) the identical proposal came from the Israeli government. If participants identified as "hawkish" were told it came from "dovish" Israeli government they believed it was relatively bad for their people and good for the other side, but not if participants identified as "doves".&lt;ref name="Maoz2002"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5184">'''Sewa Day''' is an international [[Volunteering|volunteer]] day and annual event celebrated primarily by [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]]-affiliated groups. It is celebrated a Sunday of October.

==Background==

''Sewa'', also ''Seva'', is short for the word ''[[Kar seva|Kar Seva]]'', which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''kar'', meaning hands or work, and ''seva'', meaning service.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism |first=H. S. |last=Singha |publisher=Hemkunt Press |year=2000 |ISBN=8170103010 |p=121}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Image journeys: audio-visual media and cultural change in India |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Christiane Brosius, Melissa Butcher |year=1999 |publisher=Sage Publications |location= |isbn=978-0-7619-9325-4 |page=134 |pages= |url=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], the word ''seva'' also means "to worship, to adore, to pay homage through the act of love". In the writings of Sikh gurus, these two meanings of ''seva'' (service and worship) have been merged. ''Seva'' is expected to be a labour of love performed without desire and intention, and with humility.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Labour of love: Kar seva at Darbar Sahib's Amrit Sarover |first=Gurmit Singh |last=Virdee |journal=Sikh Formations: Religion, Culture, Theory |volume=1 |number=1 |pp=13–28 |DOI=10.1080/17448720500231409}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kar seva'' is often translated as "voluntary labour". In the Punjabi language the person performing such service is called a ''Sevadar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Seva Sikhi Wiki Seva definition], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewa Day was launched in 2010 by a nonprofit of the same name, a charity registered in [[England]] &amp; [[Wales]] (No. 4446848).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewaday.org/about-sewa-day//  Sewa Day About Us], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewaday.org/facts/  Sewa Day Facts], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The first six Sewa Days were held on the first Sunday of October. This will change in 2016:

'''Stimulation''' is the encouragement of development or the cause of activity generally. For example, "The press provides stimulation of political discourse." An interesting or fun activity can be described as "stimulating", regardless of its physical effects on senses. ''Stimulate'' means to act as a stimulus to; ''stimulus'' means something that rouses the recipient to activity; &lt;nowiki/&gt;''stimuli'' is the plural of ''stimulus''.

A particular use of the term is '''physiological stimulation''', which refers to '''sensory excitation''', the action of various agents or forms of energy ([[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]) on receptors that generate [[Action potential|impulses]] that travel through [[nerves]] to the brain (afferents). There are [[sensory receptors]] on or near the surface of the body, such as photoreceptors in the retina of the eye, [[hair cell]]s in the cochlea of the ear, touch receptors in the skin and chemical receptors in the mouth and nasal cavity. There are also sensory receptors in the [[muscles]], joints, digestive tract, and membranes around organs such as the brain, the abdominal cavity, the bladder and the prostate (providing one source of [[sexual stimulation]]). Stimulation to the external or internal senses may evoke involuntary activity or guide intentions in action.  Such emotional or motivating stimulation typically is also experienced subjectively (enters awareness, is in consciousness). Perception can be regarded as conceptualised stimulation, used in reasoning and intending, for example. When bodily stimulation is perceived it is traditionally called a sensation, such as a kind of touch or a taste or smell, or a painful or pleasurable sensation. This can be thought of as [[Stimulus (psychology)|psychological stimulation]], which is a stimulus affecting a person's thinking or feeling processes.

==Overview==
Stimulation, in general, refers to how organisms perceive incoming stimuli. As such it is part of the [[stimulus-response model|stimulus-response]] mechanism. Simple organisms broadly react in three ways to stimulation: too little stimulation causes them to stagnate, too much to die from [[stress (medicine)|stress]] or inability to adapt, and a medium amount causes them to adapt and grow as they overcome it. Similar categories or effects are noted with psychological stress with people. Thus, stimulation may be described as how external events provoke a response by an individual in the attempt to [[coping mechanism|cope]].

==Over-stimulation==
It is possible to become [[habituation|habituated]] to a particular degree of stimulation, and then find it uncomfortable to have a significant change from that level of the stimulus. Thus one can become used to intense stimuli or a fast-paced life and suffer [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] when they are removed. Stress and unhappiness may result an unaccustomed level of stimulation.

Ongoing, long-term stimulation can for some individuals prove harmful, and a more relaxed and less stimulated life may be beneficial despite possible initial discomfort or stress from the change. See also; [[sensory overload]] and [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]].

Individuals with neurological conditions like [[autism]] or [[intellectual disability]] may be prone to overstimulation and suffer sensory overload at levels of stimulus that others find unexceptional.

It is hypothesized{{Who?|date=September 2015}} that long-term overstimulation can result eventually in a phenomenon called "[[Adrenal fatigue|adrenal exhaustion]]" over time, but this is neither medically accepted nor proven at this time{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

'''''The Female Brain''''' is a 2006 book by the American [[neuropsychiatrist]] [[Louann Brizendine]]. The main thesis of the book is that women's behavior is different from that of men due, in large measure, to [[hormone|hormonal]] differences. Brizendine says that the human female brain is affected by the following hormones: [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], [[testosterone]], ([[oxytocin]]), [[neurotransmitters]] ([[dopamine]], [[serotonin]]), and that there are differences in the architecture of the [[brain]] (prefrontal [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], [[hypothalamus]], [[amygdala]]) that regulates such hormones and [[neurotransmitter]]s.

==Structure==
''The Female Brain'' has seven chapters, each one of which is dedicated to a specific part of a woman's life such as [[puberty]], motherhood, and [[menopause]], or a specific dimension of a women’s emotional life such as feelings, [[love]] and [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], and [[sex]]. The book also includes three appendices on [[hormone therapy]], [[postpartum depression]], and [[sexual orientation]].

== Reception ==
The book sold well but received mixed reviews, because there was some controversy from feminist writers about the validity of some of the content. Some of the authors that supported the content of the book include:
* [[Deborah Tannen]], of the ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/18/AR2006081800429_pf.html 'A Brain of One's Own'.] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' August 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Tannen writes, "Throughout the book, I recognized biological accounts for social behaviors I had observed and written about." In a similar vein, she adds, "Anthropologists and linguists who have studied children at play have noted that girls form bonds by telling secrets. Here, too, Brizendine finds 'a biological reason.'" Her ultimate position is one of cautionary endorsement: "Ideally, readers will sift through the case studies, research findings and scientific conjectures gathered in this non-technical book and be intrigued by some while questioning others, bearing in mind the caution that hormones and brain structure play a role in gender differences but are not the whole story." 
* [[Sarah Hrdy]], author of ''Mother Nature''
* [[Daniel Goleman]] author of ''[[Emotional Intelligence]]''

Some of the authors that criticized the content of the book include:
* [[Evan Balaban]] and [[Rebecca M. Young]], in a review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = Rebecca M. | last2 = Balaban | first2 = Evan | title = Psychoneuroindoctrinology | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 443 | issue = 7112 | page = 634 | publisher = [[Nature Publishing Group]] | doi = 10.1038/443634a | date = 12 October 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1038/443634a | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7112/pdf/443634a.pdf Pdf.]
:Evan Balaban and Rebecca M. Young called ''The Female Brain'' a "melodrama" "riddled with scientific errors" and "fail[ing] to meet even the most basic standards of scientific accuracy and balance" and that "human sex differences are elevated almost to the point of creating different species, yet virtually all differences in brain structure, and most differences in behaviour, are characterized by small average differences and a great deal of male–female overlap at the individual level".&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic [[feminist]]s have given mixed reviews to ''The Female Brain''. Brizendine was given the tongue-in-cheek 2006 [[Language Log|Becky Award]], which is given to "people or organizations who have made outstanding contributions to linguistic misinformation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.languagehat.com/archives/002602.php 2006 Becky Award]&lt;/ref&gt; The award cited errors in ''The Female Brain'', including one sentence (removed from subsequent printings) which contrasted the number of words used by men and women in one day. The numbers had been taken from a book by a self-help guru and were incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/beckies.html The Language of Eve]", Geoffrey Nunberg, January 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to criticisms ==
Brizendine later made some concessions to those who felt that this book overemphasised gender-based differences, saying: "Males and females are more alike than they are different. After all, we are the same species".&lt;ref name=calmag&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugend|first1=Alina|title=Engendering Sons|journal=[[California (magazine)|California]]|issue=Winter 2014|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other media ==
{{Main|The Female Brain (film)}}

''The Female Brain'' was loosely adapted as a romantic comedy movie of the same name in 2017. Brizendine served as the inspiration for the film's main character.&lt;ref name=movie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psych.ucsf.edu/news/female-brain-movie-premieres-los-angeles |title='The Female Brain' movie premieres in Los Angeles |last=Roznovsky |first=Nicholas |date=27 June 2017 |website=UCSF Psychiatry News |publisher=UCSF Department of Psychiatry |access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''token economy''' is a system of [[contingency management]] based on the systematic [[reinforcement]] of target behavior. The reinforcers are symbols or [[token money|tokens]] that can be exchanged for other reinforcers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/token-economy&lt;/ref&gt; A token economy is based on the principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[behavioral economics]] and can be situated within [[applied behavior analysis]]. In applied settings token economies are used with children and adults; however, they have been successfully modeled with pigeons in lab settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut| K. Jackson and T.D. Hackenberg}} : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284552/pdf/8755699.pdf Token reinforcement, choice, and self-control in pigeons.] ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior''. 1996 July; 66(1): 29–49. {{doi|10.1901/jeab.1996.66-29}} {{PMC|1284552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic requirements ==
Three requirements are basic for a token economy.&lt;ref name="Kazdin"&gt;{{Aut|A.E. Kazdin}} : ''The Token Economy. A review and evaluation''. New York: Plenum Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-306-30962-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tokens ===
Tokens must be used as reinforcers to be effective. A token is an object or symbol that can be exchanged for material reinforcers, services, or privileges (back-up reinforcers). In applied settings, a wide range of tokens have been used: coins, checkmarks, images of small suns, points on a counter. These symbols and objects are comparably worthless outside of the patient-clinician relationship, but their value lies in the fact that they can be exchanged for other things. Technically speaking, tokens are not primary reinforcers, but secondary or learned reinforcers. Much research has been conducted on token reinforcement, including animal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|T.D. Hackenberg}}: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2648534/ Token reinforcement: a review and analysis.] ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 2009, 91, 257-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Back-up reinforcers ===
Tokens have no intrinsic value, but can be exchanged for other valued reinforcing events: back-up reinforcers. Most token economies offer a choice of differing back-up reinforcers that can be virtually anything. Some possible reinforcers might be:
* Material reinforcers: sweets, cigarettes, journals, money (although money holds value outside of the patient-clinician relationship)
* Services: breakfast in bed, having your room cleaned, activities
* Privileges and other extras: passes for leaving the building or area, permission to stay in bed, phone calls, having your name or picture on the wall.

Back-up reinforcers are chosen in function of the individual or group for which the token economy is set up, or depending upon the possibilities available to the staff. Prior to starting the staff decides how many tokens have to be paid for each back-up reinforcer. Often, price lists are exposed or given to the clients. Some back-up reinforcers can be bought anytime, for other exchange times are limited (e.g. opening times of a token shop).

=== Specified target behaviors ===
There is a broad range of possible target behaviors: self-care, attending activities, academic behavior, disruptive behavior. A token economy is more than just using exchangeable tokens.&lt;ref name="Kazdin" /&gt; For a token economy to work, criteria have to be specified and clear. A staff member giving tokens to a client just because he judges he is behaving positively, is not part of a token economy because it is not done in a systematic way. Sometimes client manuals have specifications how many tokens can be earned by each target behavior. For instance, if making the bed is a target behavior, staff and clients have to know how a well-made bed looks like: do the sheets have to be put under the mattress, cushion on top? However, often these specifications are hard to make: behavior such as eating politely and positive cooperation are hard to specify. While planning how many tokens can be earned by each target behavior some factors have to be considered: on the one hand clients should be able to earn a minimal amount of tokens for a minimal effort, and on the other hand clients should not earn too much too soon, making more effort useless.&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes the possibility of punishment by token loss is included, technically called 'response cost':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ormrod|first=Jeanne Ellis|title=Essentials of Educational Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Merrill|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=978-0-13-501657-2|pages=338|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; disruptive behavior can be fined with the loss of tokens. This also should be clearly specified before the application starts. Clients can be involved in the specifying of the contingencies.

== Other features of a token economy ==
Besides the 3 basic requirements, other features are often present.&lt;ref name="Glynn"&gt;{{Aut|S.M. Glynn}}: [http://bmo.sagepub.com/content/14/4/383.abstract Token economy approaches for psychiatric patients. Progress and pitfalls over 25 years.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222063442/http://bmo.sagepub.com/content/14/4/383.abstract |date=2011-12-22 }} ''Behavior Modification'', 1990, 14, 383-407.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social reinforcement ===
Token reinforcement is essential, but is always accompanied by [[social reinforcement]]. Tokens are intended to make reinforcement explicit and immediate, and to strengthen behavior, but in the end social reinforcement should be sufficient to maintain what’s been  learned.

=== Shaping ===
All principles of operant learning are applied within a token economy. [[Shaping (psychology)|Shaping]] implies clients aren’t expected to do everything perfectly at once; behavior can be acquired in steps. Initially clients can be reinforced for behavior that approaches the target. If the target behavior is keeping attention during a 30 minutes session, clients can initially already get (perhaps smaller) reinforcement for 5 minutes of attention.

=== Immediacy of reinforcement ===
Reinforcement will greater influence behavior if given shortly after the response is emitted. The longer people have to wait for a reward, the less effect and the less they will learn. This is the principle of [[delay discounting]]. Immediate token reinforcement can bridge later reinforcement.

=== Learning to plan ahead and save earnings ===
Sometimes clients can earn larger rewards like the permission to spend a weekend at home, going to a movie, or having a class excursion. When such rewards would be given at once for one instance of a target behavior, the scarce resources would soon be depleted and consequently the incentives would be lost. One advantage of tokens is they can be used to divide larger rewards into parts: clients can save tokens to buy more expensive rewards later. This implies they shouldn’t immediately spend all earned tokens on attractive smaller rewards, and instead learn to plan ahead. This way they can acquire self-control. (See [[Delayed gratification]].)

=== Individual and group contingencies ===
Mostly token economies are designed for groups. The system is running for a whole ward or class. Within this group contingency specific individual goals and reinforcers can be added. Though sometimes a token economy is designed for only one specific individual.

=== Consistent application ===
The power of a token economy largely depends on the consistency of its application. To achieve this thorough staff training is essential. Some token economies failed exactly on this point.&lt;ref name="Glynn" /&gt; Token economies imply rights and duties for clients as well as for staff. When, according to the system, a client deserves tokens, he should get them, even when a staff member judges he doesn’t deserve them because he has been impolite the day before.
Family education and involvement is very important. They can support the system or they can undermine it, for instance by secretly giving undeserved rewards.

=== Leveled system ===
Often, token economies are leveled programs. Clients can pass through different levels until they reach the highest level. At that point, behaviors are performed without token reinforcement. Higher levels require more complex behaviors. The incentive to progress from one level to the next is the availability of increasingly desirable reinforcers.

== History of the token economy ==
In the early 19th century, long before there was any knowledge about operant learning, there were some precursors of token economies in schools and prisons. In those systems points could be earned and exchanged for many different items and privileges. Only in the 1960s the first real token economies arose in [[psychiatric hospital]]s. [[Teodoro Ayllon]], [[Nathan Azrin]] and [[Leonard Krasner]] were important pioneers in these early years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|R.P. Liberman}}: [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=174312 The token economy.] ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', 2000, 157, 1398.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|T. Ayllon &amp; N.H. Azrin}} : ''The Token Economy: a motivational system for therapy and rehabilitation''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1968. {{ISBN|0-390-04310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first token economy bearing that name was founded by Ayllon and Azrin in 1961 at Anna State Hospital in Illinois. In the 1970s the token economies came to a peak and became  widespread. In 1977 a major study (a [[randomized controlled trial]]), still considered a landmark, was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|G.L. Paul &amp; R.J. Lentz}} : ''Psychosocial treatment of chronic mental patients: milieu versus social-learning programs''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-674-72112-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study showed the superiority of a token economy compared to standard treatment and specialized milieu therapy. Despite this success token economies declined from the 1980s on. It became fairly quiet on that front due to a variety of problems and criticism.

== Problems and controversy ==
Especially the application of token economies with adults became a matter of criticism. In addition some impediments and the evolution of mental health care caused troubles.

=== Changes in patient care ===
Token economies have proven their effectiveness and utility for chronic psychiatric patients, despite requiring months or even years to achieve optimal results. This causes problems when insurance and government policies increasingly require the shortest possible hospital stays. Because emphasis has shifted to community-based treatment, outpatient and home-based care is often the preferred choice over institutionalization. This decentralization of patient care methods makes it difficult to further study and develop token economies in a scientific, research-oriented method.

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
Token economies can present issues with concern to patient rights. The right to have their personal properties, basic comfort and freedom of choice of treatment constrained the possibilities for token economies. In addition, ethical and personal concerns of staff members arose: is it ethically justified to use cigarettes as secondary reinforcers; is it human to rely on ‘reward and punishment’ as means for treatment (behavior modification often is reduced to this by opponents); isn’t sincere human contact much more valuable and effective; and do token economies reduce human interaction to trade, therefore centering patients' attention (and behavior) upon materials?

=== Client resistance ===
Application of a token economy to adults sometimes triggers client resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|A.E. Kazdin}}: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1308287/pdf/jaba00041-0109.pdf The token economy: a decade later.] ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 1982, 15, 431-445.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response maintenance and generalization ===
Problems with maintaining what’s been learned and the generalization toward new situations have been signaled. When the token programs stops the acquired behavior might disappear again.

=== Extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation ===
Rewarding behavior could increase the extrinsic [[motivation]] and at the same time decrease the [[intrinsic motivation]] for activities. (Note, these terms are not part of ABA literature).

== Recent applications and findings ==
In the last 50 years much research has been conducted on token economy. The first 20 years were especially productive. Despite controversy and a lack of implementation token programs are alive and well in several settings.

=== Adults ===
In adult settings token economies are mostly applied in [[mental health]] care. The criticism that clients have no choice and are being forced, is countered by offering them the choice to enter the token program or not to enter, or to leave again once entered. The vast majority of clients in past studies voluntarily chose to stay in the program.
Research{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} shows the effects of token economies can more or less be divided into three categories:
* No effect: 5 to 20% of the clients do not (or minimally) respond to the token economy;
* Only effect while the token economy is active and no effect once stopped: in this case the token economy is functioning as a [[prosthesis]] (like a [[wheelchair]]); it does not permanently help the patient once terminated but is necessary to maintain normal functioning;
* Well established long-term effects (including community reintegration).

==== Schizophrenia ====
The first token economies were designed for chronic, treatment-resistant [[psychosis|psychotic]] inpatients. Even now token economies are applied to clients with [[schizophrenia]], who are often resistant to common behavioral treatment approaches. Sometimes the token economy is used as a lasting prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|C.M. Coelho}}, e.a.: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08952840801984816 Rehabilitation programs for elderly women inpatients with schizophrenia.] ''Journal of Woman &amp; Aging'', 2008, 3, 283-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it’s used to help such clients reach [[resocialization]]. A token economy (of course always in combination with other interventions) succeeded in the community reintegration of 78% of the clients within an average period of 110 days, after more than 7 years of uninterrupted hospital stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|S.M. Silverstein}}, e.a.: [http://michaelbfriedman.com/mbf/images/stories/Rehabilitationf_Treatment_Refractory_Schizophrenia_2006.pdf Behavioral rehabilitation of the "treatment-refractory" schizophrenia patient: conceptual foundations, interventions, and outcome data.] ''Psychological Services'', 2006, 3, 145-169.&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows clients experience the token economy with positive reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|M.F. Lin}}, e.a.: [http://journals.lww.com/jnr-twna/Abstract/2006/12000/Significant_Experiences_of_Token_Therapy_From_the.9.aspx Significant experiences of token therapy from the perspective of psychotic patients.] ''Journal of Nursing Research'', 2006, 14, 315-323.&lt;/ref&gt; Several recent reviews of [[psychosocial]] treatment for schizophrenia explicitly mention token economy as an effective, [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] treatment&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|G.D. Shean}}: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20070131 Evidence-based psychosocial practices and recovery from schizophrenia.] ''Psychiatry'', 2009, 72, 307-320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|L.B.

==== Acute units ====
The application of token economies has been extended from [[psychiatric rehabilitation]] services to acute psychiatric units. A token economy was successful in decreasing the aggression on a ward where clients on average stayed for less than three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|J.P. LePage}}, e.a.: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227645080_Reducing_assaults_on_an_acute_psychiatric_unit_using_a_token_economy_a_2year_followup Reducing assault on an acute psychiatric unit using a token economy: a 2-year follow-up.] ''Behavioral Interventions'', 2003, 18, 179-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Substance abuse ====
As a result of heavy ethical criticism, token economies developed a negative stigma and, as a result, systems were sometimes introduced with aliases. This was especially the case in [[substance abuse]] treatment settings (although some systems for smoking cessation continue to use the term token economy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|V. McLeod}}: How to quit smoking by using a token economy method. EzineArticles, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, systems derived from token economies were used under the name [[contingency management]]; initially this was more broadly defined and referred to any direct coupling of consequences (reinforcements or punishments) with behavior (for example staying clean &lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|N.M. Higgins &amp; N. Petry}}: [http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/122-127.pdf Contingency Management Incentives for sobriety.] ''Alcohol Research &amp; Health'', 1999, 23, 122-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|M.W. Lewis}}: [http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/viewFile/2038/2103 Application of contingency management-prize reinforcement to community practice with alcohol and drug problems: a critical examination.] ''Behavior and Social Issues'', 2008, 17, 119-138.&lt;/ref&gt;); later it referred specifically to one kind of token economy.

The [[community reinforcement approach]] can be combined with contingency management;&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|H.G. Roozen}}, e.a.: [http://www.robertjmeyersphd.com/pdf/CRA%20Review%202004.pdf A systematic review of the effectiveness of the community reinforcement approach in alcohol, cocaine and opioid addiction.] ''Drug and Alcohol Dependence'', 2004, 74, 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘tokens’ are used, whereas contingency management employs the term "[[voucher]]s" (or related terms).
Research shows this kind of token economy is easily applied outside of hospitals and is effective, allowing for less hospital-based treatment - although contingency management is used in the treatment of drug abuse in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

==== Developmental disorders ====
Token economy is also being applied in settings for adults with [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]]. Target behaviors can vary in types of social behavior and [[self care]], or the decreasing of inappropriate and/or disruptive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|L.A. LeBlanc, L.P. Hagopian &amp; K.A. Maglieri}}: [http://www.drleashabarry.com/PBS/week08/Token%20Economy%20Article.pdf Use of a token economy to eliminate excessive inappropriate social behavior in an adult with developmental disabilities.] ''Behavioral Interventions'', 2000, 15, 135-143.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children and adolescents ===
Token economies have been applied to children and adolescents with developmental disabilities as well as in schools.

==== Developmental disabilities ====
A token economy has proven effective in increasing attentiveness and motivation in completion of tasks for children with developmental disabilities. Research shows it can help to diminish disruptive behavior and promote social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|J.L. Matson &amp; J.A. Boisjoli}}: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486442 The token economy for children with intellectual disability and/or autism: a review.] ''Research in Developmental Disabilities'', 2009, 30, 240-248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Schools ====
Token economies have been applied in schools, particularly [[special education]] programs as well as in other programs. Positive results can imply increased attention and decreased disruptive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|K. Zlomke &amp; L. Zlomke}}: [http://www.baojournal.com/BAT%20Journal/VOL-4/BAT-4.-2.pdf Token economy plus self-monitoring to reduce disruptive classroom behaviors.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229160303/http://www.baojournal.com/BAT%20Journal/VOL-4/BAT-4.-2.pdf |date=2010-12-29 }} ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2003, 4, 177-182.&lt;/ref&gt; In educational settings token economy seems to raise the intrinsic motivation to complete assigned tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Aut|G.

{{Feminism sidebar}}
'''Vegetarian ecofeminism''' is an activist and academic movement&lt;ref&gt;''Lois Ann Lorentzen, University of San Francisco, and Heather Eaton, Saint Paul University (2002)''&lt;/ref&gt; which states that all types of [[oppression]] are linked and must be eradicated, with a focus on including the domination of humans over nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Through the feminist concept known as [[intersectionality]], it is recognized that [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[classism]], and other forms of inter human oppression are all connected. Vegetarian ecofeminism aims to include the domination of not only the environment but also of nonhuman animals to the list.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gaard, Greta. "Vegetarian Ecofeminism: A Review Essay." Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies. ( 2002): 117-146. Web. 2 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the academic and philosophical field of [[ecofeminism]], which states that the ways in which the privileged dominates the oppressed should include the way humans dominate nature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Adams | first1=Carol | year=1991| title=Ecofeminism and the Eating of Animals | doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1991.tb00213.x | journal=Hypatia | volume=1991 | issue=| pages=125–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme within ecofeminism is the belief that there is a strong connection between the domination of women and the domination of nature, and that both must be eradicated in order to end oppression.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Vegetarian ecofeminism extends beyond ecofeminism because it believes that the way in which humans exploit and kill nonhuman animals should be distinctly recognized, and that the oppression of humans is linked to the oppression of nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The concept of [[speciesism]] is central to distinguishing between vegetarian ecofeminism and ecofeminism, and it strongly links the [[hierarchies]] created among nonhuman animals to the hierarchies created among humans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Distinguishing between ecofeminism and vegetarian ecofeminism is important because of vegetarian ecofeminism's focus on the oppression of nonhuman animals provides connections between the other linked forms of oppression, but specifically the oppression of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a4443d40-b53a-427f-98dd-533f23a76bdf%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=104|title=Linking Sexism and Speciesism|last=Wyckoff|first=Jason|date=1 September 2014|journal=Hypatia|pages=n/a|doi=10.1111/hypa.12098 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speciesism==
{{Main|Speciesism}}
Speciesism is a form of oppression central to the ecofeminist concept,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and the belief that speciesism is a valid form of oppression that must be eradicated is at the center of most vegetarian ecofeminist arguments. It is used to support the exploitation and killing of nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Much like any other form of oppression, speciesism is a social construction that benefits the dominant at the expense of the oppressed.

===Humanism in opposition to vegetarian ecofeminism===
[[Humanist]]s believe that speciesism is not a "bad -ism" like racism or sexism, because while women, people of color, and any other group of oppressed humans are moral humans, nonhuman animals are not and therefore do not deserve the same rights.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Against "Humanism": Speciesism, Personhood, and Preference|last=Cushing|first=Simon|date=2003|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to humanism, the domination of humans over animals is justified, and animals are indeed meant for human [[Consumer (food chain)|consumption]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Human rights are inherently more important than animal rights because their biological differences from human makes them morally different as well.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Vegetarian ecofeminists argue that there is an inherent bond between humans and nonhuman animals, and the human supremacy and degradation of animals that ensues is a [[Social constructionism|social construction]] meant to undermine the human-animal bond.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Luke | first1=Brian | year=| title=Justice, Caring, and Animal Liberation | url=| journal=Animals and Women | volume=1992 | issue=| pages=81–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in fact not the characteristic of an abnormal few who care and empathize with nonhuman animals, but the normal state for most humans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; This is exemplified by the cross-cultural practice of pet-keeping or the usage of animals in therapy, which demonstrate the strength of the bond between humans and animals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The act of [[expiation]] in which humans justify the act of killing nonhuman animals shows that humans are inclined not to harm animals, otherwise there would not need to be any mechanisms created cross-culturally to help deal with the guilt felt in killing animals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Hierarchies===
The hierarchy created among nonhuman animals validates the hierarchies created among humans. Humans identify more closely with nonhuman animals that have human characteristics, and this allows for humans to create a hierarchy that places nonhuman that humans are able to identify more closely with at the top, and those it shares less characteristics with at the bottom.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Humans have evolved to sympathize with beings similar to themselves.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; This allows humans to justify the killing of certain animals over others, because due to the hierarchy humans have created, some animals are of lesser value and therefore have fewer rights. For example, Western cultures kill cows, chickens, and fish for consumption, but find it morally wrong to kill lions, dogs, and dolphins. That is because Western moral values find connections between humans and lions, dogs, and dolphins, but do not find connections between cows, chickens, and fish, and therefore value certain species' lives over others. Which species are valued over others differs depending on culture, country, religion, etc., as can be seen in the fact that it is socially acceptable to eat dogs in many Asian cultures, but is seen as morally corrupt in most Western cultures. The lack of a universal hierarchy for nonhuman animals shows that it is a social construction created to benefit humans.

Vegetarian ecofeminism argues that the killing of any animal is part of a larger system of oppression, and that instead of choosing one animal over another, or a human over a nonhuman animal, humans should care about all oppressed subjects and should be invested in ending each subject's oppression, so as to end the oppression of all beings. The creation of hierarchies in nonhuman animals can also rapidly become the creation of hierarchies in humans, and thus one can once again observe how speciesism is linked to racism, classism, sexism, and other forms of oppression.

Vegetarian ecofeminism asserts that as long as "humans are violent toward animals, they often are violent toward one another" and this "vicious circle of violence and destruction can end only if and when the human species learns to form harmonious relations – non-hierarchical and non-exploitative – with other animal species and the natural world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Best|first=S.|year=2006|title=Rethinking Revolution: Animal Liberation, Human Liberation, and the Future of the Left|url=|journal=Journal of Inclusive Democracy|volume=2 |issue=3|pages=1–28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vegetarianism==
Vegetarian ecofeminism argues that the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women are closely linked, so vegetarian ecofeminism argues that eating meat makes one complicit in the exploitation of animals. It also makes one complicit in the violence towards animals and women, for "meat-eating is a form of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] domination ... that suggests a link between male violence and a meat-based diet".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The phrase "the personal is political" is deeply embedded in ecofeminism, because just as it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products created in [[sweatshop]]s, it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products produced by factory farming.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Feminist]]s recognize that buying and consuming these products, whether they are clothes made by a woman denied her [[Human rights in Cambodia]] or meat from a cow whose rights as a nonhuman animal were violated until it was killed, is an act of support to sweatshops and factory farming, but also to the larger patriarchal system at play.

It is also noted that vegetarianism can be a means to protest violence of all kinds because it believes that "animals and humans suffer and die alike. Violence causes the same pain, the same spilling of blood, the same stench of death, the same arrogant, cruel and brutal taking of life."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Vegetarianism is therefore a way that ecofeminists can embody their beliefs, because eating meat directly supports the domination of humans over nonhumans, speciesism, and the creation of hierarchies. Or in other words, "the fact that our meat-advocating culture has successfully separated the consequence of eating animals from the experience of eating animals".&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Neal. 1990. The evolution of the human diet. ''In The power of your plate''. Summertown TN: Book Publishing Co. Web. 11 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The dairy industry acquires revenue via artificial insemination and the consequential lactating of female bodies. When their calf is born, the newborn is immediately taken from their mother. If they are a male calf, they are destined to be sold to the veal or beef industry. If they are a female calf, they are destined to live the same dairy cow life as their mothers. Vegetarians are able to empathize with nonhuman animals and reject the notion of speciesism, and their diets reflect their beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminists do the same but connect it to the larger picture of systematic oppression, and recognize that the only way that humans are able to justify their oppression of animals is to discredit the empathy and sympathy felt for nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Link between sexism and speciesism==
While the goal of vegetarian ecofeminism is to end all oppression, it does focus on the connections between the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women. Both are [[Objectification|objectified]] by men within the dominate discourse of the patriarchy, though in different ways: women are seen as sex objects and nonhuman animals are seen as food.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In both instances, both beings are considered to be less than men, and therefore are able to be used, abused, and consumed by those with more privilege.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; There are often [[essentialist]]ic and empathetic connections made between human mothers and nonhuman mothers, and ecofeminist scholar Carol Adams exemplifies this when she states "As a lactating mother, I empathize with the sow whose reproductive freedoms have been denied and whose nursing experience seems so wretched."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Generalizing women as mothers is problematic because not all women identify as mothers, yet there often is a strong link made between women and nonhuman animals due to their shared experience and oppression as mothers.

The egg, veal, and dairy industry directly profits from exploiting the reproductive system of female non-human animals. Similarly, many industries profit from objectifying, dominating, and consuming female human bodies. The advertising industry often objectifies women's bodies, as something to be dominated and consumed. Adams asserts that the culturally accepted belief that animal bodies are "disposable objects for fun or eating" emboldens the acceptance of "heterosexuality as normative and the idea that pleasuring men is women's work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Carol J.|year=2017|title=The Poetics of Christian Engagement: Living Compassionately in a Sexual Politics of Meat World|url=|journal=Studies in Christian Ethics|volume=30.1|pages=45–59|via=|doi=10.1177/0953946816674148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linking sexism and speciesism through language===
Women are often objectified by being compared to a piece of meat or [[Dehumanization|dehumanized]] by being called a 'cow' or a 'bird'.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; There is indeed a history of dehumanization through equating humans to animals, which because of speciesism, means that they are devalued and considered to be less than other valued humans.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This is often seen in cases of [[genocide]], for in Rwanda the Tutsi were compared to cockroaches for many months leading up to the actual genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C. J. 2006. The War on Compassion. In J. Donovan and C. J. Adams (eds) The Feminist Care Tradition in Animal Ethics. New York: Columbia University Press, 2007, pp.21–38&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing humans as animals makes it easier to oppress them, and thus it is once again clear that in order to end the oppression of humans, one must also work to end the oppression of nonhuman animals, because so long as nonhuman animals are viewed as inherently inferior to humans, dehumanization will continue to be justified with comparisons to nonhuman animals.

==Morality and ethics==
Sympathy towards nonhuman animals and recognizing that the same dominant power is abusing all of the oppressed is essential to ending all oppression because "humans have an innate sense of sympathy and that this is the basis for moral awareness",&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Donovan | first1=Josephine | year=1990| title=Animal Rights and Feminist Theory | doi=10.1086/494588 | journal=Signs | volume=15 | issue=2| pages=350–375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are therefore able to make the moral and sympathetic connections between human experiences and nonhuman experiences.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; These can include the connection mothers will feel to cows being exploited for their milk, or the understanding among "people of color, women, gays, and lesbians [who] all know the experience of being hunted-of being "prey" in Western culture."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminists argue that as feminists, those who recognize the domination of the patriarchal power, should also recognize the way in which it dominates and objectifies nonhuman animals, and should therefore feel a moral obligation to end not only women's oppression, but animals' oppression as well.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

===Need for justification when harming nonhuman animals===
Harming animals goes against humans' natural instincts, and language is used to hide the harm humans cause nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; In farming, the act of killing a nonhuman animal is not known as "slaughter" but as "termination" or "meat-packing" and the animals themselves are referred to as "livestock". This terminology prevents sympathy, through disconnecting the living animal from the product, and by masking the harm done to these nonhuman animals by humans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Another justification for exploiting and harming animals is that it is a necessary function in order for humans to survive. This is supported by the discourse that humans must consume meat and eggs in order to be healthy, or that animal testing must be used to advance medicine.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; So while humans are naturally empathetic and caring to nonhuman animals, there are a great deal of obstacles created by "the substantial power of institutionalized animal exploitation [that] sustain ignorance, promote fear, reward cruelty, and punish kindness."&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; These obstacles are deeply ingrained in many societies and thus social justice for nonhuman animals is often difficult to obtain.

==The feminist–vegetarian connection==
''The feminist–vegetarian connection'' first appeared in Sheri Lucas' "A Defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection", a response to Kathryn Paxton George's book ''Animal, Vegetable, or Woman? A Feminist Critique of Ethical Vegetarianism (2000)''. The feminist–vegetarian connection is a concept indicating that the oppression of animals in the form of being slaughtered and consumed is parallel to the oppression of women in a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], which establishes a connection between feminism and vegetarianism.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucas|first=Sheri|year=2005|title=A defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection|url=|journal=Hypatia|volume=20|pages=150–177|doi=10.1353/hyp.2005.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carol. J. Adams first published on this topic in 1975.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; However, this topic was mentioned in 'few publications' for ten years afterwards.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; The lack of acknowledgment on this topic in the 1980s became a concern amongst feminists and, eventually, triggered the formation of an 'Ecofeminist Task Force' in 1990, raising awareness on the feminist–vegetarian connection.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; After 1990, this connection was extensively analysed in articles and journals by numerous scholars such as [[Josephine Donovan]] and Kathryn Paxton George.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

==Voices in opposition to the feminist–vegetarian connection==

===Health of men and women on vegetarian and vegan diets===
In ''Animal, Vegetable, or Woman,'' Kathryn Paxton George invalidates the oppression of nonhuman animals, which is "inconsistent with feminism or antithetical to its goals" in her opinion.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; George argues in her essay "Should Feminists be Vegetarians" that "these traditional arguments for ethical vegetarianism cannot be assimilated into a feminist ethic. Correlatively, limited consumption of animal products and, in some cases, meat is consistent with a feminist ethic".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=George|first=Kathryn Paxton|year=1994|title=Should Feminists Be Vegetarians?|url=|journal=Signs|volume=19|issue=2|pages=405–434|doi=10.1086/494889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George's stance is based on human beings' physiology that conditions male to be more likely to succeed on a vegetarian diet than female.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; According to George, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet poses risks on "people identifiable by characteristics over which they have no choice or control: infants, children, adolescents, gestating or lactating women, some elderly people, and many people living in cultural and environmental circumstances that are not dependent on industrialized agriculture and high-tech society".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Based on George's scientific research, she discovered that women and children "are more vulnerable to deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals".&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministcurrent.com/2011/12/18/should-feminists-be-vegetarian/|title=PODCAST: Should Feminists be Vegetarians?|last=Murphy|first=Meghan|date=18 December 2011|website=Feminist Current|publisher=|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially children who adopt a vegan diet "may lack sufficient quantities of vitamin D and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, iron, calcium, and zinc".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Vegan women may face the risk of being diagnosed with osteoporosis as a result of adopting diets that are low in calcium.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; George claims that "milk is still recommended as the best source of calcium" as calcium in plants "either comes in a form the body cannot use very well or occurs in the presence of other compounds (such as phytates, fiber, cellulose, uronic acids, and oxalates in the case of calcium) that prevent its use".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Furthermore, lactating and gestating women may be at 'greater nutritional risk' which may negatively influence the health of the fetus or infant.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In addition, George claims that "even [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|lacto-ovovegetarian]] diet poses some risks".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Along with children and women, people from developing countries where resources and education about taking iron and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; supplements are not available can also be under the risk of iron deficiency.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

===The male ideal===
To further support the argument, George claims that the research on plant-based nutrition was "done almost entirely on men" to support the statement that one does not need to eat animal products for good health.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In George's opinion, the potential health risks brought by a vegetarian or vegan diet are "rare for Western adult males, for whom the ideal is best suited".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Also, "the nutritional evidence suggests that the best candidates for vegetarianism, and for veganism in particular, are young, healthy adult males" because they do not have the nutritional stress "from feeding a rapidly growing fetus nor are they unduly stressed by their own growth requirements, as most of their growth is accomplished".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In general, good health can be achieved and maintained on a vegetarian or vegan diet by privileged people who are "adult [20–50-year-old] male, non-allergic, healthy, well-educated, middle or upper class individual or upper class female unable to bear children".&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animal, Vegetable, or Woman?: A Feminist Critique of Ethical Vegetarianism|last=George|first=Kathryn Paxton|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Albany, New York, United States|pages=16–197|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone else who does not fall into the category of those privileged people is "''physiologically'' barred" from both maintaining health and "being fully moral" of not consuming animals.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

In ''A Defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection,'' Lucas summarizes George's arguments on healthy vegetarian and vegan diets as diets that "[requires] access to fortified foods, supplements, a dietitian, and many other advantages".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Therefore, an "ecofeminist dilemma" arises in the form that "the entire human population cannot enjoy health on vegetarian diets unless an environmental dire spread of industrialization occurs".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; According to George, even if fortified foods and supplements are already incorporated into one's diet, the risk of supplementation still takes its toll on people's health due to "the possibility of toxicity, low availability, and interactions among supplements".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

===Vegetarianism and veganism not as feminist ideals===
According to George, there are two "minimum conceptions of a feminist ethics": "First, no ethics can permit arbitrariness in its prescriptions and theories," and, "Second, any specific feminist ethic must affirm the value of the female body".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Thus, for George, "any feminist ethic must reject (1) requiring women to live as if physiologically the same as men and (2) placing arbitrary burdens upon females that males do not have to bear".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; However, in order to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet, women are required "to accept these burdens rather than reject them".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Therefore, this requirement upon women causes vegetarianism and veganism to "hardly be a feminist ideal".&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; Instead, George thinks that semivegetarianism best embraces "the value of health" and that "it would be more productive ... to improve conditions for animals and to urge truly balanced diets that are not excessive".&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

==Voices in support of the feminist–vegetarian connection==

===Food choices and gender identification===
Some scholars such as [[Carol J. Adams]] and [[Josephine Donovan]] support the feminist–vegetarian connection. In ''The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory'', Adams establishes "the cross-mapping between feminism and vegetarianism" through an in-depth analysis of gender identification embedded in people's food choices.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory|last=Adams|first=Carol J|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York, United States|pages=xxxiv–193|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a patriarchal society, "meat is constant for men, intermittent for women".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; For example, {{"'}}Ethiopian women and girls of all classes are obliged to prepare two meals, one for the males and a second, often containing no meat or other substantial protein, for the females{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Also, women who prepare to be pregnant are told that "one should eat meat (or fish, vegetables, chocolate, and salt) at least six weeks before becoming pregnant if one wants a boy. But if a girl is desired, no meat please, rather milk, cheese, nuts, beans, and cereals".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Additionally, there are cultural food taboos that concern meat consumption based on gender; women are commonly forbidden to have "chicken, duck, and pork" and also "fish, seafood, and eggs" in some Asian countries.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Only "vegetables and other nonmeat foods are viewed as women's food".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Thus, gender identification is heavily associated with the eating of animals; meat-eating links with masculinity while vegetable-eating suggests "emasculation or femininity".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; This gender-based reading of meat-eating is further accentuated by "[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'s notion of [[Phallogocentrism|carnophallogocentrism]]," indicating that "masculinity and carnivorism work together to support the virility, power, and authority of one who argues, dialogues, and speaks reasonably".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malatino|first=Hilary|year=2011|title=Carnophallogocentrism and the Sexual Politics of Meat|url=|journal=Journal of Critical Animal Studies|volume=9|pages=128–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Links between women and animals===
Adams also argues that animals and women are linked through "fused oppressions" as "we oppress animals by associating them with women's lesser status".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Examples include the use of different gender pronouns based on whether an animal poses as having "''a major power'' (he) or ''a minor power'' (she)".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In this case, ''a major power'' refers to {{"'}}an active power and a possible danger to the speaker{{'"}} while ''a minor power'' refers to the power {{"'}}as a potential prey, a power that has to be destroyed{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Adams further explains that "'she' represents not only a 'minor power', but a vanished power, a soon-to-be-killed powerless animal".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Through Adams' analysis, a female-gendered pronoun becomes an indicator of the oppressed, "representing the violated victim of male violence".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Thus, women and animals are linked through "a shared and co-constitutive mechanism of oppression that manifests linguistically, particularly through metaphor".&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

In addition, Adams indicates that people exploits animals' "femaleness" through the consumption of female animals such as hens and cows as well as their by-products such as eggs and dairy.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In the [[meat industry]], slaughters are told not to slaughter female animals "in the advanced stage of pregnancy" because "the physiological condition of the female is disturbed and the flesh is not normal".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Conclusively, Adams states that "the text of the body upon whom we write the fate of being meat is symbolically if not predominantly female".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

Furthermore, Adams argues that the links between women and animals are reinforced "through a structure of the absent referent".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; For instance, animals whose flesh is called "meat" become "absent referent" through butchering;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; by renaming dead bodies as meat, people "do not conjured dead, butchered animals, but cuisine".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  On the other hand, Women also becomes absent in the language about sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; For example, the term "[[rape]]" is used metaphorically to depict other devastating violent incidents, such as {{"'}}rape' of the earth in ecological writing of the early 1970s{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In this case, the experiences of women are recalled "as a vehicle for explicating another being's oppression" yet women themselves are absent.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; According to Adams, violence against both women and animals in the form of "sexual violence and meat eating ... find a point of intersection in the absent referent; ... if animals are the absent referent in the phrase 'the butchering of women', women are the absent referent in the phrase 'the rape of animals{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

Vegetarian ecofeminism brings to light the interconnecting oppressions of women and animals within the patriarchal hierarchy. One primary issue that feminists address is autonomy over their bodies, independent and free from control from the church and the state. Vegan ecofeminist [[Marti Kheel]] contends that "the lack of control that women have over their reproductive capacity in patriarchal society is magnified on factory farms where female cows are kept in a continual state of lactation, and where rape racks are routinely used to impregnate female animals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheel|first=Marti|year=2005|title=Toppling Patriarchy with a Fork: the Feminist Debate Over Meat|url=|journal=Pacific Division of the Society for Women in Philosophy Conference|volume=|pages=1–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alliance between feminism and vegetarianism===
After acknowledging the connections amongst vegetable-eating, women, and animals, Adams proposes that "not only was vegetarianism a logical enacting of a moral viewpoint, but it also resonated with feminist theory and female experience".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; According to ethicist Beverly Harrison, feminists must be with their bodies and acknowledge that all their knowledge, including their moral one, is 'body-mediated knowledge'; disconnecting from their bodies would result in the destruction of 'possibility of moral relations' amongst feminists.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  Adams further asserts that "ethical vegetarianism is a theory people enact with their bodies" as "vegetarians identify a connection between a healthy body and a diet that honors the moral relations between us and other animals".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; From a biological point of view, Adams supports the arguments that humans have bodies of herbivores as opposed to those of carnivores due to the biological evidences from humans' "teeth, saliva, stomach acids, and length of the intestines".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Thus, vegetarianism and feminism are connected through the predominant involvement of one's body. Veganism is a method of rejection to partaking in the oppression of animals in a patriarchal culture.

===Other voices and evidences supporting the feminist–vegetarian connection===
Through evidences from several nutritional studies that prove the health benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets, Donovan explicitly proclaims that "yes, feminists should be vegetarians" one year after the publication of George's article "Should Feminists be Vegetarians?" in 1994.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donovan|first=Josephine|year=1994|title=Comment on George's "Should Feminists Be Vegetarians?"|url=|journal=Signs|volume=21|pages=226–229|doi=10.1086/495062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donovan quotes "Nutritional Consequences of Vegetarianism" that {{"'}}with appropriate attention to nutritional needs, the health consequences of vegetarianism itself are neutral and in some respects may even be positive{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Based on nutritional studies done in 1994, she also quotes that "infant, children, adolescents, and pregnant women have ... special needs ... vegan diets can safely be used by these groups if foods, and in some instances, supplements, are selected which provide a healthful and nutritionally adequate diet ... In many cases, vegan diets offer health benefits".&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Donovan also claims that "most non-Western diets are largely vegetarian" and meat-eating, as a 'Western norm', is imposed on non-Western countries through 'Western cultural imperialism'.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Moreover, according to Lucas, "in the West, nearly all of the available flesh, milk products, and eggs are the output of cruel, violet, and wasteful practices".&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; By extension, purchasing and consuming any animal products directly supports cruelty.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Such evidences disproving the potential biological and environmental harm caused by vegetarianism accentuates the necessity of adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet while being a feminist. According to Donovan, "feminism must take a stand against animal suffering and exploitation, including human consumption of meat".&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

==Praxis==

===Activism===
While vegetarian ecofeminism is at its core an academic field, its main principles and ideas – eradicating all oppression by including speciesism and emphasizing the link between speciesism and sexism – can be transferred from theory into action through activism. Activism can take many forms, one of the most common and achievable being the power of boycotting products that support the exploitation and abuse of women and/or animals.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; For example, vegetarian ecofeminists might boycott products that were created in sweatshops and therefore exploited women, or products that were tested on animals or that were created by killing animals and therefore exploited nonhuman animals. The act of being a vegetarian or a vegan is itself a form of boycotting, for it choosing not to consume products that were created at the expense of killing or abusing nonhuman animals.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Even at the Ecofeminist Task Force of the National Women's Studies Association suggested that no animal products should be served the 1990 NWSA meeting or at future conferences due to ecological and humane issues.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Vegetarian ecofeminist might put their beliefs into practice by participating in demonstrations, as was seen at the 1990 March for the Animals in Washington, D.C., when ecofeminists carried a banner showing their support of recognizing how the domination of humans over nonhumans animals fits into ecofeminism, but also feminism in general.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Key thinkers==
Since vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the larger academic field of ecofeminism, the most significant thinkers of vegetarian ecofeminism are part of both, but one of their focuses is connecting the domination of women to the domination of nonhuman animals, and understanding how animal liberation fits into ecofeminism.

[[Greta Gaard]] is one of the main thinkers within ecofeminism in general, but especially within vegetarian ecofeminism. Aside from being an activist and a writer, she is also a professor at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls. Her essay entitled "Vegetarian Ecofeminism" speaks to many of the key concepts within the field, including the importance of including speciesism in ecofeminism.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

[[Carol J. Adams]], both a vegetarian ecofeminist writer and activist, has spent over twenty years writing about ecofeminism, focusing on the importance of connecting speciesism to sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sister Species: Women, Animals, and Social Justice|last=Kemmerer|first=Lisa|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her article entitled "Ecofeminism and the Eating of Animals" is an essential work to the field, and draws upon the importance of not consuming meat as an ecofeminist. Another one of her major works is "The Sexual Politics of Meat", which once again examines major themes in vegetarian ecofeminism.
