'''4-AcO-MiPT''' ('''4-acetoxy-''N''-methyl-''N''-isopropyltryptamine''' or '''mipracetin''') is a [[Psychedelic_drug|psychedelic]] [[tryptamine]].  It is closely related to [[4-AcO-DMT|''O''-acetylpsilocin]] and [[Methylisopropyltryptamine|MiPT]].

There is very little information on the human [[pharmacology]] or [[toxicity]] of 4-AcO-MiPT, although analytical methods have been developed for its detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=TAKAHASHI|first1=M|last2=NAGASHIMA|first2=M|last3=SUZUKI|first3=J|last4=SETO|first4=T|last5=YASUDA|first5=I|last6=YOSHIDA|first6=T|title=Creation and application of psychoactive designer drugs data library using liquid chromatography with photodiode array spectrophotometry detector and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|journal=Talanta|date=15 February 2009|volume=77|issue=4|pages=1245–1272|doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2008.07.062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noorizadeh|first1=Hadi|last2=Farmany|first2=Abbas|last3=Noorizadeh|first3=Mehrab|title=Application of GA–KPLS and L–M ANN calculations for the prediction of the capacity factor of hazardous psychoactive designer drugs|journal=Medicinal Chemistry Research|date=20 September 2011|volume=21|issue=9|pages=2680–2688|doi=10.1007/s00044-011-9794-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abhirati''' "The Joyous" ({{cjkv|c=妙喜|r=Myōki|rr=Myoheui|p=Miàoxǐ}}; {{bo|w=mngon par dga' ba}}) is the eastern [[pure land]] associated with [[Akshobhya]] in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]].{{sfn|Nattier|2000|72}} It is described in the ''Akṣobhyavyūha Sūtra'' ([[Taishō Tripiṭaka]], 313), which was first translated into Chinese by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] by 186 CE.{{sfn|Nattier|2000|76}}

Although Abhirati emerged in the earliest era of Mahayana thought, Abhirati is far less widely known than [[Sukhavati|Sukhāvatī]], the pure land of [[Amitābha]] that has been the sole focus of [[Pure Land Buddhism]] since the [[Tang dynasty]].{{sfn|Nattier|2000|74}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2908">'''''Amud Yomi''''' ({{lang-he|עמוד יומי}}) "column [of the] day" or "daily page") is a daily regimen undertaken to study the Babylonian [[Talmud]] one amud each day. (Compare with [[Daf Yomi]] in which a ''daf'' consists of two ''amud's'', one on each side of the page).

==Initiation==
The idea for calendar-based learning of the Talmud began with [[Daf Yomi]] in 1923. Many people have found it difficult to keep up with the heavy load of two pages (or one ''daf'') each day. In addition, the pace can be a little fast to delve too deeply into the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.amudyomi.org|url=http://www.mastertorah.com/newsite/general/index.php?page=talmud_about|accessdate=2009-03-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090215064220/http://mastertorah.com/newsite/general/index.php?page=talmud_about| archivedate= 15 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Amud Yomi was created as a way to study the [[Talmud]] at a slower pace.

==Process==
With 2,711 ''dappim'' (plural for daf) in the Talmud, there are over 5400 ''amudim''. (It's not exactly twice the number of ''dappim'', as some tractates will end on the front side of the page.) Most programs schedule some days for review or catch up, typically on Saturday and/or Sunday. As such, programs will cover between five and seven ''amudim'' a week. Depending on the schedule, the entire Talmud would be completed in this fashion after 15 to 21 years.

'''Ancient Iranian religion''' refers to the ancient beliefs and practices of the [[Iranian peoples]] before the rise of [[Zoroastrianism]].

The Iranian peoples emerged as a separate branch of the [[Indo-Iranians]] in the 2nd-millennium BC, during which they came to dominate the [[Eurasian Steppe]] and the [[Iranian Plateau]]. Their religion is derived from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]], and therefore shares many similarities with [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]]. Although the Iranian peoples left few written or material evidence of their religious practices, their religion is possible to reconstruct from scant Iranian, [[Babylonia]]n and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] accounts, similarities with Vedic and other [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European religions]], and material evidence. Their religion was polytheistic and the chief god of their pantheon was [[Ahura Mazda]], who was recognized as the creator of the world. They had a three-tiered division of the [[cosmos]] into the earth, the atmosphere and the heaven above. Dualism was strongly emphasized and human nature was considered essentially good. The chief ritual of the ancient Iranians was the [[Yasna|yazna]], in which the deities were praised and the [[Psychoactive drug|mind-altering drug]] [[Haoma|hauma]] was consumed. This ritual was performed by a highly trained priestly class. Fire was worshiped as the deity [[Atar]]. Politician and religion under the [[Persian Empire]]s was strongly connected.

Beginning in the early 10th-century BC, the ancient Iranian religion was gradually displaced by Zoroastrianism, which contains many essential aspects of its predecessor.

==Sources==
The sources on ancient Iranian religion, though limited, consist of textual and material sources. The textual sources are both [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] and non-Iranian.

===Iranian sources===
{{See|Avesta|Behistun Inscription}}
[[File:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|thumb|The [[Behistun Inscription|Bistun Inscription]] of [[Darius I|Darius the Great]] is an important source on the ancient Iranian religion]]
An important Iranian source is the [[Avesta]], which are [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastria]]n sacred scriptures made in the [[Avestan]]. This is considered the principal source of knowledge on ancient [[Iranian religions]]. It is a collection of several texts that seems to have been over a large span of time by a variety of authors. These texts have been subjected to editings and redactions throughout their development. It is now the only extant fragment of what remained in the 9th century of the Avesta compiled in the [[Sasanian Empire]] by [[Khosrow I]]. Summaries of its content reveal that it was a huge collection containing texts not only in Avestan, but also in [[Inscriptional Pahlavi|Pahlavi]], which was the language of Zoroastrianism in the Sasanian Empire. Though the existing Avesta is dated quite recently, it contains information that is considerably older. The [[Gathas]] ("Songs") of the Prophet [[Zoroaster]] and much of the Yashts are considered among the oldest. The Gathas includes expressions of the religious vision of Zoroaster, which in many ways is a reinterpretation of the ancient Iranian religious principles. The Yashts are a collection of verses dedicated to various deities. These verses are mostly related to Zoroastrian terminology and ideas, but have little relation to anything specifically Zoroastrian. The gods invoked are basically the pre-Zoroastrian gods of the Iranian peoples. There is little agreement on when Zoroaster lived, but most scholars agree that he lived somewhere between 1200 and 600 BC. Dating the Yashts is similarly difficult, but it is likely that they were redacted (not necessarily composed) initially in the 5th-century BC.

[[File:Herodotos Met 91.8.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The 5th-century BC [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] is an important source on ancient Iranian religion]]

Another Iranian source are royal inscriptions of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] made in the [[Old Persian]] (with [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Elamite language|Elamite]] translations). These inscriptions, in particular those of [[Darius I]] and his son [[Xerxes I]], contain many references to religion. The fact that these are fixed in time and place make them particularly useful.

Except from the Achaemenid inscriptions, there is no evidence that the Iranian religious compositions were written until the late [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] or Sassanid period. This makes ancient Iranian religion the only major religion of the [[Middle East]] which has no written texts in the ancient period. The religious information was rather oral both in composition and transmission.

===Non-Iranian sources===
The non-Iranian sources are mainly [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]. The most important Greek source is [[Herodotus]]. Some of the Greek information on ancient Iranian religion is however unreliable. This is either because it is based on outright wrong information or based on misunderstandings.

The historical reconstruction of ancient [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] literature is also an important source. The earliest religious texts of the related [[Indo-Aryan peoples]] are indispensable for reconstructing the historical development of the ancient Iranian religion. The most important of these texts in this regard is the [[Rigveda]]. It is composed of more than 1,000 hymns dedicated to various deities. The Rigveda can be dated to the period between 1700 and 1100 BC.

===Material sources===
Material sources are rather limited and mostly confined to western [[Iran]]. The remains of Achaemenid architecture are the most important of these material sources. They provide a mass of evidence of imperial articulation of religious symbols and indicate a significant dependence on Middle Eastern precedents.

==Origins==
{{See|Indo-Iranians|List of ancient Iranian peoples}}
[[File:Indo-Iranian origins.png|right|thumb|The [[Andronovo culture]], [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]] and [[Yaz culture]] cultures have been associated with [[Indo-Iranians]].]]
{{History of Greater Iran}}
During the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, one group of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] migrated southwards from the [[Eurasian Steppe]] into the [[Middle East]], the [[Iranian plateau]] and the northwestern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. These were [[Indo-Iranians]] calling themselves Arya ("nobles"). Those that settled in the [[Near East]] and [[India]] are known as Indo-Aryan peoples, while those that settled in [[Greater Iran]] are known are [[Iranian peoples]]. Because of their common origin, Iranian and Indo-Aryan religion is substantially similar. Through a comparative study of both groups one can reconstruct general features of Iranian religion for which there is no direct documentation.

The Iranian peoples were originally seminomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralists]] whoe main economic base was cattle, chiefly bovines but also goats and sheep. They excelled at breeding horses, which they used for riding and pulling [[chariot]]s in sport and warfare. Exactly how [[Trifunctional hypothesis|rigid]] their society was is difficult to determine. The Iranian peoples were specialists in religious matters. Men who could afford chariots and horses were recognized as leaders and warriors.

By the creation of the Achaemenid Empire, a more rigid division of society into priests, nobles, farmers and artisans had developed. Society was heavily [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], which was strongly reflected in religion. As the Iranian peoples settled the land they became more engaged in agriculture and sedentary life. During this process they were influenced by the indigenous populations. The religions of these peoples are completely unknown except from the elements they have left Iranian religion which has no parallel with other [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European religions]].

==Cosmology==
{{See also|Zoroastrian cosmology}}

===Cosmography===
The ancient Iranians believed in a [[cosmos]] which was a three-tiered structure. This structure consisted of the earth, the atmosphere, and the heaven above. Beyond heaven was the realm of Endless Lights while below the earth lay the realm of darkness and chaos. The earth rested on a cosmic sea called the [[Vourukasha|Varu-Karta]]. In the earths centre was cosmic mountain [[Hara Berezaiti|Hara]]. Down the Hara flowed the river [[Anahita|Ardvi]].

The earth divided into six continents surrounding the central continent. The central continent was Khvaniratha, the locus of Aryana Vajiah (land of the Aryans).

Neither the Avesta or Achaemenid inscriptions have much to say about creation as they contain nothing that can be compared to the [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]] [[Enûma Eliš]] or the first chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]]. What is rather emphasized is the majesty and power of [[Ahura Mazda]] as the creator of heaven and earth. Beside Ahura Mazda is the ancient Indo-Iranian god [[Tvastar|Thvarshtar]] ("Artisan"). Thvarstar also appears under the name Spenta Mainyu ("the Beneficient Spirit") in Zoroaster's system of the Beneficent Immortals. In the creative aspect Thvarshtar functions in many ways as Ahura Mazda. In the Younger Avesta [[Amesha Spenta|Spenta]] and the Gathas Mainyu is paired with the evil antagonist [[Angra Mainyu]] ("the Evil Spirit", Ahriman in [[Middle Persian]]). In later sources it is Ohrmazd (Middle Persian for Ahura Mazda) who is paired with Ahriman. The Avesta contains cryptic allusions to the creations of two antagonistic spirits.

It is [[Plutarch]] (De Iside et Osiride 47), who conducts the first discursive exposition of world creation by two spirits. Plutarch describes the [[Persian people|Persians]] as telling mythical tales about Oromazes (i. e., Ahura Mazda), who is born from light, and Areimanios (i. e., Ahriman), who is born from gloom, engaging in a war against each other. This dualistic idea of two primordial spirits, which Zoroaster calls twins, is an early Indo-European concept. Reconstruction indicates that primordial twins that existed before the creation of the world, came into conflict. One was named "[[Manu (Hinduism)|Man]]" (Iranian *Manu', meaning "man"), the other was named "[[Yama|Twin]]" (Iranian Yama, Avestan Yima. After Man killed Yima he used his dismembered body to fashion the world. He used the flesh for the earth, the bones for the mountains, the skull for the sky, etc. In a different Iranian variant of the myth, Yama is the first mortal and the first ruler. His rule is described as a golden age in which there is no hot or cold, no death or old age, etc. When falsehood enters Yama's speech this golden age comes to an end. The royal Glory ([[Khvarenah|Khvarnah]]) departs from Yama and seeks refuge in the cosmic sea. [[Zahhak|Azhi Dahaka]] ("Dahaka the Snake"), a serpentine tyrant, then overthrows Yama. His rule ushers in a period of chaos, drought and ruin. Azhi is later defeated by the hero Thraitauna. Thraitauna establishes the legendary line of rulers called [[Kayanian dynasty|Kavis]].

Since all sources on [[Iranian mythology|Iranian myths]], both from indigenous texts and classical authors, originated after the emergence of Zoroastrianism, it is difficult to distinguish between myths that are Zoroastrian innovations from that those that are inherited. The fact that Zoroastrianism is heavily inspired by already existing ideas and has adapted from previous Iranian religions makes this discerning particularly hard. Like other ancient religions in general, Iranian religions did not have main collection of myth. Iranian myths are rather fragments from a diverse variety of myths that exhibit variations in common themes.

There is a variant of the [[Noah's Ark]] myth in Iranian religion. Here Yama appears as the herdsman and leader of mankind. Yama rules the world for a long time, during which the earth is increased threefold due to overcrowding. Ahura Mazda tells Yama that a great winter is on the horizon. He advises Yama to build a large three-story barn-like structure (vara) in order to hold seeds of plants and pairs of animals. It seems that the vara were actually some sort of paradise or blessed island, even though the story at first developed as myth among pastoralists about the culture hero building a first winter cattle station.

Zoroaster appears to have been the first religious figure to develop an [[Eschatology|eschatological]] myth about a future saviour to rescue the world from evil. This idea plays an important part in Zoroastrianism. It was probably also influential in introducing the concept of the [[messiah]] in [[Babylonian captivity|exile]] [[Judaism]].

==Pantheon==
The Iranian pantheon was similar to that of other Indo-European religions. It contained a large number of [[deity|deities]], primarily male. These deities personified natural phenomena, social norms or institutions. It seems that there were two major groups of deities, the [[Daeva|daivas]] and the [[ahura]]s. Daiva, which means "heavenly one", is derived from the common [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for "god", which is the meaning it has in the [[Vedas]]. Among some Iranians and in Zoroastrianism the daivas were considered [[demon]]s, but this view was not universal. The ahuras ("lords") were noble sovereign deities. They were contradicted with the [[Bhaga|bagha]] ("the one who distributes") and the [[yazata]] ("the one who worshipped").

The chief of the pantheon was [[Ahura Mazda]] ("wise lord"). He was particularly connected with the principle of social and cosmic order called [[asha]] in Avestan. Closely connected to him was the ahura [[Mithra]]. Mithra was the god who presided over the covenants. In Iranian religion there were two gods with martial trais similar to those of Vedic Indra, these were Mithra and [[Verethragna|Vrthraghna]]. The most prominent female deities were Spanta Aramati, the deity of the earth, and Ardvi Sura, the deity of the sacred river.

===Ahura Mazda===

Ahura Mazda ("Wise Lord") was probably the main god in pantheon of the pre-Zoroastrian Iranians. In both the religion of Darius, Xerxes and Zoroaster, he was worshipped as the [[Supreme Being|supreme god]] to the point that the rest were almost excluded. He is chiefly considered the creator of the [[universe]] and the one who maintains cosmic and social order, [[Asha|arta]]. In his inscriptions, Darius  derives his source of authority from Ahura Mazda and makes it clear that political stability and order through law imitates the model set out by the Creator. Through interrogative discourse, an ancient Indo-European poetic device, Zoroaster asks: "Who is the original father of arta? Who established the paths of the sun and the stars? Who is it through whom the moon now waxes now wanes? Who supports the earth below and (keeps) the heavens (above) from falling down? Who yokes the two steeds to the wind and the clouds?... Who fashioned honoured Devotion together with Dominion? Who made... a son respectful of his father?"

Neither the Avesta nor the Achaemenid instripctions identify Ahura Mazda with a natural phenomenon. In the hymn of the goddess [[Rati|Rti]] (Reward), Ahura Mazda is identified as her father and Spenta Ariamati (Earth) as her mother. This implies that he has assumed the role of the Indo-European [[Sky father|Father Heaven]] (*[[Dyeus|Diēus Pater]], Vedic [[Dyaus (deity)|Dyaus Pitar]]), who is paired with [[Earth goddess|Mother Earth]]. Herodotus apparently makes this identification when stating that [[Zeus]] in [[Persian mythology]] "is the whole circle of heavens". Zeus is also equated with Oromazes (Ahura Mazda) in other Greek sources. These Greeks made this comparison because of Ahura Mazda’s role as father and chief god of the pantheon. His name implies that that he was sought by worshippers for his wisdom. Based on the expressions of Darius and Zoroaster, it is reasonable to assume that he was the object of a personal devotion which seems to have been absent with other deities.

===Mithra===
{{Main|Mithra}}
{{See also|Mithraism}}
[[Image:Taq-e Bostan - High-relief of Ardeshir II investiture.jpg|thumb|[[Investiture]] of [[Sassanid]] emperor [[Ardashir II]] (3rd century CE bas-relief at [[Taq-e Bostan]], [[Iran]]. On the left stands the [[Mithra]] with raised ''[[barsom]]'', sanctifying the investiture.]]
Along with Ahura Mazda, Mithra was the most important deity in the ancient Iranian pantheon. He may have occupied a position almost equal to him. In the Achaemenid inscriptions, Mithra is along with [[Anahita]] the only deity specifically mentioned.

In the ancient Iranian pantheon there was an individual [[Solar deity|sun god]] called [[Hvare-khshaeta|Hvar Khshaita]]. In the eastern Iranian traditions laid out in the Avesta, Mithra also appears to have a connection to the sun, especially with the first rays of sunrise as he drives forward in his chariot. In the western Iranian tradition Mithra was thoroughly associated with the sun and his name became the common word for "sun".

Despite his connection to the sun Mithra function prominently in the ethical sphere. The word Mithra was a common noun meaning "contract, covenant, treaty". Mithra was thus the god of Covenant. In this respect he function as a [[Astronomical object|celestial]] deity overseeing all solemn agreements made between people. Breaking such agreements was subjected to severe punishment whether the agreement were made between individuals or sociopolitical entities. As a covenant breaker, Mithra is described as sleepless and having 1,000 ears and 10,000 eyes. He is great warrior sporting a mace while driving his chariot into battle. In this capacity he intervenes on behalf of those faithful to treaties by subjecting the treaty breakers (mithra-drug) to panic and defeat.

As an independent deity, Mithra carried the standing epithet varu-gavyuti, which means "one who (presides over) wide pasture lands". Another of his epithets was payu, "protector". He is considered the one who protects the territories of those who worship him and abide by their promises.

Mithra is the god who gave his name to the religion of [[Mithraism]], which was at one point popular throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. The Iranian origins of mithraism are difficult to trace.

===Anahiti===
{{Main|Anahita}}
[[File:Taq-e Bostan - High-relief of Anahita, Khosro II, Ahura Mazda.jpg|thumb|300 px|[[Taq-e Bostan]] high-relief of the investiture of [[Khosrow II]] (''r.'' 590 to 628). The king (center) receives the ring of kingship from Mithra (right). On the left, apparently sanctifying the investiture, stands a female figure generally assumed to be [[Anahita]].]]
One of the longest of the Avestan Yashts is devoted to a goddess whose name is given as [[Anahita|Ardvi Sura Anahita]], which means "the damp, strong, untainted". The long name apparently combines two separate names which originally belonged to two individual deities, Ardvi Sura and Anahiti. Ardvi Sura is the Iranian name for the heavenly river goddess who in the Rigveda is called [[Sarasvati]]. In this capacity she brings water to the earth, streams, rivers, and seas while flowing from Mount Hukarya to Varu-Karta sea. Anahiti on the other hand is a separate goddess of unknown origin whose cult appears to have been popular originally in northeastern Iran. The name probably meant “untaintedness, purity". Here purity was meant both in moral and physical terms. The Greek Anaitis  preserves the original [[Proto-Iranian language|Old Iranian]] form of this name, while the Old Persian and Avestan Anahit(a) is a more recent linguistic form. In post-Achaemenid Iran Anahiti was closely connected with kingship and the [[shah]].

The Yashts describe Anahita in great detail, unlike any other deity. The descriptions about her clothing and ornamentation are so specific that it is likely the source of the description was a dressed cult image. This fact is confirmed in her mentioning by [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerses II]]. [[Berossus]], a [[Babylonia]]n historian, notes that the king had several images of her made and distributed. Since the Iranians did not originally make images, it is likely that the cult of Anahiti was inspired by Mesopotamian models. The Mesopotamian goddess [[Inanna|Ishtar]] is a likely candidate in this regard, although Anahiti's dress, in particular her beaver coat, shows major differences. There were also major similarities in their roles. Ishtar was the patroness of the palace and goddess of war. Anahiti is described as a patron of Iranian heroes and legendary rulers and her Yasht is strongly devoted to her martial traits. Both goddesses were [[List of fertility deities|important for fertility]].

===Vrthraghna===
{{Main|Verethragna}}
Vrthraghna was the mighty [[List of war deities|deity of war]]. He had martial traits are similar to Mithra and the Vedic god of war [[Indra]]. In the post-Achaemenid period he was equated with [[Hercules]] and became a favourite deity of monarchs, many of whom took his name. His name means "the smashing of resistance or obstruction". In his capacity as the god who guaranteed his people to overcome all resistance, his name came to be understood as meaning "Victory".

In connection with rulership and granting victory, he held the epithet bara-khvarnah, which means "Bearing the Glory." Like Mithra he is portrayed as the ideal warrior. For the earliest Iranian invaders of the Iranian plateau, he came to personify aspirations to acquire new territory from the native population. For later Iranians he became the divine manifestation for the will to [[World domination|conquer the world]].

In the Iranian pantheon, Vrthraghna was the god who predominantly possessed the ability to undergo transformations, both anthropomorphic and [[Therianthropy|theriomorphic]]. Though rich mythologies are believed to have existed for these [[avatar]]s, only 10 forms have been recorded. These are:

{{Quote box

* Bull
* Stallion
* Rutting camel
* Wild boar
* 15-year-old male (this was considered the ideal age)
* Falcon
* Ram
* Goat
* Hero
The avatars of Vrthraghna all had a fellow aggressiveness and virility. In some violence is conspicuous. Descriptions of these avatars can be particularly graphic.

===Rashnu===
{{Main|Rashnu}}
[[Rashnu]] was an ethical deity, a divine judge who presided over the legal disputes of humans. He was often associated with Mithra. The name of Rashnu is derived from the Indo-European verb, *reg ("to be, make straight, direct, judge"). In particular he seems to have been the god of oaths and ordeals administered in trials. In several ways he was responsible for the same judicial functions as the Vedic god [[Varuna]], who was the ultimate judge presiding over oaths, often inseparable from the Vedic [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]].

While it is uncertain whether Ahura Mazda had any judicial responsibilities, Rashnu and Mithra were connected with two separate areas of law. While Mithra was concerned with covenants, Rashnu mainly had jurisdiction of legal matters, in particular those of criminal nature. He was invoked as the god who "best smite(s), who best destroy(s) the thief and the bandit at this trial."

===Tishtrya and Tiri===
{{Main|Tishtrya}}
Astral deities figured more prominently in ancient Iranian religion than [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]]. This may be explained with the influence of Babylonian science on the Iranians, in particular the western groups. In the Avesta stars and constellations such as [[Ursa Major]], the [[Pleiades]], [[Vega]], [[Fomalhaut]] and the [[Milky Way]] are mentioned. The most important astral deities seem to have been [[Tishtrya|Tiri]] and [[Tishtrya]].

For reasons that are unknown, Tishtrya is associated with the star [[Sirius]] in one Yasht that is entirely devoted to her. Though the heliacal rising of Sirius is assumed to have occurred during the season of drought, his chief myth concerns a battle between him and the demonic star [[Apaosha|Apausha]] ("Nonprosperity") over rainfall and water. In a battle taking place along the shores of Varu-Karta, Tishtrya and Apausha battled each other while assuming the forms of a white [[stallion]] and an ugly horse. Though Apausha is initially victorious, Tishtrya eventually prevails after receiving worship, driving Apausha "along a path the length of a race course." This combat was reenacted by the Iranians in a yearly [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] ritual. After assuming victory Tishtrya causes the cosmic sea to boil and surge. Then another star, Satavaisa (Formelhaut), arises with cloud-forming mists. These mists are blown by the wind in the form of "rain and clouds and hail to the dwelling and the settlements (and) to the seven continents."

Tishtrya was considered to contain the seeds of waters and was thus closely connected with agriculture. He defeated shooting stars identified as witches, in particular one named "Bad Crop" (Duzhyāryā). In Zoroastrianism Tishrya was in late Achaemenid times identified with the western Astral deity Tiri ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] in Sassanid astronomy). Little is known about Tiri except from the highly important agricultural festival, the [[Tirgan|Tiragan]]. The fourth month, (Tir, Avestan Tishtryaeninis), and the 13th day (Tir) of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]], bears this name.

==Practices==
In sharp contrast to other people of the Middle East, the Iranians neither made images of their deities or built temples to house them. They preferred to worship their gods in the open. The ancient Iranians practiced a sacrificial ritual [[Yasna|yazna]]. In [[Atar|this ritual fire]] and the sacred drink [[Haoma|hauma]] played a key part. The chief officiant at this sacrifice was the [[Atar|zautar]].

===Yazna===
{{Main|Yasna}}
{{See|Haoma|Magi}}
Worship was mainly performed through the central ritual yazna. This ritual corresponds in many regards with the Vedic [[yajna]]. Despite changes undergone  through the millennia, these rituals are still performed by [[Zoroastrians]] and [[Hindus]]. It is probably the oldest continuously enacted ritual in the world. As far as yazna can be reconstructed, it was basically a highly elaborate festive meal offered to a guest. In this ritual the sacrificer was the host and the deity the guest. While yazna is a daily ritual in Zoroastrianism, its frequency among the early Iranians is not precisely known. Yazna was held to into communion a divine. This was either for a specific purpose, for example to secure victory in war, to express piety or to secure general welfare. Yazna followed the general rules of hospitality. A guest was sent by invitation. Upon arrival he received a warm greeting and was shown to a comfortable seat. There he was given meat and drink while entertained with songs praising his deeds and virtues. The guest was expected to return the hospitality with a gift.

The seat provided for the gods invited to yazna originally consisted of special grasses spread on the ground in front of the altar. In Vedic terminology this was called the barhish (Avestan barzish, "cushion"). The Avestan word barəsman (Iranian barzman), used in Zoroastrianism, is a cognate of this word. It is used for a bundle of sticks, later thin metal rods, that are manipulated by priests.

Of bigger importance than the offering of meat was the preparation of the divine drink [[Haoma|hauma]]. Like fire, hauma was considered both sacred and as a deity. The most important part of yazna was probably the preparation of hauma. Despite numerous proposals, the plant whose juices were extracted to prepare hauma has not been identified. The word hauma is derived from a verb "to press, extract". It thus literally means the [[juice]] which has been pressed out of the whatever plant that has been used. While making hauma the stalks were first soaked in water and then pounded. While Zoroastrians did this with metal mortar and pestle, the early Iranians pounded the stalks between two pressing stones. The juice was filtered and mixed with [[milk]] to reduce the bitter taste. It was also possibly mixed with [[water]]. Hauma was described as [[yellow]]. The drink was then consumed immediately. Though it was not [[Alcoholic drink|alcoholic]] it was rather a [[Psychoactive drug|mind-altering drug]]. According to the Yasht to Hauma: "All other intoxicants are accompanied by Wrath with the horrible club, but that intoxication which is Hauma’s is accompanied by gladdening Truth (arta)." This minor statement can be extended with more informative descriptions in the Rigveda. In the Rigveda [[Soma (drink)|soma]] was not only offered to gods, but also consumed by poets to increase their power in their search for truth. Hauma was also drunk as a stimulant by warriors before going into battle. Many heroes of Iranian mythology are remembered for having practiced this cult.

It is probable that yasna from a very early period was carried out by a priest, the zautar (Vedic hotar). The zautar was probably assisted by several other ritual specialists. With the priests acting through the sacrificer, the gods were invoked through fire. When the god arrived he was placed at the barzman, served parts of the slaughtered victim as food, served a drink and entertained with song. In turn the sacrificer would request a gift, usually in the form of heroic songs, good health or victory. In many ways the ritual can be compared with the old [[Latin]] dictum do ut des ("I give so that you may give"), in the sense that it was meant to provide a means of inducing the deities to act in favor of humans. In addition it made a communion between the divine and human realms possible. Deities could also be addressed directly through prayer. In this case the supplicant would be standing erect with upraised arms. Prostration was not known.

[[File:Niasar Fire Temple.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Fire temple]] of the early [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] or [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] period in [[Kashan]], [[Iran]].]]

===Fire===
{{See|Fire in ancient Iranian culture}}
{{See also|Fire worship}}
Fire was of supreme importance in Iranian rituals. In ancient Iran, fire was considered a deity and highly sacred element. As a result, [[atar]] was denoted both "fire and "Fire". Every instance of fire was considered a manifestation of a deity. Because burned offerings were not not made, Atar's role was mainly that of an intermediary between heaven and earth and between humans and gods. This is similar to his Vedic counterpart [[Agni]]. Beyond yazna, fire was carefully treated as a sacred element. Whether in households, or later, in fire temples, fire was maintained with proper fuel, protected from polluting agents, and most importantly never extinguished.

===Songs===
The song of praise to the divine guest was a major importance. Almost all of the Rigveda and much of the poetic portions of the Avesta must be understood in this context. This means that the ancient poetry of the Indo-Iranians was religious in nature and composed specifically for ritual occasions in which gods required songs of praise in order to make them well disposed towards those who worshipped them.

The obscure parts of many Vedic hymns and Zoroaster's Gathas can best be understood through realizing that the intended audience were the gods rather than humans.

===Festivals===
{{See|Nowruz}}
The Iranians celebrated various festivals throughout the year. These were mostly related to agricultural and herding cycles. The most important of these was that of [[Nowruz|New Year]], which is still celebrated by Iranian peoples.

==Philosophy==
===Dualism===
Like with other ancient religions, the [[cosmology|cosmological]] dichotomy of chaos and cosmos played an important part of both myth and worldview. The most important and unique aspect of ancient Iranian religion was the development of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. This was mainly expressed in opposition between truth (arta) and falsehood ([[Asha|drug, drauga]]). While originally confined to the conflict between social order and social disorder, this dualistic worldview came to affect all aspects of life. The pantheon became divided between gods and demons. Under the influence of the [[Magi]], who were members of a priestly [[Medes|Median]] tribe, the animal kingdom became divided into two classes. There were beneficent animals and noxious creatures.

Dualism even permeated the vocabulary. "ahuric" and "daivic" words for developed for such things as body parts. For example, the word zasta and gava became used for the hands of a righteous and evil person, respectively. This was however not a [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] system like the ones that flourished in the Middle East in the [[Common Era]]. This was because there was no myth of evil being created through the corruption of a spiritual being.

===Human nature===
In the Zoroastrian myth of creation, humans are created for the purpose of repulsing the [[Angra Mainyu|Evil Spirit]]. Although is uncertain whether this is a pre-Zoroastrian concept, it shows in that in Iranian religion human nature was considered essentially good. This is contrary to the myths about the baseness of human condition found in Babylonian mythology, for example in Enûma Eliš. In Iranian religious thought humans had [[free will]] and were able for determine their own destinies through their ethical choices.

In addition to the body (tanu), an individual was believed to consist of a number of spiritual elements that basically fall under the category of souls. These were:
* The animating force (ahu)
* The breath of life (vyana)
* Mind or spirit (manah)
* The soul (ruvan, Avestan urvan)
* The protective spirit (fravarti; Avestan [[fravashi]])
* The spiritual double (daina; Avestan [[daena]])
In Zoroastrianism, belief in the Day of Judgement was a central aspect. Zoroastrianism considers the ruvan to be accountable for a person's actions in life. It is therefore the ruvan which receives reward or punishment in the afterlife. At the time of judgement, the ruvan is encountered by the daina. The daina embodies the sums of a persons deeds in life, and is manifested as either a beautiful maiden or an ugly old woman. Depending on how the persons deeds are weighed, the soul is either crossed safely across the [[Chinvat Bridge|Cinvat Bridge]] to the other world or descends into the abyss.

The fravarti is a deity which functions as a protective spirit for an individual. It is also an ancestor spirit. The fravartis constitute a warrior band, quite similar to the Vedic [[Maruts]].

===Politics===
Apart from the legendary kings of eastern Iran, the Kavis, of whom Zoroaster's patron [[Vishtaspa]] (Hystapes) was the last, the only historical information about the relationship between religious and political authority come from the Achaemeneid period in western Iran. The ideology of kingship was closely connected to Ahura Mazda,a the supreme deity. The kings ruled through his will. Achaemenid kings were compelled to contend with the Median priests, known as magi. The origin of the magi is unclear. According to classical sources they were responsible for presiding over religious ceremonies and chanting "[[Theogony|theogonies]]".

The magi were also deeply involved in politics. This can be seen by the attempt of the magus [[Gaumata]] to usurp the throne after the death of Cambyses II. Darius persecuted the magi, but they were able to preserve their power and eventually become the official priesthood of the Achaemenid Empire. The magi were probably responsible with introducing dualist ideology and enforcing zealous preoccupation with ritual purity in Zoroastrianism. They are also famous throughout the ancient world for their ability to perform [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].

'''Aspidomancy''' (from the Greek word "aspis" meaning shield)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aspidomancy |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/aspidomancy |website=YourDictionary |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[divination]] based on the interpretation of patterns on a [[shield]].  Reading the patterns is believed to give some insight into the future.  Readers study the shield, looking for a pattern that may represent symbols or pictures.  They interpret these symbols and pictures as clues as to what is going to happen in the future.

Aspidomancy can also refer to the method of divination of sitting on a shield and reciting [[incantation]]s to summon an entity or enter a [[trance]], in order to gain knowledge. This method was first described in the 17th century by French writer [[Pierre de Lancre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aspidomancy |url=https://www.themystica.com/aspidomancy/ |website=The Mystica |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''canon penitentiary''' ({{lang-la|'''canon penitentiarius'''}}) is a member of the [[chapter at cathedral]] or collegiate churches, who acts as a general [[confession (Catholic Church)|confessor]] of the [[diocese]]. He has ordinary jurisdiction in the [[internal forum]], which power, however, he may not [[delegation|delegate]] to others, and may absolve residents and strangers in the diocese and subjects of the diocese also outside same. His power extends also to sins and censures reserved to the [[bishop]]. The office of general confessor is foreshadowed in the early history of penitential discipline. Distinct legislation concerning the office is found in the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215), but especially in the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563).

'''Congregation Dorshei Emet''' ({{lang-he-n|בית הכנסת דרשי אמת}} or "Seekers of Truth Synagogue") is a  [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] [[synagogue]] in [[Hampstead, Quebec]]. It was founded in 1960 by Lavy Becker, who served as volunteer [[rabbi]]. Ron Aigen was hired as the congregation's first paid rabbi in 1976, and Heather Batchelor was hired as the first [[hazzan|cantor]] in 2009.

Dorshei Emet constructed its first synagogue building in 1967. The congregation soon outgrew this structure, and built a larger one on the same site in 2003.

{{As of|2011}}, Dorshei Emet had close to 500 member households. It was the only Reconstructionist synagogue in [[Quebec]], and the oldest in [[Canada]].

==Early history==

Becker was the driving force behind a number of synagogues; he had previously helped found the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Young Israel of Montreal (in 1921), and been the founding rabbi of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Congregation Beth-El in [[Mount Royal, Quebec]] (in 1951).&lt;ref name=EJ2007p246/&gt;&lt;ref name=LavyBecker/&gt; He also helped organize Toronto's first Reconstructionist synagogue, Congregation Darchei Noam, in 1962,&lt;ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p375&gt;[[Kerry Olitzky|Olitzky, Kerry M.]]; Raphael, Marc Lee.

In 1964, the congregation acquired land on Cleve Road in Hampstead, and began construction of its first building there.&lt;ref name=CJCArchivesR/&gt; The "habitant-style" building was completed in 1967,&lt;ref name=LavyBecker/&gt;&lt;ref name=CJCArchivesR/&gt; and officially opened by Kaplan during a Reconstructionist convention in Montreal in the spring that year.&lt;ref name=JRFPOTM200212&gt;[http://63.115.67.94/news/picofmonth-02-12.html The New Home of Congregation Dorshei Emet The Reconstructionist Synagogue of Montreal] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20101230140542/http://63.115.67.94/news/picofmonth-02-12.html |date=2010-12-30 }}, Picture of the Month, [[Jewish Reconstructionist Federation]] website, December 2002.

The congregation adopted the name '''Congregation Dorshei Emet''' in the late 1970s, though it was still also known as "the Reconstructionist Synagogue of Montreal".&lt;ref name=LavyBecker/&gt;&lt;ref name=CJCArchivesR/&gt; Ron Aigen was hired as the congregation's first paid rabbi in 1976. That year the congregation, which had under 180 member families, added an extension to its building.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;&lt;ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p381&gt;[[Kerry Olitzky|Olitzky, Kerry M.]]; Raphael, Marc Lee.

Becker led the congregation as rabbi until 1976&lt;ref name=LavyBecker/&gt; or 1977.&lt;ref name=EJ2007p246/&gt; His role as rabbi at Dorshei Emet was unpaid,&lt;ref name=EJ2007p246/&gt; and while serving there he had also served in a number of other roles, including on the executive of the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] and the [[World Jewish Congress]], as president of the [[Jewish Reconstructionist Federation]], and as chairman of the Board of Overseers of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College.&lt;ref name=EJ2007p246/&gt;

Dorshei Emet began accepting non-Jewish partners of members as a ''[[ger toshav|gerei toshav]]'' in 1985.&lt;ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p381/&gt; Its 1994 constitution, however, clarified that while a non-Jewish spouse of a member was considered a ''ger toshav'', and "may be welcomed into the synagogue", he or she was not "entitled to membership in the congregation".&lt;ref name=Brown2003p95&gt;Brown, Michael Gary; Elazar, Daniel Judah; Robinson, Ira.

The synagogue's currently policy regarding non-Jews and marriage is that while the children of mixed marriages may participate in lifecycle events, including [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]] ceremonies, the rabbi will only marry couples (whether opposite or same-sex) if both partners are Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Dorshei Emet website, {{cite web |url=http://dorsheiemet.com/about-2/brochures-and-guidelines/mixed-marriage-guidelines/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101000120/http://dorsheiemet.com/about-2/brochures-and-guidelines/mixed-marriage-guidelines/ |archivedate=2011-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the hiring of Rabbi Boris Dolin, the congregation is currently undergoing a community discussion about whether the rabbi can officiate at interfaith marriages. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/new-reconstructionist-rabbi-expects-debate-intermarriage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current building==
[[File:Reconstructionist-synagogue-montreal-exterior05.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The building lacks exterior decoration]]
By 1994, membership exceeded 410 households.&lt;ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p381/&gt; The congregation's growth made it impossible for all members to worship together; the original synagogue building had been sized for no more than 150 families. On the High Holy Days, when around 600 people attended (versus 150 on a typical [[Shabbat]]), services were split between the sanctuary and a school auditorium/gymnasium.&lt;ref name=CJNews2002&gt;[http://63.115.67.94/news/picofmonth-02-12.html "Reconstructionists building new synagogue"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20101230140542/http://63.115.67.94/news/picofmonth-02-12.html |date=2010-12-30 }}, ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'', February 21, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arnold2003&gt;Arnold, Janice.

In 1999, Aigen led the congregation in a campaign to construct a new building.&lt;ref name=CJNews2002/&gt; The property next to the existing building was purchased to accommodate a larger structure, and the existing sanctuary was torn down.&lt;ref name=Arnold2003/&gt; While the new synagogue was under construction, the congregation worshiped and held activities at the [[Jewish Community Center|YM-YWHA]].&lt;ref name=CJNews2002/&gt; The new building was open in time for the 2003 High Holy Days.&lt;ref name=Arnold2003/&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Vitraux -synagogue008 detail.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stained glass windows in the sanctuary]]
The architect was Dorshei Emet member Roseanne Moss of the firm Fournier Gersovitz Moss et associés architectes.&lt;ref name=CJNews2002/&gt; The new building's exterior was in the form of an unornamented rectangular solid. It was approximately twice the size of the old one, and had a social hall, library, larger kitchen, and more office space.&lt;ref name=JRFPOTM200212/&gt;

===Interior===
The stained glass windows from the old building were installed in the new sanctuary,&lt;ref name=JRFPOTM200212/&gt; which one entered through a copper door.&lt;ref name=Weddings&gt;[http://dorsheiemet.com/lifecycle-events/weddings/ Weddings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113150913/http://dorsheiemet.com/lifecycle-events/weddings/ |date=2011-01-13 }}, Dorshei Emet website. Retrieved January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional stained glass windows were created by Montreal's Studio du Verre in 2005.&lt;ref name=SDV&gt;[http://www.studioduverre.com/atelier/atelier_eng.php?page=cv_eng#2005 Curriculum vitae of selected projects completed by Studio du Verre for religious and public buildings 2005], Studio du Verre website. Retrieved January 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stained glass windows are heavily oriented towards abstract forms. Together with the [[Torah ark]], they form the figure of a geometrical seven-branched candelabrum or [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]. The other sanctuary walls are pale beige and extremely simple in comparison. During the day, the interior is illuminated by natural light entering through the translucent walls overhead. At night, the entire building glows from interior artificial lighting.

Sound damping and acoustics for the sanctuary was done by MJM Conseillers en Acoustique/MJM Acoustical Consultants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mjm.qc.ca/fr/architectural.html Past Project Experience Overview - Architectural],  MJM Acoustical Consultants website.

==Recent events==
In May 2009, Dorshei Emet commissioned female [[Sofer|scribe]] [[Jen Taylor Friedman]] to write a new Torah scroll, in honor of the congregation's 50th anniversary. Dorshei Emet is the first synagogue in Canada and the third in the world to receive a Torah handwritten by a woman; Friedman–then the only woman to have completed a Torah scroll–had previously written two others.&lt;ref name=CJNews2009&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16953&amp;Itemid=86 "Female scribe to pen Reconstructionist shul’s new Torah"], ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'', May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah was completed on May 16, 2010.&lt;ref name=CTVNews2010&gt;[http://montreal.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100516/mtl_torah_100516/ "Woman scribes history-making Torah"], ''[[CFCF-TV|CTV Montreal]]'' website, May 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Synagogue-reconstructionist-mtl.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Torah scroll raised in the sanctuary]]
The congregation hired its first [[hazzan|cantor]], Heather Batchelor, in August 2010. Because Dorshei Emet had no tradition of cantorial singing, her role was not typical. In addition to leading [[Rosh Hashanah]] and some regular services, she ran children's programs and occasionally read from the [[Torah]]. In addition, she started a Friday night service at Dorshei Emet, something it had not had before.&lt;ref name=Arnold2011&gt;Arnold, Janice.

Dorshei Emet was one of six Jewish institutions in Montreal that were attacked on the night of January 15, 2011. The other buildings, all in [[Côte Saint-Luc]], consisted of four synagogues and a school.&lt;ref name=Muise2011&gt;Muise, Monique.

Since its founding, men and women have had identical roles at Dorshei Emet. According to Aigen, the synagogue "is an egalitarian, participatory community of Jews where women have always been equal players and full participants in Jewish ritual life, including reading from the Torah".&lt;ref name=CJNews2010&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dorshei-emet.org/toratimeinu/includes/doc/canadian_jewish_news.pdf |title= "Dorshei Emet receives Torah written by female scribe" |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726002830/https://www.dorshei-emet.org/toratimeinu/includes/doc/canadian_jewish_news.pdf |archivedate= 2011-07-26 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(221&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, ''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'', May 6, 2010, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Rabbi Boris Dolin, a Reconstructionist rabbi from Oregon was chosen from among 27 candidates to be the next full-time rabbi.  Before joining the Dorshei Emet community, Rabbi Dolin was the rabbi of Beit Polska, the Union of Progressive Congregations in Poland, and Beit Warszawa, a progressive congregation in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dorsheiemet.com/our-rabbi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miguel Ángel Ruiz Macías''' (born August 27, 1952), better known by his pseudonym as '''Don Miguel Ruiz''', is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] author of [[Toltec]] spiritualist and [[neoshamanism|neoshamanistic]] texts.

His work is best-received among members of the [[New Thought]] movement that focuses on ancient teachings as  a means to achieve spiritual enlightenment. Ruiz is listed as one of the Watkins 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watkinsbooks.com/review/watkins-spiritual-100-list-for-2014 Watkins’ Spiritual 100 List for 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Some have associated Ruiz's work with [[Carlos Castaneda]], author of ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Biography==
Don Miguel Ruiz was born in rural Mexico, the youngest of 13 children. 
He attended medical school, and became a surgeon. For several years he practiced medicine with his brothers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A near-fatal car accident changed the direction of his life. He promptly returned to his mother to acquire greater moral understanding. He then apprenticed himself to a shaman, and eventually moved to the United States.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

While the Toltec culture left no written records, Ruiz employs the word Toltec to signify a long tradition of indigenous beliefs in Mexico, such as the idea that a [[Nagual]] (shaman) guides an individual to personal freedom. After exploring the human mind from an indigenous as well as scientific perspective, Ruiz combines traditional wisdom with modern insights.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

''The Four Agreements'', published in 1997; was a ''New York Times'' bestseller for more than a decade. Other books have followed: ''The Mastery of Love'', ''The Voice of Knowledge'', ''The Circle of Fire'', ''The Four Agreements Companion Book'' and ''The Fifth Agreement'', a collaboration with his son Don José. All of his books are international bestsellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelruiz.com/index.php?p=donMiguel |title=don Miguel Ruiz |work=Miguelruiz.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Toltec Art of Life and Death'' was published in late 2015.

Fluent in Spanish and English, he often lectures and leads retreats in the United States.&lt;ref name=YT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNe2oVMFqKg |title=Don Miguel Ruiz' heart Transplant Oct. 9th : An Exclusive Conversation on his New Heart |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-11-06 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, Ruiz suffered a near-fatal heart attack. The damage from the heart attack and subsequent coma left him with a heart functioning at only 16% of capacity and in constant pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miguelruiz.com/family/about-don-miguel |title=Miguel Ruiz official website, About don Miguel|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to have handed over an [[Eagle warrior|Eagle-Knight lineage]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofmaat.com/archive/may3/luis.htm Don José Luis interview by Julia Griffin]&lt;/ref&gt; to his son Don José Ruiz. On October 9, 2010, Ruiz underwent a [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]] at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was at a retreat at the Lotus Ranch in [[Wimberley, Texas]] when he was notified that a heart was available, and had chartered a plane to get back to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=YT/&gt;

== The Four Agreements==
His most famous book, ''The Four Agreements'', was published in 1997 and has sold around 7.2 million copies in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/four-agreements-don-miguel-ruiz/1100993587?ean=2940013987647 |title=The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom [NOOK Book] |publisher=barnes and noble | accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been translated into 40 languages.  The book advocates personal freedom from beliefs and agreements that we have made with ourselves and others that are creating limitation and unhappiness in our lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/56851-the-four-agreements-gets-a-boost-from-oprah-s-super-soul-sunday.html |title=Publishers Weekly Magazine |date=April 18, 2013 |accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was featured on the ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' television show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/tows/booksseen/tows_book_20000925_dmruiz.jhtml |title=The Oprah Winfrey's Official Website |publisher=oprah.com |accessdate=October 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922231752/http://www.oprah.com/tows/booksseen/tows_book_20000925_dmruiz.jhtml |archivedate=September 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Four Agreements are:

# Be impeccable with your word.
# Don't take anything personally.
# Don't make assumptions.
# Always do your best.

The U.S. Air Force created a "challenge coin" engraved with The Four Agreements, and Ruiz is referenced as a "National Heirloom of Mexico".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awaken.com/2014/01/don-miguel-ruiz-interview-with-women-for-one-on-toltec-wisdom-and-his-book-the-four-agreements |title=Interview with Women For One on Toltec Wisdom |accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|reason=I can find no reference for the "National Heirloom" accolade beyond Ruiz's own website and those like Awaken.com that quote it; does such an honor exist?|date=March 2016}}

He wrote a companion book to ''The Four Agreements'', titled ''The Four Agreements Companion Book'', published in 2000.

Don Miguel Ruiz's son, Don Jose Ruiz, has subsequently released a sequel with his father, ''The Fifth Agreement'', which adds a further agreement:{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''East Asian Yogācāra''' ({{cjkv|t=唯識宗|p=Wéishí-zōng|r=Yuishiki-shū|k=법상종}} "'Consciousness Only' school" or {{cjkv|t=法相宗|p=Fǎxiàng-zōng|r=Hossō-shū|k=유식종}}, "'Dharma Characteristics' school") refers to the traditions in [[East Asia]] which represent the [[Yogacara]] system of thought.

==Etymology==
The term ''Fǎxiàng'' itself was first applied to this tradition by the [[Huayan]] teacher [[Fazang]] ({{lang-zh|法藏}}), who used it to characterize Consciousness Only teachings as provisional, dealing with the phenomenal appearances of the [[dharma]]s. Chinese proponents preferred the title ''Wéishí'' ({{lang|zh|唯識}}), meaning "Consciousness Only" ([[Sanskrit]] ''Vijñaptimātra'').

This school may also be called ''Wéishí Yújiāxíng Pài'' ({{lang|zh|唯識瑜伽行派}} "Consciousness-Only Yogācāra School") or ''Yǒu Zōng'' ({{lang|zh|有宗}} "School of Existence"). [[Yin Shun]] also introduced a threefold classification for Buddhist teachings which designates this school as ''Xūwàng Wéishí Xì'' ({{lang|zh|虛妄唯識系}} "False Imagination Mere Consciousness System").{{sfn|Sheng-yen|2007|page=13}}

==Characteristics==
{{main|Yogācāra#Yogācāra Tenets|Eight Consciousnesses}}
Like the parent Yogācāra school, the Faxiang school teaches that our understanding of reality comes from our own mind, rather than actual empirical experience.  The mind distorts reality and projects it as reality itself.{{sfn|Tagawa|2014|p=1–10}} In keeping with Yogācāra tradition, the mind is divided into the [[Eight Consciousnesses]] and the Four Aspects of Cognition, which produce what we view as reality.

Faxiang Buddhism also maintained the [[Yogachara#Five_Categories_of_Beings|Five Natures Doctrine]] ({{zh | t=五性各別 | s=五性各別 | p=wǔxìng gèbié | w=wu-hsing ko-pieh }}) which brought it into doctrinal conflict with the [[Tiantai]] school in China.

==History in China==

[[File:Statue of Xuanzang. Wild Goose Pagoda, Xi'an.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Xuanzang]] at [[Giant Wild Goose Pagoda]] in [[Xi'an]], [[China]]]]

===Early history and teachers===
Translations of Indian Yogācāra texts were first introduced to China in the early fifth century.{{sfn|Paul|1984|page=6}} Among these was [[Guṇabhadra]]'s translation of the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' in four fascicles, which would also become important in the early history of [[Chan Buddhism]].

During the sixth century CE, the Indian monk and translator [[Paramartha|Paramārtha]] widely propagated Yogācāra teachings in China. His translations include the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]]'', the ''[[Madhyanta-vibhaga-karika|Madhyāntavibhāga-kārikā]]'', the ''[[Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā]]'', and the ''[[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]''. Paramārtha also taught widely on the principles of Consciousness Only, and developed a large following in southern China. Many monks and laypeople traveled long distances to hear his teachings, especially those on the ''Mahāyānasaṃgraha''.{{sfn|Paul|1984|page=32-33}}

===Xuanzang and Kuiji===

Although Yogācāra teachings had been propagated widely, most look to [[Xuanzang]] as the most important founder of East Asian Yogācāra. At the age of 33, Xuanzang made a dangerous journey to India in order to study Buddhism there and to procure Buddhist texts for translation into Chinese.{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=220}} This journey was later the subject of legend and eventually fictionalized as the classic Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', a major component of East Asian popular culture from [[Chinese opera]] to Japanese television (''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey Magic]]''). Xuanzang spent over ten years in India traveling and studying under various Buddhist masters.{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=220}} These masters included [[Śīlabhadra]], the abbot of the [[Nalanda|Nālandā Mahāvihāra]], who was then 106 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Wei Tat. ''Cheng Weishi Lun.'' 1973. p. li&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang was tutored in the Yogācāra teachings by Śīlabhadra for several years at Nālandā. Upon his return from India, Xuanzang brought with him a wagon-load of Buddhist texts, including important Yogācāra works such as the ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhūmi-śastra]]''.{{sfn|Tagawa|2014|p=xx-xxi}} In total, Xuanzang had procured 657 Buddhist texts from India.{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=220}} Upon his return to China, he was given government support and many assistants for the purpose of translating these texts into [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

As an important contribution to East Asian Yogācāra, Xuanzang composed the treatise ''[[Cheng Weishi Lun]]'', or "Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only."{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=221}} This work is framed around [[Vasubandhu]]'s ''Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā'', or "Thirty Verses on Consciousness Only." Xuanzang upheld [[Dharmapala of Nalanda]]'s commentary on this work as being the correct one, and provided his own explanations of these as well as other views in the ''Cheng Weishi Lun''.{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=221}} This work was composed at the behest of Xuanzang's disciple Kuiji, and became a central representation of East Asian Yogācāra.{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=221}} Xuanzang also promoted devotional meditative practices toward [[Maitreya]] [[Bodhisattva]]. Xuanzang's disciple [[Kuiji]] wrote a number of important commentaries on the Yogācāra texts and further developed the influence of this doctrine in China, and was recognized by later adherents as the first true patriarch of the school.{{sfn|Lopez|2013|p=283-4}}

===Later history and the modern era===
In time, Chinese Yogācāra was weakened due to competition with other Chinese Buddhist traditions such as [[Tiantai]], Huayan, Chan and [[Pure Land Buddhism]].  Nevertheless, it continued to exert an influence, and Chinese Buddhists relied on its translations, commentaries, and concepts heavily, absorbing Yogācāra teachings into the other traditions.{{sfn|Tagawa|2014|p=xx-xxi}}

Yogācāra teachings and concepts remained popular in Chinese Buddhism, including visions of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]] and teachings given from him in [[Tuṣita]], usually observed by advanced meditators. One such example is that of [[Hanshan Deqing]] during the [[Ming dynasty]]. In his autobiography, Hanshan describes the palace of Maitreya in Tuṣita, and hearing a lecture given by Maitreya to a large group of his disciples.
{{quote|In a moment I saw that tall, dignified monks were standing in line before the throne. Suddenly, a [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]], holding a sutra in his hands, came down from behind the throne and handed the sutra to me, saying, "Master is going to talk about this sutra. He asked me to give it to you." I received it with joy but when I opened it I saw that it was written in gold [[Sanskrit]] letters which I could not read. I put it inside my robe and asked, "Who is the Master?" The bhiksu replied, "Maitreya."{{sfn|Hanshan|1995}}}}
Hanshan recalls the teaching given as the following:
{{quote|[[Maitreya]] said, "Discrimination is [[vijñāna|consciousness]]. Nondiscrimination is [[prajñā (Buddhism)|wisdom]]. Clinging to consciousness will bring disgrace but clinging to wisdom will bring purity. Disgrace leads to [[saṃsāra|birth and death]] but purity leads to [[Nirvana]]." I listened to him as if I were in a dream within the dream. His voice, like the sound of tinkling crystal, floated on the air. I could hear him so clearly that even when I awoke his words kept on repeating in my mind. Now I realized the difference between consciousness and wisdom. Now I realized also that the place where I had been in my dream was Maitreya Buddha's Chamber in Tushita Heaven.{{sfn|Hanshan|1995}}}}
In the early part of the 20th century, the laymen [[Yang Wenhui]] and Ouyang Jian ([[:zh:歐陽漸|歐陽漸]]) (1871–1943) promoted Buddhist learning in China, and the general trend was for an increase in studies of Buddhist traditions such as Yogācāra, [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Sanlun]], and Huayan.{{sfn|Nan|1997|p=42}}{{sfn|Sheng-yen|2007|p=217}} In his 1929 book on the history of Chinese Buddhism, Jiang Weiqiao wrote:
{{quote|In modern times, there are few ''[[śramaṇa]]'' who research [Faxiang]. Various laypeople, however, take this field of study to be rigorous, systematic and clear, and close to science. For this reason, there are now many people researching it. Preeminent among those writing on the topic are those at Nanjing's Inner Studies Academy, headed by Ouyang Jian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammerstrom|first1=Erik J.|title=The Expression "The Myriad Dharmas are Only Consciousness" in Early 20th Century Chinese Buddhism|journal=Chung-Hwa Buddhist Journal 中華佛學學報|date=2010|volume=23|page=73|url=http://www.chinesebuddhiststudies.org/previous_issues/chbj2303Erik%2071-92.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ouyang Jian founded the Chinese Institute of Inner Studies ({{zh|t=支那內學院}}), which provided education in Yogācāra teachings and the [[Mahāyāna]] prajñā class of sūtras, given to both monastics and laypeople.{{sfn|Nan|1997|p=141}} Many modern Chinese Buddhist scholars are second-generation descendants of this school or have been influenced by it indirectly.{{sfn|Nan|1997|p=141}}

==History in Japan==
[[File:Kofukuji Eastern Golden Hall.jpg|thumb|The Eastern Golden Hall or Tokondo (東金堂) of [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara, Japan]]. Kofukuji Temple is the head temple of the Yogacara School in Japan]]
The Consciousness-Only teachings were transmitted to Japan as ''Hossō'', and they made considerable impact. One of the founders of the Hossō sect in Japan was Kuiji.&lt;ref&gt;Sho, Kyodai (2002). ''The Elementary-Level Textbook: Part 1: Gosho Study "Letter To The Brothers"''. SGI-USA Study Curriculum. Source: {{cite web |url=http://www.sgi-usa.org/buddhism/library/SokaGakkai/Study/Elementary/Text1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215001051/http://www.sgi-usa.org/buddhism/library/SokaGakkai/Study/Elementary/Text1.htm |archivedate=2007-12-15 |df= }} (accessed: January 8, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a relatively small Hossō sect exists in Japan to this day, the sect has survived long after it died out in Korea and China, though its influence has diminished as the center of Buddhist authority moved away from [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], and with the rise of the [[Ekayāna]] schools of Buddhism.{{sfn|Tagawa|2014|p=xx-xxi}}  During its height, scholars of the Hossō school frequently debated with other emerging schools.  Both the founder of [[Shingon Buddhism]], [[Kūkai]], and the founder of [[Tendai]], [[Saichō]], exchanged letters of debate with Hossō scholar [[Tokuitsu]], which became particularly heated in the case of Saichō.{{sfn|Abe|1999|p=208–19}} Nevertheless, the Hossō maintained amicable relations with the Shingon esoteric sect, and adopted its practices while providing further scholarship on Yogacara philosophy.

[[Hōnen]], founder of the [[Jōdo-shū]] Pure Land sect, likewise sought advice from Hossō scholars of his time as a novice monk, and later debated with them after establishing his sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JODO SHU English|url=http://www.jodo.org/about_hs/ho_life.html|website=www.jodo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hossō scholar, [[Jōkei (monk)|Jōkei]] was among Hōnen's toughest critics, and frequently sought to refute his teachings, while simultaneously striving, as Hōnen did, to make Buddhism accessible to a wider audience by reviving devotion to the [[bodhisattva]] [[Maitreya]] and teaching followers the benefits of rebirth in the Tuṣita rather than the [[pure land]] of [[Amitābha]].{{sfn|Leighton|2006|p=110–113}} Jōkei is also a leading figure in the efforts to revive monastic discipline at places like [[Tōshōdai-ji]], [[Kōfuku-ji]] and counted other notable monks among his disciples, including [[Eison]], who founded the [[Shingon Risshu]] sect.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=132–134}}

During the [[Meiji period]], as tourism became more common, the Hossō sect was the owner of several famous temples, notably [[Hōryū-ji]] and [[Kiyomizu-dera]]. However, as the Hossō sect had ceased Buddhist study centuries prior, the head priests were not content with giving part of their tourism income to the sect's organization. Following the end of World War II, the owners of these popular temples broke away from the Hossō sect, in 1950 and 1965, respectively. The sect still maintains [[Kōfuku-ji]] and [[Yakushi-ji]].

==History in Korea==
East Asian Yogācāra ({{cjkv|c=法相宗|rr=Beopsang}}) were transmitted to [[Korea]]. The most well-known Korean figure of Beopsang was [[Woncheuk]], who studied under the Chinese monk Xuanzang. Woncheuk is well known amongst scholars of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] for his commentary on the ''Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra''. While in China, Woncheuk took as a disciple a Korean-born monk named Dojeung ({{cjkv|c=道證}}), who travelled to [[Silla]] in 692 and propounded and propagated Woncheuk's exegetical tradition there where it flourished.

In Korea, Beopsang teachings did not endure long as a distinct school, but as with China, its teachings were frequently included in later schools of thought.{{sfn|Tagawa|2014|p=xx-xxi}}

'''Evan Thomas Davies''' (20 June 1847 &amp;ndash; 31 October 1927), also known by the pseudonym "Dyfrig", was a Welsh priest. After completing his education at the school in Ystrad Meurig he moved to study at [[St David's College, Lampeter]], graduating in 1869. He then spent the next year teaching, at [[Greenock]], before, in 1870 being ordained Deacon (by [[Alfred Ollivant (bishop)|Bishop Ollivant]] of Llandaff), and, in 1871, ordained Priest. For a while he was appointed Curate of [[Llanwynno]], and later of [[Bettws, Bridgend|Betws]], [[Glamorganshire]]. In 1875, he moved to take up an appointment at St David's Welsh Church, Brownlow Hill, [[Liverpool]], before, in 1882, becoming vicar of [[Aberdovey]], and then, in 1890, of [[Pwllheli]]. In 1906 he was appointed Vicar of Llanfihangel Ysgeifiog in [[Anglesey]], where he remained until he retired in 1913. He also served as Rural Dean of [[Llyn]] (1891 to 1900), and as Residentiary Canon of [[Bangor Cathedral]] (from 1906).

His written works include ''Cydymaith y Cymro'' (1885), ''Pregethau, Erthyglau ac Areithiau'' (1894), and ''Pregethau ac Anerchiadau'' (1899). He co-edited the Welsh language religious journal ''Llusern y llan'', which ran from 1881 to 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.library.wales/browse/2625509/|title=Llusern y llan|website=National Library of Wales|access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a subscriber to ''Gleanings from God's Acre'' (1903), edited by [[Myrddin Fardd]], and spoke at the Church of England Congress in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Church of England.

[[File: Agustinos Recoletos.jpg|thumb|upright|A group of friars; novices of the Order of [[Augustinian Recollects]] at the Monastery of [[Monteagudo, Navarre|Monteagudo]] in 2006.]]

A '''friar''' is a [[Brother (Christian)|brother]] member of one of the [[mendicant orders]] founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a [[superior general]], from the older [[monastic orders]]' allegiance to a single [[monastery]] formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Franciscans]], [[Augustinians]] and [[Carmelites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Stravinskas|editor1-first=Peter M.J.|title=Catholic Dictionary, Revised|date=April 1, 2002|publisher=Our Friday Visitor|location=Huntington, Ind.|isbn=978-0879733902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Friars are different from [[monk]]s in that they are called to live the evangelical counsels (vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience) in service to society, rather than through [[cloister]]ed [[asceticism]] and devotion. Whereas monks live in a self-sufficient community, friars work among laypeople and are supported by donations or other charitable support.&lt;ref&gt;[[s: Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Friar|Catholic encyclopedia entry for "friar"]]&lt;/ref&gt; A monk or nun makes their vows and commits to a particular community in a particular place. Friars commit to a community spread across a wider geographical area known as a [[Ecclesiastical province#Religious order organization|province]], and so they will typically move around, spending time in different houses of the community within their province.

==Etymology==
The English term ''Friar'' is derived from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]] word ''free'' ("brethren"), from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''frater'' ("brother"), which was widely used in the Latin [[New Testament]] to refer to members of the Christian community.  "Fray" is sometimes used in Spain and former Spanish colonies such as [[the Philippines]] or the [[American Southwest]] as a title, such as in [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]].

==Orders==
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], there are two classes of orders known as friars, or mendicant orders: the four "great orders" and the so-called "lesser orders".

===Major orders===
The four great orders were mentioned by the [[Second Council of Lyons]] (1274):

* The '''[[Carmelites]]''', founded {{Circa}} 1155.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03354a.htm The Carmelite Order]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as the "White Friars" because of the white cloak which covers their brown habit. They received papal approval from [[Honorius III]] in 1226 and later by [[Innocent IV]] in 1247. The Carmelites were founded as a purely contemplative order, but became mendicants in 1245. There are two types of Carmelites, those of the Ancient Observance (O.Carm.) and those of the [[Discalced Carmelites]] (O.C.D.), founded by St. Teresa of Avila in the 16th century. 
[[File:Friars.jpg|thumb|Conventual Franciscans in their variant grey habits]]
* The '''[[Franciscan]]s''', founded in 1209. They are also known as the "Friars Minor". The Franciscans were founded by [[St. Francis of Assisi]] and received oral papal approval by [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in 1209 and formal papal confirmation by [[Honorius III]] in 1223. Today the Friars Minor is composed of three branches:  the Order of Friars Minor (Brown Franciscans), [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin]] (Brown Friars with long pointed hoods) and the [[Conventual Franciscans|Order of Friars Minor Conventual]] wearing grey or black habits.
* The '''[[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]''', founded {{Circa}} 1216. They are also known as the "Friar Preachers", or the "Black Friars", from the black mantle ("cappa") worn over their white habit. The Dominicans were founded by [[St. Dominic]] and received papal approval from [[Honorius III]] in 1216 as the "Ordo Praedicatorum" under the [[Rule of St. Augustine]]. They became a [[mendicant]] order in 1221.
* The '''[[Augustinians]]''', founded in 1244 (the "Little Union") and enlarged in 1256 (the "Grand Union"). They are also known as the "Hermits of St. Augustine", or the "Austin Friars". Their rule is based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]. The Augustinians were assembled from various groups of hermits as a mendicant order by Pope Innocent IV in 1244 (Little Union). Additional groups were added by [[Pope Alexander IV|Alexander IV]] in 1256 (Grand Union).

===Lesser orders===
Some of the lesser orders are: 
* the [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarians]], established in 1198
* the [[Order of Mercy|Mercedarians]], established in 1218
* the [[Servites]], established in 1240
* the [[Minim (religious order)|Minims]], established in 1474
* the Third Order Regular of St. Francis, a branch of the [[Third Order of St. Francis]], part of the Franciscan Order established in 1447
* the [[Discalced Carmelites]], established in 1568 
* the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]], established in 1598 through the [[Chapter of Toledo]]
* the [[Trinitarian Order|Discalced Trinitarians]], established in 1599
* the [[Order of Penance]], established in 1781

==Uses by other Christian traditions==
Orders of friars (and sisters) exist in other Christian traditions, including the [[Order of Lutheran Franciscans]], the [[Order of Ecumenical Franciscans]] and the [http://orderoflessersistersandbrothers.weebly.com/ Order of Lesser Sisters and Brothers]. In the Anglican Communion there are also a number of mendicant groups such as the [[Anglican Order of Preachers|Anglican Friars Preachers]], [[Society of Saint Francis|The Society of St. Francis]] and [http://osffranciscans.com Order of St Francis]

==Other usage of the name==
Several [[high school]]s, as well as [[Providence College]], use friars as their [[school mascot]].  The [[Major League Baseball]] team [[San Diego Padres]] have the [[List of Major League Baseball mascots#Swinging Friar (San Diego Padres)|Swinging Friar]] ("padre" is also a Spanish word for the priestly title "father"; in 1769 [[San Diego]] was founded by Spanish [[Franciscan]] friars under Saint [[Junípero Serra]].).

The [[University of Michigan]]'s oldest ''[[a cappella]]'' group is a male octet known as The Friars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ummgc.org/friars/history.html|title=The University of Michigan Friars :: History|publisher=University of Michigan Friars|accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Pennsylvania]] has a senior [[honor society]] known as Friars.

In the order of the [[Knights of Malta]], the short form Fra (for Frate) is used when addressing members who have taken vows.

'''Louis Émile Clément Georges Bernanos''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɔʁʒ bɛʁnanɔs|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;"Bernanos", ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 20 February 1888 – 5 July 1948) was a French author, and a soldier in [[World War I]]. A [[Roman Catholic]] with [[monarchist]] leanings,&lt;ref&gt;Allen, W. Gore (1948). "George Bernanos: A Mystic in the World," ''The Irish Monthly'', Vol. 76, No. 903, pp. 414-416.&lt;/ref&gt; he was critical of [[bourgeois]] thought and was opposed to what he identified as [[defeatism]]. He believed this had led to [[Battle of France|France's defeat and eventual occupation by Germany]] in 1940 during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Michael R. (2007). ''Georges Bernanos: The Theological Source of his Art''. McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his novels have been translated into English and frequently published in both Great Britain and the United States.

==Life and career==
Bernanos was born in [[Paris]], into a family of craftsmen. He spent much of his childhood in the village of [[Fressin]], [[Pas de Calais]] region, which became a frequent setting for his novels. He served in the [[World War I|First World War]] as a soldier, where he fought in the battles of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] and [[Verdun]]. He was wounded several times.

After the war, he worked in insurance before writing ''Sous le soleil de Satan'' (1926, ''[[Under the Sun of Satan]]'').

Despite his [[Royalist]] leanings and his membership in [[Action Française]]'s [[Camelots du Roi|youth organization]]), until 1932, Bernanos despised [[Fascism]], which he described as "disgustingly monstrous" well before [[World War II]] broke out in Europe. He won the Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française for ''[[The Diary of a Country Priest]]'' (''Journal d'un curé de campagne''), published in 1936.

He initially supported [[Francisco Franco]] and the [[Falange]] at the outset of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, John (1990). "Bernanos, Drumont, and the Rise of French Fascism," ''The Review of Politics'', Vol. 52, No. 3, pp. 441-459.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after he observed the conflict in [[Majorca]] and saw 'a terrorized people,' he became disgusted with the ''[[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|nacionales]]'' and criticized them in the book ''[[Les grands cimetières sous la lune|Diary of My Times]]'' (1938). He wrote, "My illusions regarding the enterprise of General Franco did not last long - two or three weeks - but while they lasted I conscientiously endeavoured to overcome the disgust which some of his men and means caused me."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Bernanos. ''A Diary of My Times'', London: Boriswood, 1938, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his important fictional works were written between 1926 and 1937.

With political tensions rising in Europe, Bernanos emigrated to South America with his family in 1938, settling in [[Brazil]]. He remained until 1945 in [[Barbacena]], State of Minas Gerais, where he tried his hand at managing a farm. His three sons returned to France to fight after [[World War II]] broke out, while he fulminated at his country's 'spiritual exhaustion,' which he saw as the root of its collapse in 1940. From exile he mocked the 'ridiculous' [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and became a strong supporter of the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[Free French Forces]] led by the [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Charles De Gaulle]].

After France's Liberation, De Gaulle invited Bernanos to return to his homeland, offering him a post in the government. Bernanos did return but, disappointed  to perceive no signs of spiritual renewal, he declined to play an active role in French political life.&lt;ref name="Pegasos - A literature related site in Finland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/bernanos.htm |title=Georges Bernanos |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003153856/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/bernanos.htm |archivedate=3 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations of selected works==
* ''[[The Diary of a Country Priest]]'': this was the first novel by Bernanos to be adapted as a film, called ''[[Diary of a Country Priest]]'' (1951); it was directed by [[Robert Bresson]], and starred [[Claude Laydu]] in his debut role, called one of the greatest performances in the history of film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/07/claude-laydu-obituary | title=Claude Laydu obituary | work=The Guardian | author=Robert Bergan | date=2011-08-07 | accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Mouchette (novel)|Mouchette]]'' was adapted into a [[Mouchette|film of the same name]] by [[Robert Bresson]], released in 1967.
* ''[[Under the Sun of Satan]]'': his novel was adapted as a [[Under the Sun of Satan (film)|film of the same name]], produced in 1987 in France. The film won the [[Palme d'Or]] prize at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]].
* ''[[The Fearless Heart (play)|Dialogues des Carmélites]]'': in 1947, Bernanos had been hired to write the dialogue for a film screenplay, through Raymond-Léopold Bruckberger and the scenario writer Philippe Agostini, based on the [[novella]] ''Die Letzte am Schafott'' by German novelist [[Gertrud von Le Fort]], about the 1794 execution of the [[Martyrs of Compiègne|Carmelite Nuns of Compiègne]]. The screenplay was judged unsatisfactory at the time. Following Bernanos' death his literary executor, Albert Béguin, discovered the manuscript. To assist Bernanos' heirs, Béguin sought to have the work published, requesting permission from Baroness von Le Fort for publication. In January 1949 she agreed, gifting her portion of the royalties over to Bernanos' widow and children. However, the Baroness requested that Bernanos' play be given a different title from her novella.&lt;ref name="Gendre1995"&gt;Gendre, Claude, 'The Literary Destiny of the Sixteen Carmelite Martyrs of Compiègne and the Role of Emmet Lavery'. ''Renascence'', '''48.1''', pp 37-60 (Fall 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Béguin chose ''Dialogues des Carmélites'', and the work was published in 1949.  It was translated into German, published there in 1951 as ''Die begnadete Angst'' (''The Blessed Fear'') and first staged in Zurich and Munich that year.&lt;ref name="Gendre1999"&gt;Gendre, Claude, 'Dialogues des Carmélites: the historical background, literary destiny and genesis of the opera', from ''Francis Poulenc: Music, Art and Literature'' (Sidney Buckland and Myriam Chimènes, editors).  Ashgate (Aldershot, UK), {{ISBN|1859284078}}, p 287 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The French stage première took place in May 1952 at the [[Théâtre Hébertot]]. The composer [[Francis Poulenc]] adapted Bernanos' work into an [[Dialogues of the Carmelites|opera of the same name]],which was first performed at [[La Scala|La Scala Milan]] in 1957. A [[Dialogue with the Carmelites|film based on Bernanos' play]] and starring [[Jeanne Moreau]] was released in 1960.

[[File:Krishna raising Mount Govardhan, Bhagavata Purana,ca 1640.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Image of Krishna raising Mount Govardhan from manuscript,ca 1640 of the Bhagavata Purana]] 

A '''Govardhana Shila ''' is rock from the [[Govardhan Hill]] in [[Vrindavana]]. Govardhan Hill holds a unique position in Hindu Mythology related to [[Krishna]], the land called Vrij where He was born. Known as [[Govardhan]] or Giriraj and being the sacred center of Braj, it is identified as a natural form of [[Krishna]]. Indian art overwhelmingly prefers the iconic image, but some [[aniconism]] does occur in folk worship, early [[Buddhism]], [[Shiva]]'s [[Banalinga]], and [[Vishnu]]'s Saligrama [[Sila (murthi)]]). They have solar significance, and their use in worship predates the [[Hindu]] period in [[India]]. The stone is usually brown in color.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Haberman, ''River of Love in an Age of Pollution: The Yamuna River of Northern India'', Page 264 {{ISBN|0-520-24789-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Govardhan, a very famous place of Hindu pilgrimage, is located 26&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] (154&amp;nbsp;km from [[New Delhi]]) on the state highway to Deeg. Govardhan is located on a narrow sandstone hill known as Giriraj which is about 8&amp;nbsp;km in length.
When [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] did parikrama (circumambulation) of  Govardhana Hill while visiting [[Vrindavana]] in 1515 AD,  he did not walk on the hill because he considered Govardhana as non-different from Lord Krishna. Therefore, traditionally [[Vaishnavas]] don’t step on Govardhan hill.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.salagram.net/parishad77-g.htm Govardhan Puja&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nathdwara srinathji.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Nathdwara]] Srinathji in the Govardhan leela pose, at the autumn Annakuta Festival.late 18th century.]]
It is believed that thousands of  years ago, Lord Krishna picked up this hill and held it above His head, with his little finger, for 7 days to protect his kinsfolk from the wrath of rain God [[Indra]]. This gave Krishna the epithet Govardhandhari. Since Lord Krishna declared that He and Govardhan Hill were non-different, the followers of the [[Vallabha_Acharya]] tradition, devotees of Lord Krishna, worship Govardhan Sila. They worship Govardhana-silas along with the Saligrama sila, both considered as aniconic symbols of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as they worship the Deity of Krishna in the temple. Lifting of Govardhan Hill,Krishna's Lifting Govardhan Hill,Giriraj Govardhan Puja,Krishna Lifting Govardhan Hill,Sri Giriraj Govardhan Puja. 
English translation of the relevant texts on Govardahan Hill from Srimad Bhagvatam &lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/28/en1 Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 1 Chapter 3 Verse 28&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123024056/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/28/en1 |date=2013-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; state:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Krishna assumed a great transcendental form and declared to the inhabitants of [[Vrindavana]] that He was Himself [[Govardhana Hill]] in order to convince the devotees that [[Govardhana Hill]] and [[Krishna]] are identical. The identity of Krishna and Govardhana Hill is still honored, and great devotees take rocks from [[Govardhan Hill]], and worship them exactly as they worship the Deity of Krishna in the temple.” (Srimad Bhagavatam 10.24.35 purport)''
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Of all the devotees, this Govardhana Hill is the best! O my friends, this hill supplies Krishna and Balarama, along with Their calves, cows and cowherd friends, will all kinds of necessities—water for drinking, very soft grass, caves, fruits, flowers and vegetables. In this way the hill offers respects to the Lord. Being touched by the lotus feet of Krishna and Balarama, Govardhana Hill appears very jubilant.” (Srimad Bhagavatam 10.21.18).''

Presently at its highest point, the [[Govardhan hill]] is just 25m (80&amp;nbsp;feet) high and is a wide hill. It is a narrow sandstone hill known as Giriraj which is about 8&amp;nbsp;km in length.

After Krishna protected the inhabitants of Vraj (Vridavan) from the wrath of [[Indra]], he counseled them to worship Govardhana hill and they did by way of a Puja and a [[Parikrama]] (circumambulation) around the hill.Thus, a festival in commemoration of the lifting of Mount Govardhan, near Mathura, by Krishna came into vogue as Govardhan Puja when Mount Govardhan is worshipped day after [[Deepawali]] (festival of lights) is celebrated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Pious people keep awake the whole night and cook fifty-six (or 108) different types of food for the bhog (the offering of food) to Krishna. This ceremony is called ankut or annakuta which means a mountain of food. Various types of food – cereals, pulses, fruit, vegetables, chutneys, pickles, and salads – are offered to the Deity and then distributed as prasada to devotees. Thousands of devotees bring offerings for Giriraj. Followed by this [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]], the devotees perform the Govardhana parikrama.

A Parikrama [circumambulation- going 38&amp;nbsp;km {24-miles} around the hill] is a sacred ritual called Govardana parikrama performed by many believers. There is no time limit for performing Govardhana parikrama, but for those who perform the dandavata (full prostration) Parikrama, an arduous form which may take weeks and sometimes even months to complete. It is performed by standing in one spot, offering obeisances like a stick (danda) by lying flat on the ground and then continuing, contiguously, till the entire route is covered. It is also said that some sadhus (Hindu holy men) perform 108 dandavata Parikrama by offering 108 obeisances in one spot before moving to the next. This can take a number of months to complete. 

This ritual of circumambulation is considered to be even better if is it done with milk. A clay pot filled with milk, with a hole at the bottom, is carried by the devotees in one hand and a pot filled with dhoop (incense smoke) in another. An escort continuously fills up the pot with milk till the circumambulation is completed.  Circumambulation is also done with candy being handed out to children, en route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heenainindia.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.html Know Thyself: July 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parikrama of Govardhana starts at the Manasi-Ganga Kund (lake) and then after having darsan of Lord Harideva, from Radha-kunda village, where the Vrindavan road meets the parikrama path. After parikrama of 38&amp;nbsp;km, covering important tanks, shilas and shrines such as Radha Kunda, Syama Kunda, Dan Ghati, Mukharavinda, Rinamochana Kunda, Kusuma Sarovara and Punchari, it ends at Mansi Ganga Kund only.

== Shape of Govardhana hill ==
In Govinda-lilamrita, Krishnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami states that Govardhana Hill is shaped like a peacock and that Radha Kunda and Syama Kunda are its eyes. Dan Ghati and Manasi Ganga are its long neck. Mukharavinda is the mouth, Kusuma Sarovara its face, and Punchari is its back and tail feathers. A peacock often curves its neck and puts his head under its stomach. Govardhana Hill is thus shaped in this pose of a peacock.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girirajji.com/glories-of-goverdhan-hill.html Sri Govardhana Hill, Glories of Govardhana Hill, Glories of Giriraja Govardhana, Radha Kunda, Glories of Radha Kunda, Sri Giriraja Govardhana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mala (garland) of Gunja seeds and Krishna ==
Followers of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]  worship Krishna in a small stone form (Govardhana sila) representing Mount Govardhan, with a gunja mala (garland) around it representing Radharani. It is said that the child Krishna was inseparable from his favourite gunja maala which was said to represent Radha. This mythology has made the Gunjā (Abrus precatorius) seeds  - the bright red seed of a fig tree - also a favourite for native jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flowersofindia.net/mythology.html Flowers in Ancient Literature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The only other God who shows a twig with a gunja seed on his upturned right hand palm to indicate the divya ksehtra’s superiority over Kashi (Varanasi) is Lord [[Narasimha]], in the Gunja Narasimha Swamy temple locaterd at [[T.Narsipur]] in [[Mysore]] district in [[Karnataka]] on the bank of the [[Kaveri]] - [[Kapila]] - Spatika Sarovar sangam (confluence).

'''Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari''' (1895–1977) was a Punjabi novelist and short story writer with more than fifty books to his credit. He is also considered the father of modern Punjabi prose and received [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]], [[New Delhi]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahitya-akademi.gov.in/old_version/fello.htm#awa02&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed with an engineering degree from the ''Thomson Engineering College'', now the [[IIT Roorkee]], he also studied [[Civil Engineering]] at [[University of Michigan]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=55&amp;id=4897&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=20&amp;secid=33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preet Nagar==
Gurbakhsh Singh established ''Preet Nagar'' township that was equidistant between Amritsar and Lahore. Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari, through his personal charisma, brought people like Balraj Sahni, Nanak Singh, celebrity artist [Sobha Singh (painter)] and Diwan Singh, father of Lt Gen [[Jagjit Singh Arora]] of [[Bangladesh]] war fame, apart from associating Faiz Ahmad Faiz, [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], Upendra Nath Ashq and Kartar Singh Duggal,playwright Balwant Gargi, poets Mohan Singh and Amrita Pritam: the best talent of the time&amp;nbsp;— with Preet Nagar. The great martyr Diwan Singh Kalepani,the great intellectual Principal Teja Singh,principal Jodh Singh were closely associated.
Gandhiji was to visit here and Nehru did. Tagore was aware of it. Mulkh  Raj Anand, a renowned writer in English, said that Tagore's legacy was carried forward by four in India, and counts Gurbakhsh Singh as one of these.

He brought great solace and a sense of adventure to the just about upcoming middle class and would-be professionals, through his writings in the journal he founded in 1933,'This journal, PREETLARI or LINKED(THROUGH)LOVE, preceded the setting up of the township by 5 years.
The township was in line with the international trend for Intended Communities, it  had among other efforts, a community kitchen, an activity based school called ActivitySchool, a park, physical, artistic, political, economic activity, a team of peace corps, gatherings of like minds, theatrical activity, picnics, etc.

Although Preet Nagar suffered a lot at the time of India's partition (it is situated merely a few kilometers from the border that divides India and Pakistan)and most of its inhabitants migrated to Delhi and other cities during those turbulent days, Gurbaksh Singh and his family returned to live there with a few other families.

In the mid 90's, two decades after Gurbaksh Singh's death, a Trust named 'Gurbaksh Singh Nanak Singh Foundation' was set up to restart cultural activities in Preet Nagar. A building was erected to host a library, an indoor conference hall and an amphitheater. Currently, under the chairperson-ship of the eldest daughter of the writer, Uma Gurbaksh Singh,  plays are staged every month in the amphitheater to entertain and educate the local people. This tradition has been going on for the last ten years and Punjabi plays from all over the state as well as neighboring Pakistan have been performed there.

==Preet Lari==
To share his vision and philosophy of life with others, he started the monthly journal ''Preet Lari'' in 1933. The journal became so popular that Gurbaksh Singh came to be known as Gurbaksh Singh Preet Lari, although he himself never used this suffix as an author. During Gurbaksh Singh's lifetime, from the 1950s his son Navtej Singh, a well-known writer himself, started co-editing the journal with his father and remained its editor until his own death in 1981. After the death of Navtej Singh, his son Sumit Singh aka Shammi and Shammi's wife Poonam continued to run the magazine. Shammi was killed by Sikh fundamentalists as he wrote against extremism. The [http://preetlari.wordpress.com/ magazine] is now run by Poonam Singh who is the editor and Rati Kant Singh, Shammi's younger brother and husband to Poonam Singh. Gurbaksh Singh's son Hirday Paul Singh edited "Bal Sandesh" the special children's magazine in Punjabi, also started by Sardar Gurbaksh Singh.&lt;ref&gt;http://preetlari.wordpress.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal Preet Lari carried translations,interpretations of western thought,trends as well as sought to reinvent indehenous institutions in the same,i.e., modern light.

The family members of Gurbakhsh  Singh sported his efforts and the next generation carried on the work during his lifetime and after.
The magazine, once printed in four languages, and influencing the  generations now in their late seventies in Pakistan, too, and going to many countries such as Thailand. That is,  wherever Punjabis were settled, brought about a cultural revolution of sorts.
It continues to run today and can be seen at preetlari.wordpress,com? edited by Poonam Singh, his granddaughter in law and published by his grandson Rati Kant Singh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050217/aplus.htm#1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Hinduism|Hindu]] views of homosexuality''' and, in general, [[LGBT]] (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) issues, are diverse and different Hindu groups have distinct views.
Although some Hindu dharmic texts contain injunctions against homosexuality, a number of Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual experience as natural and joyful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bonvillain| first = Nancy| authorlink = Nancy Bonvillain| title = Women and men: cultural constructs of gender| publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]| year = 2001| page = 281| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xiG1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=hinduism+homosexuality+expressions+of+human+desire| isbn = 978-0-13-025973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several Hindu temples which have carvings that depict both men and women engaging in homosexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Keene| first = Michael| title = Religion in Life and Society| publisher = Folens Limited| year = 2002| page = 58| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=I4AVbUIIygQC&amp;pg=PA58| isbn = 978-1-84303-295-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex relations and [[gender variance]] have been represented within Hinduism from [[Vedic civilization|Vedic times]] through to the present day, in rituals, law books, religious or so-called [[Mythology|mythical narratives]], commentaries, paintings, and sculpture.

==Difference between Western and Hindu views of male sexuality==
The general Hindu civil and criminal code [[Manu Smriti]] before the colonial era prescribes strict but corrective punishments and not penalties for LGBs.

One more shloka from Manu Smriti that condemns homosexuality in men is given below:

(Manu Smriti, Chapter 11, Verse 67)

The Atri Smriti also mentions homosexuality as a sin and prescribes an expiation measure for the same:

−	
By discharging semen into inhuman females except a cow, into a woman in [her] menses, into others that have no female organs (i.e., a man or a eunuch), or into water one should perform the penance of Santapanam.

[[LGBTQIA+]] activists who include the homosexuals in the Hindu Right Wing [[R.S.S]] however seek to modernise this stance.

Unlike the West, the Hindu society does not have the concept of 'sexual orientation' that classifies males on the basis of who they desire. However, there is a strong, ancient concept of [[third gender]], which is for individuals who have strong elements of both male and female in them.  According to Sanskrit texts such as the Narada-smriti, Sushruta Samhita, etc., this third sex or gender includes people who have conventionally been called homosexuals, bisexuals, transgender people and intersex people (LGBTI). Third genders are described in ancient Vedic texts as males who have a female nature—referring to homosexual men or feminine-gendered males. The gender/sexual role of third genders has for long been predominantly associated with receiving penetration from men, just like the gender/ sexual role of manhood has been to penetrate men, women or third genders. However, the Kama Sutra clearly describes third-gender men assuming both masculine and feminine identities as well as both receptive and dominant sexual roles.

Although Hindu society does not formally acknowledge sexuality between men, it formally acknowledges and gives space to sexuality between men and third genders as a variation of male-female sex (i.e., a part of heterosexuality, rather than homosexuality, if analysed in Western terms). In fact, Hijras, Alis, Kotis, etc.— the various forms of third gender that exist in India today— are all  characterized by the gender role of having receptive anal and oral sex with men. Sexuality between men (as distinct from third genders) has nevertheless thrived, mostly unspoken, informally, within men's spaces, without being seen as 'different' in the way it is seen in the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953600001672 The social construction of male 'homosexuality' in India], by S Asthana and R. Oostvogels, published in 'Social Science &amp; Medicine', vol 52(2001), Quote: "Indian culture is highly homosocial and displays of affection, body contact and the sharing of beds between men is socially acceptable (Kahn, 1994) This creates opportunities for sexual contact, though sexual behavior in this context is rarely seen as real sex, but as play. Much of this same-sex sexual activity begins in adolescence between school friends and within family environments and is non-penetrative... Young men who cultivate such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure."&lt;/ref&gt; As in some other non-Western cultures, it is considered more or less a universal aspect of manhood, even if not socially desirable. It is the effeminate male sexuality for men (or for women) which is seen as 'different,' and differently categorised. Men often refer to their sexual play with each other as '''musti''.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfi.net/downloads/knowledge_centre/NFI%20publications/articles%20and%20essays/2001_MSM_HIV%20In%20India.pdf Males Who Have Sex with Males (MSM) and HIV/AIDS in India: The Hidden Epidemic], Gregory Pappas, Omar Khan, Jason Taylor Wright, Shivananda Khan, Lalitha Kumaramangalam, and Joseph O’Neill; Quote: "Manliness and Musti
Another important aspect of MSM in the subcontinent is the meaning of manliness. Many men consider it a display of sexual prowess for an older, sexually dominant man to have sex with a young and/or submissive man or boy. Jokes and folk knowledge regarding sex incorporate this theme and create some flexibility for socially acceptable MSM behavior in an otherwise  repressive environment.23 The notion of musti also provides an open space for sexual behavior. Musti is translated as “fun or mischief” in Hindi and Urdu; the word is understood by most to  describe sexual release through ejaculation and non-penetrative sex. In that sense, oral sex or mutual masturbation is not considered to be “sex”; this affords wider license to be given to musti between men. A phrase commonly heard is that a particular liaison was “just musti,” connoting that it is not to be taken seriously, and therefore below the level at which it would draw moral opprobrium. Musti is also tacitly acknowledged as a common part of boyhood experience: it is considered of little consequence, and it is believed that boys grow out of this behavior.24"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu concept of homosexuality seeks to break this distinction between third gender and men, and to isolate sexuality between men along with the third genders, with all its negative consequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953600001672 The social construction of male 'homosexuality' in India], by S Asthana and R. Oostvogels, published in 'Social Science &amp; Medicine', vol 52(2001), Quote: "As with Indian men and women, a social distance exists between masculine- and feminine-identified MSM and it is difficult to envisage a fundamental change in these arrangements - e.g. the development of more reciprocal social and sexual relations. It is therefore highly unlikely that a collective 'gay' consciousness and solidarity can be achieved in the Indian context. Indeed, care should be taken in assuming that an incipient 'gay movement' already exists in the country (Drucker, 1996)."&lt;/ref&gt; As such, men in India have long resisted the concept of 'gay,' and have sex with men without identifying as a 'homosexual.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp078009?query=current&amp;rss=1&amp; HIV in India — A Complex Epidemic], Robert Steinbrook, M.D., N Engl J Med 2007; 356:1089-1093 March 15, 2007, Quote: "For many Indians, sex between men is not sex but “mischief,” and many men who have sex with men do not identify themselves as homosexual."&lt;/ref&gt; Gay activists have sought to introduce a locally acceptable term for 'homosexual' for two decades, without success. Finally, the term MSM was taken, because it was technically difficult for men to avoid, if they had sex with men. However, it too was rejected by Indian men, as it was seen as just another term for 'gay.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953600001672 The social construction of male 'homosexuality' in India], by S Asthana and R. Oostvogels, published in 'Social Science &amp; Medicine', vol 52(2001), Quote: "In practice, however, MSM is often use interchangeably with that of 'gay men'."&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few years, however, the concept of 'homosexuality' has finally taken root.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

A significant fallout of this has been that sexual desire between men, which was near universal earlier, is now become more and more isolated from the mainstream, as men are distancing themselves from it because of the stigma of effeminacy or third gender attached to the notion of 'gay.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953600001672 The social construction of male 'homosexuality' in India], by S Asthana and R. Oostvogels, published in 'Social Science &amp; Medicine', vol 52(2001), Quote: "Thus, whilst there was more social acceptance of alternative sexual natures in the 1970s and more space emerged for sexual minorities to live their lives without repression, gay men also became more sexually isolated. Due to the tendency to associate male homosexuality with effeminacy, men who wished to preserve their masculine heterosexual self-image withdrew from homosexual circuits. Thus there was a decline in the proportion of men who had sex with men who were also involved in heterosexual relationships."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Hindu society==

Sexuality is rarely discussed openly in contemporary Hindu society, especially in modern [[India]] where homosexuality was illegal until a brief period beginning in 2009, due to colonial [[British India|British laws]].&lt;ref&gt;From section 377 of the [[Indian Penal Code]]: ''Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.''&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2009 The [[Delhi]] High Court in a historic judgement decriminalised homosexuality in [[India]]; where the court noted that the existing laws violated fundamental rights to personal liberty (Article 21 of the [[Indian Constitution]]) and equality (Article 14) and prohibition of discrimination (Article 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms |work=The Times Of India |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427121918/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms |archivedate=April 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Supreme Court of India re-affirmed the penal code provision and overturned the Delhi High Court decision, effectively re-instating the legal ban on homosexuality. Now penalties include life imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-12/india/45120907_1_delhi-hc-section-377-ipc-supreme-court | work=The Times Of India | title=Supreme Court makes homosexuality a crime again - The Times of India | date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/no-separate-proposal-to-repeal-or-amend-section-377-govt/ | work=The Hindustan Times | title=No separate proposal to repeal or amend section 377 : govt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/no-separate-proposal-to-repeal-or-amend-section-377-government/articleshow/45618509.cms | work=Economic Times | title=No separate proposal to repeal or amend section 377 : govt | date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore LGBT people are often subected to torture, executions and fines by non-government affiliated vigilante groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/07/18/india-prosecute-rampant-honor-killings|title=India: Prosecute Rampant ‘Honor’ Killings|date=18 July 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/sAYrieZdZKEybKzhP8FDbP/Being-LGBT-in-India-Some-home-truths.html|title=Being LGBT in India: Some home truths|first=Rashmi|last=Patel|date=27 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/07/29/lesbian-newlyweds-flee-honor-killing-threats-in-india/|title=Lesbian newlyweds flee honor killing threats in India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though [[Hinduism]] is never known to exclusively ban homosexuality, certain Hindu nationalist factions are opposed to legalising [[homosexuality]] while certain others choose to remain silent. However, in the last twenty years homosexuality has become increasingly visible in the print and audio-visual media, with many out LGBT people, an active LGBT movement, and a large Indian LGBT presence on the Internet. From the 1990s onward, modern gay and lesbian Hindu organizations have surfaced in India's major cities and in 2004, plausible calls were made for the first time to repeal India's laws against homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/world/asia/19iht-letter.html Attitudes, and the law, keep India's gays quiet] New York Times – January 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deepa Mehta]]'s 1996 film ''[[Fire (1996 film)|Fire]]'', which depicts a romantic relationship between two Hindu women, was informally banned for "religious insensitivity"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116308/trivia Entry on the movie "Fire"], from IMDB ([[Internet Movie Database]]).

In her book, ''Love's Rite'',&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth. Love's Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West. New Delhi, India: Penguin Books India, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Vanita examines the phenomena of same-sex weddings, many by Hindu rites, which have been reported by the Indian press over the last thirty years and with increasing frequency. In the same period, same-sex joint suicides have also been reported. Most of these marriages and suicides are by lower middle-class female couples from small towns and rural areas across the country; these women have no contact with any LGBT movements. Both cross-sex and same-sex couples, when faced with family opposition, tend to resort to either elopement and marriage or to joint suicide in the hope of reunion in the next life. Vanita examines how Hindu doctrines such as rebirth and the genderlessness of the soul are often interpreted to legitimize socially disapproved relationships, including same-sex ones. In a 2004 survey, most — though not all — [[swami]]s said they opposed the concept of a Hindu-sanctified gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faithandthecity.org/issues/social/articles/Discussions_on_Dharma%20.shtml Discussions on Dharma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045115/http://www.faithandthecity.org/issues/social/articles/Discussions_on_Dharma%20.shtml |date=2011-07-26 }}, by Rajiv Malik, in Hinduism Today.

&lt;br/&gt; Later, Vanita condenses the ideas in her book into an article, "Same-sex Weddings, Hindu Traditions and Modern India".&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth. "Same-sex Weddings, Hindu Traditions And Modern India." Feminist Review 91, no. 1 (2009): 47-60. jstor.org (accessed February 9, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Here, she summarizes specific cases in which women specifically committed joint-suicides, were married and separated, or successfully married. She points out three different "forces that have helped female couples".&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth. "Same-sex Weddings, Hindu Traditions And Modern India." Feminist Review 91, no. 1 (2009): 53. jstor.org (accessed February 9, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; These are: the law courts, the media, and some Hindu authorities (such as the swamis mentioned earlier in this article) from her book.  When female couples can stay together under the social pressures and get to the courts, the courts generally hold up their decisions, holding to the fact that the women are consenting adults. While this does not necessarily stop the harassment, it does lend the couple further legitimacy under the laws. In addition, the more successful same-sex marriages of women are those in which the women are financially independent. If they have social support from their families and community—for the most part—then they may be able to live in peace together. The media may also play an important role in same-sex marriages. In drawing attention to their marriages, women who do not necessarily know about LGBT rights groups may be contacted and supported by those groups after media attention. However, the flip side of this is that the anti-LGBT groups also may reach out against their marriage.

Some Indian and Hindu intellectuals now publicly support LGBT civil rights. Some [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Hindu reform movements]], especially those in the West, also support social acceptance of gays, lesbians and other gender minorities. Psychoanalyst [[Sudhir Kakar]] writes that Hindus are more accepting of "deviance or eccentricity" than are adherents of Western religions, who typically treat sexual variance as "anti-social or psychopathological, requiring 'correction' or 'cure'".&lt;ref&gt;Kakar, Sundir (1981). ''The Inner World: A Psycho-analytic Study of Childhood and Society in India.'' Delhi: Oxford University Press. p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hindus, he argues, believe instead that each individual must fulfil their personal destiny (''svadharma'') as they travel the path towards [[moksha]] (transcendence).

Commenting on the legalisation of homosexuality in India; Anil Bhanot, general secretary of The [[United Kingdom]] Hindu Council said: ''The point here is that the homosexual nature is part of the natural law of God; it should be accepted for what it is, no more and no less. Hindus are generally conservative but it seems to me that in ancient India, they even celebrated sex as an enjoyable part of procreation, where priests were invited for ceremonies in their home to mark the beginning of the process''&lt;ref name="news.rediff.com"/&gt;

==The third gender==
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}

Hindu philosophy has the concept of a third sex or third gender (''tritiya-prakriti'' – literally, "third nature"). This category includes a wide range of people with mixed male and female natures such as effeminate males, masculine females, transgender people, transsexual people, the intersexed, androgynes, and so on. Many MTF third-genders are not attracted only or at all to men, but are attracted either exclusively to women or are bisexual. Many FTM transgender people are attracted to men.&lt;ref&gt;Pattanaik, Devdutt. ''The Man Who Was a Woman and Other Queer Tales from Hindu Lore'' (p. 10). Binghamton, NY: Harrington Park Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such persons are not considered fully male or female in traditional Hinduism, being a combination of both. They are mentioned as third sex by nature (birth)&lt;ref&gt;Buhler, G., trans. ''The Laws of Manu'' (3.49). Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and are not expected to behave like ordinary men and women. They often keep their own societies or town quarters, perform specific occupations (such as masseurs, hairdressers, flower-sellers, domestic servants, etc.) and are generally attributed a semi-divine status. Their participation in religious ceremonies, especially as crossdressing dancers and devotees of certain temple gods/goddesses, is considered auspicious in traditional Hinduism. Some Hindus believe that third-sex people have special powers allowing them to bless or curse others. &lt;!-- In Hinduism, the universal creation is honored as unlimitedly diverse and the recognition of a third sex is simply one more aspect of this understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Amara Das.

In 2008, the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] recognised the "Third Gender"; with its civil supplies department giving in the ration card a provision for a new sex column as 'T', distinct from the usual 'M' and 'F' for males and females respectively. This was the first time that authorities anywhere in India have officially recognised the third gender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-03-16/india/27778521_1_ration-cards-third-gender-tamil-nadu Third sex gets official status in Tamil Nadu] Pushpa Narayan, TNN; Times of India, March 16, 2008, 12.59am IST&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindu religious narratives==
{{Main|LGBT themes in Hindu mythology}}
[[Image:Ardhanari.jpg|right|180px|thumb|The Hindu god [[Shiva]] is often represented as [[Ardhanarisvara]], a unified entity of him with his consort [[Parvati]]. This sculpture is from the [[Elephanta Caves]] near [[Mumbai]].]]
In the Hindu narrative tradition, stories of gods and mortals changing gender occur.&lt;ref&gt;[Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai, Same-Sex Love in India, 2000, first section, sections 1 and 2, "Ancient Indian Materials" and "Medieval Materials in the Sanskritic Tradition" ; [[Wendy Doniger|O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger]] (1980).

Homosexual and transgender Hindus commonly identify with and worship the various Hindu deities connected with gender diversity such as [[Ardhanarisvara]] (the androgynous form of [[Shiva]] and his consort [[Parvati]]), [[Iravan|Aravan]] (a hero whom the god [[Krishna]] married after becoming a woman), [[Harihara]] (an incarnation of Shiva and Vishnu combined), [[Bahuchara Mata]] (a goddess connected with transsexuality and eunuchism), [[Gadadhara]] (an incarnation of Radha in male form), [[Chandi]]-[[Chamunda]] (twin warrior goddesses), [[Bhagavati]]-devi (a Hindu goddess associated with crossdressing), Gangamma (a goddess connected with crossdressing and disguises) and the goddess [[Yellamma]].&lt;ref name="Galva3rdsexdieties1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindu Deities and the Third Sex (1)|url=http://www.galva108.org/#!Hindu-Deities-and-the-Third-Sex-1/cu6k/A138A622-C40E-424E-BE21-884ECB1E3E2A|publisher=Gay &amp; Lesbian Vaishnava Association|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galva3rdsexdieties2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindu Deities and the Third Sex (2)|url=http://www.galva108.org/#!Hindu-Deities-and-the-Third-Sex-2/cu6k/1|publisher=Gay &amp; Lesbian Vaishnava Association|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also specific festivals connected to the worship of these deities, some of which are famous in India for their crossdressing devotees. These festivals include the Aravan Festival of [[Koovagam]], the Bahuchara Mata Festivals of [[Gujarat]] and the Yellamma Festivals of [[Karnataka]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;For a complete description of twenty-nine of the most gender-variant Hindu deities, see Part One, Chapter Three of Wilhelm's ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex''.&lt;/ref&gt; Deities displaying gender variance include [[Mohini]], the female [[avatar]] of the god Vishnu and [[Vaikuntha Kamalaja]], the androgynous form of Vishnu and his consort [[Lakshmi]].

LBGT interpretations are also drawn in the legends of birth of the deities [[Ayyappa]] (a god born from the union of Shiva and Mohini), [[Bhagiratha]] (an Indian king born of two female parents) and [[Kartikeya]] (where the fire-god [[Agni]] "swallows" the seed of Shiva after disturbing his coitus with his consort Parvati). Some homosexual Hindus also worship the gods [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]] and [[Varuna]], who are associated with two lunar phases and same-sex relations in ancient [[Brahmana]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindu Deities and the Third Sex (2)|url=http://www.galva108.org/#!Hindu-Deities-and-the-Third-Sex-2/cu6k/1|publisher=Gay &amp; Lesbian Vaishnava Association|accessdate=14 March 2016|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:6NborWhzt7kJ:www.galva108.org/%23!Hindu-Deities-and-the-Third-Sex-2/cu6k/1+&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk|archivedate=28 Feb 2016|quote=In Vedic literature, Sri Mitra-Varuna are portrayed as icons of brotherly affection and intimate friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). For this reason they are worshiped by men of the third sex, albeit not as commonly as other Hindu deities. They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. Sometimes they are portrayed seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Sri Mitra-Varuna with the two lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet and when they are thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” ([[Shatapatha Brahmana]] 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing. In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon nights are discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types of intercourse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender variance is also observed in heroes in Hindu scriptures. The [[Hindu epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' narrates that the hero [[Arjuna]] takes a vow to live as a member of the third sex for a year as the result of a curse he is compelled to honor. He thus transforms into [[Brihannala]], a member of the third gender, for a year and becomes a dance teacher to a princess. Another important character, [[Shikhandi]], is born female, but raised as a man and even married to a woman. She becomes male due to the grace of a [[yaksha]]. Shikhandi eventually becomes the reason of the death of the warrior [[Bhishma]], who refuses to fight a "woman." Another character, [[Bhishma]] appeases [[Yudhishtira]]'s curiosity about relative enjoyment of partners during sex by relating the story of King Bhangasvana, who having had a hundred sons is turned into a woman while on a hunt. She returns to her kingdom, relates the story, turns the kingdom over to her children and retires to the forest to be the spouse of a hermit, by whom she has a hundred more sons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mahabharata]] Anushaasan Parva: Daandharma Parva, Chapter 12, shloka-1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]], a king from Hindu narratives, is also known for his/her gender changes.

Some versions of the [[Krittivasi Ramayan|Krittivasa Ramayana]], the most popular Bengali text on the pastimes of [[Ramachandra]] (an incarnation of [[Vishnu]]), relate a story of two queens who conceived a child together. When the king of the Sun Dynasty, Maharaja Dilipa, died, the demigods become concerned that he did not have a son to continue his line. Shiva therefore appeared before the king's two widowed queens and commanded them, "You two make love together and by my blessings you will bear a beautiful son." The two wives, with great affection for each other, executed Shiva's order until one of them conceived a child. The sage Astavakra accordingly named the child "[[Bhagiratha]]" – he who was born from two vulvas. Bhagiratha later became a king and is credited with bringing the river [[Ganges]] down to earth through his austerities.&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth and Saleem Kidwai. ''Same-Sex Love in India: Reading From Literature and History'', pp. 100–102. New York, NY: Palgrave, 2001.

==Hindu texts==
{{primary sources|section|date=July 2014}}
Hindus have many sacred texts and different communities give special importance to different texts. Even more so than in other religions, Hindus also foster disparate interpretations of the meaning of various texts. The [[Vedas]], which form the foundation of Hinduism for many, do not refer explicitly to homosexuality, but [[Rigveda]] says regarding Samsara that '''''Vikruti Evam Prakriti''''' '''(perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural)''', which some scholars believe recognizes the cyclical constancy of homosexual/transsexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of universal diversities.&lt;ref&gt;'Expose the Hindu Taliban!' by [[Ashok Row Kavi]]&lt;/ref&gt; People of a [[third gender]] (''tritiya-prakriti''), not fully men nor women, are mentioned here and there throughout Hindu texts such as the [[Puranas]] but are not specifically defined. In general they are portrayed as effeminate men, often cowardly, and with no desire for women. Modern readers often draw parallels between these and modern stereotypes of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] [[sexual identity|sexual identities]]. However, Hindu texts (Mostly Dharmasastras) such as the Manusmirti,  Vide Atri Smřti , Vide Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra and the Vide Apastambha Dharmasūtra  do treat Homosexuality as a sin, in some cases legally punishable. in addition, each hindu denomination had developed distinct rules regarding sexuality, as hinduism is not unifyed and is decentralized in essence.

Historians Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai, in their pioneering book, ''Same-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History'', for the first time compiled extracts from Indian texts, from ancient to modern times, including many Hindu texts, translated from 15 Indian languages. In their accompanying analytical essays, they also demonstrated that Hindu texts have discussed and debated same-sex desire from the earliest times, in tones ranging from critical to non-judgmental to playful and celebratory.

Mythologist [[Devdutt Pattanaik]] summarizes the place of homosexuality in Hindu literature as follows: "though not part of the mainstream, its existence was acknowledged but not approved."&lt;ref name="Devdutt"&gt;Pattanaik, Devdutt (2001). ''Homosexuality in Ancient India'', [[Debonair (magazine)|Debonair]] 2000 or 2001. Essay available [http://www.gaybombay.org/reading/art0001.html online] from GayBombay.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Indologists assert that homosexuality was not approved for [[Brahmin|brahmanas]] or the [[Dwija|twice-born]] but accepted among other castes.

In his book, ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex'', Vaishnava monk Amara Das Wilhelm demonstrates how ancient expressions of Hinduism accommodated homosexual and transgender persons much more positively than we see in India today: "Early Vedic teachings stressed responsible family life and asceticism but also tolerated different types of sexualities within general society."&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Amara Das. ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex'', p. 131. Philadelphia, PA: Xlibris Corporation, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

===Mahanirvana Tantra===
The Mahanirvana tantra exclude the third-gendered from the right of inheritance, although establishing they have the right to be financially supported by their family.&lt;ref&gt;Mahanirvana Tantra 12:104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kama Sutra===
[[File:At the Lakshmana temple in Khajuraho (954 CE), a man receives fellatio from a seated male as part of an orgiastic scene.jpg|thumb|File:At the Lakshmana temple in Khajuraho (954 CE), a man receives fellatio from a seated male as part of an orgiastic scene.jpg]]
The '''Kama Sutra''' is an ancient text dealing with ''kama'' or desire (of all kinds), which in Hindu thought is one of the four normative and spiritual goals of life. The [[Kama Sutra]] is the earliest extant and most important work in the [[Kama Shastra]] tradition of [[Sanskrit literature]]. It was compiled by the philosopher [[Vatsyayana]] around the 4th century, from earlier texts, and describes homosexual practices in several places, as well as a range of sex/gender 'types'. The author acknowledges that these relations also involve love and a bond of trust.

The author describes techniques by which masculine and feminine types of the third sex (''tritiya-prakriti''), as well as women, perform [[fellatio]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielou, Alain. ''The Complete Kama Sutra'', Part Two, Chapter Nine, entitled "Superior Coition or Fellation [''Auparishtaka'']. Rochester, VT: Park Street Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Part, Ninth Chapter of Kama Sutra specifically describes two kinds of men that we would recognize today as masculine- and feminine-type homosexuals but which are mentioned in older, Victorian British translations as simply "eunuchs."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kama Sutra]], Chapter 9, "Of the Auparishtaka or Mouth Congress". [http://www.kamashastra.com/kama209.htm Text online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313043325/http://www.kamashastra.com/kama209.htm |date=2010-03-13 }} ([[Richard Burton]] 1883 translation).&lt;/ref&gt;  The chapter describes their appearances – feminine types dressed up as women whereas masculine types maintained muscular physiques and grew small beards, moustaches, etc. – and their various professions as masseurs, barbers and prostitutes are all described. Such homosexual men were also known to marry, according to the Kama Sutra: "There are also third-sex citizens, sometimes greatly attached to one another and with complete faith in one another, who get married together." (KS 2.9.36). In the "Jayamangala" of Yashodhara, an important twelfth-century commentary on the Kama Sutra, it is also stated: "Citizens with this kind of homosexual inclination, who renounce women and can do without them willingly because they love one another, get married together, bound by a deep and trusting friendship."&lt;ref&gt;Danielou, Alain. ''The Complete Kama Sutra''. Rochester, VT: Park Street Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

After describing fellatio as performed between men of the third sex, the Sutra then mentions the practice as an act between men and women, wherein the homosexuals acts are scorned, especially for brahmanas. (KS 2.9.37)

The Kama Sutra also refers to ''svairini'', who are "independent women who frequent their own kind or others" (2.8.26) — or, in another passage: "the liberated woman, or ''svairini'', is one who refuses a husband and has relations in her own home or in other houses" (6.6.50). In a famous commentary on the Kama Sutra from the 12th century, Jayamangala, explains: "A woman known for her independence, with no sexual bars, and acting as she wishes, is called ''svairini''. She makes love with her own kind. She strokes her partner at the point of union, which she kisses." (''Jayamangala'' on Kama Sutra 2.8.13). The various practices of lesbians are described in detail within the Second Part, Eighth Chapter of the Kama Sutra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kamasutra.telugu.ws/VatsyayanaKamaSutra_P2C8.html The Kama Sutra Of Vatsayana – Part 2, Chapter 8] Translation by Richard Burton (1883)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
There are other ancient Hindu/Sanskrit texts that refer to homosexuality. The Sushruta Samhita, for example, a highly respected Hindu medical text dating back to at least 600 B.C., mentions two different types of homosexual men (''kumbhika'' – men who take the passive role in anal sex; and ''asekya'' – men who devour the semen of other men) as well as transgender people (''sandha'' – men with the qualities, behavior and speech of women). It also states that men who behave like women, or women who behave like men, are determined as such at the time of their conception in the womb. (SS 3.2.42–43)&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Amara Das. ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex'', pp. 267, 334. Philadelphia, PA: Xlibris Corporation, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}  The Sushruta Samhita also mentions the possibility of two women uniting and becoming pregnant as a result of the mingling of their sexual fluids. It states that the child born of such a union will be "boneless."  Such a birth is indeed described in the ''Krittivasa'' Ramayana of Bengal (see below).

Other texts list the various types of men who are impotent with women (known in Sanskrit as ''sandha'', ''kliba'', ''napumsaka'', and ''panda''). The ''Sabda-kalpa-druma'' Sanskrit-Sanskrit dictionary, for instance, lists twenty types, as does the ''Kamatantra'' and ''Smriti-Ratnavali'' of Vacaspati (14th century). The Narada Smriti similarly lists fourteen different types. Included among the lists are transgender people (''sandha''), intersex people (''nisarga''), and three different types of homosexual men (''mukhebhaga'', ''kumbhika'' and ''asekya''). Such texts demonstrate that third-sex terms like ''sandha'' and ''napumsaka'' actually refer to many different types of "men who are impotent with women," and that simplistic definitions such as "eunuch" or "neuter" may not always be accurate and in some cases totally incorrect. In his article ''Homosexuality and Hinduism'', [[Arvind Sharma]] expresses his doubt over the common English translation of words like ''kliba'' into "eunuch" as follows: "The limited practice of castration in India raises another point significant for the rest of the discussion, namely, whether rendering a word such as "kliba" as "eunuch" regularly is correct..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sharma, Arvind]]. ''Homosexuality and Hinduism'' (as part of ''Homosexuality and World Religions''). Valley Forge, PA: Trinity Press International.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arthashastra of Kautilya represents the principle text of secular law and illustrates the attitude of the judiciary towards sexual matters. Heterosexual vaginal sex is proposed as the norm by this text and legal issues arising from deviation there from are punishable by fines and in extreme cases by capital punishment. Homosexual acts are cited as a small offence punishable by a fine.&lt;ref&gt;Arthashastra(4;13;236)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sangam literature===
[[Sangam literature]] use the word ‘Pedi’ to refer to transwomen, Likewise, the famous sangam period characters of King Koperunchozhan and Pisuranthaiyar are another example for same sex love and They are said to have not seen each other at all and yet shared love and regard for each other, so much, that they die at the same time at different places. “For instance, the friendship between King Pari and poet Kabilar is shown as something more than just friendship. There are lyrical undertones suggestive of the intimate relationship they had. But since there are no explicit representation, one can only postulate a possibility.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/no-more-under-siege/article5247859.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=A. | last=Shrikumar | title=No more under siege | date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-gender Hindu sects==
Below are listed some of the most common third-gender sects found in Hinduism. There are an estimated half million crossdressing "eunuchs" in modern-day India, associated with various sects, temples and Hindu deities.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Amara Das. ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex'', p. 346. Philadelphia, PA: Xlibris Corporation, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}  Despite being called "eunuchs", the majority of these persons (91%) do not practice castration but are more accurately associated with transgender.

===The Hijra===
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}
The most well-known third-gender group in India is perhaps the ''hijra'' of [[northern India]]. The ''hijra'' is the only sect that practices castration, a custom introduced during Muslim rule around the tenth century A.D. Male castration is not recommended in the [[Vedas]] and is not a traditional Hindu practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET0307/ET12-8214.html India's Slow Descent Into Homophobia] BY AMARA DASA; July 12, 2003, VNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galva108.org/faq.html|title=FAQ:#7-What are the "eunuchs" of India?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 50,000 ''hijra'' in northern India. After interviewing and studying the ''hijra'' for many years, Serena Nanda writes in her book, ''Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India'', as follows: "There is a widespread belief in India that ''hijras'' are born [[hermaphrodite]]s [intersex] and are taken away by the ''hijra'' community at birth or in childhood, but I found no evidence to support this belief among the ''hijras'' I met, all of whom joined the community voluntarily, often in their teens."&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena. Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India, p. xx. Canada: Wadworth Publishing Company, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Nanda also states: "There is absolutely no question that at least some ''hijras'' – perhaps even the majority – are homosexual prostitutes. Sinha's (1967) study of ''hijras'' in Lucknow, in North India, acknowledges the ''hijra'' role as performers, but views the major motivation for recruitment to the ''hijra'' community as the satisfaction of the individual's homosexual urges..."&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, Serena. Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India, p. 10. Canada: Wadworth Publishing Company, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The ''hijras'' especially worship [[Bahuchara Mata|Bahuchara]], the Hindu goddess presiding over transsexuality.

===The Aravani or Ali===
[[File:Kuvagam hijras.jpg|thumb|Aravanis – the "brides" of [[Iravan|Aravan]], mourn his death]]
The most numerous third-gender sect (estimated at 150,000) is the ''aravani'' or ''ali'' of [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[southern India]]. The ''aravanis'' are typically transgender and their main festival, the popular [[Koovagam]] or Aravan Festival celebrated in late April/early May, is attended by thousands, including many transgender people and homosexuals. The ''aravani'' worship the Hindu god, [[Iravan|Aravan]], and do not practice any system of castration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X6-qGoFlGngC&amp;pg=PA315 The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Lgbt Issues Worldwide] By Chuck Stewart; p.315&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Jogappa===
A lesser-known third-gender sect in India is the ''jogappa'' of South India (Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh), a group similarly associated with prostitution. The ''jogappa'' are connected with the goddess [[Yellamma]] (Renuka), and include both transgender people and homosexuals. Both serve as dancers and prostitutes, and they are usually in charge of the temple ''[[devadasi]]s'' (maidservants of the goddess who similarly serve as dancers and female courtesans). Large festivals are celebrated at these temples wherein hundreds of scantily-clad ''devadasis'' and ''jogappas'' parade through the streets. The ''jogappa'' do not practice castration.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Amara Das. Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex, pp. 77–78.

==Religious art==

Medieval [[Hindu temple]]s such as those at [[Khajuraho]] depict sexual acts in sculptures on the external walls. Some of these scenes involve same-sex sexuality:

Hinduism has a small following in Slovakia.

Hindu groups such as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]], [[Yoga in Daily Life]], Osho, [[Sahaja Yoga]],  [[Chinmaya mission]] exists in Slovakia  *[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71407.htm  International Religious Freedom Report 2006, Slovak Republic]

==Hindu organisations in Slovakia==
[[Yoga in Daily Life]] by Mahamandaleshwar [[Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda]] is a comprehensive system of Yoga with a holistic approach to health, like Ayurveda. The main goal of the Yoga in Daily Life system is to attain and maintain physical health, mental health, social health, spiritual health and eventually achieve self-realization.  There are about 100 yoga centers in Slovakia teaching Yoga in Daily Life.

[[Chinmaya Mission]] is an organization dedicated to the spread of Advaita Vedanta across the world, founded by Swami [[Chinmayananda]].

None of the above Hindu groups are registered in Slovak Republic. To register a new religion, a group must submit a list of 20,000 permanent residents who adhere to that religion. Registration of religious groups is not required in Slovakia; however, under existing law, only registered religious groups have the explicit right to conduct public worship services and other activities, although no specific religions or practices are banned or discouraged by the authorities in practice. Those that register receive government benefits, including subsidies for clergymen, office expenses, the right to visit and proselytize in prisons and hospitals, and access to public television broadcasting. Government funding also is provided to religious schools and to teachers who lecture on religion in state schools. The Government occasionally subsidizes one-time projects and significant religious activities, and registered religious groups are partly exempt from paying taxes and import custom fees. A religion may elect not to accept the subsidies.

[[File:Crossing the River Styx.jpg|thumb|right|River of the netherworld]]
{{Mesopotamian myth (7)}}

'''Hubur''' ({{cuneiform|ḪU.BUR, Hu-bur}}) is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] term meaning "river", "watercourse" or "netherworld", written ideographically with the cuneiform signs {{cuneiform|𒄷𒁓}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Netherworld?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744%3Av0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=Netherworld&amp;sa=Search#922 Webster's Online Dictionary, Sumerian 3100 BCE - 2500 BCE hubur (netherworld)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Association1954"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hairenik Association|title=The Armenian review p.117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cCkiAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 June 2011|year=1954|publisher=Hairenik Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="King2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=L. W. King|title=The Seven Tablets Of Creation: The Babylonian And Assyrian Legends Concerning The Creation Of The World And Of Mankind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCb0iI4S2VMC&amp;pg=PR95|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=19 March 2004|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-8935-5|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually the "river of the netherworld".&lt;ref name="George2003"/&gt;

==Usage and meaning==

A connection to [[Tiamat]] has been suggested with parallels to her description as "Ummu-Hubur". Hubur is also referred to in the [[Enuma Elish]] as "mother sea Hubur, who fashions all things".&lt;ref name="VogelzangVanstiphout1996"/&gt; The [[river]] [[Euphrates]] has been identified with Hubur as the source of fertility in [[Sumer]]. This Babylonian "river of creation" has been linked to the [[Hebrew]] "river of [[paradise]]".&lt;ref name="King2004"/&gt;  Gunkel and Zimmern suggested resemblance in expressions and a possible connection between the Sumerian river and that found in later literary tradition in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] ({{Bibleverse||Ezekiel|47|HE}}) likely influencing imagery of the "River of [[Water]] of [[Life]]" in the [[Apocalypse]] ({{Bibleverse||Revelation|22|1|KJV}}). They also noted a connection between the "Water of Life" in the [[legend]] of [[Adapa]] and a myth translated by A.H. Sayce called "An address to the river of creation".&lt;ref name="King2004"/&gt; Delitzch has suggested the similar Sumerian word '''Habur''' probably meant "mighty water source", "source of fertility" or the like. This has suggested the meaning of Hubur to be "river of fertility in the underworld".&lt;ref name="The Evidence of Language"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evidence of Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxc7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=6 June 2011|publisher=CUP Archive|pages=29–|id=GGKEY:4T5W4APR1T2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Foubister has suggested  the river of creation was linked with the importance of rivers and rain in the [[fertile crescent]] and suggested it was related to the underworld as rivers resemble [[snake]]s.&lt;ref name="Foubister2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Foubister|title=Goddess in the Grass: Serpentine Mythology and the Great Goddess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9ViAIrVur4C&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=October 2003|publisher=Linda Foubister|isbn=978-0-9731648-2-4|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Eugene Balentine suggested that the "pit" (sahar) and "river" or "channel" (salah) in the [[Book of Job]] ({{Bibleverse||Job|33:18|ASV}}) were referencing the Hubur.&lt;ref name="Balentine2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Eugene Balentine|title=Job|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxZVAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=7 June 2011|date=November 2006|publisher=Smyth &amp; Helwys Pub.|isbn=978-1-57312-067-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The god [[Marduk]] was praised for restoration or saving individuals from death when he drew them out of the waters of the Hubur, a later reference to this theme is made in [[Psalm 18]] ({{Bibleverse||Psalms|18|16|HE}}).&lt;ref name="WaltonMatthews2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[John H. Walton]]|author2=[[Victor Harold Matthews]]|author3=Mark William Chavalas|title=The IVP Bible background commentary: Old Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIA3tH9HqY4C&amp;pg=PA522|accessdate=10 June 2011|year=2000|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-1419-0|pages=522–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
The river plays a certain role in [[Mesopotamian mythology]] and [[Assyro-Babylonian religion]], associated with the [[Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)|Sumerian paradise]] and heroes and deities such as [[Gilgamesh]], [[Enlil]], [[Enki]] and [[Ninlil]].&lt;ref name="George2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. R. George|title=The Babylonian Gilgamesh epic: introduction, critical edition and cuneiform texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21xxZ_gUy_wC&amp;pg=PA500|accessdate=7 June 2011|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-927841-1|pages=500–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hubur was suggested to be between the twin peaks of Mount [[Mashu]] to the east in front of the gates of the netherworld. The Sumerian myth of [[Enlil and Ninlil]] tells the tale of the leader of the gods, [[Enlil]] being banished to the netherworld followed by his wife [[Ninlil]].&lt;ref name="ToornBecking1999"/&gt; It mentions the river and its [[ferryman]], [[SI.LU.IGI]], who crosses the river in a boat. Themes of this story are repeated later in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] where the ferryman is called [[Urshanabi]]. In later [[Assyria]]n times, the ferryman became a monster called [[Hamar-tabal]] and may have influenced the later [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] of [[Greek Mythology]].&lt;ref name="George2003"/&gt; In another story a four-handed, bird [[demon]] carries souls across to the city of the dead. Several [[Akkadian mythology|Akkadian]] demons are also restrained by the river Hubur. The river is mentioned in the Inscription of Ilum-Ishar, written on bricks at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. [[Nergal]], god of the netherworld is referred to as "king Hubur" in a list of Sumerian gods. The word is also used into the [[Assyrian empire]] where it was used as the name of the tenth month in a calendar dated to around 1100 BC. There was also a goddess called Haburitim mentioned in texts from the [[Third dynasty of Ur]].&lt;ref name="ToornBecking1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. van der Toorn|author2=Bob Becking|author3=Pieter Willem van der Horst|title=Dictionary of deities and demons in the Bible DDD|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;pg=PA431|accessdate=6 June 2011|year=1999|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-90-04-11119-6|pages=431–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology and geography==

In Sumerian cosmology, the souls of the dead had to travel across the [[desert]] or [[steppe]], cross the Hubur river, to the mountainland of [[Kur]].&lt;ref name="VogelzangVanstiphout1996"/&gt; Here the souls had to pass through seven different walled and gated locations to reach the netherworld.&lt;ref name="Walton2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John H. Walton|title=Ancient Near Eastern thought and the Old Testament: introducing the conceptual world of the Hebrew Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhb20fH7cZYC&amp;pg=PA318|accessdate=7 June 2011|date=1 November 2006|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2750-5|pages=318–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Annanuki]] administrated [[Kur]] as if it were a civilized settlement both architecturally and politically.&lt;ref name="Walton2006"/&gt;

Frans Wiggermann connected Hubur to the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Habur]], a tributary of the Euphrates far away from the Sumerian heartland,&lt;ref name="VogelzangVanstiphout1996"/&gt; there was also a town called Haburatum east of the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref name="ToornBecking1999"/&gt; He suggested that as the concept of the netherworld (as opposed to an ''under''world) in Sumerian [[cosmogeny]] lacked the modern concept of an [[Devil|accompanying divine ruler]] of a [[Hell|location underneath the earth]], the geographical terminology suggested that it was located at the edges of the world and that its features derived in part from real [[geography]] before shifting to become a [[demon]]ic [[fantasy]] world.&lt;ref name="VogelzangVanstiphout1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marianna E. Vogelzang|author2=Herman L. J. Vanstiphout|title=Mesopotamian poetic language: Sumerian and Akkadian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDyDXLUeHykC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=February 1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-72371-84-3|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Başlıca İslâm çini ve keramik merkezleri.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Chief places named in connection with Islamic pottery.]]

Medieval '''Islamic pottery''' occupied a geographical position between [[Chinese ceramics]], then the unchallenged leaders of Eurasian production, and the pottery of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and Europe.  For most of the period it can fairly be said to have been between the two in terms of aesthetic achievement and influence as well, borrowing from China and exporting to and influencing Byzantium and Europe. The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the [[Hadith]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=24&amp;translator=2 Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels]&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that pottery and glass were used for tableware by Muslim elites, as pottery (but less often glass) also was in China, but was much rarer in Europe and Byzantium.  In the same way Islamic restrictions greatly discouraged figurative wall-painting, encouraging the architectural use of schemes of decorative and often [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrically-patterned]] [[tile]]s, which are the most distinctive and original speciality of Islamic ceramics.

The era of Islamic [[pottery]] started around 622. From 633, [[Muslim]] armies moved rapidly towards [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Anatolia]], [[Egypt]] and later [[Andalusia]]. The early history of Islamic pottery remains somewhat obscure and speculative as little evidence has survived.  Apart from tiles which escaped destruction due to their use in architectural decoration of buildings and mosques, much early medieval pottery vanished.

The Muslim world inherited significant pottery industries in Mesopotamia, [[Persia]], Egypt, North Africa ([[African Red Slip]]) and later other regions. Indeed, the origin of glazed pottery has been traced to Egypt where it was first introduced during the fourth millennium BCE.  However most of these traditions made heavy use of figurative decoration, which was greatly reduced, though not entirely removed, under Islam.  Instead Islamic pottery developed geometric and plant-based decoration to a very high level, and made more use of decorative schemes made up of many tiles than any previous culture.

==Early Medieval (622-1200)==
[[File:Dish epigraphic Louvre AA96.jpg|thumb|left|Dish with epigraphic decoration. The Kufic inscription reads: "Magnanimity has first a bitter taste, but at the end it tastes sweeter than honey. Good health [to the owner]." Terracotta, white slip ground and slip underglaze decoration, Khurasan (Iran), 11th–12th century.]]
A distinct Muslim style in pottery was not firmly established until the 9th century in [[Iraq]] (formerly Mesopotamia), [[Syria]] and [[Persia]].  During this period pieces mainly used white [[tin-glaze]].  Information on earlier periods is very limited.  This is largely due to the lack of surviving specimens in good condition which also limits the interest in the study of ceramics of these periods.  Archaeological excavations carried out in Jordan uncovered only a few examples from the Umayyad period, mostly unglazed vessels from Khirbat Al-Mafjar.&lt;ref&gt;Baramki, D.C., "The pottery from Khirbet El-Mefjer", ''The Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine'' (QDAP 1942),  vol. 10, pp.65-103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, J.A., "Umayyad pottery from sites in East Jordan2, ''Jordan'', Vol.4, 1975, pp.25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the East, evidence shows that a production centre was set up in [[Samarkand]] under the [[Samanid]] dynasty who ruled this region and parts of [[Persia]] between 874 and 999 A.D.  The most highly regarded technique of this centre is the use of [[calligraphy]] in the decoration of vessels.  East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called "epigraphic ware", has been described as "probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery".&lt;ref&gt;Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278-290&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese influence===
{{main article|Chinese influences on Islamic pottery}}
During the Abbasid dynasty pottery production gained momentum, largely using tin glazes mostly in the form of opaque white glaze.  Some historians, such as Arthur Lane, attribute the rise of such industry to Chinese influence. Evidence from Muslim manuscripts, such as Akhbar al-Sin wa al-Hind (circa 851) and Ibn Kurdadhbih’s Book of Roads and Provinces (846-885), suggest that trade with China was firmly established. Lane also referred to the passage in a work written by Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Baihaki, (circa 1059) where he stated that the governor of Khurasan, ‘Ali ibn ‘Isa, sent as a present to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786-809), “twenty pieces of Chinese Imperial [[porcelain]] (Chini faghfuri),  the like of which had never been seen at a Caliph’s court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain”.
[[File:Plate dragon Louvre MAO696.jpg|thumb|Plate with dragon. Persia, 17th century, inspired by 15th-century Chinese blue and white porcelain]]

According to Lane, the influence of Chinese pottery progressed in three main phases.  The first contact with [[China]] took place in 751 when the Arabs defeated the Chinese at the [[Battle of Talas]].  It has been argued that imprisoned Chinese potters and paper makers could have taught the Muslims the art of pottery and paper-making.  In 800’s Chinese stoneware and porcelain reached the Abbasids.  The second phase took place in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a period noted for the decline of pottery industry following the fall of the Seljuk dynasty.  This period also saw the invasion of the Mongols who brought Chinese pottery traditions.

The influence of ceramics from the [[Tang Dynasty]] can be seen on [[lustreware]]s, produced by [[Mesopotamia]]n potters, and on some early white wares excavated at [[Samarra]] (in modern-day [[Iraq]]). Ceramics from this period were excavated at [[Nishapur]] (in modern-day [[Iran]]) and [[Samarkand]] (in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]]).

By the time of the [[Mongol invasion of China]] a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own [[fritware]] bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of [[Korean pottery]], but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, Ch. 5, pp. 134, 140-141 especially&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger [[celadon]] dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East.  Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 136-137&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of [[Chinese blue and white porcelain]], which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming.  Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the [[arabesque]]s and [[scroll (art)|plant scrolls]] of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels.  This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves.  The [[cobalt blue]] that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in [[Quanzhou]], convenient for the huge [[Jingdezhen]] potteries, and other ports to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 137-140&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the [[Ming dynasty]] was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries.  This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Often Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the [[Zhengde Emperor]]'s (r. 1505-1521) flirtation with Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic innovations===
{{see also|Hispano-Moresque ware|İznik pottery|Alchemy and chemistry in Islam}}

From between the eighth and eighteenth centuries, the use of [[Ceramic glaze|glazed ceramics]] was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate [[pottery]].&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]], for the production of [[tin-glazed pottery]], was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters.  The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[stoneware]] originating in 9th-century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; It was a vitreous or semivitreous ceramic ware of fine texture, made primarily from non-refactory fire clay.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Terminology Of Ceramic Whiteware and Related Products. ASTM Standard C242.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other centres for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cup lustre Louvre OA8179.jpg|thumb|left|9th-century [[lustreware]] bowl from [[Iraq]]]]

[[Lusterware]] was produced  in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 9th century; the technique soon became popular in [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Lusterware was later produced in [[Egypt]] during the [[Fatimid]] caliphate in the 10th-12th centuries. While some production of lustreware  continued in the [[Middle East]], it spread to [[Europe]]&amp;mdash;first in the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] of [[Al-Andalus]], notably at [[Málaga]], and then [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], then later to Italy, where it was used to enhance [[maiolica]].

Another innovation was the [[albarello]], a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of [[pharmacy]] jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. Brought to Italy from Spain, the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century.

[[Fritware]] refers to a type of pottery which was first developed in the Near East, where production is dated to the late first millennium AD through the second millennium AD. [[Frit]] was a significant ingredient. A recipe for “fritware” dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu’l Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to “frit-glass” to white clay is 10:1:1.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Bernsted 2003, ''Early Islamic Pottery: Materials and Techniques'', London: Archetype Publications Ltd., 25; R.B. Mason and M.S. Tite 1994, The Beginnings of Islamic Stonepaste Technology, ''Archaeometry'' 36.1: 77&lt;/ref&gt; This type of pottery has also been referred to as “stoneware" and “faience” among other names.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; A ninth-century corpus of “proto-stoneware” from [[Baghdad]] has “relict glass fragments” in its fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The glass is alkali-lime-lead-silica and, when the paste was fired or cooled, wollastonite and [[diopside]] crystals formed within the glass fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of “inclusions of crushed [[pottery]]” suggests these fragments did not come from a glaze.&lt;ref name="Masonand"&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for their addition would be to act as a flux, and so “accelerate vitrification at a relatively low firing temperature, and thus increase the [[hardness]] and [[density]] of the [ceramic] body.”&lt;ref name="Masonand" /&gt;

==Middle (1200–1400)==
[[File:Albarello fleur-de-lys Louvre UCAD4288.jpg|thumb|Albarello with fleur-de-lys decoration, early 14th century, Syria, musée du Louvre]]
By this period the distinctive Islamic tradition of decorated wall tiles had emerged, and continued to develop together with vessel pottery in a way unique to [[Islamic art]].  In the account of Ibn Naji (circa 1016) the Caliph sent, in addition to tiles, “a man from [[Baghdad]]” to Qairawan to produce lustre tiles for the [[mihrab]] of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] (still well preserved). Georges Marcais suggested that Iraqi potters indeed came to Quairawan. The arrival of this Baghdadi potter must have led to the establishment of a satellite centre for the production of ceramics in [[Quairawan]], but no information has yet been developed to confirm or deny this suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;Marcais G., ''Les faiences a reflets metalliques de la grande Mosquee de Kairouan'', Paris, 1928, pp.10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The events leading to the collapse of the [[Fatimid]] reign in 1171 caused ceramic production to move out to new centres, via processes similar to those described above with respect to [[Iraq]].  As a result, Persia  became a centre of revival under the Seljuk rule (1038–1327).  This is not coincidental as the Seljuks expanded their rule over Persia, Iraq, Syria, and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], as well as [[Anatolia]] and Muslim [[Asia Minor]].   All of these had been, for some considerable time, centres of old pottery.
[[File:Coupe iran.JPG|thumb|left|Bowl with hunters, [[Persian pottery]] from 12th–13th century.]]
The Seljuks brought new and fresh inspiration to the Muslim world, attracting artists, craftsmen and potters from all regions including Egypt.  In addition to continuing the production of similar (although more refined) [[Tin-glazing|tin]] and lustre glaze ceramics, the Seljuks (in Persia) were credited for the introduction of a new type sometimes known as "Faience". This is made from a hard white [[frit]] paste coated with transparent [[alkaline]] glaze.

[[Hispano-Moresque ware]] emerged in [[Al-Andaluz]] in the 13th century, probably after potters escaped the instability after the fall of the Fatimids.  It introduced lustreware manufacture to Europe and from the start was widely exported to the elites of Christian kingdoms.  The first centre was [[Málaga]], producing wares in traditional Islamic styles, but from the 13th century Muslim potters migrated to the [[Reconquista|reconquered]] Christian city of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], outlying suburbs of which such as [[Manises]] and [[Paterna]] became the most important centres, manufacturing mainly for Christian markets in styles increasingly influenced by European decoration, though retaining a distinct character.  The potters were mostly still Muslim or [[Morisco]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Caiger-Smith|Caiger-Smith, Alan]], ''Lustre Pottery: Technique, Tradition and Innovation in Islam and the Western World'', Chapters 6 &amp; 7, (Faber and Faber, 1985) {{ISBN|0-571-13507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In a rare manuscript from Kashan compiled by Abulqassim in 1301, there is a complete description of how faience production was carried out.  Frit was made of ten parts of powdered [[quartz]], one part of clay and one part of glaze mixture. The addition of greater amounts of clay made [[Pottery#Methods of shaping|wheel throwing]] of the faience easier, and allowed a better quality of work, because otherwise the material had little plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Allan,''The History of So-Called Egyptian Faience in Islamic Persia''[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:ToZNNX9ByKcJ:onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4754.1973.tb00087.x/pdf+clay+in+Islamic+Faience&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjQqKQNJACMRhHBF4olfMRaqbohZCsx8Lzwp62x9CoF89N2Aqg7g_vIfVaSHY9gbxiS3kL65qWZmc1bHicjUsSazPR8peLN5zIfbVa_8Vp44i0a6ajlDRCvUszsfBW51oW5z3kf&amp;sig=AHIEtbS8aaJN_ZqzN-NjalLSjuYd5tmE_A]&lt;/ref&gt;  The glaze itself is “formed of a roughly equal mixture of ground quartz and the ashes of desert plants which contain a very high proportion of alkaline salts.  These act as a [[flux]] and cause the quartz to vitrify at a manageable temperature.  The two alone will produce a transparent glaze”.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, O., ''Persian Lustre Ware'', London 1985, .p.32. Cited in Febervari Gesa (2000), op., cit, .p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Lane compared this material with the French pâte tender, which was used by potters as recently as the eighteenth century.  This body material and the new glaze offered the potter a greater handling and manipulation ability.  This allows the potter to improve the quality and appearance of the vessel, including more refined decorative designs and patterns. The result was a substantial variety of products such as bowls of different size and shapes, jugs, incense burners, lamps, candlesticks, trays, tiles and so on.  These advantages also allowed greater control of carved decoration, the use of which the Seljuks refined and extended during the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, A. (1947) ''Early Islamic Pottery'', Faber and Faber, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Carved decoration in ceramics, [[sgraffito]], is an old tradition used in ninth-century Islamic pottery; it is an engraving technique based on incising the design with a sharp tool through a white [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] to reveal the red [[earthenware]] body. The vessel is then coated with glaze.

The Seljuks also developed the so-called silhouette wares which are distinguished by their black background.  These are produced by a technique which consists of coating the white [[fritware]] body with a thick black [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], out of which the decoration is then carved.  Later, a coat of colourless or coloured, usually blue or green, transparent glaze is applied.  According to Lane, this technique was used, in a simpler form, in Samarkand between the ninth and tenth centuries.  The method then consisted of mixing the colours with a thick opaque clay slip instead.

==Late/Post-medieval (1400-onward)==
[[File:Iznik Pottery Candlesticks,Ottoman Turkey.JPG|thumb|İznik Pottery Candlesticks,Ottoman Turkey]]
[[File:Iznik dish.JPG|thumb|[[İznik pottery|İznik]] dish]]

The influence of [[Blue and white porcelain]] of the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming dynasties]] is evident in many ceramics made by Muslim potters. [[İznik pottery]] from around [[İznik]] in [[Anatolia]] was supported by the Ottoman court and produced the finest [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] work in pottery and panels of tiles, using the same vocabulary of bold and elegant floral designs derived from Chinese decoration.  A characteristic bold red was developed.  İznik ware had a major influence on [[Europe]]an decorative arts: for example, on Italian [[Maiolica]].  The pottery was produced in as early as the 15th century AD, and was preceded by [[Miletus ware]] from the same region.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Tite 1989, İznik Pottery: An Investigation of the Methods of Production, ''Archaeometry'' 31.2: 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Its best period lasted until the late 16th century.  It consists of a body, [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], and glaze, where the body and glaze are “quartz-frit.”&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The “frits” in both cases “are unusual in that they contain [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] as well as [[sodium oxide|soda]]”; the lead oxide would help reduce the [[coefficient of thermal expansion|thermal expansion coefficient]] of the ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic analysis reveals that the material that has been labeled “frit” is “interstitial glass” which serves to connect the quartz particles.&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 120, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael S. Tite argues that this glass was added as frit and that the interstitial glass formed on firing.&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th century saw the finest period of the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] of Valencia, produced by largely Muslim potters in a Christian kingdom, though the southern industry centred on Málaga had ended by the mid-century.  Persian pottery under the [[Safavid dynasty]] (from 1502) was also heavily influenced by Chinese blue and white porcelain, which to a large extent replaced it in court circles; fine 16th-century Persian pieces are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Mitchell, p. 262, no. 395&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Islamic parts of [[Southeast Asia]], modern [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], were export markets that were close at hand for the Chinese and later the Japanese, helped by the European trading companies, especially the [[Dutch East India Company]].  The Buddhist countries of the region also exported.  Special types of wares were developed for them, such as the Chinese [[Kraak ware]] and [[Swatow ware]], mostly producing large dishes for serving communally to a table. In the face of such competion, local wares were few and simple.   

The Islamic world as a whole never managed to develop [[porcelain]], but had an avid appetite for imports of it.  East Asian porcelain, first Chinese then [[Japanese export porcelain]] in the 17th century, was joined in the 18th century by the wares from Europe, in particular [[Vienna porcelain]], which specialized in the Eastern market, and by the latter part of the century was sending as many as 120,000 pieces per year to the [[Ottoman Empire]], many small cups and saucers for [[Turkish coffee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', p. 96, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The smaller scale factories of the Islamic world could not compete with the sophisticated imports arriving from both east and west, and local production became a craft affair, repeating now-traditional patterns.

==Study of Islamic pottery==
Arthur Lane produced two books which made substantial contribution to understanding the history and merit of Muslim ceramics.  The first book was dedicated to the study of early ceramics from the [[Abbasid]] period till the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] times, sketching the various events which played a significant role in the rise and fall of particular styles.  In his second work, Lane used the same rhetorical style adopted in the first book, this time devoting his attention to later periods from the Mongols to nineteenth-century [[İznik pottery|İznik]] and Persian pottery.

Following Lane's works, numerous studies appeared. The most comprehensive works adopting a general view are those by [[R.L. Hobson]], [[Ernst J. Grube]], [[Richard Ettinghausen]], and more recently [[Alan Caiger-Smith]] and [[Gesa Febervari]].  Additional contributions were made by those specializing in particular temporal or regional history of Muslim pottery such as [[Georges Marcais]] in his work on North Africa, [[Oliver Watson]] on Persia and [[J.R. Hallett]] on Abbasid Pottery.

==Architecture==
[[File:Aerial view of Bahubali, Gomateswara Jain temple, Karkala.jpg|thumb|Jain Tirtha, [[Shravanabelagola]] ]]
Jain temples are built with various architectural designs.&lt;ref&gt;Jain temples in India and around the world,Laxmi Mall Singhvi, Tarun Chopra, Himalayan Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Jain temples in North India are completely different from the Jain temples in South India, which in turn are quite different from Jain temples in West India.  There are two type of Jain temples:

* [[Shikhara|Shikar]]-bandhi Jain temple(one with the dome) and 
* [[Ghar Jain temple]] (Jain house temple without dome).

All shikar-bandhi Jain temples have many marble pillars which are carved beautifully with Demi god posture. There is always a main deity also known as mulnayak in each derasar. The main part of Jain temple is called "[[Garbhagriha|Gambhara]]" (Garbha Graha) in which there is the stone carved God idol. One is not supposed to enter the Gambhara without taking a bath and without wearing puja (worship) clothes.

A Jain temple which is older than 100 years and is known as a pilgrimage center is often termed a [[Tirtha (Jainism)|Tirtha]].

The main deity of a Jain temple is known as a ''mula nayak''.&lt;ref&gt;Jaina Iconography,
Volume 1 of Jaina-rūpa-maṇḍana, Umakant Premanand Shah, Abhinav Publications, 1987,p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[Manastambha]] (column of honor) is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples. It has four 'Moortis' i.e. stone figures of the main god of that temple. One facing each direction: North, East, South and West.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.pluralism.org/religion/jainism/introduction/tirthankaras&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etiquette==
There are some guidelines to follow when one is visiting a Jain temple:&lt;ref&gt;CultureShock! India: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette, Gitanjali Kolanad,
Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd, 2008 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;
*Before entering the temple, one should bathe and wear fresh washed clothes or some special puja (worship) clothes - while wearing these one must neither have eaten anything nor visited the washroom. However, drinking of water is permitted. 
*One should not take any footwear(including socks) inside the temple. Leather items like a belt, purse etc. are not allowed inside the temple premises.
*One should not be chewing any edibles (food, gum, mints, etc.), and no edibles should be stuck in the mouth.
* One should try to keep as silent as possible inside temple.
* Mobile phones should not be used in the temple. One should keep them switched off.

Prevailing traditional customs should be followed regarding worshipping at the temple and touching an idol. They can vary depending on the region and the specific sect.

{{Jainism}}
Archaeological evidence shows Jainism was a significant religion in Bengal during the early historic period.&lt;ref&gt;Bibliography PC Bagchi, 'Development of Religious Ideas' in RC Majumdar (ed), History of Bengal, Vol-1, Dacca, 1968 (2nd edn);&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sarak==
{{Main|Sarak}}
Saraks are a Jain community in [[Bihar]], [[Bengal]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and [[Jharkhand]]. They have been followers of [[Jainism]] since ancient times; however, they were isolated and separated from the main body of the [[Jain community]] in western, northern and southern India.

According to Ramesh Chandra Majumder, the Jain scholar [[Bhadrabahu]], the second Louhacharya and the author of Kalpa Sutra may have come from the Sarak community.&lt;ref name="kundu"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bangali Hindu Jati Parichay |trans-title=An Introduction of Bengali Hindu Castes |language=Bengali |last=Kundu |first=Santosh Kumar |year=2008 |publisher=Presidency Library |location=Kolkata |isbn=978-81-89466-13-8 |pages=273–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saraks were agriculturists and moneylenders having landed properties.

They have continued to remain [[Jain vegetarianism|vegetarian]] even though this practice is uncommon among other communities in the region. Saraks have [[Parshva]] as a favored patron and recite the [[Namokar Mantra|Ṇamōkāra mantra]]. The 24th [[Tirthankara]] [[Mahavira]] visited this region according to the [[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpa Sūtra]].

The Saraks lost contact with Jains in the rest of India after its conquest by [[Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji]]. Contact with the Digambara [[Jainism in Bundelkhand|Bundelkhand Jains]] was reestablished when the [[Parwar (Jain)|Parwars]] Manju Chaudhary (1720–1785) was appointed the governor of [[Cuttack]] by the [[Maratha Empire]]. 

In 2009, more than 165 Sarak Jains living in parts of West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand visited the ancient Jain pilgrimage center of [[Shravanabelagola]]. A special function to welcome the Sarak Jains was organised at Shravanabelagola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/News/2009/09-Sept/02_News_Updates_001.htm |title=&gt; News Updates |publisher=Www.Jainheritagecentres.Com |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223043115/http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/News/2009/09-Sept/02_News_Updates_001.htm |archivedate=23 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Keir Baxter''' (29 June 1926 – 22 October 1972) was a [[New Zealand]] poet and playwright. He was also known as an activist for the preservation of [[Maori people|Māori]] culture.

==Biography==
[[File:Māori Jesus at Te Papa.JPG|thumb|A casting in concrete of "The Māori Jesus", a poem by Baxter]]
Baxter was born in [[Dunedin]]&lt;ref Name="Car"&gt;[http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?owner_id=914 Carcanet profile]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Archibald Baxter]] and [[Millicent Baxter|Millicent Brown]] and grew up near [[Brighton, New Zealand|Brighton]], 20&amp;nbsp;km south of Dunedin city. He was named after [[Keir Hardie|James Keir Hardie]], a founder of the [[British Labour Party]]. His father had been a [[conscientious objector]] during the [[First World War]]. His mother had studied Latin, French and German at the [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney]], the [[University of Sydney]] and [[Newnham College]], University of Cambridge.

On his first day of school, Baxter burned his hand on a stove and later used this incident to represent the failure of institutional education. As a child he contrasted the social order represented by [[John Macmillan Brown|his maternal grandfather]] with the clan mentality of his Scottish father and frequently drew analogies between the [[Highland clans]] and the [[iwi|Māori tribes]]. Baxter stated that he began writing poetry at the age of seven, and he accumulated a large body of technically accomplished work both before and during his teenage years.

In 1944, at age eighteen he joined the [[University of Otago]]&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt;and that year he published his first collection of poetry, ''Beyond the Palisade'',&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt; to much critical acclaim. His work during this time was, as with his contemporary compatriots, most notably the experimental novelist [[Janet Frame]], largely influenced by the modernist works of [[Dylan Thomas]]. He was a member of the so-called "[[Wellington Group]]" of writers that also included [[Louis Johnson (poet)|Louis Johnson]], [[W.H. Oliver]] and [[Alistair Campbell (poet)|Alistair Campbell]]. Baxter typically wrote short lyrical poems or cycles of the same rather than longer poems; he failed to complete his course work at the [[University of Otago]], due to increasing [[alcoholism]]&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt; and was forced to take a range of odd jobs from 1945-7,&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt; most notably a cleaner at [[Chelsea Sugar Refinery]], which inspired the poem "Ballad of the Stonegut Sugar Works".

In 1948 he married [[Jacqueline Sturm]], and his interest in Christianity culminated in his joining the [[Anglican church]] during that same year.&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt; In February 1951 Baxter enrolled at [[Wellington Teachers’ College]]. In 1952 his son, John, was born and a selection of poems in a collaborative volume, ''Poems unpleasant'', was published. Having completed his course at the teachers’ college in December, Baxter spent 1953 in full-time study at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] College and published his third major collection, ''The fallen house''.&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt; In 1954 he was appointed assistant master at Epuni School, [[Lower Hutt]] and during that time joined [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], being deeply inspired by its principles.&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt; He received a BA in 1956.

By 1955 he had garnered a substantial legacy and could afford a comfortable house in [[Ngaio, New Zealand|Ngaio]], Wellington. He left Epuni School early in 1956 to write and edit primary school bulletins for the [[Department of Education (New Zealand)|Department of Education’s]] School Publications Branch. This period is likely to have influenced his writing providing material for numerous attacks on bureaucracy. In 1957 Baxter took a course in [[Roman Catholic]]ism, and his collection of poems ''In Fires of No Return'', published in 1958, was influenced by his new faith. This was his first work to be published internationally, though English critics were largely nonplussed. His wife, a committed Anglican, was dismayed by his Catholicism, and they divorced in 1957. Through the late 50s and 60s Baxter visited the [[Southern Star Abbey]] a [[Cistercian]] monastery at [[Kopua]] near [[Central Hawke's Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Matthews (classicist)|Matthews, Richard]] (1995) James K. Baxter and Kopua, Journal of New Zealand Literature: JNZL, No. 13, pp. 257–265&lt;/ref&gt; He was received into the Catholic church in 1958.&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt;

In the same year, Baxter received a [[UNESCO]] stipend and began an extended journey through Asia, and especially [[India]], where [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s university [[Shantiniketan]] was one of the inspirations for Baxter's later community at Jerusalem. Here he was reconciled with his wife and contracted [[dysentery]]. His writing after returning from India was more overtly critical of New Zealand society.&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt; In the 1960s he became a powerful and prolific writer of both poems and drama, and it was through his radio play ''Jack Winter's dream'' that he became internationally known.

The first half of the 1960s saw Baxter struggling to make ends meet on his postman's wage, having refused to take work as a schoolmaster. However, it was at this time that the collection of poems ''Pig Island Letters'' was published in which his writing found a new level of clarity. In 1966, Baxter took up the [[Robert Burns Fellowship]] at the [[University of Otago]].&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt;

In 1968 Baxter claimed that he had been instructed in a dream to 'Go to Jerusalem'. [[Jerusalem, New Zealand]] was a small Māori settlement (known by its Māori transliteration, Hiruharama) on the [[Whanganui River]]. He left his University position and a job composing catechetical material for the [[Roman Catholicism in New Zealand#Education|Catholic Education Board]], with nothing but a bible. This was the culmination of a short period in which he struggled with family life and his vocation as a poet.

Baxter spent some time in [[Grafton, New Zealand|Grafton]], [[Auckland]] where he set up a centre for drug addicts,&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt; acting on the same principles as Alcoholics Anonymous. In 1969 he adopted the Māori version of his name, Hemi, and moved to Jerusalem. He lived a sparse existence and made frequent trips to the nearby cities where he worked with the poor and spoke out against what he perceived as a social order that sanctions poverty. His poems of this time have a conversational style but speak strongly of his social and political convictions.

The harsh deprivations Baxter adopted at this time took their toll on his health. By 1972 he was too ill to continue living at Jerusalem and moved to a [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] near [[Auckland]]. On 22 October 1972 he suffered a [[coronary thrombosis]] in the street and died in a nearby house, aged 46. He was buried at Jerusalem on Māori land in front of "the Top House" where he had lived, in a ceremony combining Māori and Catholic traditions.&lt;ref Name="Car"/&gt;

==Work==
In his critical study ''Lives of the Poets'', [[Michael Schmidt (poet)|Michael Schmidt]] defines Baxter's 'Jacobean consonantal rhetoric'.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', p 833, [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]], 2007, {{ISBN|9780297840145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt has claimed that Baxter was 'one of the most precocious poets of the century' whose neglect outside of New Zealand is baffling.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', page 835. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His writing was affected by his alcoholism. His work drew upon Dylan Thomas and [[Yeats]]; then on [[Louis MacNeice|MacNeice]] and [[Robert Lowell|Lowell]]. Michael Schmidt identifies 'an amalgam of [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], Thomas and native [[atavisms]]' in Baxter's ''Prelude N.Z.''.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Michael: ''Lives of the Poets'', p 836. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jimmy Lee Swaggart''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|æ|g|ər|t}}; born March 15, 1935) is an American [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[evangelism|evangelist]].

Swaggart's TV ministry, which began in 1971, has a viewing audience both in the U.S. and internationally. The weekly ''Jimmy Swaggart Telecast'' and ''A Study in the Word'' programs are broadcast throughout the U.S. and on 78 channels in 104 other countries, and over the Internet.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.jsm.org/jimmy-swaggart.html About Jimmy Swaggart Ministries] jsm.com. Retrieved July 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At its height in the 1980s, his telecast was transmitted to over 3,000 stations and cable systems each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsm.org |title=Jimmy Swaggart Ministries |publisher=Jsm.org |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently owns and operates the SonLife Broadcasting Network.

Sexual scandals with prostitutes in the late 1980s and early 1990s led the [[Assemblies of God USA|Assemblies of God]] to [[defrock]] him. As a result of the scandals, Swaggart temporarily stepped down as the head of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of American religion and politics |last=Djupe |first=Paul A. |author2=Olson, Laura R. |year=2008 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=978-0-8160-7555-3 |page=430 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frt7RDOT1PUC&amp;pg=PA430&amp;dq=jimmy+swaggart+prostitute#v=onepage&amp;q=jimmy%20swaggart%20prostitute&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jimmy Lee Swaggart was born on March 15, 1935, in [[Ferriday, Louisiana]]. By relation, he is the nephew of Arilla ({{nee}} Swaggart) Wells (1916&amp;ndash;2015), who was also the manager of Wells Grocery in [[Tunica, Louisiana]]. He is the cousin of [[rock'n'roll]] pioneer [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[country music]] star [[Mickey Gilley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unconqueredthebook.com/ ''Unconquered: The Saga of Cousins Jerry Lee Lewis, Jimmy Swaggart, and Mickey Gilley''] 488 pages Brown Books Publishing Group (May 1, 2012), English {{ISBN|978-1612540412}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a sister, Jeanette Ensminger (1942&amp;ndash;1999). With his parents, Swaggart attended a small, 25-member Assemblies of God church in Ferriday. In 1952, aged 17, Swaggart married 15-year-old Frances Anderson whom he met in church while he was playing music with his father. They have a son named Donnie. Swaggart worked several part-time odd jobs in order to support his young family and also began singing [[Southern Gospel]] music at various churches.

According to his [[autobiography]], Swaggart, along with his wife and son, lived in poverty during the 1950s as he preached throughout rural [[Louisiana]], struggling to survive on US$30 a week (Approximately $250 adjusted for inflation to 2016). Being too poor to own a home, the Swaggarts lived in church basements, pastors' homes, and small motels. [[Sun Records]] producer [[Sam Phillips]] wanted to start a [[Gospel music|gospel]] line of music for the label (undoubtedly to remain in competition with [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], who also had gospel lines at the time) and wanted Swaggart for Sun as the label's first gospel artist. Swaggart's cousin [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], who had previously signed with Sun, was reportedly making $20,000 per week at the time. Although the offer meant a promise for significant income for him and his family, Swaggart turned Phillips down, stating that he was called to preach the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To cross a river|year=1984|publisher=Jimmy Swaggart Ministries|location=Baton Rouge, La.|isbn=978-0-88270-221-6|author=Jimmy Swaggart|edition=3rd|author2=Robert Paul Lamb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ordination and early career==
Preaching from a flatbed trailer donated to him, Swaggart began full-time evangelistic work in 1955. He began developing a revival-meeting following throughout the American South.  In 1960, he began recording gospel music record albums and transmitting on Christian radio stations. In 1961, Swaggart was ordained by the Assemblies of God; a year later he began his radio ministry. In the late 1960s, Swaggart founded what was then a small church named the Family Worship Center in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]; the church eventually became district-affiliated with the Assemblies of God.

In the late 1960s Swaggart began transmitting a weekly 30-minute telecast over various local television stations in Baton Rouge and also purchased a local AM radio station, WLUX (now [[WPFC (AM)|WPFC]]). The station broadcast Christian feature stories, preaching and teaching from various [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] and Pentecostal denominations and played [[Traditional black gospel|black gospel]], [[Southern gospel]], and inspirational music. As [[Contemporary Christian music]] became more prevalent, the station avoided playing it. Swaggart sold many of his radio stations gradually throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries still operates several radio stations that operate under the name Sonlife Radio.

==Shifting to television==
By 1975, Swaggart's television ministry had expanded to more stations around the U.S., and he started using television as his primary preaching forum. In 1978 Swaggart's weekly telecast was increased to an hour.

In 1980, Swaggart began a daily weekday telecast featuring Bible study and music, and the weekend, hour-long telecast included a service from either Family Worship Center (Swaggart's church) or an on-location crusade in a major city. In the early 1980s Swaggart's broadcasts expanded to major cities nationwide. By 1983, more than 250 television stations broadcast Swaggart's telecast.

==Prostitution scandals==
In 1988, Swaggart was implicated in a [[sex scandal]] involving a [[prostitute]] that resulted initially in his suspension, and ultimately [[defrocked|defrocking]], by the Assemblies of God. Three years later Swaggart was implicated in another scandal involving a prostitute. As a result, Swaggart's ministry became non-affiliated, non-denominational and significantly smaller than it was in the ministry's pre-scandal years.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaufman"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Fall of Jimmy Swaggart|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20098413,00.html|date=March 7, 1988|first=Joanne|last=Kaufman|work=People|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
Swaggart's exposure came as retaliation for an incident in 1986 when Swaggart exposed fellow Assemblies of God minister Marvin Gorman, who had been accused of having several affairs. Once exposed, Gorman was defrocked from the Assemblies of God, his ministry all but ended. As a retaliatory move, Gorman hired his son Randy and son-in-law Garland Bilbo to stake out the [[Travel Inn]] on [[Airline Highway]] in Baton Rouge. A camera with a [[telephoto lens]] was placed in the window of the motel's Room 12, and was draped with a black cloth. When Swaggart arrived, he reportedly went into Room 7. Randy Gorman and Garland Bilbo let the air out of the tires on Swaggart's vehicle. They called Marvin Gorman, whose church was located nearby. Randy Gorman and Garland Bilbo had taken photos of Swaggart outside Room 7 with Debra Murphree,&lt;ref name="Kaufman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Scandal Spurs Interest In Swaggart Finances |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/us/scandal-spurs-interest-in-swaggart-finances.html| date=February 25, 1988 | first=Peter |last=Applebome|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a local prostitute. Gorman arrived at the Travel Inn a short while later and asked Swaggart what he was doing there.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

According to ''Swaggart: The Unauthorized Biography of an American Evangelist,'' by Ann Rowe Seaman, Gorman secured a promise from Swaggart that he would publicly apologize to Gorman and start the process of Gorman's reinstatement to the Assemblies of God. &lt;!-- [commented out private detective- it was his son in law] --&gt; &lt;!-- [commented out "and took pictures of the tryst- he took pictures of Swaggart outside the hotel room] --&gt; Gorman offered to remain silent if Swaggart would state publicly that he lied about Gorman's affairs. Gorman waited almost a year, then hand-delivered a note to Swaggart informing him his time was up; Swaggart did not respond. On February 16, 1988, Gorman contacted James Hamil, one of the 13-man Executive Presbytery of the Assemblies of God, who called Raymond Carlson, the Assemblies Superintendent. Carlson summoned Hamill and Gorman to fly to Assemblies of God headquarters in [[Springfield, Missouri]] and arranged for an emergency meeting of the presbyters. He was shown photos of several men coming in and going out of Room 7 at the Travel Inn Motel in New Orleans. This was done to establish that the room was being used for prostitution. One of the men seen leaving Room 7 was Swaggart.&lt;!-- [commented out "he, Gorman presented Swaggart with the photos in a blackmail attempt to force Swaggart to come clean, but Swaggart refused" it is not a true statement] --&gt; The presbytery leadership of the Assemblies of God decided that Swaggart should be suspended from broadcasting his television program for three months.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

According to the [[Associated Press]], Murphree, who claimed to have posed nude for Swaggart, failed a [[polygraph test]] administered by a [[New York City Police Department]] polygraph expert.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'', February 27, 1988.{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test administrator concluded that Murphree had failed to tell the truth on all key questions concerning her statement. The test was administered after Murphree offered to sell the story to the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' for $100,000. Paul Levy, senior editor for the ''Enquirer'', stated that the polygraph examiner had concluded Murphree was not truthful on six key questions, including one in which she was reportedly asked if she had fabricated the story. Levy stated that the ''Enquirer'' decided not to print her story due to the test results, her drug use, and the fact that she had arrest warrants in three states. Murphree failed questions about whether she was paid or promised money to "set up" Swaggart, and whether she made up the story in order to make money from it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Toronto Star]]'', February 27, 1988.{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both times she answered no; according to the polygraph examiner, her answers were untrue.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Swaggart's confession and defrocking ===
On February 21, 1988, without giving any details regarding his transgressions, Swaggart gave his now-infamous "I have sinned" speech. He tearfully spoke to his family, congregation, TV audience, and finally said "I have sinned against You, my Lord, and I would ask that Your Precious Blood would wash and cleanse every stain until it is in the seas of God's forgetfulness, not to be remembered against me anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jswaggartapologysermon.html |title=Reverend Jimmy Swaggart: Apology Sermon |accessdate=January 25, 2007 |last=Swaggart |first=Jimmy |work=americanrhetoric.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Louisiana]] presbytery of the Assemblies of God initially suspended Swaggart from the ministry for three months. The national presbytery of the Assemblies of God soon extended the suspension to their standard two-year suspension for sexual immorality. His return to the pulpit coincided with the end of a three-month suspension originally ordered by the Assemblies. Believing that Swaggart was not genuinely repentant in submitting to their authority, the hierarchy of the Assemblies of God immediately defrocked him, removing his credentials and ministerial license.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Swaggart then became an independent non-denominational Pentecostal minister, establishing Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, based in the Family Worship Center in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and the Sonlife Broadcasting Network (SBN) can be seen in the United States, as well as many other countries across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsm.org/family-worship-center.html|title=Family Worship Center - Jimmy Swaggart Ministries - Baton Rouge|first=JSM Web|last=Dept.|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991 scandal===
On October 11, 1991, Swaggart was found in the company of a prostitute for a second time. He was pulled over by a police officer in [[Indio, California]], for driving on the wrong side of the road. With him in the vehicle was a woman named Rosemary Garcia. According to Garcia, Swaggart had stopped to proposition her on the side of the road. She later told reporters, "He asked me for sex. I mean, that's why he stopped me. That's what I do. I'm a prostitute."&lt;ref name=stepdown&gt;{{cite news | title=Swaggart Plans to Step Down | date=October 15, 1991 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DA1E3BF936A25753C1A967958260 | work =The New York Times | accessdate =January 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, rather than confessing to his congregation, Swaggart told those at Family Worship Center, "The Lord told me it's flat none of your business."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974120,00.html "Scandals: No Apologies This Time"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. October 28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Swaggart's son Donnie then announced to the stunned audience that his father would be temporarily stepping down as head of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries for "a time of healing and counseling."&lt;ref name=stepdown/&gt;

===Radio===
Swaggart started SonLife Radio on the noncommercial [[FM band]]. Unlike his previous stations, SonLife was commercial-free and did not sell time to outside ministries; the preaching and teaching were all produced in-house. The music played was primarily [[Southern Gospel]]. SonLife Radio can be received in 22 U.S. states and is streamed on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonlifetv.com/sonlife-radio/station-list |title=SonLife station list |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502185329/http://sonlifetv.com/sonlife-radio/station-list/ |archivedate=2012-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some controversy arose concerning the ministry raising money for stations that were never built.

===Television===
{{BLP sources section|date=April 2017}}
In 1973, Swaggart proposed to television producers in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] a television program including a fairly large music segment, a short sermon, and time for talking about current ministry projects, after two faltering attempts to tape the half-hour program in Baton Rouge and New Orleans. They accepted, and within weeks the ''Jimmy Swaggart Telecast'' was being broadcast around the United States.

In 1981, Swaggart launched a daily television program titled ''A Study in the Word''. From the beginning, the primary cable channels the program was aired on were [[CBN Cable]] (now [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]]), [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]], and the old [[PTL Satellite Network|PTL Network]] (now [[INSP (TV network)|the Inspiration Network]]).

In 2010, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries launched a 24 hour-a-day television network entitled the Sonlife Broadcasting Network (SBN), on [[DirecTV]] channel 344, [[Dish Network]] channel 257, [[Glorystar]] channel 125, AT&amp;T U-verse, Verizon Fios, and various cable TV providers and broadcast stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonlifetv.com|title=Sonlife Broadcasting Network|publisher=SonLife Broadcasting Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SBN is available in the U.S. through Free To Air (FTA) satellite television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat.com/Galaxy-19.html |title=Galaxy 19 at 97.0°W |publisher=LyngSat |accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyngsat.com/tvchannels/us/SonLife-Broadcasting-Network.html |title=SonLife Broadcasting Network |publisher=LyngSat |accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonlifetv.com/sbn-tv-listing/satellites/ |title=Satellites &amp;#124; SonLife Broadcasting Network |publisher=Sonlifetv.com |accessdate=2013-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411090008/http://sonlifetv.com/sbn-tv-listing/satellites/ |archivedate=2013-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also available in Australia and New Zealand.

SBN is also available 24 hours a day in the United Kingdom on [[Sky UK|SKY]] (Channel 593), [[Freesat]] (Channel 695) and [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] (Channel 239)

===Jimmy Swaggart Bible College===
In autumn 1984, Swaggart opened Jimmy Swaggart Bible College ("JSBC"). The college originally provided education and communication degrees. It flourished during the 1980s, reaching an enrollment of 1,450 students in the fall of 1987.    

JSBC enrollment dropped drastically in 1988 when students left as a result of Swaggart's scandal with Debra Murphree, followed by accreditation issues. In 1988 the enrollment at the Bible college was projected to drop 72% that year but the school was planning to proceed with plans to open a theological seminary. Enrollment in August 1988 was projected to be about 400 students, compared to 1,451 students last year in 1987. The estimate was based on the number of students who had registered and the inquiries from potential students.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-23/local/me-6426_1_jimmy-swaggart-bible-college&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1988 the college dormitories were re-branded and listed as apartments.

In 1991, after Swaggart was found in the presence of a prostitute in California, JSBC was renamed to World Evangelism Bible College and enrollment dropped to 370 students. The college shut down programs in music, physical education, secretarial science, and communications that October and disbanded its basketball team.   

Presently,{{when|date=July 2018}} JSBC offers short term certificate programs, Associate of Arts degree programs, and a four-year [[Bachelor's degree]] program.

The College is not [[Accreditation|accredited]] but is currently seeking accreditation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jsbc.edu/faq.html|title=F.A.Q's |publisher=Jimmy Swaggart Bible College and Seminary |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Print===
Swaggart has written about 20 Christian books offered through his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/list/268010.Jimmy_Swaggart |title=Books by Jimmy Swaggart (Author of The Expositor's Study Bible KJVersion/Concordance) |publisher=Goodreads.com |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of the ''Expositor's Study Bible'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swaggart |first=Jimmy |url=https://www.amazon.com/Expositors-Study-Bible-KJVersion-Concordance/dp/0976953005 |title=The Expositor's Study Bible KJVersion/Concordance|publisher=Jimmy Swaggart Ministries |date=August 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 15, 2012|isbn=9780976953005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 13 study guides and 38 commentaries on the Bible. The ministry also publishes a monthly magazine, ''The Evangelist''.

==Family==
Since October 10, 1952, Swaggart has been married to Frances Swaggart ({{née}} Anderson) (born August 9, 1937). They have one son, Donnie (born October 18, 1954), named after Jimmy Swaggart's brother who died in infancy. He has three grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

The '''Kachikally crocodile pool''' is located in the heart of [[Bakau]], [[Gambia]], about 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) from the capital [[Banjul]]. It is one of three sacred [[crocodile]] pools used as sites for fertility rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncac.gm/other.html Historic and Sacred Sites in Gambia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311090829/http://www.ncac.gm/other.html |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The others are Folonko in Kombo South and Berending on the north bank.

== Ownership ==
Kachikally is a privately owned shrine belonging to the Bojang family of Bakau, one of the founding families and major land owners of the city.
Kachikally is also the name of the central district of Bakau town; other districts are Sanchaba and New Town.

== Crocodiles ==
[[Image:At the crocodile p galleryfull.jpg|thumb|Visitors are able to touch the crocodiles]]
The exact number of crocodiles is not known but it is estimated that there are about 80.  All the animals are [[Nile crocodile]]s which can grow to 4.5 metres and live as long as a man. There have been reports of the presence of albino crocodiles, adding to the uniqueness of the place. Perhaps the most famous crocodile was Charlie, who like all other crocodiles was allowed to roam freely, and can be approached and touched by visitors. Crocodiles found in the wild are sometimes taken to and reared at the holy pools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14759">The '''Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople''' was an office established as a result of the [[Fourth Crusade]] and its [[Sack of Constantinople (1204)|conquest of Constantinople]] in 1204. It was a [[Roman Catholic]] replacement for the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], and remained in the city until the [[reconquest of Constantinople]] by the Byzantines in 1261, whereupon it became a [[titular see]]. The office was finally abolished in 1964.

==History==
Before the [[East–West Schism]] in 1054, the Christian Church within the borders of the ancient [[Roman Empire]] was effectively ruled by five [[patriarch]]s (the "[[Pentarchy (Christianity)|Pentarchy]]"): In descending order of precedence:  [[Rome]] by the [[Bishop of Rome]] (who rarely used the title "Patriarch") and those of [[Constantinople]], [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], and [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]].

In the West the Bishop of Rome was recognized as having superiority over the other Patriarchs, while in the East, the Patriarch of Constantinople gradually came to occupy a leading position. In the East the Pope was generally considered first among equals, but not a direct superior.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The sees of Rome and Constantinople were often at odds with one another, just as the Greek and Latin Churches as a whole were often at odds both politically and in things ecclesiastical. There were complex cultural currents underlying these difficulties, including the fact that in the West feudal models began to influence the way of viewing relations within the Church.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The tensions led in 1054 to a serious rupture between the [[Greek East and Latin West]] called the [[East–West Schism]], which while not in many places absolute, still dominates the ecclesiastical landscape.

In 1204, the [[Fourth Crusade]] invaded, seized and sacked Constantinople, and established the [[Latin Empire]]. This was not the doing of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope. Initially he spoke out against the fourth crusade.  In writing to his legate the pope said, in part "How, indeed, is the Greek church to be brought back into ecclesiastical union and to a devotion for the Apostolic See when she has been beset with so many afflictions and persecutions that she sees in the Latins only an example of perdition and the works of darkness, so that she now, and with reason, detests the Latins more than dogs?"&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, J., (2009) Holy Warriors: A Modern History of the Crusades (Vintage Books; London), p195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pope Innocent III - ''To Peter, Cardinal Priest of the Title of St. Marcellus, Legate of the Apostolic See.'' However, on the way to attack Constantinople the crusaders attacked another Christian city, Zara, and received papal absolution for this. de Villehardouin, G., (1908) ''Memoirs or Chronicle of The Fourth Crusade and The Conquest of Constantinople'' (J.M. Dent; London), p26.
&lt;/ref&gt; However the popes accepted the acts of the accompanying Catholic clergy who set up a patriarchate subservient in the Western manner to the Pope, in similar manner to what had already occurred in the [[Crusader states]] of the [[Holy Land]]. The pope recognised these "[[Latins (Middle Ages)|Latin]]" sees at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]]. Furthermore, those Orthodox bishops left in their place were made to swear an oath of allegiance to the pope.&lt;ref&gt;Papadakis, A., (1994) ''The Christian East and the Rise of the Papacy'', (St Vladimir’s Seminary Press; Crestwood, NY), p204.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the last [[Baldwin II, Latin Emperor|Latin emperor Baldwin II]] fled from Constantinople  he was well received in Rome by [[Pope Urban IV]] who promised him support to regain the throne. This threat of continued support prompted the new Greek emperor to seek out a reunion. Understanding the situation of 1204 helps with the context of the reunion council.&lt;ref&gt;Herrin, J., (2007) ''Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a  Medieval Empire'' (Princeton University Press; Princeton, NJ), pp. 300–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

By establishing communion with the Latin Patriarchs the Papacy in effect made official their position within the Roman Catholic Church. This act was part of a more general picture in which the Crusaders on the one hand established [[Crusader states|Latin Kingdoms]] officially acknowledged by the Roman Catholic Church, in the Middle East and in Greece and the Greek Islands, and also in parts of the Balkans. Included were a similar array of Latin episcopal sees.

However, the Latin Empire in Constantinople was eventually defeated and dispossessed by a resurgent [[Byzantium]] in 1261, and yet the Latin Patriarchate persisted as a [[titular see|titular]] office with varying vigour.

On 8 February 1314, [[Pope Clement V]] united the Patriarchate with the episcopal see of Negroponte ([[Chalcis]]), hitherto a [[suffragan]] of the [[Latin Archbishopric of Athens]], so that the patriarchs could once more have a territorial diocese on Greek soil and exercise a direct role as the head of the Latin clergy in what remained of [[Latin Greece]].{{sfn|Loenertz|1966|pp=266–267}}

For a time, like many ecclesiastical offices in the West, it had rival contenders who were supporters or protégés of the rival popes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} As to the title Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, this was the case at least from 1378 to 1423. Thereafter the office continued as an honorific title, during the later centuries attributed to a leading clergyman in Rome, until it ceased to be assigned after 1948 and was finally abolished in 1964.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

A [[Vicariate Apostolic of Istanbul]] (until 1990, Constantinople) has existed from 1742 into the present day.

'''Leon Golub''' (January 23, 1922 – August 8, 2004) was an American [[Painting|painter]]. He was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he also studied, receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1942, and his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] and [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1949 and 1950, respectively.

He was married to and collaborated with the artist [[Nancy Spero]] (1926 – October 18, 2009). Their son [[Stephen Golub]] is an economics professor at [[Swarthmore College]]. Their son Philip Golub is Professor of International and Comparative Politics at the American University of Paris and was a longstanding contributing editor of the influential journal ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''. Their youngest son Paul Golub is a theater director and acting teacher working in France.

== Early life ==
Born in Chicago in 1922, Golub received his B.A. in Art History from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1942. From 1947 to 1949 he studied under the [[G.I. Bill]] at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC). The student body included a large number of vets, including Golub’s one-time flatmate [[Cosmo Campoli]], [[George Cohen (artist)|George Cohen]], Theodore Halkin and [[Seymour Rosofsky|Seymour Rosofsky,]] whose work often reflected the horrors of war, as well as the uncertainties of the Cold War and Nuclear age.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;Corbett, John.

Golub helped organize and showed in the seminal Momentum Exhibitions of 1948–1949, put together by SAIC and [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design]] students in protest over their exclusion from the Art Institute’s prestigious "Annual Exhibition by Artists of Chicago and Vicinity."&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; He was also featured, along with Campoli, Halkin and Rosofsky, in the Art Institute’s "Veteran's Exhibition" of 1948.&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;Corbett, John and Jim Dempsey, Jessica Moss, and Richard A.

Westermann]], [[Irving Petlin]], Evelyn Statsinger, Don Baum, and [[Arthur Lerner]].&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;

In Chicago, Golub became involved with other artists collectively dubbed the "[[Chicago Imagists|Monster Roster]]" by critic Franz Schulze in the late 1950s, based on their affinity for sometimes gruesome, [[Expressionism|expressive figuration]], fantasy and mythology, and [[Existentialism|existential]] thought.&lt;ref name="MCA"&gt;Schulze, Franz. "Art in Chicago: The Two Traditions," in [https://www.amazon.com/Art-Chicago-1945-1995-Jeff-Abell/dp/050023728X ''Art in Chicago 1945-1995''], Museum of Contemporary Art, ed. Lynne Warren.

Retrieved March 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt; They believed that an observable connection to the external world and to actual events was essential if art was to have any relevance to the viewer or society. This is a view that informed Golub's work throughout his career.

Golub, and the group, gained notice in the 1950s when art historian and curator Peter Selz featured him, Campoli and Cohen in a 1955 ''ARTnews'' article, "Is There a New Chicago School?", and included him, Campoli and Westermann in the 1959 Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition, ''New Images of Man'', as examples of vanguard expressive figurative work in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="Adrian"&gt;Adrian, Dennis.

== Career ==
Golub, who always painted in a figural style, drew upon diverse representations of the body from ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, to photographs of athletic competitions, to gay pornography; often pulled directly from a huge database he assembled of journalistic images from the mass media. He likened his painting process to sculptural technique and employed a method of layering and scraping away paint, sometimes using a [[Cleaver (knife)|meat cleaver]], leaving varying amounts of canvas untouched.

From 1959 through 1964, Golub and his wife [[Nancy Spero]] opted to live in Europe, a move occasioned in part by the belief that Europe would be more receptive to their work dealing overtly with issues of power, sexual and political. During this period Golub's work increased in size because of larger available studio space and the inspiration of the French tradition of large-scale history painting. He also switched from using [[lacquer]] to [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]], left more of the surface unpainted, and began to grind the paint directly into the canvas. While in Italy, both Golub and Spero were profoundly influenced by the figurative works of [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] and [[Roman art]], whose narratives addressed ancient themes of power and violence.

When Golub returned to [[New York (state)|New York State]], the [[Vietnam War]] was escalating, and he responded with his two series: Napalm and Vietnam.  He and Spero became active with ''Artists and Writers Protest'', "the first such group to take a public stand against the war".&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Lester R, ''Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict'' Second Edition, Academic Press, 2008. {{ISBN|0123695031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967 as part of the group's ''Angry Arts Week'', Golub organized ''The Collage of Indignation'', a collaborative work by over 150 artists which he described as "not political art, but rather an expression of popular revulsion."&lt;ref&gt;Event, quote and source found in ''The Turning Point Art And Politics In 1968'' by Nina Castelli Sundell, 
Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, Cleveland, 1988. See:[http://www.lehman.edu/vpadvance/artgallery/gallery/turning_point/sundell.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Golub had a career breakthrough that same year when he was selected to exhibit five paintings at the Museum of Modern Art's "New Images of Man" show in New York City. His work was included alongside that of such established and rising artists as Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon and Jackson Pollock.

In the mid-1970s, Golub was beset with self-doubt. He destroyed or cut up many works he produced up to this period and nearly abandoned painting. In the late seventies, however, he produced more than a hundred portraits of public figures, among them political leaders, dictators, and religious figures. ''Leon Golub: Paintings, 1950-2000'' includes several portraits of [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[Ho Chi Minh]], along with images of [[Fidel Castro]], [[Francisco Franco]], [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Henry Kissinger]].

In the 1980s, Golub turned his attention to terrorism in a variety of forms, from the subversive operations of governments to urban street violence. Killing fields, torture chambers, bars, and brothels became inspiration and subject for work that dealt with such themes as violent aggression, racial inequality, gender ambiguity, oppression, and exclusion. Among the work produced in this period are the series ''Mercenaries'', ''Interrogation'', ''Riot'', and ''Horsing Around''.  His ''Interrogation II'' (1981; Art Institute of Chicago&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/100250 ''Interrogation II''] at the Art Institute of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;) is representative of the subject from this period and Golub's technique, "the canvas painted, scraped and repainted many times to create a tense, skinlike surface."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Gowing]], ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.2 (Facts on File, 2005): 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the nineties to his death, Golub's work shifted toward the illusionistic, with forms semi-visible, and appropriated graphic styles from ancient carvings, medieval manuscripts, and contemporary [[graffiti]]. As an older man he began to consider his own mortality, and moved toward themes of separation, loss, and death. Text appeared in many of the paintings combined with a series of symbolic references, including dogs, lions, skulls, and skeletons.

Golub's work was seen in solo exhibitions throughout the world, among them ''World Wide'' (1991), a Grand Lobby project at the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]]. For ''World Wide'' the artist created a process, repeated in exhibitions at several other museums, by which he enlarged images and details from his paintings and screened them on transparent sheets of vinyl, hung so that they surround the viewer. He was represented in many group exhibitions and was one of the few white artists included in ''Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art'' at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in 1994.

In 1996, Golub was given a commission to design a set of stained glass windows for [[Temple Sholom]] in [[Chicago]], the four windows depict the life of Joseph. These would be the only stained glass windows Leon Golub ever did. They were fabricated in New York by Victor Rothman and Gene Mallard.

== 2001: renaissance ==

While Leon Golub's later works from the 1990s offer more fragmented (in his words "left-over") reincarnations of his early messages, it is his larger, carved works, vividly depicting power relations that have re-gained attention with the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2003, Golub revisited his 1959 painting, ''Reclining Youth'', part of a series of paintings inspired by [[frieze]]s at the [[Pergamon Altar|Great Altar of Zeus]] in [[Pergamon]]. Working with [[Magnolia Editions]], the artist translated the painting into a large-scale [{{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}}] [[tapestry|Jacquard tapestry]], his first and only textile work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/Content/Golub/F00001.html Magnolia Editions - Leon Golub.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720113934/http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/Content/Golub/F00001.html |date=2008-07-20 }} Retrieved Nov. 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrospectives==

From March to May 2015 the [[Serpentine Gallery]] in London held a career retrospective&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Searle ''Leon Golub: Bite Your Tongue'' The Guardian. March 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; which was "spun off" and presented as a three-floor career retrospective at the Manhattan [[Hauser &amp; Wirth]] in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, Holland, ''Leon Golub’s ‘Riot’ Revisits Political Art With a Sense of the Absurd'' New York Times June 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''list of Lithuanian gods''' is reconstructed based on scarce written sources and late [[folklore]]. [[Christianization of Lithuania|Lithuania converted to Christianity]] in 1387, but elements of [[Lithuanian mythology]] survived into the 19th century. The earliest written sources, authored by foreigners and Christians, only briefly mention the Lithuanian gods. Beginning in the 16th century, the pagan religion received more attention from authors, but often their accounts were confused, contradictory, and heavily influenced by various religious agendas. Collection and recording of folklore began in the 19th century, by which time the pagan mythology had become fragmented and mixed with Christian traditions. The cults of old deities transformed into folklore (individual tales, myths, songs, etc.) without associated rituals. Because of such difficulties obtaining data, there is no accepted list of Lithuanian gods. Different authors present wildly contradictory reconstructions of the Lithuanian pantheon.

==Names from folklore myths and legends==
This section includes the names of gods, divine or demonic beings, and other personages from Lithuanian myths, legends, [[folklore]], and fairy-tales.

=== {{anchor|List of gods}} Gods ===
* '''[[Ašvieniai]]''', the divine twins who pulled the chariot of the Sun (the Vedic [[Ashvins|Ashwins]]).
*'''[[Aušrinė]]''', the Morning Star, a goddess, a daughter of the  God ("dievaitė"). She was the goddess of the morning. Alternatively her name is given as '''Aušra''' ("dawn"). (Usha in Vedic religion.)
*'''Auštaras''' (Auštra), the god of the northeast wind, who stands at the gates of [[paradise]] and lights the way for those going to paradise. His function of shining this beacon makes him similar to [[Aušrinė]]; some consider him to be her cousin.
*'''[[Bangpūtys]]''', the god of the seas and storms ––he is two-faced like the Roman god [[Janus]].
*'''[[Dalia (mythology)|Dalia]]''', goddess of fate and weaving.
*'''Deivės Valdytojos''' (Lithuanian: ''Governing Goddesses''), were the goddesses who made [[garment]]s from human's lives. They were seven sisters: Verpiančioji (who spun the threads of life), Metančioji (who threw rims of life), Audėja (the weaver), Gadintoja (who broke the thread), Sergėtoja (who scolded Gadintoja, and instigated war between people), Nukirpėja (who cut the cloth of life), and Išskalbėja (the laundress). They have similarities with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Moirai|Fates]] and the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Norns]]. Deivės Valdytojos were associated with [[Dalia (mythology)|Dalia]] and [[Laima]].
*'''[[Dievas (Lithuanian god)|Dievas]]''', ("God"), the supreme deity
*'''Dievas Senelis''' ("God Old Man"), a teacher of people and judge of their morality. He looks like an old traveling beggar. Dievas Senelis is proficient at magic and medicine. Epithet of Dievas.
*'''[[Gabija]]''', the foster of the Holy Fire, a goddess, a daughter of Dievas  ("dievaitė").
*'''[[Laima]]''', goddess of Fate and pregnant women.
*'''Mėnuo''', the Moon, a son of Dievas  ("dievaitis").
*'''[[Perkūnas]]''', the Thunder, the main god.  ("dievaitis") ([[Parjanya]]/[[Indra]] in Vedic religion).
*'''Praamžius''', Pramšans, Pramžimas,  Praamžimas, an [[epithet]] of Dievas (the chief god); probably of later literary origin.&lt;ref name="Mitologijos enciklopedija, 2 tomas"&gt;"Praamžius". [[Mitologijos enciklopedija]], vol. 2. Vilnius. Vaga. 1999. 291 p.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Saulė (Lithuanian mythology)|Saulė]]''', the Sun Goddess ([[Surya]] in Vedic religion)
*'''Vakarinė''', goddess of the Evening Star.
*'''[[Vėjopatis]]''', god of the wind and master of Dausos (paradise)
*'''[[Žemyna]]''', goddess, the deified soil (Zamin in Persian and Hindi for "land").
*'''Žvaigždės''' ([[Grammatical number|singular]]: '''žvaigždė'''), stars.[[Saulė (Lithuanian mythology)|Saulė (the sun)]] is their mother and sometimes{{definition|date=August 2015}} with the [[Moon]] as their father. One of the most important stars is [[Aušrinė]]. Other stars, Aušrinė's sisters, are less important, but they sometimes appear in mythic stories too. Especially notable ones are '''Vakarinė''' or '''Vakarė''' (the evening Venus, who makes the bed for [[Saulė (Lithuanian mythology)|Saulė]]), ''Indraja'' (Jupiter), ''Sėlija'' (Saturn), ''Žiezdrė'' (Mars), and ''Vaivora'' (Mercury).

===Heroes and heroines===
*'''Pajauta''', the legendary princess of [[Kernavė]]
*'''[[Jūratė and Kastytis]]''' are heroes of a Lithuanian legend, which subsequently became popular, mostly because of its modern poetic interpretation by [[Maironis]]. The queen of the amber palace [[Jūratė]] may be considered a manifestation of the goddess of Sea in this legend.

===Local and nature spirits===
*'''Ežerinis''', a spirit of lakes
*'''Javinė''', a household god who protects [[cereal|grain]] in [[Barn (building)|barn]]s.
*'''Jievaras''', a household spirit who protects grain. Sacrifices to Jievaras are made after the [[rye]] harvest. While cutting grain, women would leave a few grain tufts uncut, which would later be braided into plaits. They would also leave some [[bread and salt]] under the plait, and would say: ''Davei manei, Žemele, duodame ir tau'' ([You] gave for us, Mother Earth, we are giving for you too), a request for the land to continue to be fruitful.
*'''Kupolė''', the spirit of springtime vegetation and flowers. The Festival of Kupolė (Kupolinės) was associated with Feast of [[St. John the Baptist]] ([[Joninės]]). In this festival, women picked sacral herbs, danced and sang songs. Kupolinės is also known as [[Rasos (festival)|Rasos]]. Compare this with Ziedu [[Mahte|māte]] in [[Latvian mythology]], [[Kupala]] in [[Polish mythology]] and [[Ivan Kupala]] in [[Russian folklore|Russian mythology]]
*'''Laukų dvasios''' (spirits of fields), spirits, who were running through the fields. When crops in the fields waved in the wind, people saw them as being the actions of spirits. Laukų dvasios include Nuogalis, Kiškis (hare), Meška (bear), Lapė (fox), Katinas (tomcat), Bubis, Bubas, Bubė, [[Baubas]], Babaužis, Bobas, Maumas (bugaboo), Raudongalvis (red-headed), Raudongerklis (red-throated), Žaliaakis (green-eyed), Paplėštakis, Guda, Dizikas, Smauglys (boa), Ruginis (spirit of rye), Papiokė, Pypalas, Žebris, Arklys (horse), Vilkas (wolf).
*'''Upinis''', a spirit of rivers

===Various lower beings===
*'''Kaukas''', spirits similar to [[leprechaun]]s.
*'''[[Laumė]]''', a fairy-like female creature ([[pixie]]s). Described as white and blue as the sky itself. Good spirit, very friendly with the Earth and Nature gods. However, if anyone tried to use them, the punishment was severe.
*'''Nykštukas''', [[gnome]]s.
*'''Vėlės''', [[spirit]]s of dead human beings.

===Demonic beings===
*'''[[Aitvaras]]''', a household spirit bringing both good and bad luck
*'''Baubas''', an evil spirit with long lean arms, wrinkly fingers and red eyes. He harasses people and tears their hair or stifles them. To children, he is the equivalent of the [[boogeyman]] of the English-speaking countries. A misbehaving child could be told by the parents: "Behave, or '''baubas''' will come and get you". Also it could be described as a black and dark creature living under the carpet or in some dark spot of the house.
*'''Giltinė''' – goddess of death, also The Reaper. Other names include Kaulinyčia, Maras ([[black death]] or the Plague), Maro mergos, Kolera, Pavietrė, Kapinių žmogus.&lt;ref name=mirties&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.e-library.lt/resursai/Mokslai/KU/HTF_Baltu_kat/Etnine_kultura/4/Balsys.pdf| title=Prūsų ir lietuvių mirties (požemio, mirusiųjų) dievybės: nuo Patulo iki Kaulinyčios |first=Rimantas |last=Balsys |pages=27–51 |year=2005 |journal=Lietuvininkai ir lietuviai. Etninė kultūra |volume=IV|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sacred bird is the owl. Sometimes she was considered to be a sister of [[Laima]] (luck).
*'''Ragana''' is an old-looking female or witch. Mostly has dark intentions and powers to control forces of nature. They probably were old ladies living by the forest, having a good knowledge of plants and their use for medical and other purposes.
*'''Slogutis''' means pain, misery or nightmare. Also can mean fear or bad feelings.
*'''Pinčiukas''', devil, not the pure evil being of Christianity, but a trickster. Earlier - dweller or even god of bogs and marshes.
*'''Žiburinis''', a scary forest spirit that appears as a phosphorescent skeleton.

===Holy places and things===
*'''Dausos''' or '''Dangus''', the home of good souls. Dausos is on a high mountain ([[Latvian mythology|Latvian]] [[Latvian mythology#Other terms and concepts|Debeskalns]], or [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Valhalla]]), between two rivers. There are golden apple-trees in the Dausos garden. Day in the garden is perpetual but outside its confines is perpetual night. Master of Dausos is Vėjopatis (Lord of the wind) or Vėjas (Wind) who is also one of the oldest gods in Lithuanian mythology. Vėjas is identical to [[Vayu]] of [[Hinduism]]. Auštaras and Vėjopatis are keepers of Dausos’s gates (Dausų Vartai). While Auštaras shows the way for good souls, Vėjas (Vėjopatis) blows bad souls into oblivion.

==Names by written sources==

===Earliest Russian chronicles===
Some names from Lithuanian mythology are also found in Russian chronicles of the 13th century. These deities were secretly worshiped by [[King of Lithuania]] [[Mindaugas]] after his baptism. Russian chronicles are considered the best source of information about the ancient Lithuanian pantheon worshiped by nobles and the military.

*'''Sovijus''' in 13th-century Russian chronicles was a person who introduced the pagan custom of burning bodies after death, according to studies by [[Gintaras Beresnevičius]]. The mediaeval chronicles tell that this custom is very old and was called Sovica. Sovica was practicated not only by Lithuanians but also by other pagan tribes (Livonians, Estonians and others).
*'''Žvoruna''' (Zvoruna) was a [[euphemism]] for the hunting and forest goddess like Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. Her name is connected with wild animals. There was mentioned in chronicle that she is a bitch, it means that her [[zoomorphic]] shape is female dog.
*'''[[Medeina]]''' (Medeinė) is another euphemism of the hunting and forest goddess. Medeina also was mentioned in the 16th century by J. Lasicki. She was worshiped by King Mindaugas and represented military interest of warriors. 
*'''Teliavelis''' (Televelis) was a powerful smith who made the sun and threw it to the sky. This myth survived in folk tales in the beginning of the 20th century. Some scholars, like [[Kazimieras Buga|K. Būga]] tried to prove that Televelis is incorrectly written Kalvelis (smith diminutive in Lithuanian). Teliavelis has connections with Finnish [[Ilmarinen]].
*'''Andajus''' (Andajas, Andojas, etc.) was mentioned in medieval chronicles as the supreme deity. It may be euphemism for [[Dievas]]. It is mentioned in chronicle that warriors invoke Andajus in battle.
*'''Nonadievis''' (Nunadievis; etimologized by some scholars as Numadievis) is an incorrectly-written name of the supreme god or just another euphemism.
*'''Perkūnas''' was the god of thunder, one of the most powerful deities. Perkūnas survived in popular belief and folk tales till the 20th century.
*'''Diviriks''' is thought to be one of Perkūnas' euphemisms, meaning "leader of gods".

===Maciej Stryjkowski===
[[Maciej Stryjkowski]] (1547–1593) was a [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish–Lithuanian]] historian and author of ''Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all Russia''. In this work, Stryjkowski provided two lists of gods, one [[Old Prussia]]n and another Lithuanian. He listed 16 Lithuanian gods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tekstai.lt/index.php/zurnalas-metai/123-2006-nr-89-rugpjtisrugsjis/393-gintaras-beresneviius-m-strijkovskio-kronikos-lietuvi-diev-sraas-1.html| title=M.

#'''Prakorimas''' (Prokorimos) – the supreme deity. Stryjkowski elaborated that people used to sacrifice white cocks to Prakorimas. Their flesh was divided into three pieces: one for peasants, another for pagan priests (Lithuanian: ''žynys''), and a third for burning. Stryjkowski pointed out that Prakorimas was similar to the Prussian supreme god [[Okopirmas]].
#'''Rūgutis''' (Ruguczis) – god of fermentation and fermented foods

#'''Lietuvonis''' (Lituwanis) – god of rain
#'''Kauriraris''' (Chaurirari) – deity of war and warhorses. The name etymology is unclear. [[Vladimir Toporov]] suggested that it is derived from the Lithuanian word ''kaurai'' (fur), while [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]] argued it stems from ''karas'' (war).&lt;ref name=zirgas/&gt;

#'''Ganiklis''' (Goniglis Dziewos) – god of herds and shepherds

===Jan Łasicki===
[[Jan Łasicki]] (Lasicius) was a Polish Protestant activist. He wrote a treatise on [[idolatry]] ''About the gods of Samogitians, other Sarmatians, and false Christians'' (''De diis Samagitarum caeterorumque Sarmatarum et falsorum Christianorum'', written ca. 1582 and published in 1615). This 18-page treatise contained a lists of 76 Lithuanian gods with brief description of their functions. Łasicki obtained most of his information from Łaszkowski, a [[Szlachta|Polish lesser noble]] who worked as a royal land surveyor. The list contained very minor deities, representing everyday household items. Łasicki was also not intimately familiar with Lithuanian culture or language. Therefore, the academic opinion on the list ranges from a valuable resource to a practical joke designed to poke fun of [[Christian saints]] through an inverted mirror. Deities mentioned by Jan Łasicki were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Qs-vfVEwWAC&amp;pg=PA10 |title=De diis samagitarum libellus |first=Jan |last=Łasicki |authorlink=Jan Łasicki |pages=10–16 |year=1868 |location=Riga |publisher= J.

This section contains those names of Lithuanian and Prussian gods or other mythical beings that are mentioned in old treatises on history or philosophy, sometimes accompanied by brief descriptions, and which are known from a few independent sources or from their counterparts under different names in later collections of myths and tales.

*'''Dimstipatis''' (mentioned by Jokūbas Lavinskis), is a masculine deity ([[genius loci]]). It is a household god, the guardian of [[house]]s and caretaker of the hearth. People sacrificed [[rooster]]s and black hens to the deity. The birds were boiled; later people would gather around the kettle and eat the birds. The bones were burned. Sometimes Dimstipatis is reconstructed as a god of housewives, to whom pigs were [[sacrifice]]d. Dimstipatis was also seen as a power protecting from fires.&lt;ref name=laukpatis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1881">The '''Pharnacid Dynasty''' was an [[Iran]]ian dynasty that ruled the [[satrap]]y of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]] under the [[Achaemenid Dynasty]] of [[Persia]] from the 5th until the 4th century BCE. It was founded by [[Artabazos I of Phrygia|Artabazus]], son of satrap [[Pharnaces I of Phrygia|Pharnaces I]] (younger brother of [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]], who was born shortly before 565 BCE), son of [[Arsames]] (died ca. 520 BCE). They were directly related to the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] itself. The last member of the dynasty was [[Pharnabazus, son of Artabazus|Pharnabazus III]].

The residence of the Pharnacid Dynasty was at [[Dascylium]] (near modern-day Ergili, Turkey).

Rattanbai was the daughter of Lady Dina Petit and Sir Dinshaw Petit 2nd Baronet Petit, who in turn, was the son of [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]], a member of the [[Petit baronets|Petit family]] and the founder of the first cotton mills in India.

==Family and background==
{{See also|Petit baronets|l1=Petit family}} 	

Rattanbai Petit (often informally called "Ruttie") was born on 20 February 1900 in [[Bombay]], British India, into an extremely affluent and well-connected business family belonging to the [[Parsi]] community. She was the only daughter of businessman Sir Dinshaw Petit, the [[Petit baronets|second baronet of Petits]], and his wife Lady Dinabai Petit. Her paternal grandfather, [[Dinshaw Maneckji Petit]], the first baronet, had built some of the earliest cotton mills in India. Her brother, Fali, who became Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, 3rd Baronet, married [[Sylla Tata]], the sister of [[J. R. D. Tata]], would later become the longest serving chairman of the Tata Group, one of India's leading business conglomerates.

==Courtship and wedding==
{{See also|Jinnah family}}
[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], then 40, was only three years younger than Ruttie's father, and the two men were good friends. Jinnah was a frequent guest at Petit Hall, the sprawling seaside residence of the Petit family at the foot of [[Malabar Hill]] in Mumbai. It was in this setting that Ruttie and Jinnah became acquainted. Their romance, however, started in Darjeeling, while the two were thrown together on a vacation by her unsuspecting family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/deep-focus/How-Jinnah-lost-his-love-and-political-relevance/articleshow/47845905.cms|title=How Jinnah lost his love, and political relevance - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/others/sunday-read/jinnah-and-ruttie-life-love-and-lament/articleshow/57105149.cms|title=Jinnah and Ruttie: Life, love and lament - Mumbai Mirror -|work=Mumbai Mirror|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an age difference of twenty-four years, and the fact that Ruttie was hardly sixteen years old at this time, the two decided to get married. 
[[File:Nikahnama-jinah.png|thumb|left|upright|225px|Marriage certificate of Ruttie and Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]
Jinnah broached the topic with his friend by first discussing the question of [[Interfaith marriage|interfaith]] and inter-community marriages, always a hot potato in India. Here he was sure of drawing a favorable response from the baronet. Having drawn his friend out to make a general statement in support of mixed marriages, Jinnah then made his proposal to marry his friend's daughter. The baronet was shocked beyond words; he had never imagined anything other than a benign paternalistic relationship between his friend and his daughter. He reacted with violent indignation to the idea and almost ordered Jinnah out of his house. From the Petits' point of view, it was not just the question of religion, but also that of the age difference, especially given that Jinnah was 40, that appalled them.

"''She was, after all, not yet sixteen, an age when modern parents of the new century did not expect their daughters to rush into marriage, although in more conventional homes girls were either betrothed or already married by that age. Sir Dinshaw’s only sister, Hamabai, after having gone to a French boarding school in Nice for her baccalaureate, was still single at twenty-nine and not an eyebrow was raised."''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since Ruttie was underage, her father was able to prevent the marriage for the time being, and the matter brewed for more than a year with no resolution. Ruttie was the only daughter (she had three brothers) of her parents, and they always celebrated her birthday in grand style. Despite the tensions within the family, they could hardly give her coming-of-age birthday a miss, and a grand banquet was held on the occasion at the [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower|Taj Mahal Hotel]] in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/books/story/20170612-mohammed-ali-jinnah-mr-and-mrs-jinnah-book-rutti-jinnah-wife-sheela-reddy-986497-2017-06-05|title=Mr and Mrs Jinnah: How the failed marriage forms backdrop of the national divorce we call Partition|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the baronet had regaled his guests with a witty after-dinner speech, Ruttie stood up saying "Thank you, Papa..." and went on to drop a bombshell. She calmly informed the gathering that she had accepted a proposal of marriage from Jinnah, and that they would be married shortly; she asked the audience to wish them joy. She sat down to thundering silence, but despite the palpable outrage and opposition, a matter which had become so public could not be undone, and Ruttie could not be persuaded to change her mind. Even to the end, her parents could never reconcile themselves to the turn of events. Their objections were manifold: the difference of religion, the vast difference in age, the feeling of having been betrayed by a man they had always regarded as a friend. When the time came for Ruttie to abandon the Parsi religion and be received into the Muslim community, she was disowned and thrown off by her family and had to leave her father's house forthwith. In 1918, only weeks after her 18th birthday, Ruttie [[converted to Islam]], married the 42-year-old Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in an [[Nikah|Islamic wedding]], and cut all ties with her family and the [[Parsi|Parsi community]].&lt;ref name="dawn/3march2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=InpaperMagazine|first1=From|title=First lady: The Flower of Bombay|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/699973|accessdate=24 May 2017|work=DAWN.COM|date=3 March 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newspaper|first1=From the|title=Maryam Jinnah|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/772879|accessdate=24 May 2017|work=DAWN.COM|date=21 December 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marital problems==
The Jinnah's resided mainly at [[South Court|South Court Mansion]] in Malabar Hill, a stone's throw from Petit Hall. However, there was no contact between them and the Petit family, and the estrangement continued even after the birth of Ruttie's only child, [[Dina Wadia|Dina Jinnah]], the following year. In addition to the estrangement from her own family, Ruttie was also ex-communicated from the Parsi Community with extraordinary measures and censure, and a near complete ostracization from their social gatherings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thepunchmagazine.com/the-byword/interviews/jinnah-and-ruttie-when-politics-broke-up-a-marriage|title=Jinnah and Ruttie: When  politics broke up a marriage|last=Punch|first=The|date=2018-02-24|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruttie and Jinnah also made frequent trips to Europe and spent considerable lengths of time there. They made for a head-turning couple, not just because they looked an unlikely mismatched pair, but also because Ruttie aspired to define the acme of fashion and money was no object. Her long hair would be decked in fresh flowers, she wore vibrant silks and chiffon's, accentuated by headbands and tiaras lavish with diamonds, rubies and emeralds. Jinnah doted on his child-like bride and indulged her every wish, and she was likewise content to be pampered by her beloved husband whom she called “J”. According to most sources, the couple could not have been happier in their first few years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pakistaniat.com/2007/09/10/a-look-at-the-personal-life-of-jinnah-ruttie-jinnahs-last-letter-to-her-husband/ Ruttie Jinnah's Letters]&lt;/ref&gt; Their only child, Dina Jinnah, was born on 15 August 1919.

Jinnah's own sister [[Fatima Jinnah]], who had been a ward of Jinnah from age eight, since their father's death in 1901, was not amenable to the marriage either. In an attempt to make way for the new bride, Fatima was initially bundled off to another sister's home, but later had come to spending her Sundays at the Jinnah residence at South Court.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytimes.com.pk/206612/mr-mrs-jinnah-marriage-shook-india-shows-jinnah-positive-light/|title=‘Mr and Mrs Jinnah: The marriage that shook India’ shows Jinnah in a positive light - Daily Times|date=2018-02-24|work=Daily Times|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young Ruttie, already a mother at 19, found that she was no longer the sole recipient of Jinnah's attentions. It did not help that she and Fatima were of very different temperaments. Ruttie had even yelled at Fatima (considered dour, and very close in personal characteristics in her austerity and fastidiousness, to Jinnah) once, upon seeing her reading the [[Quran]] regularly, “the Quran is a book to be talked about, not to be read!”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jinnah enrolled Fatima in a [[Dr. R. Ahmed Dental College and Hospital|Dental College]] in 1919. In 1923, he also helped Fatima Jinnah setup her own clinic in Bombay.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Yet, this did little in bridging the gap that had developed between Jinnah and Ruttie.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/a/ahmed-jinnah.html?_r=2|title=Jinnah, Pakistan and Islamic Identity|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-1922, Jinnah was facing political isolation (almost reflecting Ruttie's own ex-communication from the Parsi Community), as he devoted every spare moment to be the voice of separatist incitement in a nation torn by Hindu-Muslim antipathy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His increasingly late hours and the ever-increasing distance between them left Ruttie feeling neglected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/Quaid/life_quaid05.htm Ruttie Jinnah – Story of Pakistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024215548/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/Quaid/life_quaid05.htm |date=24 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage deteriorated rapidly within months after the birth of their child. Jinnah expected that after the birth of their child, Ruttie should stop behaving like a child herself and discharge the role of wife and mother in a more traditional mould. Her continuing irresponsibility, self-absorption and elfin childishness were no longer charming but had turned irksome to him. His own interests and pursuits - Muslim welfare, social issues, the question of home rule - were as serious and solemn as hers were floozie and feckless, connected to clothes, jewels, parties and foreign excursions. Both of them were utterly absorbed in their own interests and looked upon the other as being unbending and unmanageable. Both of them left their daughter to the care of nannies and governesses and otherwise neglected her so completely that the child was not even given a name until the age of nine. Jinnah found it convenient to play sugar daddy by keeping Ruttie supplied with money - for which her appetite was enormous - if it would keep her reasonably happy and out of his way, but Ruttie craved not only luxury but also great attention. While on the one hand neglecting her own child so much as to make that a topic of discussion across their circle in Bombay, Ruttie on the other hand demanded that her husband be in an incessant and continuous state of courtship, doting on her, pampering her and attending to her every need every moment of every day. Such a situation had indeed prevailed for a brief period when Jinnah had been a lonely childless widower and Ruttie a frothy, vivacious teenager. That infatuation had worn out, and Jinnah found the demands made on him onerous and vexatious. The change was not something which Ruttie could understand or accept. Her complex relationship with her husband can be gleaned by reading some extracts of her last letter to him:

::''"...When one has been as near to the reality of Life (which after all is Death) as I have been, dearest, one only remembers the beautiful and tender moments and all the rest becomes a half veiled mist of unrealities. Try and remember me, beloved, as the flower you plucked and not the flower you tread upon..." and late in the letter, ".. Darling I love you – I love you – and had I loved you just a little less I might have remained with you – only after one has created a very beautiful blossom one does not drag it through the mire. The higher you set your ideal the lower it falls. I have loved you my darling as it is given to few men to be loved. I only beseech you that the tragedy which commenced in love should also end with it..."''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/pimu/886400838/in/set-72157600711943677 The life of Ruttie Jinnah in pictures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jinnah, on the other hand, confided to a friend, “she was a child, I shouldn’t have married her. It was my mistake”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further, in an irony of sorts, his own stance on inter-faith and inter-community marriages was challenged when his daughter Dina decided to marry a Christian-Parsi industrialist from Bombay. In an almost exact way Sir Dinshaw Petit and Ruttie had clashed, Jinnah too clashed with his own daughter over her desire to marry outside the Muslim community. Mahommedali Currim Chagla, who was Jinnah’s assistant at the time, writes in his autobiography Roses in December:  “Jinnah asked Dina ‘there are millions of Muslim boys in India, is he the only one you were waiting for?’ and Dina replied ‘there were millions of Muslim girls in India, why did you marry my mother then?’”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indiacurrents.com/jinnahs-daughter/|title=Jinnah’s Daughter|work=Indian American Magazine {{!}} Events {{!}} San Jose CA {{!}} India Currents|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last days and death==
Jinnah is seen as a very private person who hardly showed his emotions, but he is known to have wept twice in public, and both occasions were connected to Ruttie. One of the occasions was Ruttie's funeral in 1929, and the other was in August 1947, when he visited her grave one last time before leaving for Pakistan. Jinnah left India in August 1947, never to return again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pakistaniat.com/2007/09/10/a-look-at-the-personal-life-of-jinnah-ruttie-jinnahs-last-letter-to-her-husband/ A look at the life of Ruttie's last letter to her husband Jinnah]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ruttie's death, it appeared that Jinnah missed her a great deal. G. Allana wrote a biography of Jinnah entitled "Quaid-i-Azam Jinnah: The Story of a Nation," and he relates an anecdote made known to him by Jinnah's chauffeur. He quoted the chauffeur thus:

::''"You know servants in household come to know everything that is going around them. Sometimes more than twelve years after Begum Jinnah's (Mrs. Jinnah) death, the boss would order at dead of night a huge ancient wooden chest to be opened, in which were stored clothes of his dead wife and his married daughter. He would intently look into those clothes, as they were taken out of box and were spread on the carpets. He would gaze at them for long with eloquent silence. Then his eyes turn moisten..."''&lt;ref&gt;Ganje Firishte pp 9, 1955, Saadat Hassan Manto&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious syncretism''' exhibits blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions. It is contrasted by the idea of [[multiple religious belonging]] and [[polytheism]], respectively.

This can occur for many reasons, and the latter scenario happens quite commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions exist in proximity and function actively in the culture, or when a culture is conquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do not succeed in entirely eradicating the old beliefs or, especially, practices.

Religions may have syncretic elements to their beliefs or history, but adherents of so-labeled systems often frown on applying the label, especially adherents who belong to "revealed" religious systems, such as the [[Abrahamic religions]], or any system that exhibits an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] approach.  Such adherents sometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth.  By this reasoning, adding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no longer true.  Indeed, critics of a specific syncretistic trend may sometimes use the word "syncretism" as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that those who seek to incorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system actually distort the original faith. The consequence, according to Keith Ferdinando, is a fatal compromise of the dominant religion's integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ferdinando, Keith|authorlink1=SIckness and Syncretism in the African Context|editor1-last=Billington|editor1-first=Antony|title=Mission and Meaning|date=1995|publisher=Paternoster Press|isbn=0-85364-676-7|page=265|url=http://www.missiology.org.uk/pdf/cotterell-fs/15_ferdinando.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-exclusivist systems of belief, on the other hand, may feel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. 

In modern [[secularization|secular]] society, religious innovators sometimes create new religions syncretically as a mechanism to reduce inter-religious tension and enmity, often with the effect of offending the original religions in question.  Such religions, however, do maintain some appeal to a less exclusivist audience.  Discussions of some of these blended religions appear in the individual sections below.

== Ancient history ==
{{See also|Ancient Greek religion}}
{{See also|Religion in ancient Rome}}
{{see|Hellenistic religion}}
[[Classical Athens]] was [[Religious exclusivism|exclusive]] in matters of religion. The Decree of Diopeithes made the introduction of and belief in foreign gods a criminal offence and only Greeks were allowed to worship in Athenian temples and festivals as foreigners were considered impure.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On the other hand, Athens imported many foreign cults, including those of [[Cybele]] and the [[Thracians|Thracian]] goddess [[Bendis]], and in some cases this involved a merging of identities: for example, [[Heracles]], who had traditionally been regarded as a mortal hero, began here and elsewhere in the Aegean world to be identified as a divine ([[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]]) figure, perhaps under the influence of Eastern counterparts like the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] [[Melqart]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Syncretism functioned as a feature of [[Hellenistic]] [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] religion, although only outside of Greece. Overall, [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] culture in the age that followed [[Alexander the Great]] itself showed syncretist features, essentially blending of [[Mesopotamia]]n, [[Iran|Persian]], [[Anatolia]]n, [[Egypt]]ian (and eventually [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]–[[List of topics related to ancient Rome|Roman]]) elements within an Hellenic formula. The [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] god [[Amun]] developed as the Hellenized ''[[Zeus]] Ammon'' after [[Alexander the Great]] went into the desert to seek out [[Oracle of Zeus-Ammon|his oracle]] at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]].&lt;ref name=liviusammon&gt;{{cite web|title=Ammon (Siwa)|url=http://www.livius.org/am-ao/ammon/ammon.html|website=Livius.Org|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sacredamun&gt;{{cite web|title=Temple of Amun, Siwa Oasis, Egypt|url=http://sacredsites.com/africa/egypt/temple_of_amun_siwa_oasis.html|publisher=SacredSites.com|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such identifications derive from ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'', the Hellenic habit of identifying gods of disparate [[mythology|mythologies]] with their own. When the proto-Greeks (peoples whose language would evolve into Greek proper) first arrived in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and on the mainland of modern-day Greece early in the 2nd millennium BCE, they found localized [[nymph]]s and [[divinity|divinities]] already connected with every important feature of the landscape: mountain, cave, [[Grove (nature)|grove]] and [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] all had their own locally venerated [[Deism|deity]]. The countless [[epithet]]s of the [[Greek pantheon|Olympian gods]] reflect their syncretic identification with these various figures. One defines "''Zeus Molossos''" (worshipped only at [[Dodona]]) as "the god identical to Zeus as worshipped by the [[Molossians]] at Dodona". Much of the apparently arbitrary and trivial mythic [[fable|fabling]] results from later mythographers' attempts to explain these obscure epithets.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The [[Rome|Romans]], identifying themselves as common heirs to a very similar civilization, identified [[Greek mythology|Greek deities]] with similar figures in the [[Roman mythology|Etruscan-Roman tradition]], though without usually copying [[Cult (religious practice)|cult practice]]s. (For details, see [[Interpretatio graeca]].)   Syncretic [[god]]s of the Hellenistic period found also wide favor in Rome: [[Serapis]], [[Isis]] and [[Mithras]], for example. [[Cybele]] as worshipped in Rome essentially represented a syncretic East Mediterranean [[goddess]].  The Romans imported the Greek god [[Dionysus]] into Rome, where he merged with the Latin [[mead]] god ''Liber'', and converted the Anatolian [[Sabazios]] into the Roman [[Sabazius]].

The degree of correspondence varied: [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] makes perhaps a better match for [[Zeus]] than the rural huntress [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] does for the feared [[Artemis]]. [[Ares]] does not quite match [[Mars (god)|Mars]]. The Romans physically imported the Anatolian goddess [[Cybele]] into Rome from her Anatolian cult-center [[Pessinos]] in the form of her original aniconic archaic stone [[Idolatry|idol]]; they identified her as ''[[Magna Mater]]'' and gave her a matronly, iconic image developed in Hellenistic [[Pergamum]].

Likewise, when the Romans encountered [[Celt]]s and [[Germanic peoples]], they mingled these peoples' gods with their own, creating [[Sulis Minerva]], Apollo [[Sucellos]] (Apollo the Good Smiter) and Mars Thingsus (Mars of the war-assembly), among many others.  In the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] speaks of Germanic worshippers of [[Heracles|Hercules]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]; most modern scholars tentatively identify Hercules as [[Thor]] and Mercury as [[Odin]].

Romans were familiar with the concept of syncretism because from their earliest times they had experienced it with, among others, the Greeks. The Romans incorporated the originally Greek Apollo and Hercules into their religion. They did not look at the religious aspects that they adopted from other cultures to be different or less meaningful from religious aspects that were Roman in origin. The early Roman acceptance of other cultures religions into their own made it easy for them to integrate the newly encountered religions they found as a result of their expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, John. ''Graeco Ritu: A Typically Roman Way of Honoring the Gods''. Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 97, Greece in Rome : Influence, Integration, Resistance (1995), 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Christianity ===
[[Gnosticism]] is identified as an early form of syncretism{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} that challenged the beliefs of [[early Christianity|early Christians]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Gnostic [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] posited that only spiritual or invisible things were good, and that material or visible things were evil. Orthodox Christians have always insisted that matter is essentially good, since, as they believe, [[God]] created all things, both spiritual and material,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/credo.htm |title= The Apostles Creed and The Nicene Creed }}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that it was "very good".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-31.htm |title= Genesis1:31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Magus]] appears as one of the early proponents of Gnosticism, and is considered by some as one of its founders. He was denounced by many Church authorities, including Peter himself, and is regarded by some{{who|date=December 2017}} as the source of all [[Heresy in Christianity|heresies]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the first few centuries after the [[Crucifixion|death]] of Jesus, there were various competing "Jesus movements". The Roman emperors used syncretism to help unite the expanding empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Jesus Mysteries |last=Freke |first=Timothy |publisher=Harmony |year=1999 |isbn=0609807986 |location=United Kingdom |pages= |last2=Gandy |first2=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social conversion to Christianity happened all over Europe. It became even more effective when missionaries concurred with established cultural traditions and interlaced them into a fundamentally Christian synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Syncretism is distinguished from [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], the latter of which refers the Church's ability to "incorporate into herself all that is true, good, and beautiful in the world." This idea was present in the early Church; the ''[[Second Apology of Justin Martyr]]'' states: "Whatever things were rightly said among all men, are the property of us Christians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne Gilson]], ''History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle Ages'', Justin Martyr, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The Church has assimilated many (though not all) of the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. [[Augustine of Hippo]] is remembered for assimilating the ideas of Plato, while [[Thomas Aquinas]] is known for doing so with the ideas of Aristotle. In his essay on the development of Christian doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.newmanreader.org/works/development/ |title= An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Henry Newman]] clarified the idea of assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= http://www.newmanreader.org/works/development/chapter8.html |chapter= Chapter 8. Application of the Third Note of a True Development—Assimilative Power |title= An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Judaism ===
{{see|Second Temple Judaism|Hellenistic Judaism|Christianity and Judaism}}
In ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', [[Sigmund Freud]] made a case for [[Judaism]] arising out of the pre-existing [[monotheism]] that was briefly imposed upon [[Egypt]] during the rule of [[Akhenaten]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The [[Code of Hammurabi]] is also cited as a likely starting point for the Jewish [[Ten Commandments]]. Some [[scholar]]s hold that Judaism refined its concept of monotheism and adopted features such as its [[eschatology]], [[angelology]] and [[demonology]] through contacts with [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;

In spite of the Jewish [[halakha|halakhic]] prohibitions on [[polytheism]], [[idolatry]], and associated practices (''[[Avodah Zarah]]''), several combinations of Judaism with other religions have sprung up: [[Messianic Judaism]], [[Jewish Buddhists|Jewish Buddhism]], [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenism]] and [[Semitic neopaganism|Judeo-Paganism]]. Several  [[Jewish Messiah claimants]] (such as [[Jacob Frank]]) and the [[Sabbateans]] came to mix [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] Judaism with Christianity and Islam. Until relatively recently, China had a Jewish community which had adopted some [[Confucian]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{url|https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/israel/losttribes3.html#chiang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mysticism#Islamic mysticism|Islamic mystical tradition]] known as [[Sufism]] appears somewhat syncretic in nature in its [[History of Sufism|origins]], but it is rejected by many other modern scholars &lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sufism] Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved on August 1st, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;. A better explanation is that,
{{Quote|"Oneness of being does not mean that the created universe is God, for God's Being is necessary while the universe's being is merely possible, that is, subject to non-being, beginning, and ending, and it is impossible that one of these two orders of being could in any sense be the other; but rather, the created universe's act of being is derived from and subsumed by the divine act of creation, from which it has no ontic independence and hence is only through the being of its Creator, the one true being. So Wahdat-al-Wujud or Oneness of Being entails that nothing exists except Allah, His attributes, His actions, and His rulings, while created being, as manifest to us, cannot be identified with His entity or attributes but only with His actions and rulings: the world, as it were, is pure act, while Allah is pure Being. In short [Wahdat-al-Wujud] is not pantheism, because the world is not Allah. Spinoza's definition in the Ethica of God as "simple substance" (pantheism properly speaking), has nothing to do with the experience of those who possess ma'rifa [gnosis]. Rather, the world's existence is through Allah, in Arabic bi Llah, the point under the Arabic letter ba' being both a point of ontic connection and a point of demarcation...The matter is between Lord (Rabb), and slave who is through Lord ('abd bi Rabb)".&lt;ref&gt;Sea Without Shore: Nuh Ha Mim Keller&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mainstream [[Tasawwuf]] does not present itself as a separate set of beliefs from the mainstream [[Sunni]] tradition; well-established traditions like [[Naqshbandi]], [[Qadiri]], [[Shadhili]], and most others have always been part and parcel of normative Islamic life. No doubt some groups in the name of Sufism, just like in any religion, do espouse theologically unorthodox positions.

During Sufi presence in Bengal, Muslim–Hindu syncretism was a general trend, and [[Nabibangsha]] by Syed Sultan is an example of it. The book tells the lineage of the prophets of Islam. Apart from Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus Christ, the poet also describes Indian deities such as Brahma, Vishnu, Rama and Krishna.

The [[Barghawata]] kingdom of [[Morocco]] followed a syncretic religion inspired by Islam (perhaps influenced by Judaism) with elements of [[Sunni]], [[Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijite]] Islam, mixed with astrological and heathen traditions. Supposedly, they had their own [[Qur'an]] in the [[Berber language]] comprising 80 suras under the leadership of the second ruler of the dynasty [[Salih ibn Tarif]] who had taken part in the Maysara uprising. He proclaimed himself a prophet. He also claimed to be the final [[Mahdi]] of Islamic tradition, and that [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] ([[Jesus]]) would be his companion and pray behind him.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The [[Druze]]s integrated elements of [[Ismaili]] [[Islam]] with [[Gnosticism]] and [[Platonism]]. [[Satpanth]] is considered as syncretism of Ismaili Islam and Hinduism.

Buddhism has syncretized with many traditional beliefs in [[East Asian]] societies as it was seen as compatible with local religions. Notable syncretization of Buddhism with local beliefs includes the [[Three Teachings]], or Triple Religion, that harmonizes [[Mahayana Buddhism]] with [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] and elements of [[Taoism]], and [[Shinbutsu-shūgō]], which is a syncretism of [[Shinto]] and Buddhism.&lt;ref name=afe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/cosmos/ort/teachings.htm|title=Living in the Chinese Cosmos: Understanding Religion in Late-Imperial China|website=afe.easia.columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious beliefs, practices, and identities of East Asians (who comprise the majority of the world's Buddhists by any measure) often blend Buddhism with other traditions including [[Confucianism]], the [[Chinese folk religion]], [[Taoism]], [[Shinto]], and [[Korean shamanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/core9/phalsall/texts/lopez.html |title=Chinese Cultural Studies: The Spirits of Chinese Religion |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203092208/http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/core9/phalsall/texts/lopez.html |archivedate=3 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asia.msu.edu/eastasia/China/religion.html|title=Windows on Asia – Chinese Religions|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220182953/http://asia.msu.edu/eastasia/China/religion.html|archivedate=2009-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacu.org/religion.html |title=SACU Religion in China |publisher=Sacu.org |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askasia.org/teachers/essays/essay.php?no=16 |title=Buddhism in China |publisher=AskAsia |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaled.org/curriculum/china/bessay1.htm |title=Buddhism And Its Spread Along The Silk Road |publisher=Globaled.org |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213205522/http://www.globaled.org/curriculum/china/bessay1.htm |archivedate=13 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before and during World War II, a Nichiren Shōshū priest named Jimon Ogasawara proposed the blending of Nichiren Buddhism with Shinto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dumoulin |first1=Heinrich |last2=Maraldo |first2=John C. |title=Buddhism in the Modern World |date=1976 |publisher=Macmillan |location=The University of Virginia |page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] in ancient India have made many adaptations over the millennia, assimilating elements of various diverse religious traditions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} One example of this is the [[Yoga Vasistha]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chapple, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fe_5bUKSaUEC&amp;pg=PR12 The concise Yoga Vāsiṣṭha By Venkatesananda],  1985, pp. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]], who wanted to consolidate the diverse religious communities in his empire, propounded [[Din-i-Ilahi]], a syncretic religion intended to merge the best elements of the religions of his empire. [[Satpanth]] is considered as syncretism of Ismaili Islam and Hinduism.

[[Meivazhi]] is a syncretic monotheistic minority religion based in Tamil Nadu, India. Its focus is spiritual enlightenment and the conquering of death, through the teachings. Mevaizhi preaches the Oneness of essence message of all the previous major scriptures - particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity - allowing membership regardless of creed. Meivazhi's disciples are thousands of people belonging once to 69 different castes of different religions being united as one family of Meivazhi Religion.

In China, most of the population follows syncretist religions combining [[Mahayana Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and elements of [[Confucianism]]. Out of all Chinese believers, approximately 85.7% adhere to [[Chinese traditional religion]], as many profess to be both Mahayana Buddhist and Taoist at the same time. Many of the pagodas in China are dedicated to both Buddhist and Taoist deities.

The traditional [[Mun (religion)|Mun]] faith of the [[Lepcha people]] predates their seventh century conversion to [[Lamaism|Lamaistic Buddhism]]. Since that time, the Lepcha have practiced it together with Buddhism. Since the arrival of [[Christianity|Christian]] missionaries in the nineteenth century, Mun traditions have been followed alongside that faith as well. The traditional religion permits incorporation of [[Buddha]] and [[Jesus Christ]] as a deities, depending on household beliefs.&lt;ref name=Bareh&gt;{{cite journal |title=Encyclopaedia of North-East India: Sikkim |volume=7 |series=Encyclopaedia of North-East India |editor=Hamlet Bareh |isbn=8170997879 |publisher=Mittal Publications |year=2001 |pages=284–86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrr7HPr8NAQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrari&gt;{{cite book |title=Health and Religious Rituals in South Asia |editor=Fabrizio Ferrari |chapter=10.

==Modern history==
{{main|New religious movements}}
===Christianity===
{{see|Syncretistic controversy|Christian new religious movements}}
One can contrast Christian syncretism with [[Contextualization (Bible translation)|contextualization]] or [[inculturation]], the practice of making Christianity relevant to a culture:  ''Contextualisation'' does not address the doctrine but affects a change in the styles or expression of worship. Although Christians often took their European music and building styles into churches in other parts of the world, in a contextualization approach, they would build churches, sing songs, and pray in a local ethnic style.  Some [[Jesuit]] missionaries adapted local systems and images to teach Christianity, as did the Portuguese in China, the practice of which was opposed by the [[Order of Preachers|Dominicans]], leading to the [[Chinese rites controversy]].

Historian [[Yuval Noah Harari]] argues in ''[[Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind]]'' (2014) that syncretism is pervasive in Christianity, saying that "In fact, monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in the polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts." (page 223)

====Protestant Reformation====
Syncretism did not play a role when Christianity split into [[Eastern Orthodoxy|eastern]] and [[Catholicism|western]] rites during the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]]. It became involved, however, with the rifts of the [[Protestant Reformation]], with [[Desiderius Erasmus]]'s readings of Plutarch. Even earlier, syncretism was a fundamental aspect of the efforts of Neoplatonists such as [[Marsilio Ficino]] to reform the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, James D., Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century, Repristination Press, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4610-9382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1615, [[David Pareus]] of [[Heidelberg]] urged Christians to a "pious syncretism"{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} in opposing the [[Antichrist]], but few 17th-century Protestants discussed the compromises that might effect a reconciliation with the Catholic Church: [[Johann Hülsemann]], [[Johann Georg Dorsche]] and [[Abraham Calovius]] (1612–85) opposed the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Georgius Calixtus|Georg Calisen "Calixtus"]] (1586–1656) of the [[University of Helmstedt]] for his "syncretism".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = LCMS | url = http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&amp;word=SYNCRETISM | title = Cyclopedia | contribution = Syncretism}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[Syncretistic controversy]].)

====New World====
{{see|Afro-American religion}}

Catholicism in Central and South America has been integrated with a number of elements derived from [[Indigenous people|indigenous]] and slave cultures in those areas (see [[#Syncretism in the Caribbean|the Caribbean]] and [[#Modern syncretic religions|modern sections]]); while many [[African Initiated Church]]es demonstrate an integration of [[Protestant]] and traditional African beliefs. The Catholic Church allows some symbols and traditions to be carried over from older belief systems, so long as they are remade to fit into a Christian worldview; syncretism of other religions with Catholicism, such as [[Voudun]] or [[Santería]], is condemned by the Roman Catholic Church. The image of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] and the subsequent [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] to her are seen as assimilating some elements of native [[Culture of Mexico|Mexican culture]] into Christianity.

The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] has created controversy by disciplining pastors for syncretism when they participated in multi-faith services in response to the 9/11 attacks and to the shootings at Newtown, Connecticut, on the grounds that merely sharing a worship setting with other faiths was in error.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/nyregion/lutheran-pastor-explains-role-in-sandy-hook-interfaith-service.html?_r=1&amp; Pastor Apologizes to His Denomination for Role in Sandy Hook Interfaith Service], The New York Times, 7 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], doctrine from previous [[Dispensation (period)|dispensations]] as recorded in the [[standard works|LDS canon]] are considered official, though it is accepted that ancient teachings can be warped, misunderstood, or lost as a result of [[Great Apostasy#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|apostasy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-16-the-church-of-jesus-christ-in-former-times?lang=eng |chapter= Chapter 16: The Church of Jesus Christ in Former Times |title= [[Gospel Principles]] |year= 2011 |pages= 87–93 |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141112223053/https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-16-the-church-of-jesus-christ-in-former-times?lang=eng |archive-date= 2014-11-12 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it does not officially recognize doctrine from other religions, it is believed that truth in other sources can be identified via [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)#Personal revelation|personal revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-22?lang=eng |chapter= Chapter 22: Gaining Knowledge of Eternal Truths |title= [[Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2007 |pages= 261–70 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141112223239/https://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-22?lang=eng |archive-date= 2014-11-12 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====East Asia====
[[Roman Catholicism in South Korea|Catholicism in South Korea]] has been syncretized with traditional [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahayana Buddhist]] and [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] customs that form an integral part of traditional Korean culture. As a result, South Korean Catholics continue to practice [[jesa|ancestral rites]] and observe many Buddhist and Confucian customs and philosophies.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite book |last=Park |first=Chang-Won |title=Cultural Blending in Korean Death Rites |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=10 June 2010 |pages=12–13 |isbn=978-1-4411-1749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/19/world/asia/19iht-feud.2238466.html|title=Quest for perfect grave keeps Korean feud alive - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune|first=Choe|last=Sang-Hun|date=19 July 2006|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia the revolutionary movements of [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom|Taiping]] (19th-century China) and [[God's Army (revolutionary group)|God's Army]] ([[Karen people|Karen]] in the 1990s) blended Christianity with traditional beliefs.

===Bahá'í===
{{see|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] follow [[Bahá'u'lláh]], a prophet whom they consider a successor to [[Muhammad]], [[Jesus]], [[Moses]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Krishna]] and [[Abraham]].  This acceptance of other religious founders has encouraged some to regard the Bahá'í religion as a syncretic faith.  However, Bahá'ís and the Bahá'í writings explicitly reject this view.  Bahá'ís consider Bahá'u'lláh's revelation an independent, though related, revelation from God.  Its relationship to previous [[Dispensationalism|dispensations]] is seen as analogous to the relationship of Christianity to Judaism.  They regard beliefs held in common as evidence of truth, [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressively revealed by God]] throughout human history, and culminating in (at present) the Bahá'í revelation.  Bahá'ís have their own [[Sacred text|sacred scripture]], interpretations, laws and practices that, for Bahá'ís, supersede those of other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |pages=276–277 &amp; p.291 |isbn=1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stockman, Robert (1997). ''[http://bahai-library.com/articles/rg.syncretism.html The Baha'i Faith and Syncretism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caribbean and Afro-American ===
The process of syncretism in the Caribbean region often forms a part of cultural creolization. (The technical term "[[Creole peoples|Creole]]" may apply to anyone born and raised in the region, regardless of ethnicity.) The shared histories of the Caribbean islands include long periods of European [[Imperialism]] (mainly by Spain, France, and Great Britain) and the importation of African [[slaves]] (primarily from Central and Western Africa). The influences of each of the above interacted in varying degrees on the islands, producing the fabric of society that exists today in the Caribbean.

The [[Rastafari movement]], founded in [[Jamaica]], syncretizes vigorously, mixing elements from the [[Bible]], [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Pan Africanism]] movement, a text from the European grimoire tradition, the [[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Caribbean culture]].

Another highly syncretic religion of the area, [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]], combines elements of Western African, native Caribbean, and [[Christianity|Christian]] (especially [[Roman Catholic]]) beliefs.

Recently developed religious systems that exhibit marked syncretism include the [[Afro-American religion|African diasporic religions]] [[Candomblé]], [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and [[Santería]], which analogize various [[Yorùbá mythology|Yorùbá]] and other [[List of African deities|African deities]] to the [[Saints of the Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic saints]]. Some sects of Candomblé have also incorporated [[Native American deities]], and [[Umbanda]] combined African deities with [[spiritism|Kardecist]] [[spiritualism]].

[[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] is a similarly derived form of [[folk magic]] practiced by some [[African American]] communities in the [[Southern United States]]. Other traditions of syncretic folk religion in North America include [[Louisiana Voodoo]] as well as [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[Pow-wow (folk magic)|Pow-wow]], in which practitioners  invoke power through the [[Christian God]].

===Other===
{{main|List of new religious movements}}
Many historical [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religious movements have incorporated Christian European influence, like the [[Native American Church]], the [[Ghost Dance]], and the religion of [[Handsome Lake]].

[[Santo Daime]] is a syncretic religion founded in Brazil that incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including [[Folk Catholicism]], [[Kardecist Spiritism]], African [[animism]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] South American [[shamanism]], including ''[[vegetalismo]]''.

[[Unitarian Universalism]] also provides an example of a modern syncretic religion. It traces its roots to [[Christian Universalism|Universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[Christian]] congregations. However, modern Unitarian Universalism freely incorporates elements from other religious and non-religious traditions, so that it no longer identifies as "Christian."

The [[Theosophical Society]] professes to go beyond being a syncretic movement that combines deities into an elaborate [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], and assembles evidence that points to an underlying (or occult) reality of Being that is universal and interconnected, common to all spirit-matter dualities. It is maintained that this is the source of religious belief, each religion simply casting that one reality through the prism of that particular time and in a way that is meaningful to their circumstances.

[[Universal Sufism]] seeks the [[Cultural identity|unity]] of all people and [[religion]]s. Universal Sufis strive to "realize and spread the knowledge of Unity, the religion of Love, and Wisdom, so that the biases and prejudices of faiths and beliefs may, of themselves, fall away, the human heart overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences be rooted out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruhaniat.org/readings/3Objects.php |title=Hazrat Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan, The 3 Objects of the Sufi Movement |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227021948/http://www.ruhaniat.org/readings/3Objects.php |archivedate=December 27, 2007 |df= }},  Sufi Ruhaniat International (1956–2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnam, [[Caodaism]] blends elements of [[Buddhism]], [[Catholicism]] and [[Taoism]].

Several [[Japanese new religions]], such as [[Konkokyo]] and [[Seicho-No-Ie]], are syncretistic.

The [[Nigeria]]n religion [[Chrislam (Yoruba)|Chrislam]] combines Christian and Islamic doctrines.

[[Thelema]] is a mixture of many different schools of belief and practice, including [[Hermeticism]], Eastern [[Mysticism]], [[Yoga]], 19th century [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] philosophies (i.e. [[Nietzsche]]), [[occultism]], and the [[Kabbalah]], as well as ancient [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] religion.

Examples of strongly syncretist [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and modern movements with some religious elements include [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], [[Theosophical Society]], modern [[astrology]], [[Neopaganism]], and the [[New Age]] movement.

In [[Réunion]], the [[Malbars]] combine elements of Hinduism and Christianity.

'''Roman mythology''' is the body of traditional stories pertaining to [[ancient Rome]]'s [[founding of Rome|legendary origins]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious system]], as represented in the [[Latin literature|literature]] and [[Roman art|visual arts of the Romans]]. "Roman mythology" may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period.

The Romans usually treated their traditional narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. The stories are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Heroism was an important theme. When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices, they are more concerned with ritual, [[augur]]y, and institutions than with [[theology]] or [[cosmogony]].&lt;ref&gt;John North, ''Roman Religion'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000) pp. 4ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of Roman religion and [[myth]] is complicated by the early influence of [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek religion]] on the [[Italian peninsula]] during Rome's [[protohistory]], and by the later artistic imitation of [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literary models]] by Roman authors. In matters of theology, the Romans were curiously eager to identify [[List of Roman deities|their own gods]] with those of the [[Greeks]] (''[[interpretatio graeca]]''), and to reinterpret stories about [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek deities]] under the names of their Roman counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;North, ''Roman Religion'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome's early myths and legends also have a dynamic relationship with [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]], less documented than that of the Greeks.

While Roman mythology may lack a body of divine narratives as extensive as that found in Greek literature,&lt;ref&gt;North, ''Roman Religion'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romulus and Remus]] suckling the she-wolf is as famous as any image from [[Greek mythology]] except for the [[Trojan Horse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[T. P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Latin literature was more widely known in Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], the interpretations of Greek myths by the Romans often had a greater influence on narrative and pictorial representations of "[[classical mythology]]" than Greek sources. In particular, the versions of Greek myths in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', written during the reign of [[Augustus]], came to be regarded as [[canon (literary)|canonical]].

==The nature of Roman myth==
[[File:Rimini219.jpg|thumb|In this wall painting from [[Pompeii]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] looks on while the physician [[Iapyx]] tends to the wound of her son, [[Aeneas]]; the tearful boy is her grandson [[Ascanius|Ascanius, also known as Iulus]], legendary ancestor{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} of [[Julius Caesar]] and the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]]]
Because [[ritual]] played the central role in Roman religion that myth did for the Greeks, it is sometimes doubted that the Romans had much of a native mythology.  This perception is a product of [[Romanticism]] and the [[classics|classical scholarship]] of the 19th century, which valued Greek civilization as more "authentically creative."&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Wiseman, ''The Myths of Rome'' (University of Exeter Press, 2004), preface (n.p.).&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century, however, Roman myths were an inspiration particularly for [[Western painting|European painting]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wiseman, ''The Myths of Rome'', preface.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman tradition is rich in historical myths, or [[legend]]s, concerning the foundation and rise of the city. These narratives focus on human actors, with only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. In Rome's earliest period, history and myth have a mutual and complementary relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandre Grandazzi]], ''The Foundation of Rome: Myth and History'' (Cornell University Press, 1997), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[T. P. Wiseman]] notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Roman stories still ''matter'', as they mattered to [[Dante]] in 1300 and [[Shakespeare]] in 1600 and the [[founding fathers of the United States]] in 1776. What does it take to be a [[Roman citizenship|free citizen]]? Can a [[superpower]] still be a [[republic]]? How does well-meaning [[authority]] turn into murderous [[tyranny]]?&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Major sources for Roman myth include the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Vergil]]  and the first few books of [[Livy]]'s history as well as Dionysius' s ''Roman Antiquities''. Other important sources are the ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' of [[Ovid]], a six-book poem structured by the [[Roman calendar|Roman religious calendar]], and the fourth book of elegies by [[Propertius]]. Scenes from Roman myth also appear in Roman [[wall painting]], [[Roman currency|coins]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]], particularly [[relief]]s.

===Founding myths===
{{Main|Founding of Rome}}
The ''Aeneid'' and Livy's early history are the best extant sources for [[Founding of Rome|Rome's founding myths]]. Material from Greek heroic legend was grafted onto this native stock at an early date.  The Trojan prince [[Aeneas]] was cast as husband of [[Lavinia]], daughter of King [[Latinus]], patronymical ancestor of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latini]],  and therefore through a [[Latin kings of Alba Longa|convoluted revisionist genealogy]] as forebear of [[Romulus and Remus]].  By extension, the Trojans were adopted as the mythical ancestors of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Lusus Troiae]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other myths===

The characteristic myths of Rome are often political or moral, that is, they deal with the development of [[Roman Constitution|Roman government]] in accordance with divine law, as expressed by [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], and with demonstrations of the individual's adherence to moral expectations ''([[mos maiorum]])'' or failures to do so.

==Religion and myth==
{{Main|Religion in ancient Rome}}
Narratives of divine activity played  a more important role in the system of Greek religious belief than among the Romans, for whom ritual and cult were primary. Although Roman religion did not have a basis in [[scriptures]] and [[exegesis]], priestly literature was one of the earliest written forms of [[Latin literature |Latin prose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Moses Hadas]], ''A History of Latin Literature'' (Columbia University Press, 1952), p. 15 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QnvOnY6ydngC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22commentarii+pontificum%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1932&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22commentarii%20pontificum%22&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The books ''(libri)'' and commentaries ''(commentarii)'' of the [[College of Pontiffs]] and of the [[augur]]s contained religious procedures, prayers, and rulings and opinions on points of religious law.&lt;ref&gt;C.O. Brink, ''Horace on Poetry. Epistles Book II: The Letters to Augustus and Florus'' (Cambridge University Press, 1982), p. 64 [https://books.google.com/books?id=loI8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=%22commentarii+pontificum%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1932&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2010&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22commentarii%20pontificum%22&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Although at least some of this archived material was available for consultation by the [[Roman Senate|Roman senate]], it was often ''occultum genus litterarum'',&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De domo sua'' 138.&lt;/ref&gt; an arcane form of literature to which by definition only priests had access.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Linderski]], "The ''libri reconditi''," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 89 (1985) 207–234.&lt;/ref&gt; Prophecies pertaining to world history and to Rome's destiny turn up fortuitously at critical junctures in history, discovered suddenly in the nebulous [[Sibylline books]], which [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin the Proud]] (according to legend) purchased in the late 6th century BC from the [[Cumaean Sibyl]]. Some aspects of archaic Roman religion survived in the lost theological works of the 1st-century BC scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], known through other classical and Christian authors.

[[File:Arte romana, triade capitolina, 160-180 dc (guidonia montecelio, museo civico archeologico) 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Capitoline Triad]]]]
The earliest pantheon included Janus, [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], and a leading so-called [[Archaic Triad]] of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, whose [[Flamines maiores |flamens were of the highest order]]. According to tradition, [[Numa Pompilius]], the [[Sabine]] second [[king of Rome]], founded Roman religion; Numa was believed to have had as his consort and adviser a Roman goddess or [[nymph]] of fountains and of prophecy, [[Egeria (mythology) |Egeria]]. The Etruscan-influenced [[Capitoline Triad]] of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva later became central to official religion, replacing the Archaic Triad — an unusual example within [[Indo-European religion]] of a supreme triad formed of two female deities and only one male. The cult of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] became established on the [[Aventine Hill]], but the most famous Roman manifestation of this goddess may be [[Diana Nemorensis]], owing to the attention paid to her cult by [[J.G. Frazer]] in the [[mythography|mythographical]] classic ''[[The Golden Bough]]''.

[[Nephele]] sits at Mercury's feet. - Roman fresco  from the eastern wall of the [[triclinium]] in the [[House of the Vettii]], [[Pompeii]], [[Pompeian Styles|Fourth Style]] (60-79 AD).]]
The gods represented distinctly the practical needs of daily life, and Ancient Romans scrupulously accorded them the appropriate rites and offerings. Early Roman divinities included a host of "specialist gods" whose names were invoked in the carrying out of various specific activities. Fragments of old ritual accompanying such acts as plowing or sowing reveal that at every stage of the operation a separate deity was invoked, the name of each deity being regularly derived from the verb for the operation. [[Tutelary deity#Ancient Rome|Tutelary deities]] were particularly important in ancient Rome.

Thus, [[Janus]] and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] guarded the door and hearth, the [[Lares]] protected the field and house, [[Pales]] the pasture, [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] the sowing, [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] the growth of the grain, [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]] the fruit, and [[Consus]] and [[Ops]] the harvest. Even the majestic [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the ruler of the gods, was honored for the aid his rains might give to the farms and vineyards. In his more encompassing character he was considered, through his weapon of lightning, the director of human activity. Due to his widespread domain, the Romans regarded him as their protector in their military activities beyond the borders of their own community. Prominent in early times were the gods [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]], who were often identified with each other. Mars was a god of war; he was honored in March and October. Modern scholars see Quirinus as the patron of the armed community in time of peace.

The 19th-century scholar [[Georg Wissowa]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Wissowa]], ''De dis Romanorum indigetibus et novensidibus disputatio'' (1892), full text (in Latin) [https://books.google.com/books?id=FYlbAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22De+dis+Romanorum+indigetibus+et+novensidibus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; thought that the Romans distinguished two classes of gods, the ''[[di indigetes]]'' and the ''di novensides'' or ''[[novensiles]]'':  the ''indigetes'' were the original gods of the Roman state, their names and nature indicated by the titles of the earliest priests and by the fixed festivals of the calendar, with 30 such gods honored by special festivals; the ''novensides'' were later divinities whose cults were introduced to the city in the historical period, usually at a known date and in response to a specific crisis or felt need. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] and others, however, have argued that this distinction cannot be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnaldo Momigliano]], "From Bachofen to Cumont," in ''A.D. Momigliano: Studies on Modern Scholarship''  (University of California Press, 1994), p. 319; Franz Altheim, ''A History of Roman Religion'', as translated by Harold Mattingly (London, 1938), pp. 110–112; [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North and S.R.F. Price. ''Religions of Rome: A History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), vol. 1, p. 158, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Hannibalic War|war with Hannibal]], any distinction between "indigenous" and "immigrant" gods begins to fade, and the Romans embraced diverse gods from various cultures as a sign of strength and universal divine favor.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (London, 1922) pp. 157 and 319; J.S. Wacher, ''The Roman World'' (Routledge, 1987, 2002), p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;


===Foreign gods===
[[File:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mithras]] in a Roman wall painting]]
The absorption of neighboring local gods took place as the Roman state conquered neighboring territories. The Romans commonly granted the local gods of a conquered territory the same honors as the earlier gods of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Roman state religion]]. In addition to [[Castor and Pollux]], the conquered settlements in Italy seem to have contributed to the Roman pantheon [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Minerva]], [[Hercules]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and deities of lesser rank, some of whom were Italic divinities, others originally derived from the Greek culture of [[Magna Graecia]]. In 203 BC, Rome imported the cult object embodying [[Cybele]] from [[Pessinus]] in [[Phrygia]] and welcomed its arrival with due [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#caerimoniae|ceremony]]. Both [[Lucretius]] and [[Catullus]], poets contemporary in the mid-1st century BC, offer disapproving glimpses of Cybele's wildly ecstatic cult.

In some instances, deities of an enemy power were formally invited through the ritual of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#evocatio|evocatio]]'' to take up their abode in new sanctuaries at Rome.

Communities of foreigners ''([[Peregrinus (Roman)| peregrini]])'' and former slaves ''(libertini)'' continued their own religious practices within the city. In this way [[Mithras]] came to Rome and his popularity within the [[Roman army]] spread his cult as far afield as [[Roman Britain]]. The important Roman deities were eventually identified with the more [[anthropomorphism |anthropomorphic]] Greek gods and goddesses, and assumed many of their attributes and myths.

'''Sayram''' ({{lang-kz|Сайрам}}, ''Sayram'', سايرام; {{lang-uz|Sayrom}}, ''Сайром'', سەيرام; {{lang-ar|إسفیجاب}} ''‘Isfījāb''; {{lang-fa|اسپیجاب}}, ''Espījāb/Espijâb'') is a rural locality located in southeastern [[South Kazakhstan Region]] on the Sayram Su River, which rises at the nearby 4000-meter mountain Sayram Su. In medieval times, the city and countryside were located on the banks of the [[Arys River]], into which the Sayram Su river flows. It is now a suburb of [[Shymkent]].

Michael Fergus and Zhanar Zhandosova, Stacey International Publishers, March 2004 ({{ISBN|1900988615}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Sayram is significant today for maintaining mud-brick architecture and the absence of Soviet-style architecture. There are many pre-20th-century mausoleums, and more continue to be built.

[[Archaeology]] in Central Asia was active following its conquest by the [[Russian Empire]], but remains a relatively understudied area.  There has been some field work done in the city both before and during the rise of the [[Soviet Union]], and there is likewise renewed interest in the city as one of the oldest cities of the independent country of Kazakhstan. Notable among the archaeological discoveries is evidence of an early [[plumbing]] system like the kinds found in [[Samarqand]] and other cities of the early [[Persian Empire|Persian]] empires.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

There is another city named Sayram in [[Xinjiang]], China located between [[Kucha]] and [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]], which, according to local tradition, was founded by captives captured by the [[Oirats|Qalmaqs]].&lt;ref&gt;Barthold, rev. of Tārīkh-i Amniyya, in Sochineniya, viii, 213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The oldest name of the city according to historical evidence is Isfijab (Espijâb, Isfījāb, Asfījāb), which remained until the Mongol conquest. [[Mahmud Kashgari]] mentioned it as the "White City which is called Isbījāb," suggesting its connection with the Soghdian/Persian word for white, ''sipīd'' or ''ispīd''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Bosworth, C.E. "Isfīdjāb." Encyclopædia of Islam, 2nd ed., Brill, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Kashgari also mentioned that the city was known as Sayram at that time, the name which the town bears today. The Russian [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[N. S. Lykoshin]] suggested that Sayram's correct name was ''Sar-i ayyām'', or 'Ancient of Days'.  His editor held, however, that instead of ''ayyām'', it was instead the Arabic ''yamm'', 'sea, river' and referred to the source of a stream. If the name Sayrām is actually Turkic, it probably refers to 'a place of shallow water.'&lt;ref&gt;Devin DeWeese, "Sacred History for a Central Asian Town: Saints, Shrines, and Legends of Origin in Histories of Sayrām, 18th-19th Centuries," ''Revue des mondes musulmans et de la Méditerranée'' [online], 89-90 | July 2000, uploaded May 12, 2009, accessed December 10, 2010. URL : http://remmm.revues.org/index283.html&lt;/ref&gt; To wit, [[Mahmud Kashgari|al-Kāshgharī]] gives, alongside his entry on '''Sayrām''' as the name of Isfijāb, the phrase ''seyrem sūw,'' 'shallow water,' which coincidentally is the name of the river running east of the center of the city. Kāsgharī also later notes the verb ''seyremlen''-, 'to become shallow,' with the phrase ''sūw seyremlendī'', 'the water became shallow (or scanty)'.&lt;ref&gt;al-Kàshgharî, Mahmûd, 1982–85, R. Dankoff and J. Kelly (transl.), ''Compendium of the Turkic Dialects (Diwân lughāt al-Turk)'', Sources of Oriental Languages and Literatures, 7, Turkish Sources, VII, Cambridge, Harvard University Printing Office.

==History==
[[File:World in 1000 BCE.png|thumb|left|The World at Sayram's founding]]
[[File:Map achaemenid empire en.png|thumb|Achaemenid Empire]]
[[File:Achaemenid Empire.jpg|thumb|Map of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, ca 500 BC. Sayram is not named on this map]]The modern city of Sayram celebrated its 3,000th year&lt;ref&gt;Sayram Region, 75th Anniversary. Yerkin Nurazxan, editor 2003.  Published independently.&lt;/ref&gt; of continued habitation in 1999.
Sayram is a city on the frontier between irrigated farmland and the pastures of the [[Dasht-i Qipchaq]].  It has a long history of commercial and political importance as a border town and has been the site of numerous conquests and reconquests.

===Earliest history===
Some local historians have attempted to find proof of Sayram's prehistory in the holy book of the Zoroastrian faith. They state that the first recorded mention of Sayram is in the [[Avesta]], the holy book of [[Zoroastrianism]]. There are several names mentioned, though it is possible they refer to people, places, cities, or geographic features. Historian Richard Frye states that "even guesses about their identity do not help us in reconstructing history."&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Richard. ''The Heritage of Central Asia: From Antiquity to the Turkish Expansion''. Markus Wiener Publishers, Princeton. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The word appearing in the Avesta is ''Sairima'', which some historians{{who|date=January 2013}} equate with the name Sayram. There is mention of a river, and a land or people called ''Sairima elis'', or '''people or land of/near Sayram'''.&lt;ref name="nurazxan2003"/&gt; Sayram would have been a northern border town in the northeastern reaches of the [[Achaemenid]] Empire, later conquered by Alexander.  There is no mention of Sayram in the histories surrounding the acts of Alexander.

===Before Islam===
In the 7th century, the Western Turkic Confederation consisted of five Tu-lu and five Nu-shih-pi tribes, known collectively as the On Oq (Ten Arrows) and by the Chinese as Shih Hsing (Ten Clans).&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge history of early Inner Asia. By Denis Sinor. Published by Cambridge University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-521-24304-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-24304-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 642, the ''khaqan'' ([[Khan (title)|khan]]) of the Tu-lu Turkic tribe took refuge in Isfijab from the Nu-shih-pi.&lt;ref&gt;Early mystics in Turkish literature. By Mehmet Fuat Köprülü, Gary Leiser, Robert Dankoff.  Published by Routledge, 2006. {{ISBN|0-415-36686-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-36686-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the expulsion of the heretical sects of Christianity, there came a large number of Christians to Central Asia and the East. Largest among them were the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]], who were condemned at the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431. There was a community of Nestorian Christians in Sayram when [[Islam]] first came to Sayram in [[766 AD]]&lt;ref name="nurazxan2003"/&gt; who resisted conversion. Buddhism was also prevalent in Central Asia at that time.

===Islamic Conquest===
Sayram was already an important trading site in the centuries before the Arab Conquest.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Civilizations of Central Asia''
Published by Motilal Banarsidass Publ. {{ISBN|81-208-1540-8}}, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1540-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam was brought to Sayram and its neighboring cities by a detachment of Arabic and Arabic-speaking soldier-missionaries from the already converted lands to the south. Sayram, or Isfijab as it was then known, served as a border town between the Islamic lands and the pagan Turks.&lt;ref&gt;''A history of inner Asia'', by Svatopluk Soucek. Published by Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab Conquest was led by Iskak, known today in Sayram as Iskak-bab.  The standard bearer of these soldiers of Islam was ‘Abd al-‘Azīz. One surviving manuscript, entitled ''Nasabname'', tells how the Muslim warriors under Iskak-bab came to Sayram and met with the Nestorian patriarch of Sayram, Nakhibar.
[[File:Abd al aziz baba.jpg|thumb|Three-Domed Mausoleum of ‘Abd al-‘Azīz-baba and Seyt Kozhakhan-ata, originally built by the order of [[Timur]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Iskak-bab invited Nakhibar to the true faith. But Nakhibar replied, "I am a ''tarsa'' (Christian) of the seventieth generation, and my faith is true! That is why I shall fight you." Hand-to-hand combat ensued, and lasted for three days and nights. Ten thousand Nestorian ''tarsa''s and fifteen thousand Muslim missionaries died for their faith.  The color-bearer of the Muslim forces was ‘Abd al-‘Azīz.&lt;ref&gt;''Nasabname, Book of Generations'': Sayram, Anon.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same manuscript goes on to describe Iskak-bab's building of the first mosque in Sayram, which would make it the first mosque in all of present-day Kazakhstan, as well.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"After that he set up a Friday mosque in Sayram. The first stone in the foundation was laid by his hands. He sanctified the stone with holy water."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Under the Samanids===
In 840 AD, the Samanid chief of [[Samarkand]] Nūḥ ibn Asad, wrested control of the city from the Turks. In that year, Nūḥ built a wall around it to protect it from the Turks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; By this time the city was a flourishing market center at the nexus of nomad and sedentary lands. It was also a linchpin in the broad zone of protective forts built to protect the Samanid empire from nomadic raiders. [[Moqaddasi]] numbered these fortresses, or ''ribāṭ''s, at 1,700. They built outer walls to protect the crops of the inhabitants from raiders, but the town was not only a military outpost. Traders from Bukhara and Samarkand constructed large caravanserais for themselves in Sayram.

Sayram was also the main contact between Samanid Islam and the Qaghan Turks of [[Turpan]], [[Kashgar]], and [[Kucha]]. The alternate southern routes were controlled by rival factions, leaving the primary route east through [[Farab]] and Sayram.&lt;ref&gt;''The Passion of al-Hallaj, Mystic and Martyr of Islam''. By Louis Massignon, Herbert Mason. Published by Princeton University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-691-01919-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-01919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sayram is significant for maintaining a degree of independence from the Samanids, remaining a possession of the local Turkic dynasty. The rulers owed three signs of loyalty to the Samanids: military service, the presentation of symbolic gifts, and the name of the Samanid ruler on minted currency.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Civilizations of Central Asia'' by M.S. Asimov, Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson, Ahmad Hasan Dani, Unesco, Clifford Edmund Bosworth, Muḥammad Osimī, János Harmatta, Boris Abramovich Litvinovskiĭ.  Published by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Sayram at this time was one-third the size of Banākath (now in ruins near present-day Chinoz, Uzbekistan), the chief town of the neighboring district of Shāsh (present-day [[Tashkent]]).

Sayram was divided into three districts, like others of the time: ''qohandez'' (citadel), ''madīnah'' (inner town), and ''rabaż'' (suburb), the latter two being protected by walls. All the houses were of mud brick. The government center (''dār al-imārah''), the prison, and the Friday mosque were all in the inner city. There were four main gates to the inner town, each guarded by a ''ribat'' manned by ''[[ghazi (warrior)|ghāzī]]''s (volunteer fighters for the faith) recruited from [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]]. The ruler of Sayram apparently also exercised some authority within the steppes, since [[Moqaddasi]] mentions that the "king of the Turkmen" at nearby rdū habitually sent presents to Asfījāb.

===Under the Qarakhanids===
The [[Qarakhanids]] seized the city in 980, during the reign of [[Nuh II of Samanid|Nuh II]] of the [[Samanid]] Empire.&lt;ref name="blair1992"/&gt;  At this time, according to [[al-Istakhri]], the city marked the border between Karluks and [[Oghuz Turks|Oğuz Turks]].&lt;ref&gt;''Peoples of Central Asia'' by Lawrence Krader. Published by Indiana University, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Sayram was part of the eastern Qarakhanid khanate based on three cities: Sayram itself, Talas, and Farghāna. Coins were minted there by the Qarakhanid rulers.&lt;ref&gt;O. Pritsak, "Die Karachaniden," ''Der Islam'' 31, 1954, pp. 36-38&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening years of the 7th/13th century, the district seems to have been taken over by the Qipchaqs of the middle Syr Darya, for the [[Khwārazm-Shāh dynasty|Khorezmshah]] ʿAlāʾ al-dīn Muḥammad devastated the area beyond the Syr Darya to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Mongol leader Küchlüg.

===Sayram under the Mongols===
The city of Sayram was captured by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] using catapults under the command of the Siet Alahai.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1910"&gt;''Mediaeval Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources: Fragments Towards the Knowledge of the Geography and History of Central and Western Asia from the 13th to the 17th Century'', E. Bretschneider. K. Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; co., ltd, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1220, the Taoist monk [[Qiu Chuji]] left his home town of [[Shandong]] in northern China and traveled to Persia to present himself before Genghis Khan. His fame as a pious exemplar of Taoist belief had preceded him,&lt;ref&gt;Bartold, V. V. (1963). Sochineniia. Moskva,, Izd-vo vostochnoi lit-ry. p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; and his travels carried him over roads newly restored by the Mongols, roads that were then in better condition than when the Russian imperial orientalist V. V. Barthold described them in the early 20th century. Qui Chuji (Chan-Chun, or Чан-чунь in Barthold's work) traveled through the land of the [[Uyghurs]], through [[Yining City|Kulja]], through [[Zhetysu]], crossing first the [[Chu River]] on a wooden bridge, then the [[Talas River]] on a bridge of stone, before reaching Sayram in November 1221.&lt;ref&gt;Bartold, V. V. (1963). Sochineniia. Moskva,, Izd-vo vostochnoi lit-ry. p. 518&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of Sayram is mentioned in some detail in Qui Chuji's book&lt;ref&gt;^Si You Ki: Travels to the West of Kiu Ch‘ang Ch‘un, by Emil Bretschneider, in ''Medieval Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources'', vol. 1 (1888) Trubner &amp; Co, London; Reprint by Elibron Classics {{ISBN|1-4021-9303-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Travels to the West of Qiu Chang Chun|Travels to the Western Regions]]'', recorded by his disciples after Chuji returned home.

[[Genghis Khan]] camped in Sayram, and awaited the arrival of his sons in 1223.&lt;ref&gt;''Turkestan Down to the Mongol Invasion'', by Vasiliĭ Vladimirovich Bartolʹd Published by Luzac, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;  Sayram's neighbor to the west was not so lucky, the doomed city of [[Otrar]], also called Utrar or Farab, and the birthplace of [[Al-Farabi]], which was utterly destroyed by the Mongol leader.

The famous historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid-al-Din]] (1247–1318）wrote that Sayram was also known as Kary Sailam (Old Sayram). At that time it was a large city with forty gates, and it took one whole day to cross the city.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;''Mediaeval Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources: Fragments Towards the Knowledge of the Geography and History of Central and Western Asia from the 13th to the 17th Century'', E. Bretschneider.  K. Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; co., ltd, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sayram under Timur===
It is unclear when the city fell under [[Tamerlane|Timur's]] rule. Under the [[Timurids]], Sayram was an important border city, a center of trade, and Timur gave rule of the city to his grandson [[Ulugbek]].&lt;ref&gt;''Four Studies on the History of Central Asia'' by Vasiliĭ Vladimirovich Bartolʹd. Published by E.J. Brill, 1963, University of California&lt;/ref&gt; In 1404, the right wing of [[Tamerlane|Timur's]] China-bound invasion force wintered in Sayram, Tashkent, and Banākath.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1910"/&gt;
‘Abd al-Razzāq wrote that in 1410 the fortress of Sayram was besieged by Moghul forces, and by the end of the 15th century was given to [[Yunus Khan]] of Moghulistan, where his son was reigning in 1496.

During the [[Ming dynasty]], envoy [[Chen Cheng (Ming dynasty)|Chen Cheng]] was sent by the [[Yongle Emperor]] to the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] khanate and subsequently dedicated one chapter of his book [[Xi yu fan guo zhi|A Record of the Barbarian Countries in the Western Region]] to Sayram.&lt;ref&gt;E. Bretschneider, Mediaeval Researches Vol. 2, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of the Timurid power, in the middle of the 15th century, Sayram was raided regularly (along with [[Turkestan (City)|Turkestan]]) by the Moghul amir Mir Haqq-Berdi Bekichek.&lt;ref&gt;V. V. Barthold, "History of the Semirechyé," in Barthold, ''Four Studies on the History of Central Asia'', tr. V. and T. Minorsky (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962), vol. I, pp. 137-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sayram under Muhammad Shaybani===
[[Muhammad Shaybani Khan|Shaybani Khan]] took Sayram in 1503.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;  With the coming of Uzbek power in the region, Sayram fell to Muhammad Shaybani Khan along with the rest of the region. However, peace in the region was elusive. The [[Kazakhs]] soon grew in power and Sayram became a common prize of raids and wars between the Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and [[Dzungar people|Qalmaqs]].

===Sayram under Kazakhs and Zunghars===
In 1512, the keys of the city were given to [[Qasim Khan]], Khan of the Kazakhs when he came to the city. In [[Babur]]'s account, no khan was as respected or authoritative as Qasim, who could command over 300,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Howorth, Henry. ''History of the Mongols'' from the 9th to the 19th Century. Part II: The So-Called Tartars of Russia and Central Asia''. Burt Franklin, New York. 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manṣūr Khān led an Uzbek force against the Kazakhs in 1522 in response to their raids from the region of Sayram into the [[Fergana Valley|Farghana]].&lt;ref&gt;Tārīkh-i Rashīdī, tr. Elias and Ross, 79, 358&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of this expedition to control Kazakh raids effectively ended attempts by the Uzbeks to control Sayram and its region.

The rise of the collection of Oirat clans into what became known as the [[Zunghar Khanate]] in the 1600s saw much of what is now southern Kazakhstan leave the control of the Kazakh Khans. The historian Barthold argued that only after [[Galdan Boshugtu Khan]], the [[Khong Tayiji]] of the Zunghars, had successfully conquered and destroyed the power of Sayram did he move his encampment west to the valley of the Ili, ensuring his control of [[Zhetysu]] east of Sayram. Galdan sent forces against Sayram in 1681, which must have been unsuccessful because they returned in 1683, when Barthold tells us that his commander Rabtan (probably [[Tsewang Rabtan]] took the city and razed it.&lt;ref&gt;V. V. Barthold, "History of the Semirechyé," in Barthold, Four Studies on the History of Central Asia, tr. V. and T. Minorsky (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962), pp. 98-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sayram was slowly rebuilt, likely with the support of the merchants of Central Asia and the leadership of the Kazakhs. This knowledge comes from the fact that the city appears again as a target of Zunghar aggression forty years later.

In 1723, the year of the [[Barefooted Flight]] of the Kazakhs, Sayram, Turkistān, and Tashkent passed under the control of the [[Oirats|Qalmaqs]] and remained within their control until their destruction by the Chinese in 1758.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Brill, ''The Encyclopæedia of Islam'' 1913–1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sayram under the Khanate of Kokand===
The city of Sayram was taken by the Ming of the [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand Khanate]] in 1810. The local Qazaq population, and possibly the local sedentary population, revolted against Kokand control in 1820-1.&lt;ref&gt;Bregel, Yuri. ''An Historical Atlas of Central Asia''. Handbook of Oriental Studies, sec. 8, vol. 9- Leiden: Brill, 2003. xi&lt;/ref&gt;  There is little mention of Sayram in regional histories until its fall to the Russians in 1864, by which time the nearby city of [[Chimkent]] had already begun to eclipse Sayram in local importance.

===Sayram under the Russians===
After the [[Russian Empire|Russian conquest]] in 1864, several new villages were founded around Sayram.  They were found to be prosperous by I. I. Geier, a local Russian journalist/historian writing in the first decade of the 20th century, though Sayram was still noted for its superior wheat, horse market, historical background, and many tombs.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Brill, ''Encyclopæedia of Islam''. 1913–1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sayram under the Soviet Union===
During [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union|National delimitation]], the area of Sayram was at one point part of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkistan ASSR]]. At that time, the majority of modern-day Kazakhstan, including the steppe regions, were part of the separate [[Kirgizistan ASSR]]. After this period of border drawing and redrawing, Sayram eventually became part of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]]. It remains in the successor independent country of the Kazakh SSR, [[Kazakhstan]].

==Demographics==
[[File:Sko-history.gif|thumb|Sayram's [[minaret]]]]The population of over 40,000 is roughly 95% Uzbek, 3% Kazakh, and 1% Russian, with the remainder being Uzbek-speaking Azeris, Chechens, Tajiks, and Iranians. Sayram is a city of observant Muslims, and the [[Adhan|call to prayer]] can be heard from the city's mosques.

The economy of [[Economy of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] being much stronger than Uzbekistan's, Sayram has seen an increase of migrant laborers from Uzbekistan, as well as those coming to stay as permanent residents.

===Ethnic groups===
The citizens of modern Sayram are ethnic [[Uzbeks]]. There is small minority of other ethnicities, mostly [[Kazakhs]].

===Religion===
[[File:Sayram Main Mosque.jpeg|right|thumb|Sayram's Friday Mosque, built in the last ten years by donations from foreign philanthropists.]]
The religion of the inhabitants of Sayram is [[Islam]]. Like most of [[Islam in Central Asia|Central Asia's Muslims]], the people of Sayram follow the [[Hanafi]] school of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]].

==Main sights==
[[File:Sayram Gate.jpg|left|thumb|Main Gate of Sayram]]
[[File:Sayram minaret.JPG|thumb|Minaret to the Kydyr mosque, 10th century. Roughly 45 feet (15 meters) tall.]]
[[File:SayramNewMausoleum.jpg|thumb|left|The newest mausoleum in Sayram today was built and finished in 2005 for Botbay Ata.]]
Modern Sayram is still very much a part of ancient Central Asia. Unlike most of Kazakhstan, it bears almost no mark of Soviet planning or modernization. The streets curve in many directions, while the center of the town occupies the same crossroads that have been used for centuries. There are no apartments in the city proper, and no buildings more than two stories high, allowing the skyline to be dominated by the domes of local minarets, mosques, and mausoleums, some more than 1,000 years old.

==Transportation==
Sayram is reachable via a ten- to fifteen-minute bus, taxi, or [[route taxi|marshrutka]] ride from [[Shymkent]], which is host to an international airport that also receives domestic flights from Kazakhstan's international hubs [[Almaty]] and [[Astana]].

[[File:Turkestan.jpg|thumb|Ahmad Yasawi's mausoleum, bearing the largest dome in Central Asia, located in [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkestan]]]]
The man who later became Khoja Ahmad Yasavi was born in Sayram. The date of his birth is difficult to ascertain from historical documents, and later 13th-century [[hagiography|hagiographical]] sources show evidence of pushing the date of his life to before the Mongol Conquest, i.e. c. 1103–1166.&lt;ref&gt;Zarcone, Th. "Yasawiyya." ''Encyclopædia of Islam'', 2nd ed., Brill, 2010. Brill Online.&lt;/ref&gt; This chronology is generally accepted in contemporary Central Eurasian studies. His first teacher was Hazrat Shayh Shahobiddin Isfijabi. Today he is known by the nickname Oqota Baba (White Grandfather). Near his mausoleum, there is a small stream bridged by the main road into Sayram. This bridge is the focus of a local legend concerning the meeting of Ahmad as a boy and the great wanderer Arslan Bab.

According to legend,&lt;ref&gt;''No Counting the Saints in Sayram'', Makhmut Nursalaev (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Arslan was one of the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]'s followers.  He had already lived 300 years before meeting Muhammad, and was well versed in all of the world's religions, though he chose to follow Islam alone. As Muhammad's death drew near, he asked his followers who would take the stone of his holy date, a carrier of all Islamic knowledge, and give it to the next generation. Arslan replied that he would gladly bear this burden, and taking the stone, continued on his journey. Hundreds of years later, as he passed through the small town of Isfijab, Arslan Baba [his title of respect]&lt;ref&gt;Algar, H. "Bāb." ''Encyclopedia Iranica''. Originally published December 15, 1988. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bab]&lt;/ref&gt; was stopped on the road by a young boy. "Grandfather, give me my date stone!" demanded the young Ahmad. Arslan relinquished the stone, and following the death of Ahmad's father in 1113, journeyed with Ahmad to Yasi. [[File:Arslan legend.jpg|thumb|Sign in Sayram (written in [[Uzbek Language|Uzbek]]) marking the bridge where Arslan Baba passed a persimmon stone to young [[Ahmad Yasavi]]]] From there Ahmad became a prize pupil and one of the rising stars of [[Sufism]].  Arslan Baba finally succumbed to old age and was buried near [[Otrar]]. Following Arslan's death, Ahmad moved to Bukhara and followed the studies of [[Yusuf Hamadani]] before moving to [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Yasi]].

====The Yasavi Order====
He spent the majority of his life in Yasi, taking the name Ahmad Yasawi.  His order is known as the Yasawiyya/Yasavi, and is particularly important in the history of the region, as well as in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Basic Views of Khoja Ahmad Yasavî and His Followers''. Tosun, Necdet. ''Ekev Academic Review'', vol. 13, issue 38 (Winter 2009), p. 29-38&lt;/ref&gt;  Their order was known for its disdain for hypocrisy and also the inclusion of certain historic Central Eurasian traditions identified with [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Manichaeism]].&lt;ref&gt;Zarcone, Th. "Yasawiyya." ''Encyclopædia of Islam', 2nd ed., Brill, 2010. Brill Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest historical record of the Yasavi Order comes from Hakim Ata, and the uncertainty surrounding Ahmad's order stems from the confusion regarding the multiple dates given for Hakim's life and possible direct descent from Ahmad as the second, third, fourth, or fifth generation of the order.&lt;ref&gt;DeWeese, Devin. "Ḥakim Aṭā", ''Encyclopedia Iranica''. Originally published December 15, 2003. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hakim-ata]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad's mother and father are buried in Sayram. Their mausoleums are both major sites of pilgrimage today, drawing pilgrims from all over Central Asia: [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and the surrounding area. [[Timur|Tīmūr ibn Taraghay Barlas]] decreed that a [[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi|mausoleum]] be raised over the site of the Sufi's grave.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2397">'''Simon Iff''' is the [[protagonist]] of a series of short [[Detective fiction|detective stories]] written by [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]]. He is portrayed as a mystic, a magician and a great detective with a thorough insight into human [[psychology]].

The stories typically revolve around an apparently unsolvable crime, which is eventually untangled by Iff's magical and psychological logic. Crowley explained the method of crafting a Simon Iff story in simple terms:

{{quote|Think of a situation as inexplicable as possible, then to stop up all the chinks with putty, and having satisfied myself that no explanation was possible, to make a further effort and find one.&lt;ref&gt;''The Confessions of Aleister Crowley'', Arkana Publishing, 1989 p.830: {{ISBN|0-14-019189-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Publication history==
The Simon Iff stories were written during a visit to [[New Orleans]] in December 1916, primarily as a means of alleviating Crowley's financial hardships. The mystic was verging on bankruptcy, a result of his lifestyle, and extravagant self-publishing, while having never earned a wage. The initial collection of six stories which Crowley penned would be labelled ''The Scrutinies of Simon Iff.''  Crowley would later write twelve more stories under the title ''Simon Iff in America'', six stories as ''Simon Iff Abroad'', and two final stories as ''Simon Iff Psychoanalyst.''  ''The Scrutinies of Simon Iff'' were first published in 1917-1918 in the New York publication ''The International'' under the pseudonym Edward Kelly ( presumably a nod to [[Edward Kelley]], the Elizabethan alchemist and enochian magician). There is an edition of ''The Scutinies of Simon Iff''  published by Teitan Press: {{ISBN|0-933429-02-9}}, while a 2012 Wordsworth Editions release ({{ISBN|978-1-84022-678-2}}), under their "Tales of Mystery &amp; the Supernatural" line, contains the complete works.  As with most of Crowley's work, the Iff stories are practically unheard of outside of occult circles.

Simon Iff also appears in Crowley's most widely read novel ''[[Moonchild (novel)|Moonchild]]'' (1929).

'''Trina Robbins''' (born Trina Perlson, 1938)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Riesman |first1=Abraham |title=The Story of Trina Robbins, the Controversial Feminist Who Revolutionized Comic Books |url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/04/meet-trina-robbins-the-feminist-who-revolutionized-comics.html |work=Vulture |date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[People of the United States|American]] cartoonist. She was an early and influential participant in the [[underground comix]] movement, and one of the first few female artists in that movement. Both as a cartoonist and historian, Robbins has long been involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists. In the 1980s, Robbins became the first woman to draw ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' comics. She is a member of the [[Will Eisner Hall of Fame]].

==Career==

=== Early work ===
Robbins was an active member of [[science fiction fandom]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Her illustrations appeared in [[science fiction fanzines]] like the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]]-[[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|nominated]] [[Habakkuk (fanzine)|''Habakkuk'']].

=== Comics ===
Robbins' first comics were printed in the ''[[East Village Other]]''; she also contributed to the spin-off underground comic ''[[Gothic Blimp Works]]''.

In 1969, Robbins designed the costume for the [[Warren Publishing]] character [[Vampirella]], for artist [[Frank Frazetta]] in ''Vampirella'' #1 (Sept. 1969).&lt;ref name=arndt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Index%20Only.htm | first=Richard J.|last=Arndt|title=The Warren Magazines| publisher=EnjolrasWorld.com | date = September 22, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710194128/http://enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Index%20Only.htm| archivedate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She left New York for [[San Francisco]] in 1970, where she worked at the feminist [[underground newspaper]] ''It Ain't Me, Babe''. That same year she, along with fellow female artist [[Barbara "Willy" Mendes]], established the first all-woman comic book, the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[It Ain't Me, Babe (comic)|''It Ain't Me, Babe Comix'']].&lt;ref name="Krensky74"&gt;Krensky, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan79&gt;Kaplan, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; From this period on, Robbins became increasingly involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists, through projects such as the [[comics anthology]] ''[[Wimmen's Comix]]'', with which she was involved for twenty years. ''Wimmen's Comix'' #1 featured Robbins' "Sandy Comes Out", the first-ever comic strip featuring an "out" [[lesbian]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Arie. ''Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed!''. (Chicago Review Press, 2006) {{ISBN|1-55652-633-4}}, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Robin (July 31, 1994). "Where Women Rule: The World of Lesbian Cartoons". ''The Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review'' 1 (3): 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins became increasingly outspoken in her beliefs, criticizing underground comix artist [[Robert Crumb]] for the perceived misogyny of many of his comics. She said, "It's weird to me how willing people are to overlook the hideous darkness in Crumb's work&amp;nbsp;... What the hell is funny about rape and murder?"&lt;ref name="Sabin-92"&gt;Sabin, Roger (1996). "Going underground". ''Comics, Comix &amp; Graphic Novels: A History Of Comic Art''. London, United Kingdom: Phaidon Press. pp. 92. {{ISBN|0-7148-3008-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s Robbins created adaptations of [[Sax Rohmer]]'s ''Dope'' and [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[The Silver Metal Lover]]''. In the mid-1980s she wrote and drew ''Misty'' for the [[Marvel Comics]] children's imprint [[Star Comics]]. The short-lived series was a reinterpretation of the long-standing character [[Millie the Model]], now an adult running her own modeling agency and minding her niece Misty.

Robbins' official involvement with [[Wonder Woman]], a character she had long admired, began in 1986. At the conclusion of the first volume of the series (in conjunction with the series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), [[DC Comics]] published a four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''The Legend of Wonder Woman'', written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and drawn by Robbins. Robbins was the first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ultra Nerdy |url=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2014/11/05/trina-robbins-wonder-woman-comics/ |title=Q &amp; A with Trina Robbins – first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics (with video) &amp;#124; Vancouver Sun |publisher=Blogs.vancouversun.com |date=2014-11-05 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series paid homage to the character's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] roots. She also appeared as herself in ''Wonder Woman Annual 2'' (1989). In the mid-1990s, Robbins criticized artist [[Mike Deodato]]'s "[[bad girl art]]" portrayal of Wonder Woman, calling Deodato's version of the character a "barely clothed hypersexual [[pin-up girl|pinup]]."&lt;ref&gt;Trina Robbins, ''The Great Women Superheroes'' (Kitchen Sink Press, 1996) {{ISBN|0-87816-481-2}}, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Robbins collaborated with [[Colleen Doran]] on the [[DC Comics]] graphic novel ''Wonder Woman: The Once and Future Story'', on the subject of [[spousal abuse]].

Robbins has been writing the comic book adventures of [[Honey West]], notable as being one of popular fiction's first female [[private detective]]s.

=== Writing and activism ===
In addition to her comics work, Robbins is an author of nonfiction books on the history of women in cartooning.

Her first book, co-written with [[Catherine Yronwode]], was ''Women and the Comics,'' a history of female comic-strip and comic-book creators. As one of the first books ever published on this subject, it was covered in the mainstream press, in addition to the fan press.&lt;ref&gt;"Women in the Comics: Assertive and Independent Women Make a Comeback" [[Miami Herald]] (newspaper), December 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Comic Books Are For Adults Too" by William Singleton, Scripps Howard News Service, Chronicle-Telegram (newspaper), January 7, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Funny How Things Change" ''Daily Herald'' (newspaper), December 28, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Robbins volumes on women in the comics industry include ''A Century of Women Cartoonists'' (Kitchen Sink, 1993), ''The Great Women Superheroes'' (Kitchen Sink, 1997), ''From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women’s Comics from Teens to Zines'' (Chronicle, 1999), and ''The Great Women Cartoonists'' (Watson-Guptill, 2001). Her most recent work, ''Pretty In Ink'', published by Fantagraphics, covers the history of North American women in comics from Rose O'Neill's 1896 strip ''The Old Subscriber Calls'' to present.&lt;ref&gt;added Pretty in Ink reference&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins was a co-founder of [[Friends of Lulu]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilonsky, Robert (May 18, 2000). "Fatal femmes: Why do women in comics become Women in Refrigerators?". ''Dallas Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit formed in 1994 to promote readership of comic books by women and the participation of women in the comic book industry.

Robbins is featured in the feminist history film ''[[She's Beautiful When She's Angry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/women/|title=The Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/the-film/ |title=The Film — She's Beautiful When She's Angry |publisher=Shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Robbins was intimately involved in the 1960s rock scene, where she was close friends with [[Jim Morrison]] and [[The Byrds]]. She is the first of the three "Ladies of the Canyon" in [[Joni Mitchell]]'s classic song from the album of the [[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|same name]].&lt;ref name=Weller293&gt;Weller, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s she ran an East Village clothing boutique called "Broccoli" and made clothes for [[Mama Cass]], [[Donovan]], [[David Crosby]] and others.&lt;ref name="hollywoodhangover1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodhangover.com/htm_files/part_eight.htm |title=Fresh Photos - Part Eight |publisher=Hollywoodhangover.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written a memoir entitled ''Last Girl Standing'', scheduled for release in 2017 from [[Fantagraphics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13521">The '''United Nation of Islam''' (UNOI) is a  group based in [[Kansas City, Kansas]] and offshoot of [[Nation of Islam]].  It was founded circa 1978 by Royall Jenkins, who continues to be the leader of the group and styles himself Royall, Allah in Person.  They have since changed their name to "Food for Life Supreme", "Value Creators" and most recently "Promise Keepers".
{{Nation of Islam|Subsidiaries}}

==History==
[[Image:Royall Allah In Person UNOI.png|thumb|262px|Royall Elliot Jenkins]]
Royall Jenkins was born in 1942 in South Carolina and grew up in eastern Maryland, later moving to New York and then Chicago, while working as a long-distance truck driver delivering publications of the [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI). He remained a member until after the death of [[Elijah Muhammad]] but split from the organization in 1978. According to Jenkins, he spent time on a [[Unidentified flying object|spaceship]] with [[angels]], where he learned that he was the [[Supreme Being]] and how to govern the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unitednationofislam.com/nationbuilding/nationbuilding_008.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603222225/http://unitednationofislam.com/nationbuilding/nationbuilding_008.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public records show Jenkins working as a truck driver and living mostly with friends as he tried to recruit followers, including his daughter Maureen, who joined him in 1985 in a house in [[Waldorf, Maryland]]. The house was rented for them by Joseph Kelly, one of Jenkins' first converts. The UNOI eventually grew, and was [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as a [[nonprofit organization]] in [[New Jersey]] in 1993.

Between 1996 and 2002, the group relocated to its current [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]] location.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan Corrigan, ''Your community ... in renewal'', Kansas City Star, 2004-05-12&lt;/ref&gt; The UNOI is very controversial and currently has a membership of a few hundred people.

==Beliefs==
The beliefs of the UNOI are based on the beliefs of the NOI with considerable modifications by Jenkins. While believing that [[Allah]] came in the person of [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], founder of the NOI, Jenkins claims that he himself is Allah in his own person who is more powerful and who is given the task of coercing the submission of all things and perfecting everything used to magnify Him, after which ''men'' [specifically males] will all be God,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?topic=32.0 |title=Allah - By Royall, Allah In Person&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144901/http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?topic=32.0 |archive-date=2011-07-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or gods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?topic=755.0 Being One With The Man-Royall, Allah In Person July 26, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenkins stresses the relations between different [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]s and [[sex]]es, referring extensively to black man, black woman, and white man. Black men are said to be the real and original men,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?topic=662.0 Being a Man - By Royall, Allah In Person - December 12, 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas white people are claimed to have been created by a scientist named [[Yakub (Nation of Islam)|Yakub]] 6,000 years ago, the same belief held, at least in a metaphorical sense, by followers of the NOI prior to the death of [[Elijah Muhammad]]. Jenkins also claims that black men created black women as a natural pleasure, that women are inferior, and that following female guidance leads to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?topic=94.0 The Sure Way To Hell - By Royall, Allah In Person-June 18, 2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that black women are in league with white men, whom he considers enemies, and condemns women seeking child support, custody, and alimony though courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?topic=736.0 Woe, to the Black Woman, Part I-By Royall, Allah In Person&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNOI Web site"&gt;[http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?board=4.0 Center Page !!!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenkins also claims that the current NOI has been led astray by its leader [[Louis Farrakhan]], whom he asserts is the most "formidable enemy to Allah,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?topic=102.0 Divine Judgement - By ROYALL, Allah in Person&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and that Farrakhan uses tricks and deceptive tactics to "silence anyone else's voice" and "prepare the masses to fight for him," through appearing "to be against the Whiteman {{sic}} and his government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?topic=27.0 Louis Farrakhan's War Tactics - By Royall, Allah In Person&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Members of the UNOI work as unpaid labor in various businesses owned by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;The Perks of Cult Life by Prostell Thomas (a memoir) {{ISBN|0615834639}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNOI-owned businesses include a full-service gas station (Your Gas Station), several restaurants and bakeries, a sewing factory, an urgent-care medical facility (Your Colonic Center) and a construction company, among others.&lt;ref name="christiansciencemonitor"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   UNOI claims that it provides for all the needs of all full-time volunteers.  The group has roughly 200 full-time members in Kansas City, with perhaps 300 spread across several other cities.  Most of the latter are part-time.&lt;ref name="pitch"&gt;{{cite news

UNOI hosts several call-in TV and radio programs across the United States. Jenkins appears regularly on these programs, as well as touring various US cities. The UNOI also offers classes and has a Web site that provides extensive writings by Jenkins and recordings of his TV appearances.

After moving to Kansas City in 1996 (although its headquarters was not moved there until 2001), the UNOI received commendations for apparently aiding in the [[urban renewal|renewal]] of an area along Quindaro Boulevard that had a reputation for high crime rates and as a [[slum]]. The group purchased several properties in the area at minimal prices and used them to house its various businesses. As this happened, crime rates fell dramatically and property values rose.&lt;ref name="kansan1"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donovan Corrigan, "Your community...in renewal," ''Kansas City Star'', 2004-05-12&lt;/ref&gt; Commendations extended to the [[Wyandotte County]] government donating several additional (vacant) buildings to UNOI.

==Controversy==
Critics of the UNOI note that members work for Jenkins' benefit in UNOI businesses and receive no income, apply for and receive welfare from the government, and are given only the minimal necessities for survival, while UNOI uses the funds for their own benefit (including free vacations in the [[Caribbean]]). UNOI members and their children are required to be educated by the UNOI, which does not instruct them in many basic skills or provide opportunity for [[academic accreditation|accredited]] [[higher education]]. Members receive health insurance and are not permitted to receive medical care outside that offered by the UNOI at Your Colonic Center, which does not include any physicians licensed in Kansas. At least one child of UNOI members has died without being taken to Kansas City emergency medical services.&lt;ref name="pitch"/&gt;

The UNOI has also overstated its success—on one occasion stating that the Kansas City site is free of all crime, in the same month as a gunman fired twenty shots at a UNOI-run gas station. The Kansas City police department said it was unable to judge the effectiveness of UNOI in reducing crime. In 2002, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported five health violations at a UNOI-operated diner. In 2003, the gas station was the UNOI's only profitable business.

Jenkins has taken several wives from among his followers, including a teenaged stepdaughter (after having [[impregnate]]d her). From these unions, he has fathered at least 15 children.&lt;ref name="pitch"/&gt;  Jenkins claims that he is justified in practicing [[polygamy]], comparing himself to [[Solomon]] and claiming "In the near future, a man will be known for his wisdom according to the number of wives that he has."&lt;ref name="UNOI website"&gt;[http://unoi.org/forums/index.php?board=4.0 Center Page !!!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable among the UNOI's critics are at least ten former members, including Moreen and Hanif Jenkins, two of Royall Jenkins' children from his first marriage. Hanif was a member of the UNOI for six months and then became a critic of its operations. Moreen joined the UNOI in 1985. She claimed that she married Joseph Kelly, one of the first members of the UNOI, and also studied UNOI theology for several hours a day for years. In 1997, Royall Jenkins declared that Kelly was a [[reincarnation]] of [[Elijah Muhammad]], a claim that the NOI rejected. In 2002 Moreen Jenkins claimed her father threatened her life and the life of her youngest child after she attempted to apologize to the victim of a beating by UNOI members. She then took her infant child and left UNOI. Members continued to harass her. She stated that the UNOI was blocking her attempts to communicate with her other children and her attempts to gain custoy. As of 2003, she had filed for divorce and still sought custody of her children.&lt;ref name="pitch"/&gt; Moreen died at her home on October 14, 2008, shortly after her 45th birthday.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/kansascity/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=119303763]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the UNOI stated that Moreen Jenkins was "operating out of vengeance, scorn, anger, desire and treachery" and proposed that she seduced reporters with "the guise of a scoop." In the same statement, Royall Jenkins is quoted as announcing “the time when those who conspire against the rise of the Blackman —including Black women—will no longer be tolerated."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;UNOI Web site&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, Jenkins described his daughter as a traitor, stated "the death of my daughter Moreen was more than justified" and exhorted his followers not to mourn.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In June 2018, the United Nation of Islam was profiled on [[A%26E_(TV_channel)|A&amp;E]]'s ''Cults &amp; Extreme Belief'', a television show where host [[Elizabeth Vargas]] and others interview former members of organizations considered [[cult|cults]], talking to them about how they became involved and their allegations of abuse. In the episode, former members talks about their allegations of human trafficking, unpaid labor, neglect and abuse of children of members of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aetv.com/shows/cults-and-extreme-belief|title=Cults and Extreme Belief Full Episodes, Video &amp; More|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human trafficking lawsuit ==
In September 2017 Kendra Ross brought a civil suit against the UNOI stating that she was forced into unpaid work for 10 years and made to move to various cities from the age of 11 until she escaped at 21. She was forcibly separated from her mother at 12. Her lawyer stated that "“This organization just took away her childhood...They stripped her of 19 years of her life, forced her to work for no pay, and subjected her to just inhumane conditions.” She was forced to marry another member who was chosen by a "psychic doctor". A Federal judge awarded her approximately $8 million in damages.&lt;ref name="Human trafficking"&gt;{{cite news |title=Human trafficking victim, forced to work 10 years for no pay, awarded $8 million by federal judge |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2018/05/30/human-trafficking-victim-forced-to-work-10-years-for-no-pay-awarded-8-million-by-federal-judge/?utm_term=.b7ef3943719d |accessdate=10 July 2018 |work=Washington Post |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14079">'''Yehowists'''  (also '''Yehowist-Ilyinites, Ilyinists, Ilyintsy, Jehovists, Sect of the Right-hand Brotherhood, The Message of Zion''', {{lang-ru|Ильинцы, секта десного братства, иеговисты, еговисты, Сионская весть}}) is a Russian [[Spiritual Christianity|Spiritual Christian]] [[millenarian]] religious movement founded by retired army officer and religious thinker Nikolai Ilyin in the 1840s.

==Yehowists before the Revolution==
During Ilyin's life and due to sending bulk booklets both by Ilyin and by his followers groups of Ilyinites were founded in different parts of the Russian Empire. The center of the movement before the Revolution remained in Ural but individual groups were also formed in Transcaucasia, Northern Caucasus and Ukraine. Ilyinites were persecuted periodically, and quite often they were punished by exiling to [[Central Asia]] and other parts of the Russian Empire. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Russians were populating parts of [[Kazakhstan]] and northern [[Kyrgyzstan]]. There were Yehowists among settlers who discovered that new places provide more religious freedom than they had in Russian regions.

==Yehowists during the Soviet period==
Ilyinites took the revolution of 1917 indifferently. Their teaching prohibits them to take action in military clashes and killing, however Ilyinites expected to get more religious freedom after the revolution. In 1939 a secret center of Ilyinites was discovered and closed by NKVD in Nizhny Tagil city in Ural. During the Soviet period Ilyinites had to hide their activity; some of them were persecuted, arrested; their religious literature was confiscated. Quite often young men refused to serve in the army, which resulted in criminal prosecution and in some cases in capital punishment. Nevertheless, Yehowists kept on distributing Ilyin's booklets both printed secretly and hand-written or copied with a copying paper. Yehowists are not a registered organization believing that there is no need in getting registered with the authorities that belong to [[Satan]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Religious publications about Yehowists made during the Soviet period are scarce and contain wrong data about Yehowists. They stated that Ilyinites ceased to exist as a religious movement and also tried to represent Yehowists as part or a branch of Jehovah's Witnesses, which is totally incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;See Modern Yehowism by Moskalenko A., Novosibirsk: Science, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yehowists today==
The Yehowist Movement (frequently referred to by its members as Brotherhood) continues to exist in parts of the former Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovists-Il’inites. A Russian Millenarian Movement" by Sergey V. Petrov, Nova Religio 9, no. 3 (March 2006): 86-89. See abstract online at http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/nr.2006.9.3.080&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Southern Russia, and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;History of religions by Dmitry Taevsky – Yehowists-Ilyinites (the Righteous brotherhood, Message of Zion).&lt;/ref&gt; Most Yehowists are ethnic Russians, although the percentage of non-Russian members is growing due to conversion. The period is characterized by new forms of distribution of religious literature; in particular Ilyinites actively use the Internet translating Ilyin's works to other languages. Yehowists run a multilingual website - http://svetoch.org&lt;ref&gt;[http://svetoch.org Universal Theological Truth]&lt;/ref&gt; offering both Russian originals intended for the public at large and also English, German, Hebrew, Greek, Polish and Kyrgyz translations. Invitations to visit the site are posted periodically on forums and other sites in the Russian segment of the Internet.

The Yehowist population is small and there are no accurate estimates to the number of Yehowists because it is a closed religious organization. Ilyinites never provide any information about their population and also about internal life and activity of their communities. Their population is believed to grow due to proselytism.

==Yehowist theology==
Ilyin's teaching in today's representation is a quite sophisticated and philosophical concept, which focuses on such aspects as 1000 year kingdom, physical immortality of man, upcoming battle between Yehowah and Satan in Armageddon. Despite the fact that Ilying was a proponent of polytheism he focused on two Gods only: [[Yehowah]] and [[Satan]]. According to Ilyin there are two ManGods of equal strength in our Solar system - Yehowah and Satan. There are other Gods outside the Earth and the Solar system but they are not empowered to deal with earthly people and people must not worship them.&lt;ref&gt;The religion started after getting the Book from Heaven.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about Yehowah Ilying said: "...THE ONLY GOD over people, and HE is the only ONE, who has keys to death and graves... and HE is the only ONE, whom we should worship and pray about everything..." Gods like people exist in human form. Yehowism totally denies existence of a soul, paradise and hell in their modern interpretation. For this reason Yehowah is often called a mangod in Ilyin's works. According to Ilyin: "Yehowah is a man and even a Hebrew but the EVERLASTING ONE..."&lt;ref&gt;http://svetoch.org/ru/otkrytie-7-tajn.html Revealing 7 mysteries (Russian only)&lt;/ref&gt; Yehowah is God of the immortals while Satan is God of the mortals or satanists meaning followers of the traditional Christian denominations and Talmudic Judaism. Ilyin wrote: "my GOD walks on Earth, and visits HIS friends, and has supper with them, like HE visited Abraham and had supper with him under the oak tree, …visited Melchizedek, Job, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Balaam and Mohammad."&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Ilyin, "Inviting all people to become immortal" (Privately printed, n.d.), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous religious people of the past, according to Ilyin, were representatives of Yehowism in their time, for example John Huss, Quaker George Fox, a [[German mystic]] Jakob Böhme, Socrates, Pythagoras, Medichi, Elisabeth Kridner, Muhammad, Confucius and many others. Yehowah, according to Ilyin, is [[Jesus]]. Jesus Christ was a temporary incarnation of Yehowah on Earth. So it was Hebrew God Yehowah himself, who was crucified and died on the cross. Yehowists totally deny trinity taking it as Satan's fiction.

Yehowah and Satan lead an ongoing fight with each other. Yehowists fight for Yehowah by distributing Ilyin's works and following moral and ritual norms of Yehowism. In reward they will get eternal life in physical form. A decisive battle will soon take place between the two Gods, which Ilyin calls Armageddon. Yehowah will win and build 1000 year Jerusalem Republic. This will be a period of abundance for people. After 1000 years Satan will break free and the last battle with Yehowah will take place, in which Satan and his followers will be exterminated utterly. Then Yehowah will renew the Earth drastically and will keep on improving it periodically.

Ilyin never set any particular dates for Armageddon foretelling rather forthcoming apocalyptic events than their dates: "[Satan] will force all people to bow to its vicious power and for cannon fodder causing a lot of suffering and bloodshed; especially it will kill brutally lot of people in the Turkish empire, Balkan Peninsula, Jerusalem and in the Caucasus,"&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Ilyin, "Second Address by YEHOWAH’s Messenger" (Privately printed, n.d.). English translation is available [here: http://svetoch.org/en/second-address-by-messenger-of-yehowah.html]&lt;/ref&gt; or in another booklet he says: "first, [i.e. before the tribulation] YEHOWAH will bring down cannon fire on Germany."&lt;ref&gt;Nikolai Ilyin, "A Question to the World Enlightener Elijah" (Privately printed, no publication data, written in 1888), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of every person on this planet, according to Ilyin, is to achieve physical immortality through self-perfection, observing Yehowah's Law and his last-days commands given through Ilyin.

==Yehowists' revered books==
Yehowists believe that text of the Christian (and Jewish) Bible was distorted by Satan. Although they agree that the bible contains some truths but its text is so much distorted that Yehowists don't use it at all believing that the reader will not be able to tell the truth from later Satan's distortions and additions. Although Ilyin's works contain numerous references to the Bible but members of Yehowist society are not allowed to read it including Holy Scriptures of other religions. Instead Yehowists take [[Book of Revelation]] of Saint John edited by Ilyin and alternatively called by Yehowists the Book from Heaven as the holiest book. This book is considered secret and available to members of the Yehowist society only. Apart from the Book from Heaven Ilyin's works are also regarded as holy writings. They are divided into several types depending on creation period and purpose. Some books written by Ilyin are considered to be out of date intended mainly for members of the organization. Works written during the initial period are known to be materials for distribution, which are distributed with the aim of propagation of Ilyin's teaching. All works by Ilyin are reproduced by Yehowists both in printed and handwritten forms with the old Russian spelling kept in order to avoid distortions when reproducing them. Below you can find a list of booklets translated into English:

# Universal Truth
# Inviting all mortal people to become immortal
# Second address by Messenger of YEHOWAH
# Disproving all religions

Handing out booklets is the only allowed method of propagation of the teaching while verbal preaching is prohibited. Nikolai Ilyin prohibited his followers to preach verbally based on the prophecy in Is. 41-25 "...he will do it the way that no one will hear him preaching a sermon nor breaking a bruised reed in the street";&lt;ref&gt;[http://svetoch.org/en/universal-truth.html Universal Truth]&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, preaching may easily lead to debate with members of other religions. Preaching is also believed to have a possibility of distortions of the message. Booklets are handed out to all people who are willing to take them.

==Worship and traditions of Yehowists==
Worship of Yehowists take place during closed meetings and only members of the society can take part in them. The meetings are likely to include prayers, singing, reading Holy Scriptures and burning the incense.&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovists-Il’inites. A Russian Millenarian Movement" by Sergey V. Petrov, Nova Religio 9, no. 3 (March 2006): 80-91. See abstract online at http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/nr.2006.9.3.080&lt;/ref&gt; Yehowists use a book of hymns written by Ilyin for singing both at worship meetings and at also at informal meetings.&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovists-Il’inites. A Russian Millenarian Movement" by Sergey V. Petrov, Nova Religio 9, no. 3 (March 2006): 80-91. A short review is available at http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/nr.2006.9.3.080&lt;/ref&gt;

Worship meetings of Yehowists takes place on Saturdays starting from Friday night because Saturday is a day of rest like in Judaism. Unlike Judaism observing the Saturday is not so strict. Saturday is the only religious festivity of Yehowists. Celebration of Christmas, Easter and other traditional Christian religious celebrations is not allowed. Although Yehowists use common and personal celebrations like New Year and birthday for informal meetings.

Yehowists strictly follow a food diet, which in general is similar to the Jewish one. In particular eating pork, hare and other seafood&lt;ref&gt;See "Peculiarities of religious practice of Yehowists as a factor for preserving their identity" by Sergey V. Petrov in a digest entitled "Religious practices in modern Russia, Moscow: Novoe Izdatelstvo, 2006."&lt;/ref&gt; is strictly forbidden.

Yehowists don't serve in the army and don't take part in military actions. As a whole the moral rules they preach are universal. They condemn hatred, unjustness, lie, slander, theft, alcohol, smoking and other vices.

==Attitude to education==
Yehowists value secular education. Ilyin repeatedly emphasized that his message, first of all, is intended for educated people. In reality the majority of Ilyinites don't hold academic degrees, which is caused mainly by persecution by the authorities and limited capabilities for getting education, especially in rural areas. There are no any restrictions for getting education including higher one excluding theological, legal, military and theatrical ones regarded by Ilyin as Satan's sciences.

==Attitude to other religions==
Yehowism claims to be the only true religion of God Yehowah. Consequently, other religions are considered to be false or deluded. Participation in worship and even visiting religious buildings of other religions is prohibited. Although Ilyin praised some religious leaders and followers of the past such as Quakers, Novgorod strigolniks and others. As a whole Ilyin criticized other religions in his writings, especially traditional Christian denominations and Talmudic Judaism.

==Criticism of Yehowism==
Quite often Yehowists are criticized for expressing hatred and being intolerant of other religions. Indeed, a lot of sayings by Ilyin contain keen criticism towards them and are not ethically acceptable. However, despite severe criticism of other religions and ideologies Yehowism is friendly to people practicing them. Ilyin repeatedly called on his followers to get along with all people regardless of their beliefs and perception. Ilyin's style is characterized by a certain degree of rudeness and straightforwardness. This might easily astonish and even shock readers, who have never read similar ideas. Disrespect to the Bible, Christian sacred objects, mysteries, Talmud, etc. shown by Ilyin in his writings also might drive away and insult members of traditional religions.
