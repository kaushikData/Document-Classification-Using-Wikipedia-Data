[[File:CIA aerial view Osama bin Laden compound Abbottabad.jpg|thumb|250px|The classified papers analysed the unilateral military actions of US military forces in Pakistan that occurred in 2011.]]
The '''Abbottabad Commission Report''' is a judicial inquiry paper authored and submitted by the [[Abbottabad Commission]], led by [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan|Justice]] [[Javaid Iqbal]], to the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] of Pakistan on 4 January 2013.&lt;ref name="The News International, 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff correspondents|title=Abbottabad Commission report submitted to PM|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-19995-Abbottabad-Commission-report-submitted-to-PM|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=The News International, 2013|date=4 January 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002555/http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-19995-Abbottabad-Commission-report-submitted-to-PM|archivedate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report investigates the circumstances surrounding the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] in Abbottabad. Upon submission, the report was immediately classified by the Prime Minister and its findings were not made public.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 06/13"&gt;{{cite news|last=Khan|first=Sumera|title=Two years on: Abbottabad report remains out of sight|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/543834/two-years-on-abbottabad-report-remains-out-of-sight/|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Express Tribune, 06/13|date=3 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502031901/http://tribune.com.pk/story/543834/two-years-on-abbottabad-report-remains-out-of-sight/|archivedate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indicated by the media, the report compiled the 700-pages, which lists some 200 recommendations after interviewing over 300 witnesses and scrutinising more than 3,000 documents pertaining to the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|raid]] by US [[Joint Special Operations Command|special operations forces]] to kill [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]] on 2 May 2011.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 01/13"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Abbottabad Commission: Report on bin Laden out, but not public|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/488865/abbottabad-commission-report-on-bin-laden-out-but-not-public/|work=4 January 2013|publisher=Express Tribune, 01/13|accessdate=27 June 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200156/http://tribune.com.pk/story/488865/abbottabad-commission-report-on-bin-laden-out-but-not-public/|archivedate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to American unilateral actions, the government formed the commission which was to find out exactly what happened and who was responsible for failing to catch the high-profile target, who had taken refuge in Abbottabad. In 2013, parts of the reports published by the [[News channels in Pakistan|news channels]] in the country and most of the findings of the said report were leaked to the press and were strongly criticised by defence experts.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 06/13"/&gt; The government then classified all of its publications despite American reservations and concerns,&lt;ref name="Samma TV report"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsdesk|title=Pak-US people need to see Abbottabad commission report|url=http://www.samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=55658|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Samma TV report|date=23 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200029/http://www.samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=55658|archivedate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the report was released by [[Al Jazeera]] on 8 July 2013.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20130708" /&gt;

==Background==
In 2011, the United States took [[Death of Osama bin Laden|unilateral]] actions to target and kill [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama Bin Laden]], who was reportedly in hiding in [[Abottabad]], in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province]] of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan"/&gt; After much criticism, Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] formed the commission under Senior Justice [[Javed Iqbal (Judge)|Javed Iqbal]].&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan"/&gt; Soon after conducting session interviews, Senior Justice [[Javed Iqbal (Judge)|Iqbal]] announced that Abbottabad Commission report will be made public in a few weeks.&lt;ref name="AAJ Television"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ejaz|first=Muhammad|title=Abbottabad Commission report to become public in a few weeks: Justice Javed|url=http://www.aaj.tv/2011/12/commission-report-to-become-public-in-a-few-weeks-justice-javed/|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=AAJ Television|date=21 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004409/http://www.aaj.tv/2011/12/commission-report-to-become-public-in-a-few-weeks-justice-javed/|archivedate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Iqbal's claims, the commission did not release the report and its preparation period further prolonged to next years.&lt;ref name="News Tribe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hussain|first=Mirza|title=Abbottabad Commission to present report next month.|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/05/24/abbottbad-commission-to-present-report-next-month/|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=News Tribe|date=24 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501235528/http://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/05/24/abbottbad-commission-to-present-report-next-month/|archivedate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Pakistani [[Ministry of Justice (Pakistan)|Ministry of Justice]] (MoJ) issued a notification to the commission on asking to complete its investigation and submit the report on 12 October 2012.&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Abbottabad Commission given 30 days to submit report|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012\09\12\story_12-9-2012_pg7_15|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Daily Times, Pakistan|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of the report duly recommended a trial against the medical doctor-turned spy, Dr. [[Shakil Afridi]].&lt;ref name="News Tribe" /&gt; Asked by a journalist for delaying of the report, Senior Justice Iqbal maintained that the presence of CIA in Pakistan is also being investigated, adding that it would be mentioned in the report.&lt;ref name="AAJ Television" /&gt; To another question by a journalist as to [[Osama bin Laden death conspiracy theories|whether the person]] killed in the compound in Abbottabad was [[Osama bin Laden]], Justice Javed Iqbal quoted: If we tell you that what's left.... You'll find out soon."&lt;ref name="AAJ Television" /&gt;

==Contents==

Revealed by the British ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', the papers ultimately cleared the [[Government of Pakistan|Government]], [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]], the [[The Establishment|establishment]], and intelligence services of involvement in protection of the al-Qaeda chief.&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Abbottabad Commission clears Pak govt, military of protecting Osama|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/22-Oct-2012/abbottabad-commission-clears-pak-govt-military-of-protecting-osama|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=The Nation|date=22 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016143849/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/22-Oct-2012/abbottabad-commission-clears-pak-govt-military-of-protecting-osama|archivedate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; American literary political critics have accused Pakistan officials of knowing more about Osama's presence than they were letting on.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt; United States had been long demanding Pakistan to declassify the papers of the reports, maintaining that it is important for the Pakistani and American public to see the report of Abbottabad Commission.&lt;ref name="Samma TV report" /&gt; All request had been dismissed by the [[Government of Pakistan|Government]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt;

===Classified status===
Before the full submission of the papers in 2013, only a few parts of the papers were obtained by the [[Dunya News|''World News]] channel of Pakistan and televised it all over the nation in 2012.&lt;ref name="Dunya News (World News)"&gt;{{cite news|last=News Desk|title=Dunya News gets copy of Abbottabad Commission report|url=http://dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/Pakistan/147839-Dunya-News-gets-copy-of-Abbottabad-Commission-repo|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Dunya News (World News)|date=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the broadcast, the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] declined to comment on the report.&lt;ref name="Top News USA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Williamson|first=Jamie|title=U.S. declines to comment on Osama Abbottabad Commission report|url=http://www.topnews.in/usa/us-declines-comment-osama-abbottabad-commission-report-221586|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Top News USA|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official press briefing to media, the US State Department maintained that "U.S. shares with Pakistan a "profound" interest in learning about what kind of support network al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden might have had during his hiding but would only comment on the Abbottabad Commission's findings on the issue when it gets the actual report."&lt;ref name="Pakistan Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff Correspondents|title=US has profound interest in Abbottabad Commission report|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2012/10/22/news/national/us-has-profound-interest-in-abbottabad-commission-report/|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Pakistan Times|date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sensing the impact on the military, the defence authors had had earlier hinted to media that the papers would be marked as [[Classified information|classified]] expect little of substance to be revealed.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Times (Web cache)"/&gt; Excerpts leaked to the press from the yet-to-be-made-public report differed with the American account of the incident.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Times (Web cache)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Abbottabad Commission: Report on bin Laden out, but not public|url=http://pakistannewstoday.4com.co/abbottabad-commission-report-on-bin-laden-out-but-not-public/|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Pakistan Times (Web cache)|date=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the final report was submitted to Prime Minister [[Raja Pervez Ashraf|Pervez Ashraf]] to review the papers. After briefly reviewing the papers, Prime Minister Ashraf [[Classified information|classified]] the publications of the report before leaving the office.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 06/13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pakistan Times 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hussain|first=Tayyab|title=Pakistanis still in the dark over Bin Laden raid|url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/05/02/news/national/pakistanis-still-in-the-dark-over-bin-laden-raid/|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Pakistan Times 2013|date=2 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511135934/http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/05/02/news/national/pakistanis-still-in-the-dark-over-bin-laden-raid/|archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al Jazeera report leak===
The report of the Abbottabad Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Document: Pakistan's Bin Laden Dossier |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/binladenfiles/2013/07/201378143927822246.html |work=[[Abbottabad Commission]] |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=8 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6I7fpcDHf?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/binladenfiles/2013/07/201378143927822246.html |archivedate=15 July 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; formed in June 2011 to probe the circumstances around the killing of Osama bin Laden by American forces in a unilateral raid on the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, was leaked by the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit on 8 July 2013, after being suppressed by the Pakistani government.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20130708"&gt;{{cite web|last=HAshim|first=Asad|title=Leaked report shows Bin Laden's 'hidden life'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/07/20137813412615531.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=8 July 2013|date=8 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430164359/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/07/20137813412615531.html|archivedate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burke|first=Jason|title=Pakistan's Abbottabad report is serious, savage self-analysis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/pakistan-abbottabad-report-savage-self-analysis?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=8 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TGBoone20130708"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boone|first=Jon|title=Osama bin Laden: Pakistan criticised over failure to capture al-Qaida chief|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/osama-bin-laden-pakistan-criticised?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=8 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725210846/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/08/osama-bin-laden-pakistan-criticised?INTCMP=SRCH|archivedate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCNews20130708"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaked report reveals Pakistan failures on Bin Laden|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23235847|publisher=BBC News Asia|accessdate=9 July 2013|date=8 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101013935/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23235847|archivedate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20130708" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20130708" /&gt; The report drew on testimony from more than 200 witnesses, including members of Bin Laden's family, Pakistan's then spy chief Ahmad Shuja Pasha, senior ministers in the government and officials at every level of the military, bureaucracy and security services.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20130708" /&gt; The four-member Abbottabad Commission interviewed 201 people, including the country's intelligence leaders, in an effort to piece together the events around the American raid on 2 May 2011, that killed Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, and embarrassed the Pakistani government. The commission was led by Justice Javed Iqbal of the Pakistani Supreme Court, a retired police officer, a diplomat and an army general. It first met in July 2011, two months after the American raid, and has held 52 hearings and conducted seven field visits.&lt;ref name="NYT20130708" /&gt;

Osama bin Laden was able to hide in Pakistan for nine years due to the "collective failure" of state military and intelligence authorities and "routine" incompetence at every level of civil governance structure allowed the once world's most wanted man to move to six different locations within the country.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20130708" /&gt; The Commission's 336-page report is scathing, holding both the government and the military responsible for "gross incompetence" leading to "collective failures" that allowed both Bin Laden to escape detection, and the United States to perpetrate "an act of war".&lt;ref name="AlJaz20130708" /&gt; It found that Pakistan's intelligence establishment had "closed the book" on bin Laden by 2005, and was no longer actively pursuing intelligence that could lead to his capture. The Abbottabad Commission report blasted the Pakistani government and military for a "national disaster" over its handling of bin Laden and calls on the leadership to apologise to the people of Pakistan for their "dereliction of duty."&lt;ref name="USAToday20130708"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanglin|first=Doug|title=Leaked Pakistan report details bin Laden's secret life|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/07/08/pakistan-commission-osama-bin-laden-al-jazeera-leaked-report/2498565/|accessdate=8 July 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document repeatedly returned to what it describes as "government implosion syndrome" to explain the failure of any institution to investigate Bin Laden's unusual hideout.&lt;ref name="TGBoone20130708" /&gt; "It is a glaring testimony to the collective incompetence and negligence, at the very least, of the security and intelligence community in the Abbottabad area," said the report.&lt;ref name="TGBoone20130708" /&gt; "How the entire neighbourhood, local officials, police and security and intelligence officials all missed the size, the strange shape, the barbed wire, the lack of cars and visitors … over a period of nearly six years beggars belief," it said.&lt;ref name="TGBoone20130708" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCNews20130708" /&gt; The report said that Bin Laden must have required a support network "that could not possibly have been confined to the two Pashtun brothers who worked as his couriers, security guards and general factotums".&lt;ref name="TGBoone20130708" /&gt; The report said: "Over a period of time an effective intelligence agency should have been able to contact, infiltrate or co-opt them and to develop a whole caseload of information. Apparently, this was not the case."&lt;ref name="TGBoone20130708" /&gt; The commission didn't rule out the possibility of involvement by rogue Pakistani intelligence officers, who have been accused of deliberately shielding Bin Laden by some commentators.&lt;ref name="TGBoone20130708" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCNews20130708" /&gt; "Given the length of stay and the changes of residence of [Bin Laden] and his family in Pakistan … the possibility of some such direct or indirect and "plausibly deniable" support cannot be ruled out, at least, at some level outside formal structures of the intelligence establishment."&lt;ref name="TGBoone20130708" /&gt; "Connivance, collaboration and cooperation at some levels cannot be entirely discounted," it said.&lt;ref name="NYT20130708"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Declan|title=Leaked Report Cites Pakistan's Failings Before U.S. Killed Bin Lade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/world/asia/leaked-report-cites-pakistans-failings-before-us-killed-bin-laden.html|accessdate=9 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725173440/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/world/asia/leaked-report-cites-pakistans-failings-before-us-killed-bin-laden.html|archivedate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission made several findings. Among these include:&lt;ref name="USAToday20130708" /&gt;
* Osama bin Laden entered Pakistan in mid-2002 after narrowly escaping capture in the [[battle of Tora Bora]] in Afghanistan. Over nine years, he moved to various places inside the country, including [[South Waziristan]] and northern [[Swat Valley]].
* In Swat, the al-Qaeda leader reportedly met with [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammad]], the alleged mastermind of the [[9/11 attacks]], in early 2003. About a month later, KSM was captured in Rawalpindi in a joint US-Pakistani operation, and bin Laden fled the area.
* Osama bin Laden, along with two of his wives and several children and grandchildren, moved into the custom-built compound in Abbottabad, a military garrison town, in 2005 and lived there until the US raid.
* Osama bin Laden was very concerned about surveillance. The report says bin Laden wore a [[cowboy hat]] outside to avoid detection from above and considered buying and cutting down a row of [[poplar tree]]s on the perimeter of the Abbottabad compound because he thought it might provide cover for observers.
* The presence of a CIA support network to help track down bin Laden without the Pakistani establishment's knowledge was "a case of nothing less than a collective and sustained dereliction of duty by the political, military and intelligence leadership of the country."

With respect to the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|death of bin Laden]] at the hands of US Navy SEALs, the report concluded: 

{{quote|The whole episode of the U.S. assassination mission of May 2, 2011 and the Pakistan government's response before, during and after appears in large part to be a story of complacency, ignorance, negligence, incompetence, irresponsibility and possibly worse at various levels inside and outside the government.&lt;ref name="USAToday20130708" /&gt;}}

The Pakistani military's inability to prevent an American incursion into its airspace was described as the country's greatest "humiliation" since 1971, when Indian forces routed Pakistan in a war that led to the creation of the present-day state of [[Bangladesh]], according to the report. Despite American assurances that US forces would enter Pakistan if they thought they could capture Osama bin Laden, Pakistani air defences were set to a "peace time mode" when American helicopters crossed into Pakistani airspace, the report stated.&lt;ref name="WP20130708" /&gt; The report didn't name the persons responsible for the failures in the hunt for bin Laden as well as the American intrusion into Pakistan and said that it may be politically unrealistic to suggest punishments for them, but "as honourable men, they ought to do the honourable thing, including submitting a formal apology to the nation for their [[dereliction of duty]]."&lt;ref name="WP20130708"&gt;{{cite news|last=Craig|first=Tim|title=Pakistan faults self in bin Laden hunt|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/pakistan-faults-self-in-bin-laden-hunt/2013/07/08/999706d4-e813-11e2-818e-aa29e855f3ab_story.html|accessdate=9 July 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Balloch Grosart''' (18 June 1827{{snd}}16 March 1899) was a  [[Scotland|Scottish]] clergyman and literary [[editing|editor]]. He is chiefly remembered for reprinting much rare [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] literature, a work which he undertook because of his interest in [[Puritan]] [[theology]].

==Life==

The son of a building contractor, he was born at [[Stirling]] and educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1856 he became a minister of the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] at [[Kinross]], serving the congregation known as First United Presbyterian Church. In 1865 he went to [[Liverpool]], and three years later to [[Blackburn]].&lt;ref name="EB 1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Grosart, Alexander Balloch|volume=12|page=615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He resigned from the ministry in 1892, and died at [[Dublin]].

==Editorial work==

Among the first writers whose works he edited were the Puritan writers, [[Richard Sibbes]], [[Thomas Brooks (writer)|Thomas Brooks]] and [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]]. Editions of [[Michael Bruce (poet)|Michael Bruce]]'s ''Poems'' (1865) and [[Richard Gilpin]]'s ''Demonologia sacra'' (1867) followed. In 1868 he brought out a bibliography of the writings of [[Richard Baxter]], and from that year until 1876 he was occupied in reproducing for private subscribers the “Fuller Worthies Library,” a series of thirty-nine volumes which included the works of [[Thomas Fuller]], Sir [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]], [[Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke|Fulke Greville]], [[Edward de Vere]], [[Henry Vaughan]], [[Andrew Marvell]], [[George Herbert]], [[Richard Crashaw]], [[John Donne]] and Sir [[Philip Sidney]]. The last four volumes of the series were devoted to the works of many little known and otherwise inaccessible authors.&lt;ref name="EB 1911"/&gt; He also wrote a biography of the Scottish poet, [[Robert Fergusson]] (Edinburgh: [[Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier]], 1898)
in the [[List of books for the "Famous Scots Series"|“Famous Scots Series”]].

His ''Occasional Issues of Unique and Very Rare Books'' (1875–1881) included among other things the ''Annalia Dubrensia'' of [[Robert Dover (Cotswold Games)|Robert Dover]]. In 1876 still another series, known as the “Chertsey Worthies Library,” was begun. It included editions of the works of [[Nicholas Breton]], [[Francis Quarles]], [[Joseph Beaumont|Dr Joseph Beaumont]], [[Abraham Cowley]], [[Henry More]] and [[John Davies of Hereford]].&lt;ref name="EB 1911"/&gt;

The two last-named series were being produced simultaneously until 1881, and no sooner had they been completed than Grosart began the “Huth Library,” so called from the bibliophile [[Henry Huth (bibliophile)|Henry Huth]], who possessed the originals of many of the reprints. It included the works of [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], [[Thomas Nashe]], [[Gabriel Harvey]], and the prose tracts of [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]. He also edited the complete works of [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[Samuel Daniel]]. From the Townley Hall collection he reprinted several manuscripts and edited [[John Eliot (statesman)|Sir John Eliot]]'s works, [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork|Sir Richard Boyle]]'s ''Lismore Papers'', and various publications for the [[Chetham Society]], the [[Camden Society]] and the [[Roxburghe Club]].&lt;ref name="EB 1911"/&gt;

=== Religious works ===
* ''[https://archive.org/details/jesusmightytosa00grosgoog Jesus 'mighty to save': Isaiah lxiii.1 or, Christ for all the world, and all the world for Christ]'' (1863)
* ''[https://archive.org/details/joiningchurchor02grosgoog Joining the Church, Or, Materials for Conversations Between a Minister and Intending Communicant]'' (1865)

[[File:Archeological playing card.jpg|thumb|Sample of the cards.]]
The '''archaeology awareness playing cards''' are a set of [[playing cards]] developed by the [[United States Department of Defense]] designed to educate members of the [[United States military]] serving in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] about the importance of respecting ancient monuments, to try to preserve the Iraqi and Afghan national [[cultural heritage]]. The goal of the publication of the cards was two-fold according to Fort Drum archaeologist Laurie Rush - to prevent unnecessary damage to ancient sites and to stem the illegal trade of artifacts in Iraq. The military has long recognized that educational playing cards are a good way to capitalize on the time soldiers spend waiting for orders.

They were devised following the success of the [[most-wanted Iraqi playing cards]] (officially called "personality identification playing cards") that were used in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] to help members of the U.S. military identify wanted personnel from the Baathist regime. Approximately 40,000 sets of the cards were issued to U.S. forces. In the archaeology deck, each suit has a theme: diamonds for artifacts, spades for digs, hearts for "winning hearts and minds," and clubs for heritage preservation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaeology.org/0707/trenches/solitaire.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the cards==

'''Charles Lawrence Hutchinson''' (March 7, 1854 – October 7, 1924) was a prominent Chicago business leader and philanthropist who is best remembered today as the founding and long-time president of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

== Background ==
[[File:Charles L. Hutchinson house 2709 S. Prairie.jpg|330px|thumb|left|Charles and Frances Hutchinson were residents of Chicago's elite [[Prairie Avenue]], living for over three decades in this house at 2709. The original house was designed in 1881 by George O. Garnsey and built in the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne]] style, and remodeled as shown here in 1888 to [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] tastes by Francis M. Whitehouse. After the neighborhood became less fashionable in the early years of the 20th century, the Hutchinsons moved to a cooperative apartment on E. Walton Place and their former home became a [[boarding house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hilliard |first=Celia |title=The Prime Mover - Charles L.

== The Art Institute of Chicago ==
"Established in 1879 from the remnants of a foundering art academy, the Art Institute of Chicago grew into a sturdy organization largely through the efforts of ...

As one of many accolades conferred on Hutchinson by the Art Institute, the trustees passed a resolution On October 22, 1907 dedicating Gallery 32 as the Charles Lawrence Hutchinson Gallery of Old Masters to commemorate Hutchinson’s twenty-fifth anniversary as president of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=The Charles Lawrence Hutchinson Gallery of Old Masters |journal=Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago |volume=I |issue=1 |date=October 1907 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he died in 1924, his obituary notice in ''The Bulletin of the Art Institute'' noted that “His entire life was devoted to public service, but his service to the Art Institute was so intimate, his devotion so complete that it is not possible to measure it. He ''was'' The Art Institute, and it will stand as his most permanent monument”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Charles Lawrence Hutchinson – 1854-1924 |journal=Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago |volume=XVIII |issue=9 |date=December 1924 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution’s first headquarters were located in Pike's Building at 170 State St.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=(classified advertisement ) Educational Directory – Art School|journal=The (Chicago) Inter Ocean|volume= IX| issue = 1 12|date= July 31, 1880 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the rooms of the recently defunct Chicago Academy of Design. They remained there until May 1 of 1882, when Hutchinson recognized that the growth of the organization required a larger facility that featured more artist-friendly accommodation.  At that time the group relocated to rooms on the second floor of the D Battery Armory on Michigan Avenue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Art in Chicago -Studio and Gallery Notes|journal=The Chicago Daily Tribune|volume= XLI| issue = |date= May 7, 1882|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (located just north of where today the Allerton Building of the Art Institute is located). The drive for what was intended to be a permanent facility also began that year when Hutchinson acquired a lot at the southwest corner of Michigan Avenue and VanBuren Street that had built on it a two-story commercial building that was leased in part to a medical college, for which he advanced the Art Institute the purchase price of $45,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Real Estate – A Fair Activity in Building Not Withstanding High Prices – Details of Mr. Pullman’s Plan for a New Residence Suburb – It Will Have a Certainty of Rapid and Elegant Transit – Improvements at Woodlawn, Lake View, South Chicago and Elsewhere |journal=The Chicago Daily Tribune |volume=I |issue=1 |date=July 23, 1882 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Institute moved its offices into the vacant part of the building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Chicago from the Earliest Period to the Present Time in Three Volumes - Volume III - From the Great Fire of 1871 to 1885 |editor-last=Andreas |editor-first=Alfred T. |authorlink= |year=1886 |publisher=The A.T. Andreas Company |location=Chicago |isbn= |page=421 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent to the purchase a three story addition of pressed brick was built on the back portion of the lot. Classes moved from the armory into this new space on January 8, 1883 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Gossip of the Home Studios and Galleries|journal=The Chicago Daily Tribune|volume= | issue = |date= January 7, 1883|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these accommodations remained the extent of the Art Institute's real estate holdings until 1885, when the lot to the immediate south was acquired for expansion. Because of the organization's continued rapid growth the medical college building was demolished in 1885 and a new building by [[John Wellborn Root]] was built around the 1882 structure to provide more classrooms, galleries and museum space, with a portion of the building set aside for artistically-oriented tenants and organizations whose rent was intended to help pay for the new building and its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hilliard |first=Celia |author2= |year=2010 |title=The Prime Mover: Charles L.

Under Hutchinson's watch, plans for expansion of the museum's collection and the building program continued unabated. He used his influence as an organizer of the World's Columbian Exposition to acquire property for a new building for the Art Institute on the east side of Michigan Avenue in Lake Park (today [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]) on landfill that had been created with debris from the [[Great Chicago Fire]]. On this property was then located a structure that was initially designed and built as a conference center for the fair, but that afterwards became the new home of the Art Institute. It was intended that proceeds from the sale of the VanBuren Street building and $200,000 from the directors of the fair would provide the Art Institute with "a permanent home for art works which will eclipse everything in the nature of fine structures Chicago has known hitherto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Art Notes|journal=The New York Times |volume= |issue= |date=November 20, 1891|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new structure (now the Allerton Building) replaced the Exposition Building (built in 1873) that was standing on the site, and was designed by [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]], the later of whom was a friend of Hutchinson's having been the architect of [[Hutchinson Commons|Hutchinson Hall]] at the University of Chicago (1890).  The Art Institute moved into the new structure in November 1893 after the fair closed, and Hutchinson spent the next several years leading the effort to reconfigure the interior of the new building. The work entailed the building of the Grand Staircase and the creation of space for the school, libraries, galleries, and the filling of that space with world-class art acquired locally or (more frequently) thru buying expeditions to [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. &lt;br /&gt;
As the Art Institute was not able to provide Hutchinson with the generous purse that would be required for that purpose in those early days, this feat was effected thru Hutchinson's personal connections to Chicago's wealthiest families. An early coup in this regard for Hutchinson and [[Martin A. Ryerson]], a fellow trustee and his frequent companion in these forays, was the 1889 purchase, "at great sacrifice" to the seller, of thirteen seventeenth century [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] paintings that were purchased for $200,000, the money for which was advanced by [[Marshall Field]], [[Philip Danforth Armour|Philip Armour]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=FAMOUS PICTURES FOR CHICAGO - C.L. Hutchinson Tells How He Secured Gems from the Demidoff Collection|journal=The (Chicago) Daily Tribune|volume= |issue= |date=July 3, 1890|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Press'' sniffed at this effort in what was perceived as an example of Chicago’s cultural barbarism, considering the city’s position as hog butcher to the world and its philistine reputation as a resolute accumulator of wealth for its own sake by whatever means: “He (Hutchinson) probably paid $1,000 a front foot for them, and we assume the citizens of Chicago will give him a triumphal procession when they arrive, carrying them and him in huge floats, drawn by teams of milk-white Berkshire hogs that have been newly washed with a ten inch hose jet of water until their pink flesh shows under the clean bristles.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Chicago Gets Some Corkers|journal=The New York Press|volume= |issue= |date=July 9, 1890|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutchinson's connections would serve the Art Institute well over the next few decades. Among the notable additions to the museum's collection acquired through them included bequests by [[Bertha Honoré Palmer|Bertha Palmer]], Martin L. Ryerson and Clarence Buckingham, whose gifts would add resources which respectively formed the basis of the museum's notable [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] collection and augmented other collections with more than two hundred additional Old Master, Impressionist, and Post-Impressionist paintings and 1,400 Japanese woodblock prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies - Vol. 19 No.1 |first= |title=From the Archives: Photographs of the Art Institute of Chicago, 1893-1933|year=1993 |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |location=Chicago |isbn=|pages=12, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 1912 a bridge was built to span the by-then suppressed tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad that ran immediately behind the 1893 building, and in 1916 a two-story structure was built on top of it, funded with a $50,000 donation made by railroad inventor William H. Miner. This structure was named Gunsaulus Hall to honor [[Frank W. Gunsaulus]], museum trustee and the first president of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology|Armour Institute]], and housed the museum's industrial arts and related media collection &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Inventor Gives Institute $50,000 for Industrial Art - W. H. Miner Enables Construction of Hall to House Valuable Collection|journal=The Chicago Daily Tribune |volume= |issue= |date=November 6, 1915 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the Alsdorf Galleries today occupy the first floor of that space). By 1920 there were talks in earnest regarding the addition of McKlintock Court and the Hutchinson Wing which surrounds it and the [[Goodman Theater]]/[[The Theatre School at DePaul University|Goodman School of Drama]], which was a gift of the family of the playwright Kenneth S. Goodman, who died in 1918. Ground for the building of the latter pair (by [[Howard Van Doren Shaw]]) was broken in 1923 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=|first=  |title= Ground Broken for Civic Theater in Grant Park|journal=The Chicago Daily Tribune | volume= | issue =  |date= June 28, 1923|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the theater opened to the public in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[Richard Christiansen (critic)|Christiansen]] |first= Richard |title= Commentary - A Good Move - Goodman's relocation would benefit theater, city|journal=The Chicago Tribune | volume= | issue =  |date= June 26, 1988|page=M14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchinson believed that a man’s secret of success lie not only in “intense industry”, but also in “his recreations [that] make or break him as surely as do his business habits”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=  |title= How to Succeed |journal=Chicago Livestock World= | volume= XIII| issue = 82 |date= March 18, 1912|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of his lifetime, Hutchinson was president, board member, trustee and/or supporter of perhaps as many as seventy commercial, civic and philanthropic institutions.

[[Chetniks]] [[war crime]]s during the [[World War II|Second World War]] were primarily directed towards the non-Serbian population of Yugoslavia (mainly Muslims and Croats) and [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist]]-led [[Yugoslav Partisans]] and their supporters. Since their establishment in 1903, Chetniks had been instrumental to the nationalist and expansionist politics of Serbia. They acted to preserve the centralized [[Greater Serbian]] political system within the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The historian [[Vladimir Žerjavić]] estimates that the Chetniks killed 29,000 Muslims and 18,000 Croats over the course of the war, mostly civilians. The historian [[Zdravko Dizdar]] offers a similar figure, stating that 50,000 Muslims and Croats were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Geiger|Geiger, Vladimir]] {{cite journal|publisher=Croatian Institute of History|title=Human Losses of the Croats in World War II and the Immediate Post-War Period Caused by the Chetniks (Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland) and the Partisans (People's Liberation Army and the Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia/Yugoslav Army) and the Communist Authorities: Numerical Indicators|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/103223?lang=en|pp=85–87}}&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians Zdravko Dizdar and Mihajlo Sobolevski divided the criminal methods used by Chetniks into six categories: mass slaughter, [[rape]], burning alive, beheading, impalement, and execution of the wounded. Other methods included hanging, killing with various objects, [[stoning]], [[Maim|maiming]], starving, and robbing. Forcible conversions to [[Orthodoxy]] took place in prisons such as the [[Knin camp|internment camp]] near [[Knin]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Z. Dizdar I M. Sobolevski, Prešućeni četnički zločini u.

The surrender of captured [[Yugoslav Partisans]] to the Nazis occurred during the November 1941 [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|uprising in Serbia]]. General [[Draža Mihailović|Dragoljub (Draža) Mihailović's]] staff handed 350 captured Partisans to the Nazis, who executed them. During the Chetnik-Partisan conflict in western Serbia, the Chetniks captured over one hundred Partisans. A group of approximately 500 prisoners, including Partisans captured in the towns of [[Gornji Milanovac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/4_14_1_110.htm|title=ZBORNIK DOKUMENATA VOJNOISTORIJSKOG INSTITUTA: TOM XIV, KNJIGA 1|publisher=znaci.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kosjerić]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/59_2_124.pdf|title=Užička republika, Zapisi i sećanja, Narodni muzej, Užice 1981|publisher=znaci.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karan, Užice|Karan]], and [[Planinica (Mionica)|Planinica]], were captured by Chetniks in the [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]] mountain range. 

Around 13 November 1941, Chetniks took a group of 365 prisoners to the town of [[Mionica]] and then to the village of [[Slovac]]. They were brought by Nazi and [[Milan Nedić|Serbian collaborationist]] forces to the city of [[Valjevo]]. The convoy was secured by Chetnik leader Jovan Škavović Škava. The meeting between Mihailović and the Nazis in the village of [[Divci]] (at which they agreed to cooperate) preceded the Partisans' surrender. Of this group of prisoners, the Nazis executed 263 on 27 November 1941 in Krušik, [[Valjevo]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/38_21.htm|title=ZATAMNJENA ISTINA|website=znaci.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/44_4.pdf|title=Radoslav S.

Partisans were executed on a regular basis: "Captured 25 Partisans and killed 24 on the site" (Miloš Erkić, commander of the Tuzla Brigade of the 58th May Corps, to the commanders of the Sember and May brigades on 24 December 1943).

{{Quote|text=According to the captive testimonies, Second Proletarian Division from [[Peko Dapčević]]'s corps, which has three divisions, was here.

On 31 October 1941, Chetniks attacked the hospital of the Pomoravlje Partisan Detachment near the village of [[Ursule]]. This attack was part of the general attack by Nazi and Serb collaborationist units on the free Partisan territory of [[Levoča|Levača]]. About ten nurses and fighters from the Levača Unit of the Pomoravlje Partisan Detachment were captured. All the prisoners were taken to [[Rekovac]], redirected to [[Riljac]] and [[Ljubostinje]] and killed, sent to concentration camps or escaped.&lt;ref&gt;Mitrović, Adam.

Chetniks attacked the Partisan hospital in the village of [[Gornja Gorevnica]], captured eleven partisans, and killed a nurse between 4 and 5 November 1941. The prisoners were taken to [[Brajići]], where they were sentenced to death by a court-martial; the sentence was carried out on 5 November in [[Brajići]].&lt;ref&gt;Poznanović, Dr. Rade; Milun Raonić &amp; Milorad Radojčić {{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/242.htm|title=TRAGOM IZDAJE|website=znaci.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 1943, Chetnik units of the [[Dinara Division|Dinaric Division]] were ordered to begin "cleansing (the area) of Croats and Bosniaks" and to create "one national corridor along the [[Dinara]] mountain for the connection of [[Herzegovina]] with Northern [[Dalmatia]] and [[Lika]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jelić-Butić, Fikreta {{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/41_8.htm|title=CETNICI U HRVATSKOJ 1941-1945|website=znaci.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chetniks slaughtered dozens of captured partisans, including renowned Croatian poet [[Ivan Goran Kovačić]], during the [[Case Black]] operation in June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vijesti.hrt.hr/79974/ubijen-ivan-goran-kovacic|title=Ubijen Ivan Goran Kovačić|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="znaci.net"&gt;http://www.znaci.net/00001/60_3_34.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain Division]]'' reported: "Captured 498, of which 411 were executed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/4_12_3_103.htm|title=ZBORNIK DOKUMENATA VOJNOISTORIJSKOG INSTITUTA: TOM XII, KNJIGA 3|website=www.znaci.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cikot|Cikota]] (eastern Bosnia) in mid-July, the Chetniks found 80 wounded Partisans from the First Proletarian Division, seized their weapons, and handed them to the Nazis. The Nazis killed them and burned their bodies.&lt;ref name="znaci.net"/&gt; 

That month, Chetniks found wounded partisans from the First and Second Proletarian Brigades in [[Bišina]] and handed them over to the Nazis; the wounded partisans were later executed. Chetnik [[Dragutin Keserović]] found a partisan hospital in [[Jastrebac]] in May 1944, shooting 24 patients and four nurses. The Chetniks discovered another partisan hospital in [[Semberija]] that month, killing about 300 seriously-wounded patients. In [[Krčan]], southeast of [[Udbina]], about 90 seriously-wounded Partisans were hiding in 16 houses. They initially hid in the basements with fifteen nurses for ten days after [[Operation Morgenstern]], a joint anti-Partisan offensive of the [[Wehrmacht]], [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|NDH forces]] and Chetniks in [[Lika]]. The region held from 7 to 23 May 1944. Nurses, mostly members of the [[League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia]] from surrounding villages, carried the wounded from the basements to Krčan. A group of Partisans guarded Trnova Poljana, protecting  access to Krčan, Kuke, and Visuć from Lapac. Jovo Popović knew about Partisan posts, and brought Chetniks to the village by a roundabout route. They entered Krčan on 2 June 1944 at 10 am, and killed 36 wounded partisans; women and old men hid 56 other wounded partisans. Two doctors (Croat Josip Kajfeš and an Italian named Suppa) were killed, and a Dr. Finderle was wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Josip Grbelja, [http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/27655 Senjski zbornik 31/2004], ''Rujan 1943. u Otočcu.

[[:sh:Aleksa Backović|Aleksa Backović]], Commissar of the 8th Kordun Division, was murdered in Obrad Radočaj's house by Popović.

Chetniks terrorized civilians suspected of collaboration with the partisans, intimidating others to discourage partisan support. A suspect's family was often tortured for collaboration with partisans.

In late December 1943, [[Draža Mihailović]] ordered an anti-communist operation south of [[Belgrade]]. Colonel Jevrem Simić (general inspector of the Chetnik Detachments) and [[Nikola Kalabić]] (commander of the Chetnik Hill Guard Corps) were the main coordinators. After they signed a ceasefire-and-cooperation agreement with the Nazis in the region on 26 November 1943, Chetniks brought their units and began to clear the area.{{Quote|text=All areas close to Belgrade are infested with communists and their supporters.

Continuously inform others about the actions taken.|source=Mihailović's telegram to the commanders of Seged, Kiš (Živojin Lazović, commander of the Smederevo Corps), Ras-Ras ([[Nikola Kalabić]]), Dog-Dog and Romel)}}

Mihailović's operation lasted from 20 to 21 December. Members of the Smederevo Corps under the command of Živan Lazović killed 72 civilians, nine of whom were children from nine months to 12 years old. This became known as the Vranić Massacre. After the operation, Mihailović reported: "Terrible inactivity of the elders of Aval Corps. Živan Lazović must come so he could show what could be done."&lt;ref&gt;Mihailović's telegram no. 546 to 548 for Dob-Dob and Kom-Kom, 18 January 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1943, under Komarčević's command, Chetniks killed 72 partisan supporters in Posavina Srez. In December, Chetnik commander Živan Lazović killed 15 peasant partisan supporters. That month, Chetniks under the command of Nikola Kalabić killed 21 peasants in [[Kopljare]] and, under the command of Vuk Kalaitović, shot 18 Partisan supporters in the town of [[Sjenica]]. Chetniks under the command of Sveto Bogičević entered [[Sepci]], where they captured Sava Sremečević, Konstantin Vojinović, Ilija Radojević and Ilija Jovanović, in August 1944. After torturing them in an attempt to extract a confession of collaboration with Partisans, they killed all four.&lt;ref&gt; Miodrag Zečević, {{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/60_3_34.pdf|title=Dokumenti sa suđenja Draži Mihajloviću, Beograd 2001: Presuda Dragoljubu Mihailoviću i ostalima|website=znaci.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Systematic crimes with genocidal characteristics}}Genocidal crimes==
Chetnik ideologists contended that [[ethnic cleansing]] of certain areas was necessary to consolidate an ethnically-"pure" Serb territory as a basis of post-war Yugoslavia. The ethnic cleansing was expected to be conducted "at a convenient moment." One of a number of documents that attest to this plan is Mihailović's written memorandum to [[Pavle Đurišić]] of 20 December 1941:&lt;ref&gt;[https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/Instrukcija_D._Mihailovića_Pavlu_Đurišiću_od_20._prosinca_1941] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|text=The goals of our squadrons are:
*A struggle for the freedom of our people under the scepter of His Majesty [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]],
*To create Greater Yugoslavia and [[Greater Serbia]] within it, and ethnically cleansed Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Syrmia]], [[Banat]] and [[Bačka]] within Greater Serbia,
*A struggle for inclusion into our state life all other Slavic territories occupied by the Italians and Germans ([[Trieste]], [[Province of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Istria]] and [[Carinthia]]) as well as [[Bulgaria]] and northern [[Albania]] with [[Shkodër]],
*Cleansing the state territory from all national minorities and non-national elements,
*To create immediate common borders between Serbia and Montenegro, as well as between Serbia and Slovenia by [ethnically] cleansing [[Sandžak]] from Muslims and Bosnia from Muslims and Croats ...}}

The precondition for creating an ethnically-"clean" area was the destruction of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) and ethnic cleansing of the region inhabited by Croats and Bosniaks. About ''[[Homogeneous Serbia]]'', [[Stevan Moljević]]'s [[discourse]] about his [[Greater Serbia]]n program, Moljević wrote to [[Dragiša Vasić]] in February 1942:{{Quote|text= (...) 2) Regarding our internal affairs, the demarcation with the Croats, we hold that we should as soon as an opportunity occurs, gather all the strength and create a completed act: occupy territories marked on the map, clean it before anyone pulls itself together. We would assume that the occupation would only be carried out if the main hubs were strong in [[Osijek]], [[Vinkovci]], [[Slavonski Brod]], [[Sunja, Sisak-Moslavina County|Sunja]], [[Karlovac]], [[Knin]], [[Šibenik]], [[Mostar]] and [[Metković]], and then from within start with an [ethnic] cleansing of all non-Serb elements. The guilty should have an open way - Croats to Croatia, Muslims to Turkey (or Albania). As for the Muslims, our government in London should immediately address the issue with Turkey. English will also help us. (Question is!). The organization for the interior cleansing should be prepared immediately, and it could be because there are many refugees in Serbia from all "Serb lands" (...)}}

Written evidence by Chetnik commanders indicates that terrorism against the non-Serb population was intended to establish an ethnically-pure Greater Serbia in the historical territory of other ethnic groups (most notably Croatian and Muslim, but also Bulgarian, Romanian, Hungarian, Macedonian and Montenegrin). Mihailović went further than Moljević and requested over 90 percent of the NDH's territory, where more than 2,500,000 Catholics and over 800,000 Muslims lived (70 percent of the total population, with Orthodox Serbs the remaining 30 percent). Chetnik commander Milan Šantić said in [[Trebinje]] in July 1942, "The Serb lands must be cleansed from Catholics and Muslims. They will be inhabited only by the Serbs. Cleansing will be carried out thoroughly, and we will suppress and destroy them all without exception and without pity, which will be the starting point for our liberation."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

According to a March 1942 document from the Chetnik Dinaric Battalion, the primary Chetnik goal was to create a "Serbian national state in the areas in which the Serbs live, and even those to which Serbs aspire (Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Lika]] and part of [[Dalmatia]])" where "only Orthodox population would live". Bosniaks should realize that the Serbs were their allies, and not join the Partisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://povijest.net/dinarska-cetnicka-divizija-4/|title=Dinarska četnička divizija (4)|website=Hrvatski povijesni portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bajo Stanišić]], the final goal of the Chetniks was the "founding of a new Serbian state, not a geographical term but a purely Serbian, with four basic attributes: the Serbian state [Greater Serbia], the Serb King [of] the [[Karađorđević dynasty]], Serbian nationality, and Serbian faith. The Balkan federation is also the next stage, but the main axis and leadership of this federation must be our Serbian state, that is, the Greater Serbia."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Chetnik leadership saw their "convenient moment" in January and February 1943. During this period, Chetniks commanded by [[Zaharije Ostojić]] and assisted by [[Pavle Đurišić]] and [[Vojislav Lukačević]]'s units conducted extensive genocidal operations and ethnic cleansing in eastern Bosnia and Sandžak. After they finished, Đurić wrote in a report to Mihailović:&lt;ref&gt;[https://sr.wikisource.org/sr-el/Извештај_Павла_Ђуришића_начелнику_штаба_Врховне_команде_од_13._фебруара_1943] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=To the Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command: Operations in [[Pljevlja]], [[Čajniče]], and [[Foča]] srezs against Muslims are completed. The operations were executed exactly as commanded. The attack started at the agreed time. All commanders and units have accomplished tasks to the general satisfaction. All the Muslim villages in the three mentioned srezs are completely burned so that none of their homes were left intact. All the property, except cattle, grains, and haylofts, has been destroyed. The collection of human and animal food for the creation of spare food storage and feeding units that remained in the field for cleaning and screening of terrain and forest areas, and for the implementation and consolidation of the organization on the liberated territory, was ordered at certain places.&lt;br&gt;During the operation, the complete destruction of Muslims regardless of sex and age was conducted.

Victims totaled 22 (of which two were accidental), with 32 wounded. Of the Muslims, about 1,200 fighters and up to 8,000 other victims: women, the elderly and children.

During the initial operations, the Muslims ran towards [[Metaljka (Čajniče)|Metaljka]], [[Čajniče]] and [[Drina]]. A small part of the population found shelter in Metaljka. It's estimated that there are up to 2,000 refugees in Čajniče, and one part of it has managed to cross Drina before certain units have made cross-cutting of possible directions in that sector. The rest of population was destroyed.

The morale of the Muslims was destroyed. It was an epidemic of fear of our Chetniks, so they simply surrendered.}}

In late March and April 1943, the Yugoslav Partisans expelled Chetnicks from the region. The German command, equally willing cooperate with Chetnik and Muslim collaborators, later halted the operations. Chetnik planners and ideologists postponed their blueprint for the end of the war. [[Dragiša Vasić]] wrote in an April 1942 letter to Mihailović:&lt;ref&gt;Milovanović, Nikola {{cite web|url=http://www.znaci.net/00001/11_28.htm|title=DRAŽA MIHAILOVIĆ - SMERNICE POLITIČKOG PROGRAMA I CILJEVI RAVNOGORSKOG POKRETA|publisher=znaci.net|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=With regard to point II b), where it is said that it is necessary to occupy the territory immediately and before anyone can get rid of the foreign element, I think that this issue should not worry us that much. I remember very well the situation Europe was in after the last war. Countries that were engaged in the war were so busy with their own internal affairs that no one, so to speak, was taking into account what others were doing within their own borders. In the first year after the end of the war, one good part of the unwanted population could simply be eradicated, and nobody would turn their heads. So, if we are smart, this issue of cleansing or reshaping and changing the population shouldn't be particularly difficult for us.}}

A 13 February 1943 letter from the commander of the Ozren Chetnik Corps from to the commander of the Zenica Military-Chetnik Detachment says that the source of Chetnik genocide of Croats and Muslims dates back to the 1882 creation of an independent Serbia:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

{{Quote|text= (...) Maybe these goals look to you and your fighters big and unrealistic. Remember great liberation struggles under the leadership of the Vožd [[Karađorđe]]. Serbia was full of Turks [Muslims]. In Belgrade and other Serbian lands, Muslim [[minaret]]s were sticking up, and Turks carried out their stinky washings in front of the [[mosques]] as they are now doing in Serbian Bosnia and Herzegovina. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims flooded our homeland. Take a walk through Serbia today. Nowhere will you find neither Turks [Muslims], their graveyards nor gravestones (...) It's the best proof and the greatest guarantee that we will succeed in today's holy struggle, and that we will exhort all Turks from these Serb lands. No Muslim will remain among us (...) The villagers and other people will move to Turkey. Our government in London, through the allied and friendly government of England, seeks to achieve the consent with the Turkish government (so [[Churchill]] spoke in [[Ankara]] with Mr. [[İsmet İnönü|İnönü]]). We will mercilessly destroy all Catholics [Croats] who wronged our people in these tragic days, as well as all intellectuals and economically stronger. The peasantry and the workers will be saved, and we will make them real Serbs by forcibly converting them to Orthodoxy. These are the goals of our great struggle and when the time comes we will realize them. We have already realized them in some parts of our homeland.}}

==Trials==
{{Main|Trial of Mihailović et al.}}
At the beginning of August 1945, the first public post-war trial (before the court-martial) was held in liberated [[Belgrade]] of [[Vojislav Lukačević]] and others. Public prosecutor [[Miloš Minić]] accused Lukačević of a massacre in Foča as commander of Chetnik units in Bosnia, participation in the extermination of the Muslim population, collaboration with the Nazis and [[Milan Nedić]], and of crimes against Yugoslav Partisans. Lukačević, found guilty and sentenced to death, was executed in Belgrade in late August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasevich, Jozo (1975), ''War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941–1945: The Chetniks''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8047-0857-9}}, pg. 427&lt;/ref&gt;

Chetnik leader [[Dragoljub Mihailović]] was captured on 13 March 1946 by agents of the Yugoslav Security Agency ([[OZNA]]) and indicted on 47 counts. He was convicted of eight, including [[crimes against humanity]] and [[high treason]]. Mihailović, sentenced to death on 15 July, was executed with nine other Chetnik commanders in [[Lisičji Potok]] in the early hours of 18 July 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Buisson, Jean-Christophe (1999).

'''''Company in a courtyard behind a house''''' (1663-1665) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]], it is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Amsterdam Museum]], on loan to the [[Rijksmuseum]].

This painting by Hooch was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote; "286. SCENE IN A COURTYARD BEFORE A SMALL HOUSE (or, The Lovers). [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm.]] 61 ; Suppl. 25 ; de G. 6.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/569/mode/1up Comparative table] of catalog entries between John Smith's first [[Catalogue raisonné]] of Hooch and Hofstede de Groot's first list of Hooch paintings published in [[Oud Holland]]&lt;/ref&gt; In front of a small house with a red roof, red brick walls, and white pilasters, a gentleman and a lady, in a red jacket and yellow skirt, are seated at a small table. The lady, sitting almost with her back to the spectator, is squeezing a lemon into a glass of wine. The gentleman, with his pipe in his right hand, looks on with interest. Behind the couple an older woman comes forward with a glass of beer. At the corner of the house to the right a servant-girl, standing on a tub, is scouring a brass pot. To the right is a wooden fence with an open garden-door, above which rise some trees. To the left of the group is a hedge with trees beyond. It is a fine and early work, dating from about 1660-65. "The brilliant sunshine of a fine afternoon lends a peculiar charm to the scene " (Sm.). 
Signed on the bank to the left, "P D HOOG"; canvas, 24 inches by 18 1/2 inches. Imported into England by Chaplin. In the O'Niel collection in 1832, and in the [[Adriaan van der Hoop|Van der Hoop]] collection, Amsterdam, in 1842. 

Now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, Van der Hoop bequest, No. 1251 in the 1903 catalogue (formerly No. 686)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/555/mode/1up entry 286 for Scene in  a Courtyard Before a Small House (or, The Lovers)] in Hofstede de Groot, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free software|Free]]/[[open-source software]] – the [[free software license|source availability model]] used by [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS) – and [[closed source]] are two approaches to the distribution of software.

== Background ==

Under the ''closed-source'' model source code is not released to the public. Closed-source software is maintained by a team who produces their product in a [[compiler|compiled]]-executable state, which is what the market is allowed access to. [[Microsoft]], the owner and developer of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]], along with other major software companies, have long been proponents of this business model, although in August 2010, Microsoft interoperability general manager Jean Paoli said Microsoft "loves open source" and its anti-open-source position was a mistake.&lt;ref name="Microsoft Open Source Statement"&gt;[https://www.pcworld.com/article/203923/microsoft_we_love_open_source.html Microsoft: 'We Love Open Source']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FOSS]] model allows for able users to view and modify a product's source code, but most of such code is not in the [[public domain]]. Common advantages cited by proponents for having such a structure are expressed in terms of trust, acceptance, teamwork and quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html The GNU Manifesto – GNU Project – Free Software Foundation (FSF)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-free license is used to limit what [[free software movement]] advocates consider to be the essential freedoms. A license, whether providing open-source code or not, that does not stipulate the "four software freedoms",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html The Free Software Definition – GNU Project – Free Software Foundation (FSF)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; are not considered "free" by the free software movement. A closed source license is one that limits only the availability of the source code. By contrast a [[copyleft]] license claims to protect the "four software freedoms" by explicitly granting them and then explicitly prohibiting anyone to redistribute the package or reuse the code in it to make derivative works without including the same licensing clauses. Some licenses grant the four software freedoms but allow redistributors to remove them if they wish. Such licenses are sometimes called ''permissive software licenses''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html Various Licenses and Comments about Them – GNU Project – Free Software Foundation (FSF)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a license is the [[FreeBSD License]] which allows derivative software to be distributed as non-free or closed source, as long as they give credit to the original designers.

A misconception that is often made by both proponents and detractors of FOSS is that it cannot be capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Greg | last = Perkins | title = Open Source and Capitalism | date = 1999-08-24 | url = http://slashdot.org/articles/980824/0854256.shtml | work = [[Slashdot]] | accessdate = 2014-02-13 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000817054044/http://slashdot.org/articles/980824/0854256.shtml | archivedate = 2000-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOSS can and has been commercialized by companies such as [[Red Hat]], [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]], [[Mozilla Corporation|Mozilla]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[Novell]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]/[[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[VMware]] and others.&lt;ref name="Popp2"&gt;{{cite book | first = Dr. Karl Michael | last = Popp | title = Best Practices for commercial use of open source software | year = 2015 | publisher = Books on Demand | location = Norderstedt, Germany | isbn = 978-3738619096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercialization ==

=== Closed-source software===
{{Main article|Proprietary software}}
The primary [[business model]] for closed-source software involves the use of constraints on what can be done with the software and the restriction of access to the original source code.&lt;ref name="Popp2"/&gt; This can result in a form of imposed [[artificial scarcity]] on a product that is otherwise very easy to copy and redistribute. The end result is that an end-user is not actually purchasing software, but purchasing the right to use the software. To this end, the source code to closed-source software is considered a trade secret by its manufacturers.

=== FOSS ===
{{Main article|Business models for open-source software}}
FOSS methods, on the other hand, typically do not limit the use of software in this fashion. Instead, the revenue model is based mainly on support services. [[Red Hat Inc.]] and [[Canonical Ltd.]] are such companies that give its software away freely, but charge for support services. The [[source code]] of the software is usually given away, and pre-compiled binary software frequently accompanies it for convenience. As a result, the source code can be freely modified. However, there can be some license-based restrictions on re-distributing the software. Generally, software can be modified and re-distributed for free, as long as credit is given to the original manufacturer of the software. In addition, FOSS can generally be sold commercially, as long as the source-code is provided. There are a wide variety of [[free software license]]s that define how a program can be used, modified, and sold commercially (see [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]], and [[BSD licenses|BSD-type licenses]]). FOSS may also be funded through donations.

A software philosophy that combines aspects of FOSS and proprietary software is [[open core]] software, or commercial open source software. Despite having received criticism from some proponents of FOSS,&lt;ref name="Riehle"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has exhibited marginal success. Examples of open core software include [[MySQL]] and [[VirtualBox]]. The [[MINIX]] operating system used to follow this business model, but came under the full terms of the [[BSD license]] after the year 2000.

=== Handling competition ===
This model has proved somewhat successful, as witnessed in the [[Linux]] community. There are numerous GNU/[[Linux distribution]]s available, but a great many of them are simply modified versions of some previous version. For example, [[Fedora Linux]], [[Mandriva Linux]], and [[PCLinuxOS]] are all derivatives of an earlier product, [[Red Hat Linux]]. In fact, [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] is itself a derivative of Fedora Linux. This is an example of one vendor creating a product, allowing a third-party to modify the software, and then creating a tertiary product based on the modified version. All of the products listed above are currently produced by software service companies.

Operating systems built on the [[Linux kernel]] are available for a wider range of processor architectures than [[Microsoft Windows]], including [[PowerPC]] and [[SPARC]]. None of these can match the sheer popularity of the [[x86]] architecture, nevertheless they do have significant numbers of users; Windows remains unavailable for these alternative architectures, although there have been such ports of it in the past.

The most obvious complaint against FOSS revolves around the fact that making money through some traditional methods, such as the sale of the use of individual copies and patent [[Royalties|royalty]] payments, is much more difficult and sometimes impractical with FOSS. Moreover, FOSS has been considered damaging to the commercial software market, evidenced in documents released as part of the [[Microsoft Halloween documents leak]].&lt;ref&gt;"[...] the documents show that while Microsoft may be dismissive of open-source software in public, it considers it a serious competitor in private." – quote from the "[[Microsoft Halloween documents leak#Documents I and II|Documents_I_and_II]]" subsection of [[Microsoft Halloween documents leak]] article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/halloween6.html "Halloween VI" document] appears to give convincing evidence that Microsoft had their reasons for trying to argue against the popularity of GNU/Linux and other [[Free and open-source software]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Gates, in his [http://www.startupgallery.org/gallery/notesViewer.php?ii=76_4&amp;p=5 reply] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130115904/http://www.startupgallery.org/gallery/notesViewer.php?ii=76_4&amp;p=5 |date=30 November 2010 }} after the public response to his own 1976 [[Open letter to hobbyists]], said "Unfortunately, some of the companies I have talked to about microcomputer software are reluctant to have it distributed to the hobbyist, some of whom will steal it, when [...]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of making a copy of a software program is essentially zero, so per-use fees are perhaps unreasonable for open-source software. At one time, open-source software development was almost entirely volunteer-driven, and although this is true for many small projects, many alternative funding streams have been identified and employed for FOSS:

* Give away the program and charge for installation and support (used by many [[Linux distributions]]).
* "[[Commoditizing the complement|Commoditize complements]]": make a product cheaper or free so that people are more likely to purchase a related product or service you do sell.
* Cost avoidance / cost sharing: many developers need a product, so it makes sense to share development costs (this is the genesis of the [[X Window System]] and the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] web server).
* [[Donation]]s
* [[Crowd funding]]

Increasingly, FOSS is developed by commercial organizations. In 2004, [[Andrew Morton (computer programmer)|Andrew Morton]] noted that 37,000 of the 38,000 recent patches in the [[Linux kernel]] were created by developers directly paid to develop the Linux kernel. Many projects, such as the X Window System and Apache, have had commercial development as a primary source of improvements since their inception. This trend has accelerated over time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

There are some{{Who|date=December 2011}} who counter that the commercialization of FOSS is a poorly devised business model because commercial FOSS companies answer to parties with opposite agendas. On one hand commercial FOSS companies answer to volunteers developers, who are difficult to keep on a schedule, and on the other hand they answer to shareholders, who are expecting a return on their investment. Often FOSS development is not on a schedule and therefore it may have an adverse effect on a commercial FOSS company releasing software on time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packettrap.com/pdf/white_paper_open_source.pdf Integrating Open Source in Commercial Solutions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovation ==

[[Gary Hamel]] counters this claim by saying that quantifying who or what is innovative is impossible.&lt;ref&gt;http://opensource.com/business/11/2/whos-really-innovative&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of compatible FOSS replacements for proprietary software is encouraged by the [[Free Software Foundation]] to make it possible for their users to use FOSS instead of proprietary software, for example they have listed [[GNU Octave]], an API-compatible replacement for [[MATLAB]], as one of their [[Free Software Foundation#High priority projects|high priority projects]]. In the past this list contained free binary compatible Java and CLI implementations, like [[GNU Classpath]] and [[DotGNU]]. Thus even "derivative" developments are important in the opinion of many people from FOSS. However, there is no quantitative analysis, if FOSS is less innovative than proprietary software, since there are derivative/re-implementing proprietary developments, too.

Some of the largest well-known FOSS projects are either legacy code (e.g., FreeBSD or Apache) developed a long time ago independently of the [[free software movement]], or by companies like [[Netscape]] (which open-sourced its code with the hope that they could compete better), or by companies like [[MySQL]] which use FOSS to lure customers for its more expensive licensed product. However, it is notable that most of these projects have seen [[Rewrite (programming)|major or even complete rewrites]] (in the case of the Mozilla and Apache 2 code, for example) and do not contain much of the original code.

Innovations have come, and continue to come, from the open-source world:
* [[GmailFS]] is a good example of the collaborative nature of much open-source development. Building on [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]] (which allows filesystems to be implemented in userspace, instead of as code that needs to be loaded into the kernel) combined with [http://sourceforge.net/projects/libgmail libgmail], which is a [[Python (programming language)|Python]] library for programmatic access to a user's [[Gmail]] message store, the result is the ability to use the multiple gigabytes of Gmail message space as a fileserver accessible from anywhere on the Internet.
* [[Perl]], the pioneering open-source scripting language, made popular many features, like [[regular expressions]] and [[associative array]]s, that were unusual at the time. The newer [[Python (programming language)|Python]] language continues this innovation, with features like functional constructs and class-dictionary unification.
* [[dcraw]] is an open-source tool for decoding [[RAW format|RAW-format]] images from a variety of [[digital camera]]s, which can produce better images than the closed-source tools provided by the camera vendors themselves.
* A number of laptop models are available with a particular emphasis on multimedia capabilities. While these invariably come preinstalled with a copy of Microsoft Windows, some of them&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/07/22/HNqosmio_1.html Toshiba launches multimedia Qosmio notebooks | InfoWorld | News | 2004-07-22 | By Martyn Williams, IDG News Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,112577,00.asp PC World – Acer Readies New Notebook, Tablet PC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; also offer an alternative "[[Instant-on|fast-boot]]" mode (such as [[HyperSpace (software)|Phoenix HyperSpace]]) based on GNU/Linux. This gets around the long time it can take to boot up Windows.
* [[VLC media player]], [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]], and [[Amarok (software)|Amarok]] are FOSS music players that integrate internet-based data sources to an unprecedented degree, taking song information from [[MusicBrainz]], related track information from [[last.fm]], album cover art from [[amazon.com]] and displaying an artist's Wikipedia page within the player.
* While admittedly inspired by [[Mac OS X]]'s [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer, [[Compiz Fusion]] has pioneered the concept of "plug in" window decorators and animation effects. Users can develop their own creative and unique effects.
* Open-source telecommunication products, such as the [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk PBX]], have revolutionized the [[ICT industry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ictinnovations.com/content/open-source-voice-applications Open Source in ICT Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are substantial efforts towards the implementation of a [[semantic desktop]] in FOSS communities.
* Today's desktop environments are innovating regarding their unique idea of a [[Social Desktop]].
* Many academic research projects release their results as FOSS.

=== Code quality ===
An analysis of the code of the [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system kernels looked for differences between code developed using open-source properties (the first two kernels) and proprietary code (the other two kernels). The study collected metrics in the areas of file organization, code structure, code style, the use of the C preprocessor, and data organization. The aggregate results indicate that across various areas and many different metrics, four systems developed using open- and closed-source development processes score comparably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The study mentioned above is refuted by a study conducted by Coverity, Inc finding open source code to be of better quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coverity.com/press-releases/coverity-scan-report-finds-open-source-software-quality-outpaces-proprietary-code-for-the-first-time/|title=Coverity Scan Report Finds Open Source Software Quality Outpaces Proprietary Code for the First Time|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
A study was done on seventeen open-source and closed-source software showed that the number of vulnerabilities existing in a piece of software is not affected by the source availability model that it uses. The study used a very simple metrics of comparing the number of vulnerabilities between the open-source and closed-source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is Open Source Security a Myth?|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1941487.1941516|journal = Commun.

The study measured the vulnerability density in the web applications and shown that some of them had increased vulnerability density, but some of them also had decreased vulnerability density.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Security of open source web applications|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5314215|journal = 3rd International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement, 2009.

==Business models==
&lt;!-- Feel free to split or merge this new section into other parts of the article. --&gt;
In its 2008 Annual Report, Microsoft stated that FOSS business models challenge its license-based software model and that the firms who use these business models do not bear the cost for their software development{{Clarify|date=June 2009}}. The company also stated in the report:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312508162768/d10k.htm Annual Report on Form 10-K]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10005379-16.html?hhTest=1 Microsoft's annual report: Open-source mental block | The Open Road – The Business and Politics of Open Source by Matt Asay – CNET News.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Some of these [open source software] firms may build upon Microsoft ideas that we provide to them free or at low royalties in connection with our [[interoperability]] initiatives. To the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance, our sales, revenue and operating margins may decline.

Open source software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our products, in some cases on the basis of technical specifications for Microsoft technologies that we make available. In response to competition, we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions.}}
There are numerous business models for open source companies which can be found in the literature.&lt;ref name="Popp2"/&gt;

'''''Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel''''' ({{lang-sr-cyrl|Хазарски речник|rtl=yes}}, {{lang|sr|Hazarski rečnik|italic=yes|rtl=yes}}) is the first novel by [[Serbs|Serbian]] writer [[Milorad Pavić (writer)|Milorad Pavić]], published in 1984. Originally written in [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the novel has been translated into many languages. It was first published in English by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], [[New York City|New York]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Milorad Pavić's official site: [http://www.khazars.com/prevodi/ TRANSLATIONS] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no easily discerned plot in the conventional sense, but the central question of the book (the mass [[religious conversion]] of the [[Khazar]] people) is based on a historical event generally dated to the last decades of the 8th century or the early 9th century when the Khazar royalty and nobility converted to [[Judaism]], and part of the general population followed.&lt;ref&gt;Lektire i puškice: [http://www.gimnazijaso.edu.rs/lektire/iv/hazarski-recnik.php Hazarski rečnik – Milorad Pavić] {{sr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However,  most of the characters and events described in the novel are entirely fictional, as is the culture ascribed to the Khazars in the book, which bears little resemblance to any literary or [[archeological]] evidence.

The novel takes the form of three cross-referenced mini-[[encyclopedia]]s, sometimes contradicting each other, each compiled from the sources of one of the major [[Abrahamic religions]] ([[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]]). In his introduction to the work, Pavić wrote:
{{blockquote|No [[chronology]] will be observed here, nor is one necessary. Hence each reader will put together the book for himself, as in a game of [[dominoes]] or [[playing cards|cards]], and, as with a mirror, he will get out of this dictionary as much as he puts into it, for you [...] cannot get more out of the truth than what you put into it.&lt;ref&gt;Milorad Pavić's Dictionary of the Khazars, New York: Knopf, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book comes in two different editions, one "male" and one "female", which differ in only a critical passage in a single paragraph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stason.org/TULARC/education-books/find-books/14-What-is-the-difference-between-the-male-and-female-editio.html the male and female versions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavić stated that the Khazars were a metaphor for a small people surviving in between great powers and great religions. In Yugoslavia, Serbs recognized their own fate; it was the same in Slovenia and elsewhere, a schoolbook on survival. The same in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and on and on. A French critic said, 'We are all Khazars in the age of nuclear threat and poisoned environment.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/pavic-khazars.html HE THINKS THE WAY WE DREAM by D. J. R. BRUCKNER]&lt;/ref&gt;

== About the book ==
[[Ann Hansen]] was incarcerated for eight years for the bombing of the [[Litton Industries]] which was described by its perpetrators as the [[direct action]], urban [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]  protest. The group was known as ''[[Squamish Five]]'', after the name of the BC town where they were arrested, or also as ''Vancouver Five''. In her book, Hansen concedes tactical mistakes, but maintains the necessity of militant opposition to capitalist state. She stated among other things, that{{quote|"The essence of direct action ... is people fighting for themselves, rejecting those who claim to represent their true interests, whether they be revolutionaries or government officials. It is a far more subversive idea than civil disobedience because it is not meant to reform or influence state power but is meant to undermine it by showing it to be unnecessary and harmful. When people, themselves, resort to violence to protect their community from racist attacks or to protect their environment from ecological destruction, they are taking direct action".&lt;ref name="AK Press"&gt;Hansen, Ann. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9HRClitXq7UC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=violent+direct+action&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V05pU5y6HMSkyAT54YHgBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=violent%20direct%20action&amp;f=false Direct Action: Memoirs of an Urban Guerrilla]''.

The book sheds light on mostly forgotten page of the Canadian history, when "the most significant left-wing terrorism took place in the early 1980s, committed by a group of five people from BC who called themselves “Direct Action” after the French revolutionary group, “[[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]]”. The ideology of Ann Hanson and her collaborators is characterized as a "mix of environmental, anti-nuclear, and feminist ideals".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.defenddemocracy.org/stuff/uploads/documents/Peaceable_Kingdom.pdf#page=182 Terror in the Peaceable Kingdom: Understanding and Addressing Violent Extremism in Canada]''.

A '''double-marking language''' is one in which the [[grammar|grammatical]] marks showing relations between different constituents of a phrase tend to be placed on both the [[Head (linguistics)|heads]] (or nuclei) of the phrase in question, and on the modifiers or dependents. Pervasive double-marking is rather rare, but instances of double-marking occur in many [[language]]s.

For example, in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in a genitive construction involving two definite nouns, both the possessor and the possessed are marked, the former with a suffix marking the possessor (and corresponding to a [[possessive adjective]] in English) and the latter in the [[genitive case]]. For example, 'brother' is ''kardeş,'' and 'dog' is ''köpek,'' but 'brother's dog' is ''kardeşin köpeği.'' (The consonant change is part of a regular [[consonant mutation]].)

Another example is a language in which endings that mark [[grammatical gender|gender]] or [[grammatical case|case]] are used to indicate the role of both nouns and their associated modifiers (such as adjectives) in a sentence (such as [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or in which case endings are supplemented by verb endings marking the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[direct object]] and/or [[indirect object]] of a sentence.

[[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] had double-marking in both verb phrases (verbs were marked for person and number, nominals for case) and noun-adjective phrases (both marked with the same case-and-number endings) but not in possessive phrases (only the dependent was marked).

==History==
[[File:Enid Haupt and Lady Bird Johnson.JPG|thumb|left|Lady Bird Johnson strolls in the Haupt Garden with its donor Enid A. Haupt (left)]]
The garden opened on May 21, 1987 as part of the redesigned Castle quadrangle.&lt;ref name=SIedu /&gt;   It is named for [[Enid A. Haupt]], who provided the $3 million endowment which financed its construction and maintenance.&lt;ref name=SIgardens /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frommer's Oct 17 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cultural Landscape Foundation October 2012"/&gt; Initially approached with a request that she finance a small Zen garden within the quadrangle, after a review of the plans Haupt said that she was "not interested in putting money into a Zen garden...I'm only interested in financing the whole thing."&lt;ref name=NewView&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=Edwards|title=A new view from the Castle : the Smithsonian Institution's quadrangle : Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, National Museum of African Art, S. Dillon Ripley Center, Enid A. Haupt Garden|year=1987|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-87474-749-X|pages=57|author2=Carlhian, Jean Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quadrangle redesign project and the [[Smithsonian Gardens]] more broadly were part of the vision of the eighth Secretary of the Smithsonian, [[S. Dillon Ripley]], who felt that the museum experience should extend beyond the museums' buildings into the outdoor spaces.&lt;ref name=crawford /&gt;

The landscape design of the Garden featured the collaborative efforts of architect Jean Paul Carlhian, principal in the Boston firm of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson and Abbott; Lester Collins, a landscape architect from Millbrook, New York; Sasaki Associates Inc. of Watertown, Massachusetts; and James R. Buckler, founding director of the Smithsonian's Office of Horticulture.&lt;ref name=SIedu&gt;{{cite web|title=Enid A. Haupt Garden {{!}} Exhibitions|url=http://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Details/Enid-A-Haupt-Garden-36|accessdate=24 May 2012|author=Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central feature of the garden is a symmetrically patterned [[parterre]], flanked by the Moongate Garden to the west and the Fountain Garden to the east.&lt;ref name="Frommer's Oct 17 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=historyinbloom /&gt;  The parterre measures 144 feet long by 66 feet wide; the low-growing plants that fill out the series of diamonds, fleurs-de-lis, and scallops or swags that make up the design are changed every six months, typically in September and May.&lt;ref name="Cultural Landscape Foundation October 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuideBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Ottesen|first=Carole|title=A Guide to Smithsonian Gardens|year=2011|publisher=Smithsonian Books|isbn=978-1-58834-300-0|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable design features include saucer and tulip magnolias, brick walkways, and historical cast-iron garden furnishings from the Smithsonian Gardens' Garden Furniture Collection.&lt;ref name="Frommer's Oct 17 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SIedu /&gt;

'''EACES (European Association for Comparative Economic Studies) e.V.''' is a German [[Eingetragener Verein|Verein]].
[[Image:Logo finish.jpg|thumb|alt=EACES logo|Logo EACES]]

==Purpose of the association==
The general purpose of the [[professional association|association]] is to initiate and co-ordinate international collaboration designed to assist the advancement of theoretical and applied knowledge in the field of [[comparative economics|comparative economic]] studies in Europe and elsewhere. Its aims are purely [[science|scientific]].

The principal interests of the association are the theoretical analysis in the field and the comparative study of real [[economic system]]s. The areas concerned are the economies of East and West, North and South, as well as the economic interactions among systems and among regional areas, such as the EU.

The association is envisaged as a broadly based organization in which all schools of analysis will exchange views and ideas on current and prospective research.

The association is:
* organizing international conferences and workshops
* promoting the study and application of comparative economics and related subjects, form working groups to further research on particular topics
* cooperating with other international groups, such as the International Economic Association, concerned with this and similar fields of research
* facilitating translations and publications

==Membership==
'''a.''' Each individual person and institutional body can become a member of the association. Application: http://eaces.net/member.html The Managing Board decides on the applications.&lt;br /&gt;
'''b.''' Membership expires by withdrawal, death or exclusion. The announcement of withdrawal of a member will come into effect at the end of the current fiscal year and has to be declared in writing to the executive committee by 1 December. The obligation to pay membership fees ends in any case at the end of the current fiscal year.&lt;br /&gt;
'''c.''' Members who have failed to pay membership fees for two consecutive years will be suspended and may be excluded. The executive committee decides on the exclusion of members.&lt;br /&gt;
'''d.''' The association is not responsible for actions of its members and their consequences.

==Organs of the association==
'''a.''' The executive committee and the general assembly of the members are the organs of the association. Unless specified differently, their decisions are taken with the vote of the simple majority of the members present. &lt;br /&gt; [[Image:jens holscher.jpg|frame|alt=photo jens holscher|President [http://staff.bus.brighton.ac.uk/jh320/ Jens Holscher]]]
'''b.''' Each individual and institutional member has right to one vote in the general assembly. Only individual members have both active and passive voting rights. Institutional members have only right to one active vote.

[http://www.eaces.net/officers.html/ Recent Officers]&lt;br /&gt;
'''a.''' President, vice-president, treasurer and secretary are elected on separate ballot papers, by simple majority of members present at the General Assembly.&lt;br /&gt;
'''b.''' Other officers of the executive committee are elected on a single ballot paper. In the order of votes, candidates enter the executive committee until the new committee,
excluding the president, vice-president, Treasurer, and Secretary, consists of nine members.

==History of the association==
In an International Conference held in [[Urbino]] (Italy) in '''1989''' a large number of European economists doing research in the field of comparative studies decided to build a new European association in order to further research and scientific exchanges on the subject.

There was, therefore, the establishment of a large promoting committee and of a more restricted organizative committee with the aim to prepare for the founding conference of the association. The founding conference was held in [[Verona]] (Italy) on 27–29 September 1990 and saw the participation of around 160 economists of 24 different countries.

About 40% of participants were from Eastern Europe and the [[Soviet Union]]. The countries represented were: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, [[Czechoslovakia]], Denmark, Finland, France, Japan, Germany (both Western and Eastern Germany), Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, [[Netherlands]], Poland, Romania; Spain, Sweden;Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, US, [[USSR]], [[Yugoslavia]]. The good scientific level of the Conference and the friendly and informal atmosphere provided by the organizer contributed to a brilliant start of the association.

The First General Assembly of EACES, held on 27 September 1990, approved the statute and elected Vittorio Valli ([[University of Turin]]) for the post of president. On the following day, with a secret ballot, there was the election of the other members of the executive committee on the basis of a list of candidates freely chosen by EACES member. Seven countries were represented in the executive committee. The status of host country probably contributed to an over representation of Italy in the committee, but the rotation of officers and of the location of general Conferences will correct this imbalances in the future.
The association was formally registered at a public notary in Turin (Italy) on 31 January 1991.

Since its foundation the association has organized nine general conferences and a number of specialized workshops in several countries.(http://eaces.net/confer.html)

The membership has increased to a total number of about 400, including 9 institutional members.

[[File:Petrus Christus - Portrait of a Young Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Portrait of a Young Girl (Christus, Berlin)|Portrait of a Young Girl]]'', c. 1470, by [[Petrus Christus]]]]

The '''Gemäldegalerie''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈmɛːldəɡaləˌʁiː}}, ''Picture Gallery'') is an art museum in [[Berlin]], Germany, and the museum where the main selection of paintings belonging to the [[Berlin State Museums]] (''Staatliche Museen zu Berlin'') is displayed.  It holds one of the world's leading collections of European paintings from the 13th to the 18th centuries.  Its collection includes masterpieces from such artists as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Raphael]], [[Botticelli]], [[Titian]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Giambattista Pittoni]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], and [[Antonio Viviani]]. It was first opened in 1830, and the current building was completed in 1998. It is located in the [[Kulturforum]] museum district west of [[Potsdamer Platz]].

==The collection==
[[File:Amor Vincet Omnia.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Victorious]]'' (1602–1603). Oil on canvas. 156 x 113 cm. [[Caravaggio]] shows Eros prevailing over other human endeavors: war, music, science, government.]]
{{See also|Category:Paintings in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin}}
The Gemäldegalerie prides itself on its scientific methodology in collecting and displaying art.  Each room can be taken in as a single statement about one to five artists in a certain period or following a certain style.  The German collection is the finest and most comprehensive in the world, rivalled only by Vienna and Munich, and the Early Netherlandish and Italian collections also exceptionally comprehensive.  The holdings of Spanish, French and British art are much smaller.  Especially notable rooms include the octagonal Rembrandt room and a room containing five different [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] by [[Raphael]].

There are two paintings by [[Vermeer]] in the collection, ''[[The Wine Glass]]'' and'' [[Woman with a Pearl Necklace]]''.

Other notable experiences include [[Flemish painting|Flemish]] moralistic paintings which stretch across the north side of the museum, showing an interplay between the religious motives of the artists' patrons and the often sensual inspirations of the artists.  In the [[Renaissance]] section, for example, [[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Victorious]]'' is displayed alongside [[Giovanni Baglione]]'s ''Sacred Love Versus Profane Love''.  The two paintings are historically connected; after hearing of the scandalous portrayal of the theme "love conquers all" in Caravaggio's work, a Roman bishop commissioned Baglione's reply, which mimics Carvaggio's style, including the features of ''Amor''.

==The building==
[[File:Rembrandt van Rijn 195.jpg|thumb|''Joseph's dream'', [[Rembrandt]], c. 1645]]
The current gallery sits in the southwest corner of the Kulturforum, a modern-styled answer to the old Museumsinsel ([[Museum Island]]).  The gallery was designed by [[Munich]] [[architects]] [[Heinz Hilmer]] and [[Christoph Sattler]].  The building consists of 72 rooms providing a two-kilometer (1.25&amp;nbsp;mi) floor.  Upstairs the rooms flow around a large central hall, described by the museum as a "meditation hall". The hall sometimes displays sculpture, but is mostly empty, allowing easy crossing between rooms, and somewhere for school parties to sit.&lt;ref&gt;Prestel, 10–12&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also works downstairs, a gallery devoted to frames, and a digital gallery.

The collection is arranged more or less chronologically starting from the entrance and moving toward the farthest room; however there are many doors back to the long central space, so it is straightforward to reach any other room at any point.  The visitor chooses between southern, mainly Italian, art to the left, and German and Flemish art to the right.  Completing the circuit takes the visitor first forward, then backward, in time.  The numbering system starting on the north side of the museum covers mostly Northern European art, then British art.  A visitor following along the southern side will go through mostly Italian and Southern European art.  The main floor galleries contain some 850 works in 53 rooms, with around 400 more in several rooms off a corridor downstairs, which are also open to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Prestel, 10–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Unlike most major national European collections (with the exception of the [[National Gallery, London]]), the Gemäldegalerie collection is not essentially formed around the former dynastic royal collection, but created by a process of acquisition by the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian government]] beginning in 1815. From the first the museum was intended to reflect the full range of European art, giving a different emphasis from that of older royal collections, including the royal collection of Saxony, now mostly in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]], the finest German princely collection, which like other royal collections is strongest in Italian art.&lt;ref&gt;Prestel, 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:David Teniers the Younger - A Company at a Meal.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''Company at a Meal'' by [[David Teniers the Younger]].]]

The collection was first opened to the public in 1830, on completion of construction of the Royal Museum, now called the [[Altes Museum]] ("Old Museum"), designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] and sited by the [[Lustgarten]] opposite the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Royal Palace]] on the other side of [[Unter den Linden]]. The paintings occupied the upper floor with the [[Antikensammlung Berlin|collection of antiquities]] on the lower.  At this point the collection contained nearly 1200 paintings, with a core of 160 from the 17th century collection of Marchese [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], bought in Paris in 1815. An even more important purchase was 677 paintings from the collection formed in Berlin by the English merchant [[Edward Solly]] was acquired in 1821; Solly was an early collector of Italian [[Trecento]] and [[Quattrocento]] paintings and [[Early Netherlandish painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Prestel, 4–6. The King bought some 3,000 works from Solly with his own money, allowing Waagen to take his pick.&lt;/ref&gt; Purchases continued throughout the 19th century, with 345 works acquired during the inaugural directorship of [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] from 1830–1868, though paintings competed with antiquities for rather reduced purchasing budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Prestel, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Jakob Muffel - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Dürer]], ''[[Portrait of Jakob Muffel]]'' 1526]]

After Berlin became the capital of the new [[German Empire]] in 1871 the funds available greatly increased, and purchases accelerated, as Berlin strove to catch up with the greatest European collections.  In 1874 the collection acquired the best of the collection of mostly north European art formed by the industrialist [[Barthold Suermondt]] of [[Aachen]] after his business collapsed.  This was handled for the museum by the art historian [[Wilhelm von Bode]], who had joined in 1872, and was to be the Berlin Museums' greatest Director. He headed the sculpture collections from 1883, then the paintings from 1890, becoming general head of the Berlin Museums from 1890 to 1920. A specialist in [[Rembrandt]] and Dutch painting, he made very significant additions in those areas, but did not neglect Italian painting. His leadership marked the rise of the Gemäldegalerie to international prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Prestel, 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berlin Gemäldegalerie 008.jpg|thumb|left|One of the rooms with German [[medieval]] religious paintings]]

In 1904 the Gemäldegalerie moved to the newly built [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]], now the [[Bode Museum]], where the collection continued to expand. The museum was badly damaged during [[World War II]], but most of the collection survived the war in shelters across Germany. At the end of the war, however, 400 works that were regarded as too large to take to the remoter hiding places were destroyed in a fire in a [[Flak tower]] that served as a bomb shelter.  Many important altarpieces and other large works were lost, and the collection remains short of very large works compared to the other major European collections.  Furthermore, several hundred paintings were looted by Russian or American soldiers or confiscated by the Red Army and never returned,&lt;ref&gt;Prestel, 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; although in June 2006 a small painting by [[Alessandro Allori]], missing since 1944, was returned by the British journalist [[Charles Wheeler (journalist)|Charles Wheeler]], who had picked it up at the end of the war in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Luke. "[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/arttheft/story/0,,1787559,00.html Renaissance woman returned to gallery]". ''The Guardian'', 1 June 2006. Retrieved on 12 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving collection was divided between East Berlin (mostly at the Bode Museum on Museumsinsel) and West Berlin in [[Berlin-Dahlem]], where from the 1950s they were housed in a building originally used for the Asiatic collections, built in 1923, with post-war additions.&lt;ref&gt;Prestel, 8–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Purchases for the West Berlin collection eventually resumed after the war, with [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], Italian [[Baroque painting]], and the creation of a small section for [[Art of the United Kingdom|English painting]] being priorities for successive directors before the [[Re-unification of Germany]].  In 1992 the museum administrations of East and West were re-united, but uniting the collections physically took longer. The current building on the Kulturforum was completed in 1998, and displays some 1,250 paintings, although yet another move currently seems likely (see below).  Other works are displayed elsewhere, as the museum forms part of the Berlin State Museums and does not own a distinct collection as most museums do. For example, ''[[L'Enseigne de Gersaint]]'', or "Gersaint's Shopsign", (1720), a famous painting by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]], is displayed with other works in the appropriate setting of [[Charlottenburg Palace]].  The whole collection of [[Old Master]] Western paintings in the Berlin State Museums is usually said to be around 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Prestel, 10–11; see 2012 press references below for the 3,000 figures.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relocation and controversy==
{{As of|2012}}, the gallery's collection faces a pending move to a temporary site on Berlin's Museumsinsel, to make room for the expansion of the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the 20th-century collection of Ulla and Heiner Pietzsch, bequeathed on condition that it be displayed in its entirety. The proposal has provoked controversy and criticism, particularly since there are no permanent plans for a new structure that would house the collection in its full scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=Berlin plan for Old Masters to give way to modern art angers historians|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/12/berlin-old-masters-art-historians?intcmp=239|accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Old Masters face eviction from Berlin gallery|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/jul/12/old-masters-berlin-gallery-pictures|accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walde|first=Gabriele|title=Wir lassen uns nicht auf Meisterwerke reduzieren|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article107924101/Wir-lassen-uns-nicht-auf-Meisterwerke-reduzieren.html|accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=Die Zeit|date=6 July 2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rauterberg|first=Hanno|title=Rettet die Gemäldegalerie!|url=http://www.zeit.de/2012/27/Gemaeldegalerie-Berlin|accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=Die Zeit|date=9 July 2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Istanbul - Pierre Loti Cafe - 01.jpg|thumb|right|Modern [[Istanbul]], site of ancient [[Constantinople]], capital of the eastern [[Roman Empire]], where Jordanes wrote ''Getica''.]]
'''''De origine actibusque Getarum''''' (''"The Origin and Deeds of the Getae/Goths"''{{refn|Late antique writers commonly used [[Getae]] for [[Goths]] mixing the peoples in the process.|group="n"}}),{{sfn|Costa|1977|p=32}}&lt;ref&gt;''De Rebus Geticis'': O. Seyffert, 329; ''De Getarum (Gothorum) Origine et Rebus Gestis''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith|1870|loc=vol. 2, p.607}} or the '''''Getica''''',&lt;ref name="name1"&gt;{{harv|Mierow|1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; written in [[Late Latin]] by [[Jordanes]] (or ''Iordanes/Jornandes'') in or shortly after 551 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first =Peter|last =  Heather | title = Goths and Romans 332-489| publisher = Oxford|year = 1991 | pages = 47-49 (year 552)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Walter |last = Goffart | title = The Narrators of Barbarian History|publisher =  Princeton |year = 1988 |page = 98 (year 554)}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims to be a summary of a voluminous account by [[Cassiodorus]] of the origin and history of the [[Goths|Gothic people]], which is now lost.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|loc = Or in the original ''Die Goten'' (München 2001) , consistently uses ''Origo Gothica'' as a name not only for the work of Cassiodorus, but also, very confusingly, for the ''Getica''. The source is Cassiodorus, ''Variae'' 9.25.5: "Originem Gothicam fecit esse historiam Romanam", which can be interpreted in different ways (see {{harvnb|Goffart|2006|pp=57-59}}). Cassiodorus' lost work is more commonly referred to as ''Historia Gothorum'' or ''History of the Goths'' by modern scholarship ({{harvnb|Merrills|2005|p= 102, 9}}).}} However, the extent to which Jordanes actually used the work of Cassiodorus is unknown. It is significant as the only remaining contemporaneous resource that gives the full story of the origin and history of the Goths. Another aspect of this work is its information about the early history and the customs of [[Early Slavs|Slavs]].

==Synopsis of the work==
The ''Getica'' begins with a geography/ethnography of the North, especially of [[Scandza]] (16-24). He lets the history of the Goths commence with the emigration of [[Berig]] with three ships from Scandza to [[Gothiscandza]] (25, 94), in a distant past. In the pen of Jordanes (or Cassiodorus), Herodotus' [[Getae|Getian]] demi-god [[Zalmoxis]] becomes a king of the Goths (39). Jordanes tells how the Goths sacked "[[Troy]] and Ilium" just after they had recovered somewhat from the war with [[Agamemnon]] (108). They are also said to have encountered the Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Vesosis]] (47). The less-fictional part of Jordanes' work begins when the Goths encounter Roman military forces in the 3rd century AD. The work concludes with the defeat of the Goths by the Byzantine general [[Belisarius]]. Jordanes concludes the work by stating that he writes to honour those who were victorious over the Goths after a history of 2030 years.

==Importance and credibility==
Because the original work of Cassiodorus has not survived, the work of Jordanes is one of the most important sources for the period of the migration of the European tribes, and the [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Visigoths]] in particular, from the 3rd century CE. Cassiodorus had claimed to have the Gothic "folk songs" — ''carmina prisca'' (Latin) — as an important source; recent scholarship regards this as highly questionable.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}} Its main purpose was to give the Gothic ruling class a glorious past, to match the past of the senatorial families of Roman Italy.

Jordanes stated that Getae are the same as the Goths, on the testimony of [[Orosius Paulus]].&lt;ref name="name1"/&gt; A controversial passage identifies the ancient people of [[Vistula Veneti|Venedi]] mentioned by [[Tacitus]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Ptolemy]], with the [[Slavs]] of the 6th century. As early as 1844,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| authorlink = Pavel Josef Schafarik|first = Pavel Josef| last = Schafarik | title = Slawiche Alterthümmer|publisher = Leipzig| year = 1844| volume= 1|page= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been used by eastern European scholars to support the idea of the existence of a Slavic ethnicity long before the last phase of the Late Roman period. Others have rejected this view, based on the absence of concrete archaeological and historiographical data.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p= 7; also pp.11-13 for an analysis of Schafarik's ideas in the context of his age as well as their revival by later Soviet historiography}}

The book is important to some medieval historians because it mentions the campaign in [[Gaul]] of one [[Riothamus]], "King of the Brettones," who was a possible [[Historical basis for King Arthur|source of inspiration for the early stories of King Arthur]].

One of the major questions concerning the historicity of the work is whether the identities mentioned are as ancient as stated or date from a later time. The evidence allows a wide range of views, the most skeptical being that the work is mainly mythological, or if Jordanes did exist and is the author, that he describes peoples of the 6th century only. According to the latter, his main source's credibility is questionable for a number of reasons. First, the originality of his main source, [[Cassiodorus]], is debatable because large part of it consists of culling of ancient Greek and Latin authors for descriptions of peoples who ''might'' have been Goths.{{sfn|Geary|2002|pp=60-61}} Not only that but it seems that Jordanes has distorted Cassiodorus's narrative by presenting us a cursory abridgement of the latter, mixed with 6th century ethnic names.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=40}}{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=59-61}}

Some scholars claim, that while acceptance of Jordanes at face value may be too naive, a totally skeptical view is not warranted. For example, Jordanes says that the Goths originated in Scandinavia 1490 BC. [[Austria]]n historian [[Herwig Wolfram]], believes that there might be a kernel of truth in that claim, if we assume that a clan of the [[Geats|Gutae]] left Scandinavia long before the establishment of the [[Amali]] in the leadership of the Goths. This clan might have contributed to the ethnogenesis of the [[Gutones]] in east [[Pomerania]] (see [[Wielbark culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Herwig|1988|p=40}}, {{harv|Goffart|2006|pp=59-61}} harshly criticized this view&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the name of the king [[Cniva]] which David S. Potter thinks is genuine because, since it doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings given by Jordanes, he must have found it in a genuine 3rd-century source.{{sfn|Potter|2004|p=245}}

Danish scholar [[Arne Søby Christensen]] on the other hand claims that the ''Getica'' was an entirely fabricated account, and that the origin of the Goths in the book is a construction based on popular Greek and Roman myths as well as a misinterpretation of recorded names from Northern Europe. The purpose of this fabrication, according to Christensen, was to establish a glorious identity for the peoples that had recently gained power in post-Roman Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5010849449 Questia.com Review of Cassiodorus, Jordanes, and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth by Peter S. Wells]{{deadlink|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian scholar [[Walter Goffart]] suggests another incentive: ''Getica'' was part of a conscious plan by emperor Justinian and the propaganda machine at his court. He wanted to affirm that Goths (and their barbarian cousins) did not belong to the Roman world, thus justifying the claims of the Eastern Roman Empire to the western part of the latter.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p= 70}}

===Similarities with Gutasaga===

The migration of the Goths from Scandinavia however bears some similarities with the story of the [[Gutasaga]], which tells of an emigration that is associated with the historical migration of the [[Goths]] during the [[Migration period]]:

''This Thielvar had a son called Hafthi. And Hafthi's wife was called Whitestar. Those two were the first to settle on Gotland. The first night they slept together she dreamt that three snakes were coiled in her lap. And it seemed to her that they slid out of her lap. She told this dream to her husband Hafthi. He interpreted it thus:

''"All is bound with bangles,
''it will be inhabited, this land,
''and we shall have three sons."

''While still unborn, he gave them all names:

''"Guti will own Gotland,
''Graip will be the second,
''and Gunfiaun third."

''These later divided Gotland into three parts, so that Graip the eldest got the northern third, Guti the middle third, and Gunfjaun the youngest had the south. Then, over a long time, the people descended from these three multiplied so much that the land couldn't support them all. So they selected every third person by lot to leave, with the right to keep and take away with them everything they owned except for their land. They were unwilling to leave then, but went to instead Torsburgen and settled there. But afterwards the country (i.e. Gotland) would not tolerate them, and drove them away.

''Then they went away to Fårö and settled there. They couldn't support themselves in that place, so they went to a certain island off the coast of Estland, called Dagö, and settled there and built a town that can still be seen. But they couldn't support themselves there either, so they went up the river Dvina, up through Russia. They went so far that they came to the land of the Greeks (i.e. the Byzantine empire). They asked leave of the Greek king to stay there while the moon waxed and waned. The king granted that, thinking it was just for one month. Then after a month, he wanted to send them away, but they answered that the moon waxed and waned for ever and always, and so they said they were allowed to stay. Word of this dispute of theirs reached the queen. She said, "My lord king, you granted them permission to dwell while the moon waxed and waned; now that's for ever and always, so you can't take it off them." So they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language.''

That the Goths should have gone "to the land of the Greeks" is consistent with their first appearance in classical sources: [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] reported that they devastated "[[Macedon]]ia, [[Greece]], the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], and [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]" in 263.

The emigration would have taken place in the 1st century AD, and  loose contact with their homeland would have been maintained for another two centuries, the comment that the emigrant's language "still has something" in common shows awareness of dialectal separation.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} The events would have needed to be transmitted orally for almost a millennium before the text was written down.

The mention of the [[Daugava River|Dvina]] river is in good agreement with the [[Wielbark Culture]]. Historically, the Goths followed the [[Vistula]], but during the [[Viking Age]], the Dvina-[[Dniepr]] waterway succeeded the Vistula as the [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|main trade route to Greece]] for the ''Gutes'' (or ''Gotar'' in standard [[Old Norse]]), and it is not surprising that it also replaced the Vistula in the migration traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histvarld.historiska.se/histvarld/sok/artikel.asp?id=10425  ''Gutasagan Gutalagens'' (Vikingatidens ABC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306132839/http://histvarld.historiska.se/histvarld/sok/artikel.asp?id=10425 |date=2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

A manuscript of the text was rediscovered in [[Vienna]] in 1442 by the Italian humanist [[Enea Silvio Piccolomini (humanist)|Enea Silvio Piccolomini]].{{sfn|Thomas|Gamble|1927|loc= Pp vi, 202, 59}} Its ''[[editio princeps]]'' was issued in 1515 by [[Konrad Peutinger]], followed by many other editions.{{sfn|Smith|1870|loc= "Jornandes"}}&lt;!-- should be very easy to point to subsequent editions, please contribute to find biblographical records and earlier online versions--&gt;

The classic edition is that of 19th-century [[Germany|German]] [[classical scholar]] [[Theodor Mommsen]] (in ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', ''auctores antiqui'', v. ii.). The best surviving manuscript was the ''Heidelberg manuscript'', written in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]], probably in the 8th century, but this was destroyed in a fire at Mommsen's house on July 7, 1880.  Subsequently, another 8th-century manuscript was discovered, containing chapters I to XLV, and is now the 'Codice Basile' at the Archivio di Stato in Palermo.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, C.L.A. XII.1741: 'saec. VIII, 2nd half'&lt;/ref&gt;  The next of the manuscripts in historical value are the ''Vaticanus Palatinus'' of the 10th century, and the ''Valenciennes manuscript'' of the 9th century.

Jordanes' work had been well known prior to Mommsen's 1882 edition. It was cited in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s classic 6 volumes of ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776), and had been earlier mentioned by [[Degoreus Whear]] (1623) who refers to both Jordanes' ''[[Romana (Jordanes)|De regnorum ac temporum successione]]'' and to ''De rebus Geticis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=De Ratione Et Methodo Legendi Historias |author=[[Degoreus Whear]] |year=1623 |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/whear/text.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

In his Preface, Jordanes presents his plan
:"...to condense in my own style in this small book the twelve volumes of [Cassiodorus] Senator on the origin and deeds of the Getae [i.e. Goths] from olden times to the present day."
Jordanes admits that he did not then have direct access to Cassiodorus's book, and could not remember the exact words, but that he felt confident that he had retained the substance in its entirety.{{sfn|Mierow|1915|loc = Preface [quote]: Jordanes writes: "But above every burden is the fact that I have no access to his books that I may follow his thought. Still - and let me lie not - I have in times past read the books a second time by his steward's loan for a three days' reading. The words I recall not, but the sense and the deeds related I think I retain entire."}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to say that he added relevant passages from Latin and Greek sources, composed the Introduction and Conclusion, and inserted various things of his own authorship. Due to this mixed origin, the text has been examined in an attempt to sort out the sources for the information it presents.

===Jordanes himself===
{{main|Jordanes}}
Former notarius to a Gothic [[magister militum]] Gunthigis, Jordanes would have been in a position to know traditions concerning the Gothic peoples without necessarily relying on anyone else. However, there is no evidence for this in the text, and some of the instances where the work refers to ''carmina prisca'' can be shown to depend on classical authors.{{sfn|Christensen|2002}}

===Cassiodorus===
{{main|Cassiodorus}}
Cassiodorus was a native Italian ([[Squillace]], [[Bruttium]]), who rose to become advisor and secretary to the Gothic kings in various high offices. His and the Goths' most successful years were perhaps the reign of [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]]. The policy of Theodoric's government at that time was reconciliation and in that spirit he incorporated Italians into the government whenever he could. He asked Cassiodorus to write a work on the Goths that would, in essence, demonstrate their antiquity, nobility, experience and fitness to rule.

Theodoric died in 526 and Cassiodorus went on to serve his successors in the same capacity. He had not by any means forgotten the task assigned to him by his former king. In 533 a letter ostensibly written by King [[Athalaric]] to the senate in Rome, but ghosted by Cassiodorus, mentions the great work on the Goths, now complete, in which Cassiodorus "''restored the Amali with the illustriousness of their race''."
The work must have been written at [[Ravenna]], seat of the Gothic kings, between 526 at latest and 533.

What Cassiodorus did with the manuscripts after that remains unknown. The fact that Jordanes once obtained them from a steward indicates that the wealthy Cassiodorus was able to hire at least one full-time custodian of them and other manuscripts of his; i.e., a private librarian (a custom not unknown even today).

Jordanes says in the preface to ''Getica'' that he obtained them from the librarian for three days in order to read them again (relegi). The times and places of these readings have been the concern of many scholars, as this information possibly bears on how much of ''Getica'' is based on [[Cassiodorus]].

There are two main theories, one expressed by the Mierow source below, and one by the O'Donnell source below. Mierow's is earlier and does not include a letter cited by O'Donnell.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2002|pp=223-240}}

Gothic sovereignty came to an end with the reconquest of Italy by [[Belisarius]], military chief of staff for [[Justinian]], ending in 539. Cassiodorus' last ghost writing for the Gothic kings was done for [[Witiges]], who was removed to Constantinople in 540. A number of token kings ruled from there while Belisarius established that the Goths were not going to reinvade and retake Italy (which was however taken again by the [[Lombards]] after Justinian's death).

Cassiodorus retired in 540 to his home town of Squillace, where he used his wealth to build a monastery with school and library, ''Vivarium''.

===Authors cited by ''Getica''===
The events, persons and peoples of ''Getica'' are put forward as being up to many centuries prior to the time of Jordanes. Taken at face value, they precede any other history of Scandinavia.

Jordanes does cite some writers well before his time, to whose works he had access but we do not, and other writers whose works are still extant. Mierow gives a summary of these, which is reviewed below, and also states other authors he believed were used by Jordanes but were not cited in ''Getica'' (refer to the Mierow source cited below). Mierow's list of cited authors is summarized as follows:

*Ablabius. Otherwise unknown historian, author of the work ''Gothorum gentis'' ("of the Gothic people"), now lost.
*[[Dexippus]] on the [[Vandals]] and the [[Heruli]].
*Dio, either [[Dio Cassius]] or [[Dio Chrysostom]], author of [[Getica (Dio)|another ''Getica'']]. Description of Britain in Jordanes.
*Fabius. Otherwise unknown, author of a work including the siege of [[Ravenna]], now missing.
*[[Josephus]] in IV.29, brief mention of the Goths as [[Scythians|Scyths]].
*[[Livy]], brief mention in II.10.
*[[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] on the [[Amali]], V.43.
*[[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]], now known only in [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]]' epitome of ''Historiae Philippicae''.
*[[Pomponius Mela]].
*[[Priscus]]. Events concerning [[Attila]].
*[[Ptolemy]] on [[Scandinavia]] in ''Getica'' Part III.
*[[Strabo]]. Authority on Britain.
*[[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]]. Copies of his copies from [[Julius Capitolinus]] on [[Maximinus I|Maximinus]].
*[[Tacitus]]. Authority on [[Roman Britain|Britain]].
*[[Virgil]].

==The late Latin of Jordanes==
The early [[Late Latin]] of Jordanes evidences a certain variability in the structure of the language which has been taken as an indication that the author no longer had a clear standard of correctness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Brian |last = Croke | title = Cassiodorus and the Getica of Jordanes | journal = Classical Philology | volume= 82 | number = 2 |date = Apr 1987|pages= 117-134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanes tells us in ''Getica'' that he interrupted work on the ''[[Romana (Jordanes)|Romana]]'' to write ''Getica'', and then finished ''Romana''. Jordanes states in ''Romana'' that he wrote it in the 24th year of the emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]], which began April 1, 551. In ''Getica'' he mentions a plague of nine years previous. This is probably the [[Plague of Justinian]],  that began in Egypt in 541, reached Constantinople in 542 and went on to Italy in 543. The time is too early to identify a direction of change toward any specific Romance language, as none had appeared yet. This variability, however, preceded the appearance of the first French, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, etc. After those languages developed, the scholastics gradually restored classical Latin as a means of scholarly communication.

Jordanes refers to himself as ''agrammaticus'' before his conversion. This obscure statement is sometimes taken to refer to his Latin. Variability, however, characterizes all Late Latin, and besides, the author was not writing just after his conversion (for the meaning of the latter, see under [[Jordanes]]), but a whole career later, after associating with many Latin speakers and having read many Latin books. According to him, he should have been grammaticus by that time. More likely, his style reflects the way Latin was under the Goths.

Some of the variabilities are as follows (Mierow):

'''[[Orthography]]'''. The spelling of many words differs from the classical, which Jordanes would certainly have known. For example, Grecia replaces Graecia; Eoropam, Europam; Atriatici, Adriatici.

'''[[Inflection]]'''. [[Substantive]]s migrate between [[declension]]s; [[verb]]s between [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]]. Some common changes are fourth to second (lacu to laco), second declension adjective to third (magnanimus to magnanimis), i-stems to non-i-stems (mari to mare in the ablative). [[Gender]] may change. Verbs may change [[voice]].

One obvious change in a modern direction is the indeclinability of many formerly declined nouns, such as corpus. Also, the -m accusative ending disappears, leaving the preceding vowel or replacing it with -o (Italian, Romanian), as in Danubio for Danubium.

'''[[Syntax]]'''. Case variability and loss of agreement in prepositional phrases (inter Danubium Margumque fluminibus), change of participial tense (egressi .. et transeuntes), loss of [[subjunctive]] in favor of [[indicative]], loss of distinction between principal and subordinate clauses, confusion of subordinating conjunctions.

'''[[Semantics]]'''. A different vocabulary appears: ''germanus'' for ''frater'', ''proprius'' for ''suus'', ''civitas'' for ''urbs'', ''pelagus'' for ''mare'', etc.

The '''Ghana–United States [[Status of Forces Agreement]]''' was proposed in 2018 by the [[United States Department of Defense]] to the [[government of Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2018/March-20th/we-have-no-plan-to-set-up-military-base-in-ghana-us-embassy-debunks-claim.php|title=We Have No Plans To Set Up Military Base in Ghana-US Embassy Debunks Claims|last1=Ibrahim|first1=Abubakar|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=19 April 2018|publisher=Myjoyonline|agency=Myjoyonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite historical cooperation between [[Ghana]] and the [[United States]], the proposal was controversial due to concerns (raised primarily by the [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]] party) that the agreement would offer undue privileges to the United States, including a particularly controversial permission to build a [[List of the United States military bases|United States military base]] in Ghana. The President of Ghana, [[Nana Akufo-Addo]], has denied that the agreement would give the United States permission to build a military base in Ghana.[[File:UN 70Y USEmb Accra 2015-10-24.jpg|thumb|right|Two female soldiers of the UN peacekeeper contingent of the Ghana Army at the flag hoisting ceremony before the US Embassy in Accra]]

== Background ==
[[File:USMC-051018-M-2175L-123.jpg|thumb|right|US military and Ghana Army in a Jungle warfare training in Achiase, Ghana]]{{Main|Ghana–United States relations}}
[[Ghana]] and the [[United States of America]] have had a cordial bilateral relationship since Ghana's independence on 6 March 1957. Ghana has cooperated with the U.S. in a wide variety of fields, including education, [[aviation]], agricultural commodities, [[extradition]], [[Telecommunication|telecommunications]], defence, economic and technical support.

===Military cooperation===
In 1961, Ghana was the first country in which the United States have deployed [[Peace Corps]] personnel, after President [[John F. Kennedy]] issued an executive order to establish an agency within the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]].&lt;ref name="US Peace Corps"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.peacecorps.gov/ghana/about/|title=US Peace Corps - About Ghana|last=|first=|date=|website=Peace Corps|publisher=US Peace Corps|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the two countries have engaged in joint military cooperation and exchange programs. A recent example of this occurred when Ghanaian Military forces, which had trained in [[jungle warfare]] for the past four decades, aided the regionally aligned forces of [[United States Army Africa]] in a jungle warfare training exercise in Achiase Military Base, Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peluvarti|first1=Army staff Sgt.

== Controversy ==
The main opposition party in Ghana, the [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]], raised concerns that the deal provided one-sided benefits to the United States. It emerged afterward{{When|date=July 2018}} that the government of Ghana had agreed to a similar Military Agreement in 1998 and again in 2015 under the leadership of the National Democratic Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.peacefmonline.com/pages/politics/politics/201803/347952.php|title=Full Disclosure: 1998, 2015 Documents On Ghana/US Military 'Base' Pact|date=26 March 2018|accessdate=19 April 2018|publisher=peacefmonline|agency=peacefmonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2018}} The NDC denied these claims, and stated that should the NDC be elected back into power in 2020, they would withdraw from the SOFA agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/NDC-denies-signing-controversial-military-agreement-637002|title=NDC denies signing controversial military agreement|last=|first=|date=22 March 2018|website=Ghanaweb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Details of the 2018 agreement ===
The Opposition party [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]] registered their displeasure against some of the terms of the Agreement which give unfettered access to Ghana's resources to their US counterparts. Among some of which the US Department of Defense requested from the [[Nana Akuffo-Addo]] led [[New Patriotic Party]] Government, which the opposition party deems contentious and must be renegotiated are:

#      "Ghana hereby provides unimpeded access to and use of agreed facilities and areas to United State forces, United States contractors, and others as mutually agreed. Such agreed facilities and area: or portions thereof, provided by Ghana shall be designated as either for exclusive use by United States forces or to be jointly used by United States forces and Ghana. Ghana shall also provide access to and use of a runway that meets the requirements of United States forces" [http://www.pulse.com.gh/news/politics/read-ghanas-secret-agreement-with-us-on-military-base-id8141360.html]
#      "Ghana recognizes that it may be necessary for United States forces to use the radio spectrum. United States forces shall be allowed to operate its’ own telecommunication systems (as telecommunication is defined in the 1992 Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union).

The most contentious clause is the one that states " The United States Forces may undertake construction activities, and make alterations and improvements to, agreed facilities and areas". This was largely interpreted by the opposition party and security experts as a request for setting up a Military Base in the country, which the Government vehemently denied.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Parliamentary walkout ===
After easily getting cabinet approval, the agreement was sent to the [[Parliament of Ghana]] for ratification.  The agreement was brought before the House for consideration and ratification after the joint-committee on Defense and Interior Constitutional, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs of Parliament gave it a green light. The minority leader [[Haruna Iddrisu]] expressed his reservations on the floor of [[Parliament House (Ghana)|Parliament House]] to convince the speaker, [[Aaron Mike Oquaye]] to rescind his decision on laying the document before the House.  His request was denied and he and his colleagues walked out to express their disapproval of the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nyabor|first1=Jonas|title=Minority Stage Walkout Over Military Base Deal|url=http://citifmonline.com/2018/03/23/minority-stage-walkout-over-us-military-base-deal/|accessdate=20 April 2018|agency=citifm 97.3 fm|publisher=citifmonline|date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular protest ===
A section of the population and civil societies also registered their displeasure against the Military Agreement. Notable among them is the [[Ghana First Patriotic Front]] (GFPF). They organized a peaceful protest in the national capital to declare their dissatisfaction with the Agreement [https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2018/march-28th/photos-protest-against-us-Ghana-military-deal-underway.php]. The [[Ghana Federation of Labour]] also appealed to the President to expunge some of the clauses enshrined in the document, which they said are not in the best interests of the country [http://citifmonline.com/2018/03/28/remove-controversial-articles-from-us-military-camp-deal-union/].

== President's response ==
[[File:Nana Akufo-Addo at European Development Days 2017.jpg|thumb|right|President of Ghana, [[Nana Akuffo-Addo]]]]In response, President [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] stated on national television that the military agreement did not approve construction of a future military base, and further added that his government will not consider any such request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/846254/us-military-deal-nana-addo-stokes-fire.html|title=US Military Deal: Nana Addo Stokes Fire!|date=7 April 2018|accessdate=20 April 2018|publisher=Modern Ghana|agency=Daily Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/politics/2018/April-5th/full-speech-akufo-addos-address-on-controversial-military-deal.php|title=Full speech: Akufo-Addo’s address on controversial military deal|date=5 April 2018|accessdate=20 April 2018|publisher=myoyonline.com|agency=Joyonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Various Ghanaian intellectuals and politicians have voiced concerns and opposition to the military agreement, including former president [[Jerry Rawlings]], MP [[Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa]], and [[Bright Simons]]. Chief among their concerns is that the agreement will impede Ghanaian self-[[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/844381/okudzeto-ablakwa-tells-us-pull-out-of-us-ghana-military-dea.html|title=Okudzeto Ablakwa Tells US; Pull Out of US-Ghana Military Deal|last1=Laryea|first=|date=28 March 2018|work=|accessdate=19 April 2018|publisher=Modern Ghana|agency=Modern Ghana|quote=" We don't want a permanent military base in our country...so they can advise themselves and pull out of Ghana.

'''Global Information Governance Day''', or '''GIGD''', is an international holiday that occurs on the third Thursday in February. The purpose of Global Information Governance Day is to raise the awareness of [[information governance]]. The holiday was created by Garth Landers, Tamir Sigal, and Barclay T. Blair in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://iginitiative.com/tag/global-information-governance-day/&lt;/ref&gt;

Information governance is the enforcement of desirable behavior in the creation, use, archiving, and deletion of corporate information. [[Gartner]] Inc., an information technology research and advisory firm, defines information governance as the specification of decision rights and an accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in the valuation, creation, storage, use, archival and deletion of information. It includes the processes, roles, standards and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.gartner.com/debra_logan/2010/01/11/what-is-information-governance-and-why-is-it-so-hard/ Gartner definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

February is Information Governance Month, coordinated by the [[American Health Information Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahima.org/resources/InfoGov.aspx Information Governance Month]&lt;/ref&gt;

The celebration is coordinated and promoted by information governance experts.
 
==History==
[[Records management]] deals with the '''retention''' and '''disposition''' of records.  A record can either be a physical, tangible object, or digital information such as a database, application data, and e-mail.  The [[records life-cycle|lifecycle]] was historically viewed as the point of creation to the eventual disposal of a record.  As content generation exploded in recent decades, and regulations and compliance issues increased, traditional records management failed to keep pace.  A more comprehensive platform for managing records and information became necessary to address all phases of the lifecycle, which led to the advent of information governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arma.org/pdf/WhatIsRIM.pdf What is RIM? An article from ARMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Information governance goes beyond retention and disposition to include privacy, access controls, and other compliance issues.  In electronic discovery, or '''e-discovery''', [[electronically stored information]] is searched for relevant data by attorneys and placed on [[legal hold]].  IG includes consideration of how this content is held and controlled for e-discovery, and also provides a platform for defensible disposition and compliance.  Additionally, [[metadata]] often accompanies electronically stored data and can be of great value to the enterprise if stored and managed correctly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arma.org/erecords/index.cfm ARMA description of e-discovery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128102612/http://www.arma.org/erecords/index.cfm |date=2013-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With all of these additional considerations that go beyond traditional records management, IG emerged as a platform for organizations to define policies at the enterprise level, across multiple jurisdictions.  IG then also provides for the enforcement of these policies into the various repositories of information, data, and records.

Information governance was given national recognition in November, 2011 with a directive from President Obama to overhaul current records management processes within the government to encompass current needs more comprehensively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/11/28/presidential-memorandum-managing-government-records Presidential Memorandum – Managing Government Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

Information governance has been a growing trend, even becoming the theme of the annual [[ARMA International]] Conference in 2012. While Records Managers are becoming aware of IG, there is still little awareness among many organizations. Global Information Governance Day was established in 2013 to raise this awareness.

'''Grace Hartman''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OOnt}} (1900 – May 23, 1998),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; née '''Armstrong''' was a [[Canadian]] social activist and politician in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Canada, who became the city's first female [[mayor]]. She became mayor on October 18, 1966 &lt;ref&gt;"The legacy of Grace Hartman: Honour bestowed on late mayor offers young women and girls a lasting role model to emulate." (October 16, 2001).

However, in the municipal elections the following year, Hartman was defeated when the city's popular longtime mayor [[Joe Fabbro]], Silverman's predecessor, stood for election again.&lt;ref name=section15&gt;[http://section15.ca/features/people/2002/01/30/grace_hartman_social/ Social Activist and Politician: Grace Hartman]. section15.ca, January 30, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartman had previously campaigned for mayor in 1956, losing to Fabbro.&lt;ref name=section15 /&gt;

In addition to the distinction of being the first woman to serve as mayor in the City of Sudbury, Hartman also shares the distinction with Dr. Faustina Kelly Cook of being one of the first women to serve on [[Greater Sudbury City Council|Sudbury City Council]].&lt;ref name="Wallace 1993"/&gt; They were both elected to Sudbury City Council on December 4, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sudbury Daily Star.'' (December 5, 1950) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; She served on council until 1954, when she was elected the city's [[comptroller]].&lt;ref name=liveslived&gt;[http://www.mysudbury.ca/downloads/lives_lived/Public_Finances_Banking.pdf Lives Lived - Public Finances and Banking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706190959/http://www.mysudbury.ca/downloads/lives_lived/Public_Finances_Banking.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}. ''mySudbury.ca''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartman was also a president of the [[Ontario Municipal Association]], a board member of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], and a chair of several social service and community organizations in Sudbury.&lt;ref name=section15 /&gt;

She was born in [[Markdale, Ontario]], and moved to Sudbury after marrying George Hartman in 1938.&lt;ref name=liveslived /&gt; George Hartman died in 1960; Grace subsequently married Arthur Grout in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;"Once mayor of Sudbury; will marry". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', December 4, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Hartman was named one of the 25 leading women of Ontario.&lt;ref name=section15 /&gt;

In the late 1970s, Hartman and Grout retired to [[Toronto]], although Hartman returned to Sudbury several times, to accept an honorary doctorate from [[Laurentian University]] and a lifetime achievement award from the city's business and professional women's association.&lt;ref name=section15 /&gt;

Hartman died at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in Toronto on May 23, 1998.&lt;ref name=section15 /&gt;

In 2001, the outdoor [[amphitheatre]] at the city's [[Bell Park (Sudbury)|Bell Park]], the site of the annual [[Northern Lights Festival Boréal]], was named the Grace Hartman Amphitheatre in her memory. Creating the amphitheatre had been one of Hartman's key projects during her city council term.&lt;ref name=liveslived /&gt;

'''Jonathan Anthony Wisniski''' (born September 20, 1951) is an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known as '''Greg "The Hammer" Valentine'''. He is the son of wrestler [[Johnny Valentine]].

In the course of his career, which has spanned over four decades, Valentine has held more than 40 [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championships]], including the [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]], [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] and [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]]. An alumnus of [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]], the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]], he was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|Class of 2004]] and the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum|Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="WWEBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/gregvalentine|title=Greg Valentine|publisher=[[WWE]]|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Seattle, Washington]], Wisniski traveled around [[Texas]] in his teens with his father; [[Johnny Valentine]]. During a summer vacation, he decided to drop out of college and become a wrestler. His father initially tried to deter him, but eventually ceded to his wishes and sent him to Canada in 1970 to train under [[Stu Hart]] in [[Calgary]].

==Professional wrestling career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}

===Early career (1970–1976)===
Wisniski was trained to wrestle by [[Stu Hart]], wrestling his debut match in July 1970 against [[Angelo Mosca|Angelo "King Kong" Mosca]] (he lost in around five minutes). Six months later, Wisniski relocated to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] to complete his training under [[Ed Farhat|the Sheik]].

Initially reluctant to take his father's [[ring name]], Wisniski wrestled as Baby Face Nelson before becoming Johnny Fargo, one half of the Fargo Brothers with Don Fargo between 1971 and 1974. The Fargo Brothers initially competed in the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] based National Wrestling Federation before moving on to Texas. They split in 1974 and Wisniski went to [[Florida]], where he began performing as Johnny Valentine Jr., hopeful that he could live up to his father's legacy. He later changed his ring name to Greg "the Hammer" Valentine, and was billed as Johnny Valentine's brother, not his son, because of fears that the elder Valentine would be thought of as too old to be a legitimate threat. Valentine remained in Florida for a year while also working in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and in Japan under [[Antonio Inoki]] in 1975 and early 1976.

===Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (1976–1978)===
In August 1976, Valentine debuted in [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] and [[George Scott (wrestler)|George Scott]]'s [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]], an affiliate of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] based in the [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]] and [[The Virginias|Virginias]]. Valentine was hired to replace his father, who had been forced to retire after he broke his back in a [[Aviation accidents and incidents|plane crash]] in 1975. He immediately began [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuding]] with Johnny Weaver, who he "retired" with a [[Professional wrestling high-flying techniques#Diving elbow drop|top rope elbow drop]]. Valentine's elbow drop was promoted as a deadly move, with tapes of him breaking wooden boards with his elbow shown to the audiences before his debut.

Valentine then formed a [[tag team]] with [[Ric Flair]], with whom he twice won the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|NWA World tag team title]] and held the [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship]] (between June 30 and August 22, 1977). They first defeated [[Gene Anderson|Gene]] and [[Ole Anderson]] on December 26, 1976 (who nine years later would become in storyline [[Anderson family|Flair's "cousins"]]) in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], injuring Gene so badly that he had to be stretchered out. They held the titles until May 8, 1977, when [[Minnesota Wrecking Crew|the Andersons]] defeated them in a [[steel cage match]] in the old [[Cricket Arena|Charlotte Coliseum]].

Flair and Valentine regained the tag titles from the Andersons on October 30, this time leaving Ole unable to leave under his own power. The team split after they were stripped of the titles in April 1978 by NWA president [[Eddie Graham]] as a result of their "unprofessional conduct". Flair then set his sights on the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], while Valentine held the NWA World Tag Team Championships once more with [[Baron von Raschke]] in 1978.

At the same time, Valentine feuded with [[Wahoo McDaniel|Chief Wahoo McDaniel]] over the [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship]]. Wahoo had cost Valentine and Flair their first tag team championships (Wahoo, the then-nemesis of Flair, had been the special referee in the steel cage match), so Valentine was eager for revenge. On June 11, 1977 in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] he defeated Wahoo, breaking his leg in the process. Though Wahoo's legs were too thick for Valentine to apply his signature [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|Figure Four leglock]], he managed to break Wahoo's ankle using a leg/ankle suplex. The [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] Valentine then began wearing a T-shirt with the slogan "''I broke Wahoo's leg''" on the front and "''No more Wahoo''" on the back. Wahoo returned on August 9, 1977 and took back the title. Valentine would hold the title once more, defeating Wahoo again on September 10 and losing to [[Ken Patera]] on April 9, 1978.

===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1978–1979)===
Valentine began working on a casual basis for the [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF), then owned by [[Vincent J. McMahon]], in November 1978. Managed by [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]], he was given the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] of a methodical wrestler who broke the legs of all his opponents, including [[Chief Jay Strongbow]]. In February 1979, he wrestled then [[WWE Championship|WWWF Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]] to a one-hour time-limit draw at [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=262|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (1979–1984)===
Valentine returned to the NWA in late 1979 and asked Flair to reform their tag team. Flair, by then a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]], declined. Valentine held the NWA World Tag Team Championship once more with [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]] in 1980. Four days after their victory, the promoter, [[David Crockett (wrestling)|David Crockett]] told Valentine and Stevens that he possessed [[Photographic film|film]] which proved that the illegal man had been pinned in the tag match, nullifying the win. When Crockett threatened to send the film to [[Bob Geigel]] (then the NWA President) who would overturn their victory, Stevens and Valentine attacked him and cut the film up with a [[pocketknife]], destroying the evidence.

Valentine later claimed to have "seen the light", and reformed his team with Flair, who believed that Valentine was now a face. In a tag match against [[Jimmy Snuka]] and [[The Iron Sheik]], Valentine abandoned Flair, leaving him outnumbered. Flair was beaten, and then Valentine snapped Gene Anderson’s [[hickory]] [[Walking stick|cane]] over his head, legitimately breaking his nose and splitting his lips. The former partners began feuding over Flair's [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]], with Valentine finally defeating Flair for the title on July 26 in Flair's adopted hometown of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. He held the title until November 24, when he was beaten by Flair; Flair became one of Valentine's main opponents in the Mid-Atlantic territory.

Valentine would hold the United States Championship twice more, renewing his feud with Wahoo in 1982 and defeating him for the title on November 4 with the assistance of his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], [[Oliver Humperdink|Sir Oliver Humperdink]]. [[Roddy Piper]] began pursuing the title, and, after Piper gave Valentine a cake with a [[dog collar]] inside, the two had a series of brutal [[Professional wrestling match types#Names and Variations|dog collar matches]], most notably at [[Starrcade (1983)|Starrcade 1983]], where Piper pinned Valentine in a non-title match after repeatedly whipping him with the steel chain. The feud was intensified by Valentine's propensity to focus on Piper's ear, which had been injured earlier in his career and would bleed easily. Piper would eventually defeat Valentine on April 16, 1983, but Valentine regained the title on April 30 in Greensboro, NC; after the match, where he regained the US Title from Piper, Valentine hit Piper in the ear with US Title. He dropped the title to Dick Slater on December 14, just before leaving them for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]].

===World Wrestling Federation (1981–1982)===
Valentine returned to the WWWF, now known as the World Wrestling Federation, for a year in 1981 and continued to pursue the title. On October 19, he was pinned by Backlund, but then handed the title belt by the dazed referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=346|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was held up, and Backlund defeated Valentine cleanly in the November 23 rematch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=349|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1982, Valentine met Backlund yet again, this time in a steel cage, for the WWF Heavyweight Championship at the [[Philadelphia Spectrum]], which Backlund won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989|last=Cawthon|first=Graham|pages=353|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also feuded with [[Pedro Morales]] over the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]], who he "injured" by [[suplex]]ing him on the concrete floor of the arena. Valentine was not successful in winning this title either, and in mid-1982 left the promotion.

=== World Wrestling Federation===
==== Intercontinental Champion (1984–1985) ====
Valentine went back to the WWF in 1984, predicting that [[Vince McMahon]]'s plan for national expansion would succeed. His first manager was [[Lou Albano|Captain Lou Albano]], and he was later managed by [[Jimmy Hart]].

On September 24, 1984 in [[London, Ontario]] Valentine defeated [[Tito Santana]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]], focusing on Santana's injured knee throughout the match. Santana initially thought he had the match won, but had in fact only achieved a two-count. As Santana was celebrating, Valentine rolled him up for the pin and the title. Following the win, Valentine put Santana in the figure four leglock, reinjuring him. While Santana was sidelined having leg surgery, Valentine feuded with the [[Junkyard Dog]], who he faced in an Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship Title match at the very first [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]] held in [[Madison Square Garden]]. Valentine pinned the JYD after using the ropes, but Santana came to ringside and informed the referee, who restarted the match. Valentine then walked out, losing the match by count-out but saving his title. Santana eventually healed and fought Valentine in many matches (after Santana returned to the ring by defeating [[Buddy Rose|The Executioner]] in the first ever match at Wrestlemania). He went on to win the title back on July 6, 1985 in a [[steel cage match]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], ending Valentine's 285-day reign, the fifth-longest in [[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|Intercontinental title history]]. Valentine, incensed over losing the championship belt, destroyed it in the steel cage, forcing the WWF to get a new Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt (in reality, this was pre-planned as the WWF already had a newer, more modern Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt made and destroying the old title belt was seen as the perfect way to introduce the new one).

==== The Dream Team (1985–1987) ====
{{See also|The Dream Team (professional wrestling)||l1=The Dream Team}}
Valentine would then form a tag team with [[Brutus Beefcake]] known as [[The Dream Team (professional wrestling)|The Dream Team]], managed by [[John L. Sullivan (wrestler)|Luscious Johnny V]]. Initially the team was managed by both Jimmy Hart and Johnny V, but the WWF dropped Hart from the group and he went on to manage [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart|Bret "Hitman" Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart|Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart]]). On August 24, 1985 at [[Spectrum (arena)|The Spectrum]] in [[Philadelphia]], the Dream Team defeated [[The U.S. Express]] ([[Barry Windham]] and [[Mike Rotunda|Mike Rotundo]]) for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] when Beefcake ([[kayfabe]]) rubbed Johnny V's lit [[cigar]] in Windham's eyes allowing him to be pinned. They held the titles until April 7, 1986 when they were defeated at [[WrestleMania 2]] by [[The British Bulldogs]] ([[Davey Boy Smith]] and the [[Dynamite Kid]]). At [[WrestleMania III]], The Dream Team defeated [[The Rougeau Brothers]] ([[Jacques Rougeau|Jacques]] and [[Raymond Rougeau|Raymond]]) as a result of interference by Johnny V and [[Dino Bravo]]. Upset because of a missed move by Beefcake during the match, Valentine left with Bravo and abandoned Beefcake, resulting in Brutus [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turning]] face later on in the night.

Replacing Beefcake with Dino Bravo, Valentine formed [[The Dream Team (professional wrestling)#The New Dream Team|The New Dream Team]]. Valentine was unhappy about teaming with Bravo, who he felt he had little chemistry with. After the WWF asked him to "kidnap" Matilda, the [[bulldog]] mascot of The British Bulldogs, Valentine resigned. He was brought back soon after, with Jimmy Hart again as his new manager (while the "kidnap" angle was reassigned to [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|The Islanders]]) but was used in a much diminished role between 1987 and 1990.

==== Feuds with Don Muraco and Ron Garvin (1988–1990) ====
Valentine was entered in the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at [[WrestleMania IV]], where he defeated [[Ricky Steamboat|Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat]] in the first round before losing to [[Randy Savage|"Macho Man" Randy Savage]], the eventual winner of the tournament, in the quarter-finals.

In 1988, Valentine feuded with [[Don Muraco|"The Rock" Don Muraco]], who had turned face a year earlier. The feud was triggered when Valentine viciously attacked Muraco's manager, former WWF Heavyweight Champion [[Superstar Billy Graham]]. Graham, walking with a cane, tried to intervene when Valentine held the figure-four leglock on jobber Ricky Ataki, after already winning the match. Valentine then put the figure-four leglock on Graham, who had a plastic hip. The feud was abruptly halted when Muraco was dismissed by the WWF, despite Valentine's pleas for Muraco not to be fired so that the promising program could be allowed to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2017/0110/621078/greg-valentine-reveals-his-favorite-wwe-superstar/|title=Greg Valentine Reveals His Favorite WWE Superstar, Would His Stiff Style Work Today, Ronnie Garvin - WrestlingInc.com|work=WrestlingInc.com|access-date=2018-01-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Ironically, [[kayfabe]] magazine ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated|Inside Wrestling]]'' had run a story on the feud, claiming that it was Muraco, yearning to personally avenge Graham's injuries, who had begged the WWF not to dismiss Valentine).&lt;ref&gt;Why Don Muraco BEGGED The WWF Not To Suspent Greg Valentine - ''Inside Wrestling'' November 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1989 he began feuding with [[Ron Garvin|"Rugged" Ronnie Garvin]]. Two weeks after [[WrestleMania V]] (where he teamed with the Jimmy Hart managed [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] in a loss to the now babyface Hart Foundation), he defeated Garvin in a [[Streak vs Career match|retirement match]] on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'' by reversing a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Small package|small package]] and holding on to the ropes. Garvin became a referee until Valentine and Hart managed to have him fired. Garvin then became a ring announcer, and began aggravating Valentine. At [[SummerSlam (1989)|SummerSlam 1989]] for his match with [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]], Garvin announced Valentine as being Hercules' "so-called opponent" and at 249&amp;nbsp;lbs looking to Garvin like he was "overweight by thirty pounds" and as he approached the ring. Other insults by Garvin during the introduction included Valentine not knowing whether he was "coming or going" and being the only wrestler Garvin knew who had "two left feet" and that he had a "pipsqueak, poor excuse for a manager". Following the match, Garvin then announced Hercules as the winner when Valentine cheated to win, despite the referee declaring Valentine the winner. Valentine knocked Garvin out of the ring before having a further punching match with Hercules while Garvin climbed back in the ring and nailed Valentine. The Hammer and Jimmy Hart eventually demanded that Garvin be reinstated so that they could fight in the ring.

For some time Valentine had been wearing a shin guard, which he would rotate (so it covered his calf, not his shin) in order to increase the pressure exerted by the Figure Four Leglock. He referred to the shin guard as the "Heartbreaker". Valentine would also (illegally) attach the shin guard to his arm in order to accentuate his [[elbow drop]]s. In the course of the feud, Garvin countered with a rotated shin guard of his own, which he dubbed "the Hammer Jammer". The feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Submission match|submission match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1990)|1990 Royal Rumble]]. Garvin utilized the "Hammer Jammer" during the match, using it to "counter" Valentine's figure-four leglock when Valentine applied it on Garvin during the match (rather than writhing in pain as normal during the hold, Garvin was smiling and making faces at Valentine). Jimmy Hart managed to remove the "Hammer Jammer" from Garvin's leg, after which Valentine systematically wore down Garvin's leg, but eventually lost after Garvin hit him with the Heartbreaker and applied a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|sharpshooter]], forcing Valentine to submit.

==== Rhythm and Blues, departure (1990–1992) ====
{{See also|Rhythm and Blues (professional wrestling)||l1=Rhythm and Blues}}
[[File:Rhythm and Blues tag team.jpg|thumb|right|Valentine (left) with his [[Rhythm and Blues (professional wrestling)|Rhythm and Blues]] tag team partner [[The Honky Tonk Man]]]]
Shortly after, Valentine formed a tag team with The Honky Tonk Man. For around eight months Valentine resisted dying his hair black (an idea of [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]]) but eventually relented and the team became known as [[Rhythm and Blues (professional wrestling)|Rhythm and Blues]] and were managed by Jimmy Hart. Rhythm and Blues feuded with [[The Bushwhackers]] ([[Butch Miller (wrestler)|Butch]] and [[Luke Williams (wrestler)|Luke]]) and The Hart Foundation, but were overshadowed by the [[The Road Warriors|Legion Of Doom]] ([[Road Warrior Animal|Animal]] and [[Road Warrior Hawk|Hawk]]), who were by then dominating the tag division. Famously during the time of Rhythm and Blues, WWF announcer [[Gorilla Monsoon]] would proclaim every time Valentine got on the microphone and sang (while also attempting to play a guitar) that "if you hung The Hammer for being a good singer you would hang an innocent person".

Valentine became a face in December 1990 and on January 19, 1991, Valentine participated in the fourth annual Royal Rumble match. He lasted forty four minutes. He was to feud with his former partner, the Honky Tonk Man, but Honky left the WWF before the feud could begin. Valentine lost to the Jimmy Hart managed [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] at [[WrestleMania VII]], and was defeated again at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam 1991]] by [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]]. He participated in the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]] for the vacated WWF Championship, where he attacked his old rival Ric Flair before being eliminated by the [[Barry Darsow|Repo Man]].

=== World Championship Wrestling (1992) ===
Conscious of his diminishing status, Valentine left the WWF and signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1992. He formed a tag team with [[Terry Taylor]] for six months and the duo went on to win the [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship]]. After Taylor was fired, Valentine was left without an [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angle]], and eventually resigned in late 1992 when he was asked to [[Job (professional wrestling)|lose]] to [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].

===World Wrestling Federation (1993, 1994)===
He reappeared in the WWF at the [[Survivor Series (1993)|1993 Survivor Series]] under a mask as The Blue Knight in an elimination match pitting [[Shawn Michaels]] (who was substituting for [[Jerry Lawler]]) and his three "knights" (who also included [[Barry Horowitz]] as the Red Knight and [[Jeff Gaylord]] as the Black Knight) against the Hart Family. He would return again, as Greg Valentine, at the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|1994 Royal Rumble]], lasting over twenty minutes before being eliminated by [[Rick Martel]]. That summer Valentine would wrestle three times on a July house show tour, facing [[Bob Backlund]] on each occasion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Championship Wrestling (1996–1998)===
On July 1, 1996 Valentine returned to WCW and faced Randy Savage on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' in [[Landover, Maryland]]. Valentine was used primarily on television, facing [[Big Show|The Giant]], [[Harlem Heat]], and [[Lex Luger]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw96.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he was used sparingly as well, again on television but had a 6-2 record, defeating [[Mike Enos]], [[Bobby Eaton]], and [[Billy Kidman]]. Valentine wrestled four times for the promotion in 1998 and was 3-1. He finished his WCW run with a victory over [[Pat Tanaka]] on February 17, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw98.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent circuit (1994–2007)===
Valentine went on to tour the [[independent circuit]], wrestling in Japan, with the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] based International Championship Wrestling promotion and with the [[American Wrestling Federation]]. Starting in the summer of 1996, Valentine made several appearances with WCW over the course of the next two years. He was used on a pay-per-appearance basis, but was rarely utilized and was allowed to continue wrestling on the independent circuit. On October 10, 1999 he appeared on the infamous ''[[Heroes of Wrestling]]'' pay per view, pinning [[George Steele|George "The Animal" Steele]] with the assistance of [[Sherri Martel]]. He wrestled on the 2000 tour of the [[United Kingdom]] in which [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] died. He was also involved with the short-lived [[X Wrestling Federation]] as an investor and as an in-ring performer. In the 2000s, he began reducing his independent dates in order to pursue a career in [[real estate]].

[[File:Greg Valentine &amp; Reid Flair.jpg|thumb|Valentine (right) in the ring with [[Reid Flair]] in 2009]]
On January 29, 2005 at ''[[WrestleReunion]]'', Valentine won a seventeen-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] to become the IWA Heavyweight Champion. He lost the title to [[Tito Santana]] at ''WrestleReunion #2'' on August 27 of that year. Valentine also wrestled for several independent promotions, including [[American Wrestling Association|AWA Superstars of Wrestling]], which toured [[New England]]. In AWA Superstars of Wrestling, Valentine regularly wrestled [[Tony Atlas]].

In May 2007, Valentine defeated Quinson Valentino to win the Canadian Grand-Prix Wrestling Championship in Morrisburg, Ontario.  On August 24, 2007, Valentine returned to Ontario to defend the CGPW Championship against [[Koko B. Ware]] in Cornwall, after Koko defeated Valentine in a non-title match, on the previous night, in Ottawa.  Valentine was successful in defeating Koko in Cornwall, though the title was vacated due to inactivity.

In late 2007, Valentine made an appearance in [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling|JCW]] or [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]] reforming the Dream Team with [[Brutus Beefcake]]. in an 8 team elimination match for the then vacant [[JCW Tag Team Championship|JCW Tag-Team Titles]]. Where they were the first team to be eliminated after a slightly botched sunset flip from [[Necro Butcher]].

On January 29, 2011, Valentine was inducted into the Legends Pro Wrestling "Hall of Fame" by Jack Blaze in Wheeling, West Virginia, at their annual "LPW Over The Edge" event.

===WWE (2004, 2005, 2008)===
On March 13, 2004, Valentine was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2004)|class of 2004]] by his former manager Jimmy Hart. The following night, at [[WrestleMania XX]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], Valentine received loud applause when the class of 2004 was introduced. Shortly after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, Valentine dedicated the plaque he received to his late father by saying:  "This one's for you pop, [[Johnny Valentine]]". On October 3, 2005, Valentine made an appearance at [[WWE Homecoming]], and on October 23 he was defeated by [[Rob Conway]] (then using a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] similar to that of [[Randy Orton]]'s gimmick of "the legend killer") on an episode of [[WWE Heat]] after [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene]] interfered on his behalf, causing the referee to award a victory via disqualification to Conway. He was present at the Retirement Ceremony of his long-time friend, [[Ric Flair]], on the March 31, 2008 episode of ''[[WWE Raw]]''.

==Personal life==
Greg married Julie on February 14, 1995. He had two daughters, Vanessa and Romaine, with his first wife, who once appeared on WWF TV in 1984 to give Valentine a back rub, which he claimed was the secret of his success. Vanessa began training with the Hart Brothers in the late 1990s. Vanessa died of cancer in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prowrestlingdigest.com/2014/06/01/stratoti-greg-valentine-speaks-his-mind-at-pwhof/ "The Fabulous Fargo Brothers Reunite!", by Paul Stratori, ''Pro Wrestling Digest'', June 1, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[Born again (Christianity)|born again Christian]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110520023801/http://midatlanticgateway.com/resourcecenter/interviews/valentine/valentine04.htm "The Greg Valentine Interview, Part Four", by David Chappell, MidAtlanticGateway.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally speaks at [[Secondary school|high schools]] and [[college]]s with [[Ted DiBiase]].

==Media==
Valentine has appeared on an episode of ''[[Hogan Knows Best]]'' as one of Hulk's party guests. He also co-starred in [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]'s ''[[Insane Clown Posse]] Theater'' along with [[Insane Clown Posse]] members [[Violent J]] and [[Shaggy 2 Dope]]. The cast was rounded out with Michelle "Sugar Slam" Rapp, Kevin Gill, and [[Vampiro]]. Valentine played an usher who ejected guests from the theater when their time is up on the show.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1544">'''Harden's''' is a UK [[restaurant guide]], publishing print, online and mobile reviews and ratings for both [[London]] and [[UK]] restaurants. Like New York's [[Zagat Survey]] (which no longer has a London edition), the ratings and reviews are based on the results of a reader survey (and were at one point also based on the personal visits of brothers and founders Richard and Peter Harden).

The survey on which the guide is based is also used to produce [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/the_dish/foodlist/ The Sunday Times Food List] - an annual publication featuring the top 100 restaurants in the UK.

It is published annually, and in addition to evaluating individual restaurants, and "Best of", it provides analysis of the restaurant scene and developments over the past year.

== History ==
The London guide was first published in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-05/london-s-appetite-for-restaurants-growing-at-dazzling-pace&lt;/ref&gt; and based on experiences with restaurant guides in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;Presumably [[Zagat Survey]], the survey-based NYC restaurant guide.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Düsseldorf]].

In 1998, the UK guide was started.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestaffcanteen.com/editorial/interview-richard-harden-hardens-guide&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hero card''' is a custom-printed card designed to promote a [[Auto racing|race]] team with emphasis on the primary driver(s) and their [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]]. Bigger than a [[baseball card]], hero cards have two standard sizes: 6 x 8 and 8 x 10 (inches).&lt;ref name=racerchicks&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Hero cards - What are They and Why They are a Good Investment

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Card information and driver depiction vary, but most hero cards include photos, information about the driver, race history/highlights, sponsors' names, and contact information. Drivers use hero cards as an oversized [[business card]] for autograph sessions, and teams sometimes include hero cards in their [[media kit]]s.&lt;ref name=racerchicks /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5884">'''Irish Queer Archive''' (IQA) ({{lang-ga|Cartlann Aerach na hÉireann}}) is a comprehensive collection of material in [[Ireland]] relating to [[homosexuality]], [[LGBT]] literature and general [[queer studies]].

The Archive contains the most comprehensive collection of material in Ireland relating to homosexuality in particular and lesbian/gay, bisexual and transgender studies in general. There are some quarter million press cuttings from the late 1960s onwards, a library of several hundred international titles (the earliest, a US title, dates from 1951), a complete set of every lesbian/gay title (periodicals and single issues) published since 1974 on the island of Ireland, and a collection of audiovisual material, photographs and slides, flyers, posters, badges and other ephemera. Amongst the private papers and organisational records are the archives of [[Alternative Miss Ireland]], the Dublin Lesbian &amp; Gay Film Festival [GAZE], [[National LGBT Federation]], IGRM, Gay Health Action, GLEN, Lesbians Organising Together (LOT), [[Dublin LGBT Pride]], and [[Gay Community News (Dublin)|Gay Community News]] (GCN].

The Irish Queer Archive – a vast collection of material which provides insights into the social, cultural and political history of the LGBT communities in an Irish and international context during the latter half of the 20th century – was presented in 2008 to the National Library of Ireland following a decision to donate it by the National LGBT Federation. IQA is a living archive and continues to accept donations and deposits.

==Background==
Post Stonewall ‘69, Irish lesbian and gay groups and individual activists have laboured to document their history; a history that ultimately touches on all of Irish life in the 20th century. Well-preserved yet incomplete records bear witness to the nascent lesbian and gay civil rights era of the early 1970s. Organisations like the Northern Irish Gay Rights Association (NIGRA), Irish Gay Rights Movement (IGRM) and the [[National LGBT Federation]] (NXF) maintained a tradition of preservation with keen foresight, often at considerable expense and with limited human resources.

As one of the largest, oldest and continuous lesbian/gay corporate organisations in Ireland, NXF has been to the forefront of maintaining some semblance of an archive. From the late ‘70s onwards this was confined to a rudimentary press clippings service and some limited research by, amongst others, activists Edmund Lynch, David Norris and Tom McClean. Like many organisations, NXF also managed to acquire or subsume the interests and records of other smaller, often more specialised, groups. One example of this is the entire archive of Out, Ireland's first commercial monthly gay magazine (1984-1988). The Out holding typically includes proofed manuscripts, original artwork, administrative and financial files, photographs, illustrations and file copies.

From 1980 onwards a larger group of people in NXF helped maintain and preserve documents and cuttings. NXF capitalised on years of acquisition by holding onto a huge number of international titles that were surplus to ILGA’s requirements when the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) moved its information secretariat from Dublin to Stockholm in 1982. This collection constitutes the bedrock of the archive's library of international titles dating back to 1951.

The archive and reference library was put on a more organised footing in Midsummer 1997 when NXF and GCN moved into new premises on South William Street, Dublin. At that point, civil rights activist [[Tonie Walsh]], along with librarians Linda Forry and Plunkett Conroy, began a systematic re-organisation of its holdings. A limited public office was set up in a short time, facilitating researchers, students and historians, in addition to servicing the research needs of journalists at Gay Community News.

Although it struggled financially in the following years with finding suitable, affordable office and storage accommodation, NXF lost no time in appointing a group of academics, historians and writers to focus on exploiting the collections and making suggestions for a future safe home. This IQA group consisted of Dr. Eibhear Walshe, lecturer in English at UCC; Dr. Mary McAuliffe and Dr. Katherine O’Donnell, both of Gender Studies at UCD; Joan Murphy, an RTÉ archivist; librarian Elizabeth Kirwan of NLI; and Tonie Walsh, coincidentally a former president of NXF and founding editor of Gay Community News (GCN).

Extensive overtures and negotiations with Gerry Lyne (since retired) of the Department of Manuscripts at the National Library of Ireland ultimately bore fruit when it was agreed in 2008 to transfer the collections to NLI. The historic transfer of IQA to NLI was also hugely symbolic as it signalled the Irish state taking ownership of LGBT heritage. However, given the size of the archive, much work needs to be done in filing, cataloguing and ultimately digitising the entire collection.IQA holdings that have been made accessible are described as Manuscripts Collection List No. 151. Further information may be gleaned from the National Library website: www.nli.ie.

An advisory group, composed of many of the above-mentioned individuals, continues to focus on opportunities to help the National Library of Ireland exploit its collection. Regular cultural updates are featured on its Facebook page: www.facebook.com/IQAadvisorygroup.

For his 100th, 200th, and 300th books (based on his personal count), Asimov published ''[[Opus 100]]'' (1969), ''[[Opus 200]]'' (1979), and ''Opus 300'' (1984), celebrating his writing.&lt;ref name="Asimov 1969"&gt;{{cite book |title=Opus 100 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asimov 1979"&gt;{{cite book |title=Opus 200 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1979 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-395-27625-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asimov 1984"&gt;{{cite book |title=Opus 300 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1984 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-395-36108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov was so prolific that his books span all major categories of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] except for category 100, [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="AsimovFAQ-DeweyDecimal"&gt;{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Jenkins |first2=John H. |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#others11 |title=Isaac Asimov FAQ |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=June 27, 2008 |accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Asimov did write several essays about psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/Essays/psychology.html |title=Asimov essays about psychology |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=1995 |accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forewords for the books ''The Humanist Way'' (1988) and ''In Pursuit of Truth'' (1982),&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;Isaac Asimov, "The Way of Reason", in ''In Pursuit of Truth: Essays on the Philosophy of Karl Popper on the Occasion of his 80th Birthday,,'' ed.

According to [[UNESCO]]'s ''Index Translationum database'', Asimov is the world's 24th most-translated author.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsstatexp.aspx?crit1L=5&amp;nTyp=min&amp;topN=50 Index Translationum database]''&lt;/ref&gt;

An online exhibit in [[West Virginia University Libraries]]' virtually complete Asimov Collection displays features, visuals, and descriptions of some of his over 600 books, games, audio recordings, videos, and wall charts. Many first, rare, and autographed editions are in the Libraries' Rare Book Room. Book jackets and autographs are presented online along with descriptions and images of children's books, science fiction art, multimedia, and other materials in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraries.wvu.edu/collections/exhibits/asimov/ WVU Libraries Asimov Collection].

'''Orange Pippin''' is a website providing information on the different cultivars of [[apple]], [[cherry]] and [[plum]]s. It was established around 2005 by Richard Borrie, a database programmer who lives in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orangepippin.com/resources/about-us About us]&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, it carries a listing of over 2000 apple orchards and 600 apple cultivars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orangepippin.com/ Orange Pippin]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is regarded as the most comprehensive resource for [[apple cultivars]] and orchards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deeprootsathome.com/apples-orange-pippin-and-my-pixies/ Deep Roots]&lt;/ref&gt;

Orange Pippin is named after [[England]]'s most famous apple variety, the [[Cox's Orange Pippin]] which according to them, is widely regarded as the finest of all dessert apples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orangepippin.com/ Orange Pippin]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parenthetical referencing''', also known as '''Harvard  referencing''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm| title=Harvard System of Referencing Guide| date=21 May 2012| publisher=Anglia Ruskin University| accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[citation]] style in which partial citations—for example, "(Smith 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;1)"—are enclosed within [[parentheses]] and embedded in the text, either within or after a sentence. They are accompanied by a full, alphabetized list of citations in an end section, usually titled "references", "reference list", "works cited", or "end-text citations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.williams.edu/citing/styles/chicago2.php "Author–date system], Chicago Manual of Style, Williams College Libraries, accessed 25 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pears, R and Shields, G ''Cite them right : the essential referencing guide'' (2008) {{ISBN|978-0-9551216-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parenthetical referencing can be used in lieu of [[Note (typography)|footnote]] citations (the [[Vancouver system]]).

There are two styles of parenthetical referencing:
* Author–date: primarily used in the natural sciences and social sciences, and recommended by the [[American Chemical Society]] and the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA);
* Author–title or author–page: primarily used in the arts and the humanities, and recommended by the [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA).

== Origins and use ==
According to an 1896 paper, the origin of the author–date style is attributed to a paper by Edward Laurens Mark, Hersey professor of anatomy and director of the zoological laboratory at Harvard University, who may have copied it from the cataloguing system used then and now by the library of Harvard's [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]].&lt;ref name=Chernin&gt;Chernin, Eli (1988). [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1834803&amp;blobtype=pdf "The 'Harvard system': a mystery dispelled"],  ''British Medical Journal.'' October 22, 1988, pp. 1062–1063.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 Mark wrote a paper on the embryogenesis of the garden slug, in which he included an author–date citation in parentheses on page 194, the first known instance of such a reference.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Edward Laurens (1881). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0tAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Maturation, fecundation, and segmentation of Limax campestris, Binney"], ''Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College,'' Volume 6, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, according to Eli Chernin writing in the ''British Medical Journal'', references had appeared in inconsistent styles in footnotes, referred to in the text using a variety of printers' symbols, including asterisks and daggers. Chernin writes that a 1903 [[festschrift]] dedicated to Mark by 140 students, including [[Theodore Roosevelt]], confirms that the author–date system is attributable to Mark. The festschrift pays tribute to Mark's 1881 paper, writing that it "introduced into zoology a proper fullness and accuracy of citation and a convenient and uniform method of referring from text to bibliography." According to an editorial note in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 1945, an unconfirmed anecdote is that the term "Owen system" was introduced by an English visitor to Harvard University library, who was impressed by the citation system and dubbed it "Harvard system" upon his return to England.&lt;ref name=Chernin/&gt;

Although it originated in biology, it is now more common in humanities, history, and social science.  It is favored by a few scientific journals, including the major biology journal ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]].''

=={{anchor|Author-date}} Author–date==
In the author–date method (Harvard referencing), the in-text citation is placed in parentheses after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports. The citation includes the author's  name, year of publication, and page number(s) when a specific part of the source is referred to (Smith 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;1) or (Smith 2008:1). A full citation is given in the references section: Smith, John (2008). ''Name of Book''. Name of Publisher.

===How to cite===
The structure of a citation under the author–date method is the author's surname, year of publication, and page number or range, in parentheses, as illustrated in the Smith example near the top of this article.
* The page number or page range is omitted if the entire work is cited. The author's surname is omitted if it appears in the text. Thus we may say: "Jones (2001) revolutionized the field of trauma surgery."
* Two authors are cited using "and" or "&amp;": (Deane and Jones 1991) or (Deane &amp; Jones 1991). More than two authors are cited using "[[Et al#et alii|''et al.'']]": (Smith ''et al.'' 1992).
* In some documentation systems (e.g., MLA style), an unknown date is cited as having "no date of publication" by the abbreviation for "no date" (Deane, n.d.).&lt;ref name=EastAnglia&gt;[http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm?harvard_id=66#66 "References with missing details"], "Harvard System of Referencing Guide", University of East Anglia, accessed 25 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In such documentation systems, works without pagination are referred to in the References list as "not paginated" with the abbreviation for that phrase (n. pag.).&lt;ref name=EastAnglia/&gt;
* "No place of publication" and/or "no publisher" are both designated the same way (n.p.) and placed in the appropriate spot in the bibliographical citation (''Harvard Referencing''.  N.p.).&lt;ref name=EastAnglia/&gt;
* A reference to a republished work is cited with the original publication date either in square brackets (Marx [1867] 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;90) or separated with a slash (Marx, 1867/1967, p.&amp;nbsp;90).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = American Psychological Association | title = Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association | edition = 5th | publisher = American Psychological Association | location = Washington, DC, USA | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1-55798-791-4 | page = 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the original publication year qualifies the suggestion otherwise that the publication originally occurred in 1967.
* If an author published several books in 2005, the year of the first publication (in the alphabetic order of the references) is cited and referenced as 2005a, the second as 2005b and so on.
* A citation is placed wherever appropriate in or after the sentence. If it is at the end of a sentence, it is placed before the period, but a citation for an entire block quote immediately ''follows'' the period at the end of the block since the citation is not an actual part of the quotation itself.
* Complete citations are provided in alphabetical order in a section following the text, usually designated as "Works cited" or "References." The difference between a "works cited" or "references" list and a bibliography is that a bibliography may include works not directly cited in the text.
* All citations are in the same font as the main text.
* Note that "[t]he 'Harvard System' is something of a misnomer, as there is no official institutional connection. It's another name for the author/date citation system, the custom of using author and date in parentheses, e.g. (Robbins 1987) to refer readers to the full bibliographic citations in appended bibliographies. Some Harvard faculty were among the first practitioners in the late 19th century, and the name stuck, particularly in England and the Commonwealth countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Harvard system for citing references?|url=http://asklib.hcl.harvard.edu/faq/81735|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820040237/http://asklib.hcl.harvard.edu/faq/81735|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 August 2015|website=Harvard College Library's Ask a Librarian service|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also note that there is no official guide to Harvard citation style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mullan|first1=W.M.A.|title=DFST Harvard Reference Generator|url=https://www.dairyscience.info/harvard/referencegen.php|publisher=Dairy Science and Food Technology (DSFT)|accessdate=17 July 2016|quote=Note the Harvard system of referencing is not 'tightly' specified and some variation in the use of capital letters, italics, the use of parentheses and text styles does occur in different institutions and journals. Please check the 'house style' that is specified for your publication, thesis, dissertation or assignment before submitting your work.}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently variations occur across various online Harvard citation and referencing guides. For example, some universities instruct students to type a book's publication date ''without'' parentheses in the reference list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Guide to Harvard Style Referencing|url=https://library.sydney.edu.au/subjects/downloads/citation/Harvard_Complete.pdf|website=University Library|publisher=The University of Sydney|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Harvard System of Referencing (5th edition)|url=http://libweb.anglia.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.htm|website=University Library|publisher=Anglia Ruskin University|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In giving the city of publication, an internationally well-known city (such as London, The Hague, or New York) is given as the city alone. If the city is not internationally well known, the country (or state and country if in the U.S.) is given.

An example of a newspaper reference:
* Bowcott, Owen (October 18, 2005). [https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,11917,1594716,00.html "Protests halt online auction to shoot stag"], ''The Guardian''.

===Advantages===
* The principal advantage of the author–date method is that a reader familiar with a field is likely to recognize a citation without having to check in the references section.  This is most useful in fields whose works are commonly known by their date of publication (for example, the sciences and social sciences in which one cites, say, "the 2005 Johns Hopkins study of brain function"), or if the author cited is notorious (for example, HIV denialist [[Peter Duesberg]] on the cause of [[AIDS]]).
* The use of author–date systems helps the reader easily identify sources that may be outdated.
* If the same source is cited more than once, even a reader unfamiliar with the author may remember the name.  It quickly becomes obvious if the publication is relying heavily on a single author or single publication.  When many different pages of the same work are cited, the reader does not need to flip back and forth to footnotes or endnotes full of "[[ibid.]]" citations to discover this fact.
* With the author–date method, there is no renumbering hassle when the order of in-text citations is changed, which can be a scourge of the [[Vancouver system|numbered endnotes system]] if house style or project style insists that citations never appear out of numerical order. (Computerized [[reference-management software]] automates this aspect of the numbered system [for example, Microsoft Word's endnote system, Wikipedia's &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; system, [[BibTeX|LaTeX/BibTeX]], or [[Comparison of reference management software|various applications marketed to professionals]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.)
* Parenthetical referencing works well in combination with substantive notes.  When the note system is used for source citations, two different systems of note marking and placement are needed—in Chicago Style, for instance, "the citation notes should be numbered and appear as endnotes. The substantive notes, indicated by asterisks and other symbols, appear as footnotes" ([[#refChicagoManualOfStyle2003|"Chicago Manual of Style" 2003]], 16.63-64). This approach can be cumbersome in any circumstances. When it is not possible to use footnotes altogether probably because of the publisher's policy, it results in two parallel series of endnotes, which can be confusing to readers. Using parenthetical referencing for sources avoids such a problem.
* The reader can find the in-text author–date citations of a specific work more easily. Finding in-text numbered citations is more difficult because some will not appear if they are included in ranges.

===Disadvantages===
* The principal disadvantage of parenthetical references is they take up space in the main body of the text and are distracting to a reader, especially when many works are cited in a single place (which often occurs when reviewing a large body of previous work).  Numbered footnotes or endnotes, by contrast, can be combined into a range, e.g. "&lt;nowiki&gt;[27–35]&lt;/nowiki&gt;".  However this disadvantage is offset by the fact that parenthetical referencing may be economical for the overall document since, for instance, "(Smith 2008: 34)" takes up a small amount of space in a paragraph, whereas the same information would require a whole line in a footnote or endnote.
* In many disciplines in the arts and humanities, date of publication is often not the most important piece of information about a particular work.  Thus, in author–date references such as "(Dickens 2003: 10)", the date is essentially redundant or meaningless when read on the page, since works may go through numerous editions or translations long after the original publication. Compare a reference in a science discipline such as "The last survey indicated that four hundred were left in the wild (Jones ''et al.'' 2003)", where the date ''is'' meaningful.  The reader of certain forms of arts and humanities scholarship may thus be better aided by the use of author–title referencing styles such as MLA: for example, "(Dickens ''Oliver'', 10)", where meaningful information is given on the page.  Historical scholarship is an exception, since, when citing a primary source, date of publication ''is'' meaningful, though in most branches of history footnotes are preferred on other grounds.  Generally speaking, however, it is instructive that author–date systems such as [[Parenthetical referencing#Origins and use|Harvard were devised by scientists]], whereas author–title systems such as [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA]] were devised by humanities scholars.
* Similarly, because works are frequently reprinted in many arts and humanities disciplines, different author–date references might refer to the same work.  For example, "(Spivak 1985)", "(Spivak 1987)", and "(Spivak 1996)" might all refer to the same essay — and might be better rendered in author–title style as "(Spivak 'Subaltern')".  Such ambiguities may be resolved by adding an original date of publication, for example, "(Spivak 1985/1996)", though this is cumbersome and exacerbates the principal disadvantage of parenthetical referencing, namely its distraction for the reader and unattractiveness on the page.
* Rules can be complicated or unclear for non-academic references, particularly those where the personal author is unknown, such as government-issued documents and standards.
* When removing a portion of text which has citations in it, the editor(s) must also check the ''Reference'' sections to see if the sources cited in the removed text is used elsewhere in the paper or book, and if not, to delete any reference not actually cited in the text (although this issue can be eliminated by the use of [[Reference management software|reference manager software]]).
* The use of the author–date methods (but not author–title) can be confusing when used in monographs about particularly prolific authors.  In-text citation and back-of-the-book listings of works arranged by date of publication are conducive to errors and confusion: for example, Harvey 1996a, Harvey 1996b, Harvey 1996c, Harvey 1996d, Harvey 1995a, Harvey 1995b, Harvey 1986a, Harvey 1986b, and so on.
* The mixing of text with frequent parentheses and long strings of numbers is typographically inelegant.
* Most historical journals (apart from economic and social history) use footnotes because of the need for maximum flexibility. Primary source references to archives, etc., involve long and complex information, all of which may be immediately relevant to a serious reader. An interesting example of this arose with the famous work of the anthropologists John and Jean Comaroff, ''Of Revelation and Revolution'' which treated historical events from anthropological perspective: although parenthetical references were used for scholarly sources, the authors found it necessary to use notes for the historical archive material they were also using.

==Author–title==
In the author–title or author–page method, also referred to as [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], the in-text citation is placed in parentheses after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports, and includes the author's  name (a short title only is necessary when there is more than one work by the same author) and a page number where appropriate (Smith 1) or (Smith, ''Playing'' 1).  (No "p." or "pp." prefaces the page numbers and main words in titles appear in capital letters, following MLA style guidelines.)  A full citation is given in the references section.

==Content notes==
{{See also|The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers#Content notes}}
A content note generally contains useful information and explanations that do not fit into the primary text itself. Content notes may be given as [[footnote]]s or [[endnote]]s or even a combination of both footnotes and endnotes.  Such content notes may themselves contain a style of parenthetical referencing, just as the main text does.

The exhibition's title reflects the lyric "I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains", from the song "[[Nobody Home]]", on ''[[The Wall (Pink Floyd)|The Wall]]''. It was promoted with media appearances by all three surviving band members ([[David Gilmour]], [[Nick Mason]] and [[Roger Waters]]), and designer [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]];&lt;ref name="Dunton" /&gt; as well as the flying of an [[Pink Floyd pigs|inflatable pig]] over the V&amp;A,&lt;ref name="Bonner" /&gt; and at the BBC's [[Broadcasting House]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph-pig"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/11/pictures-day-11-may-2017/pink-floyd-inflatable-pig-floats-next-broadcasting-house-promote/|title=The Pink Floyd inflatable pig floats next to Broadcasting House to promote their new exhibition at the V&amp;A museum - Pictures of the Day|date=11 May 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treating the band's history in chronological order, the exhibition ends with their 2005 reunion at [[Live 8]],&lt;ref name="Aspden" /&gt; with footage of the band performing "[[Comfortably Numb]]", using specially-remixed audio, delivered via [[AMBEO]], a [[Sennheiser]] 3D audio technology, over 17 channels and 25 speakers, seven of which are [[subwoofer]]s.&lt;ref name="Dunton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zemler" /&gt;

The '''Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI)''' ({{lang-ru|Российский государственный архив социально-политической истории (РГАСПИ)}}) is a large [[Russia]]n state [[archive]] based in [[Moscow]], which holds pre-1952 archives of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). It is managed by [[Rosarkhiv]]. It was established in 1999 as merger of two other archives, the Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Most Recent History (RTsKhIDNI, {{lang-ru|Российский центр хранения и изучения документов новейшей истории (РЦХИДНИ}}) and the Centre for the Preservation of Documents of Youth Organizations ({{lang-ru|Центр хранения документов молодежных организаций (ЦХДМО)}}). Post-1952 archives of the CPSU are collected in the [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]].

The archives include many of the personal papers of major Communist and Soviet leaders, including [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Mikhail Kalinin]], [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Sergei Kirov]], [[Georgy Malenkov]], [[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[V. M. Molotov]], [[Georgi Plekhanov]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], and [[Grigory Zinoviev]].

'''[[F. L. Lucas]]''''s '''''Style''''' (1955) is a book about the writing and appreciation of "good prose", expanded for the general reader from lectures originally given to English Literature students at [[Cambridge University]]. It sets out to answer the questions, "Why is so much writing wordy, confused, graceless, dull?" and "What are the qualities that endow language, spoken or written, with persuasiveness or power?" &lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.10&lt;/ref&gt; It offers "a few principles" and "a number of examples of the effective use of language, especially in prose", and adds "a few warnings".&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.16, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; The book is written as a series of eleven essays (with much quotation and anecdote, and without bullet-points or note-form), which themselves illustrate the virtues commended.&lt;ref&gt;John Rosselli, review of ''Style'' in the ''Manchester Guardian'', September 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "RM in TST 1955"&gt;[[Raymond Mortimer]], review of ''Style'' in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 11 September 1955&lt;/ref&gt; The work is unified by what Lucas calls "one vital thread, on which the random principles of good writing may be strung, and grasped as a whole".&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), author's paragraph on dust-jacket&lt;/ref&gt; That "vital thread" is "courtesy to readers". It is upon this emphasis on good manners, urbanity, good humour, grace, control, that the book's aspiration to usefulness rests. Discussion tends to circle back to 18th-century masters like Voltaire, Montesquieu, Gibbon, the later Johnson, or their successors like [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]], [[Anatole France]], [[Lytton Strachey]] and [[Desmond MacCarthy]]. 

==Contents==
The book begins with a definition of style in prose, and a discussion of its importance. It questions the extent to which style can be taught, given that it is a reflection of personality ("The problems of style are really problems of personality" &lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.48&lt;/ref&gt;), but concludes that "Writers should write from the best side of their characters, and at their best moments." &lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.61&lt;/ref&gt; It goes on to outline the elements of a lucid, varied and pointed prose style; to warn of perils to be avoided (the book is an anthology of weeds as well as flowers); and to explore different methods of planning, composition and revision. There is a chapter on the rhythms of prose and on aural effects. Passages quoted for analysis are in a range of styles, taken from letters, essays, criticism, biography, history, novels and plays. Aside from simile and metaphor, the book does not deal, except incidentally, with figures of speech; nor with rhetorical tropes, apart from irony and syntactical devices such as inversion and antithesis. Lucas does not deal, except in passing, with points of correct English usage, referring readers to Fowler's ''[[Modern English Usage]]'' for these.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), Preface&lt;/ref&gt; Giving a few examples of regrettable change and ignorance, however, he stresses the importance of "preserving the purity of the English tongue".&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), pp.41–45&lt;/ref&gt; Languages evolve, but can also degenerate.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), pp.35–37&lt;/ref&gt;

"I can think of no constantly perfect stylist who has not laboured like an emmet." &lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

"One cannot ask oneself too often, both in writing and in re-reading what one has written, 'Do I really mean that? Have I said it for effect, though I know it is exaggerated? Or from cowardice, because otherwise I should be ill thought of?' " &lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

"A writer should view his mental offspring as relentlessly as a Spartan father. If he does not 'expose' his unsound offspring himself, others will, in a different sense." &lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and publishing history==
The book was based on one of Lucas's first courses of lectures at Cambridge (1946 to 1953) after his return from [[Bletchley Park]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cambridge University Reporter]], 1946–1953&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to lecture on 'Good prose, and the writing of it' (the course was later renamed 'Style') reflected a wish to improve the quality of student essays, adversely affected, Lucas felt, by the [[New Criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.24–25&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to expand the lectures into book form for the general reader was prompted partly by his recent experience as an Intelligence report-writer in [[Hut 3]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.22, p.143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lucas FS 1960"/&gt; and partly by his belief that "on the quality of a nation's language depends to some extent the quality of its life and thought; and on the quality of its life and thought the quality of its language".&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'' (London 1955), p.36&lt;/ref&gt; First published in 1955 by [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell &amp; Company]] of London and by the [[Macmillan Company]], New York, ''Style'' went through seven impressions in the UK between 1955 and 1964. In the second edition, published by [[Collier Books]] of New York in 1962 and by [[Pan Books]] of London in 1964, Lucas made minor changes and added – in response to some readers' protests&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Style'', 2nd edition (New York 1962, London 1964), Preface&lt;/ref&gt; – footnote translations (his own) of the book's foreign-language quotations. Cassell reprinted the first edition in 1974, adding a Foreword by [[Sir Bruce Fraser]]; this reissue Cassell mistakenly called the "second edition". After being out-of-print for four decades, the real second edition, with Lucas's translations, checked against the first edition, was reprinted in 2012 by Harriman House Publishing, of [[Petersfield]], who added their own sub-title, 'The Art of Writing Well'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://harriman-house.com/style F. L. Lucas ''Style: The Art of Writing Well'', Harriman House Publishing 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; "Though one cannot teach people to write well," Lucas had observed, "one can sometimes teach them to write rather better." &lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'On the Fascination of Style', in Birk, N. P., &amp; Birk, G. B., ''The Odyssey Reader: Ideas and Style'' (New York 1968), p.490&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Style'' was generally well received.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Lucas, ''Style: The Art of Writing Well'', Harriman House Publishing 2012, pp.i–iii (press quotations)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nowell-Smith, Simon, ''The House of Cassell, 1848-1958'' (London 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; "A delightful book," wrote [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']], "exemplifying brilliantly all that it seeks to instill – enjoyment of reading and mastery of writing." &lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Gordon Porteus]], review of ''Style'' in the ''Time and Tide'', September 1955&lt;/ref&gt; It was Lucas's most successful book.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, L. P., ''Kingsmen of a Century, 1873–1972'' (Cambridge 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; He had long had a reputation as a stylist,&lt;ref&gt;Sir Richard Livingstone, Foreword to Lucas's ''Euripides and his Influence'' (Boston 1923)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Lucas's own style had been analysed in A. J. J. Ratcliff's ''Prose of Our Time'' (London 1931)&lt;/ref&gt; "one whose pen possesses the sparkle and fascination which made the essay, in the hands of writers such as Bacon and Montaigne, a thing of beauty and interest".&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's advertisement for Lucas's ''Studies French and English'' (London 1934), dust-jacket&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Mortimer]] in ''The Sunday Times'', however, found the author "sometimes laboured in his anxiety to be debonair".&lt;ref name = "RM in TST 1955"/&gt; Some reviewers expressed the view that "The book's most obvious merit lies in its quotations" ([[Rayner Heppenstall]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]''). "There are almost as many in French as in English, and their range and aptness are remarkable." &lt;ref name = "RH NS&amp;N"&gt;Rayner Heppenstall, 'Prose for General Purposes', review of ''Style'' in ''The New Statesman and Nation'', 24 September 1955, p.371-372&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, felt that there should have been fewer examples from poetry and more from contemporary prose.&lt;ref name = "RH NS&amp;N"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J. M. Cohen]], review of ''Style'' in ''[[The Spectator]]'', 18 November 1955&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Listener (magazine)|''The Listener'']] approved "the entertaining relevance of anecdote".&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Style'' in ''The Listener'', September 1955&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Bruce Fraser]] praised Lucas's close analysis of faulty style: "The passage in which he dissects a great hunk of Swinburne's prose, reduces it by more than half, recognizes that it could be made shorter still, and ends by suggesting that it need not have been written at all, is in itself worth the whole price of the book".&lt;ref&gt;Foreword by Sir Bruce Fraser to 1974 Cassell reprint of ''Style''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Toynbee]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' disliked the work and dismissed its author as "middlebrow": "There have been wonderful styles which illustrate the virtues of clarity, brevity, simplicity and vitality. Other styles, no less wonderful, have exhibited obscurity, amplitude, complexity and decadence. Good writers have been urbane, gay and healthy: other good writers have been boorish, melancholic and diseased... Mr Lucas pays lip-service to the recalcitrant disorder of the scene" but "writes far too briefly of variety".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Toynbee, review of ''Style'' in ''The Observer'', 11 September 1955&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]] in ''[[The New Criterion]]'' (2011) considered the book "filled with fine things ... F. L. Lucas wrote the best book on prose composition, for the not-so-simple reason that, in the modern era, he was the smartest, most cultivated man to turn his energies to the task".&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Joseph, 'Heavy Sentences', ''[[The New Criterion]]'' June 2011 [https://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Heavy-sentences-7053]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 article "brought attention to this neglected classic and helped set in train its reissue".&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Lucas, ''Style: The Art of Writing Well'' (Harriman House Publishing 2012), Publisher's Acknowledgements, p.257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newenglishreview.org/custpage.cfm/frm/117345/sec_id/117345 Walther, Matthew, 'The Art of Writing Well', review of ''Style'' in ''New English Review'', July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

=='On the Fascination of Style' (1960)==
Lucas returned to the subject in a 4000-word essay, 'On the Fascination of Style', published in the March 1960 number of [[Holiday (magazine)|''Holiday'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Holiday'' magazine, [[Curtis Publishing Company]], Pennsylvania, March 1960&lt;/ref&gt; The essay reworks the core points of ''Style'' more succinctly, in a different order and with some changes in emphasis, and adds new examples and a few autobiographical anecdotes. It was reprinted in Birk &amp; Birk, ''The Odyssey Reader: Ideas and Style'' (New York, 1968)&lt;ref name = "Lucas FS 1960"&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'On the Fascination of Style', in Birk, N. P., &amp; Birk, G. B., eds., ''The Odyssey Reader: Ideas and Style'' (New York 1968), pp.486–494&lt;/ref&gt; and in McCuen &amp; Winkler, ''Readings for Writers'' (New York, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;McCuen, Jo Ray, &amp; Winkler, Anthony C., eds., ''Readings for Writers'' (New York 2009) {{ISBN|1-4282-3128-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was reissued in 2012 as 'How to Write Powerful Prose', by Harriman House Publishing, Petersfield.&lt;ref&gt;'How to Write Powerful Prose', Harriman House Publishing, Petersfield [http://www.harriman-house.com/book/view/326/lifestyle/f-l-lucas/how-to-write-powerful-prose/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Far Side''''' is a single-panel [[comic strip|comic]] created by [[Gary Larson]] and [[print syndication|syndicated]] by [[Universal Press Syndicate]], which ran from January 1, 1980, to January 1, 1995 (when Larson retired as a cartoonist). Its [[surrealism|surrealistic]] humor is often based on uncomfortable social situations, improbable events, an [[anthropomorphic]] view of the world, logical fallacies, impending bizarre disasters, (often twisted) references to [[proverb]]s, or the search for meaning in life. Larson's frequent use of animals and nature in the comic is popularly attributed to his background in [[biology]]. Reruns are still printed in many newspapers.

''The Far Side'' was ultimately carried by more than 1,900 daily newspapers, translated into 17 languages, and collected into calendars, greeting cards, and 23 compilation books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
The series was preceded by a similar panel called ''[[Nature's Way (comic strip)|Nature's Way]]'', also by Larson. Larson decided that he could increase his income from cartooning by selling his ''Nature's Way'' strip to another newspaper. While on vacation in [[San Francisco]], he pitched his work to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and, to his surprise, the ''Chronicle'' bought the strip and promoted it for [[Print syndication|syndication]], renaming it ''The Far Side''.&lt;ref name=Salon99&gt;{{Cite web |last=McCarthy |first=Susan |url=http://www.salon.com/people/bc/1999/12/21/larson/ |title=Gary Larson |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=21 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first appearance in the ''Chronicle'' was on January 1, 1980.  A week later, ''The Seattle Times'' dropped ''Nature’s Way.''&lt;ref name=prehistory&gt;Larson, Gary. ''The Prehistory of the Far Side: a 10th anniversary exhibit''. Kansas City, MO: Andrew and McNeel, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8362-1851-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Far Side'' ran for fifteen years, syndicated initially by [[Chronicle Features]] and later by [[Universal Press Syndicate]], until Larson retired with his final strip published on January 1, 1995.

One of ''The Far Side'' cartoons shows two chimpanzees grooming. One finds a blonde human hair on the other and inquires, "Conducting a little more 'research' with that [[Jane Goodall]] tramp?"&lt;ref name="Strange Legacy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comicsalliance.com/tribute-gary-larson-far-side/ | title=The Strange Legacy of Gary Larson's 'The Far Side' | publisher=ComicsAlliance | date=August 14, 2015 | accessdate=August 20, 2016 | author=Chris Sims}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodall herself was in Africa at the time, and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] thought this was in bad taste, and had their lawyers draft a letter to Larson and his distribution syndicate, in which they described the cartoon as an "atrocity." They were stymied by Goodall herself when she returned and saw the cartoon, as she stated that she found the cartoon amusing.&lt;ref name="farside"&gt;Larson, Gary. ''The Prehistory of the Far Side: a 10th anniversary exhibit''. Kansas City, MO: Andrew and McNeel, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8362-1851-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, all profits from sales of a shirt featuring this cartoon go to the Jane Goodall Institute. Goodall wrote a preface to ''The Far Side Gallery 5'', detailing her version of the controversy, and the Institute's letter was included next to the cartoon in the complete ''Far Side'' collection.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gary. ''The Far Side Gallery 5''. Kansas City, MO: Andrew and McNeel, 1995. ({{ISBN|0-8362-0425-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; She praised Larson's creative ideas, which often compare and contrast the behavior of humans and animals.

''[[The Complete Far Side: 1980-1994|The Complete Far Side]]'' and ''[[The Prehistory of The Far Side]]'' include letters from angry readers alongside the comics. The letters were written to newspaper publishers and often demanded the removal of ''The Far Side''. Despite these protests, ''The Far Side'' remained popular and continued to run in many newspapers. Larson himself often laughs at the controversies as evidenced in ''The Prehistory of The Far Side'', in which he writes that the people complaining have usually misunderstood the cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Gary. ''The Prehistory of the Far Side''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Gary Larson drew a cover for the November 17 edition of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2003-11-17 The New Yorker cover 17-Nov-2003]&lt;/ref&gt; (the Cartoon Issue), a prestigious offer he said he could not refuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2003/nov/30/gary_larson_revisits/ The Lawrence Journal-World]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design overview ==
Most ''The Far Side'' cartoons are a single rectangular panel, occasionally split into small sections of four, six, or eight for the purposes of a storyline. A caption or dialogue usually appears under the panel as typed text, although word-balloons are sometimes used for conversations. Sunday comics were double-sized, done in watercolor or colored pencils, with captions handwritten in Larson's own hand. Most of Larson's comics relied on some combination of a visual and verbal gag, rather than just one or the other. Some recurring themes in the comic include people being stranded on desert islands, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], heaven, hell, and the life of [[caveman|cavepeople]]. Many cartoons focused on animals, especially cows, bears, dogs, flies, and ducks. Notably, virtually all characters portrayed in the comic were overweight or obese, and usually wearing glasses. In addition, unless needed for a facial or comic expression, eyes are almost never drawn and characters usually show only a brow ridge.

== Books ==
Gary Larson produced 23 ''The Far Side'' books, which were all on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. The cartoons were first collected in small books (see list below), and some were then republished in larger best-of collections such as ''The Far Side Galleries''. Additional best-of collections were published, such as ''The Prehistory of The Far Side'', culminating in the final publication, ''The Complete Far Side'' in 2003.

The five ''The Far Side Gallery'' books are the most popular, each of them collecting together the best cartoons from three smaller books, along with a humorous foreword by celebrity fans, including [[Stephen Jay Gould]], [[Stephen King]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Jane Goodall]].

In 1989, ''The Prehistory of The Far Side'' was published to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the strip. In this book, Gary Larson discussed the development of ''The Far Side'', and the public's reaction to it, and presented a selection of his personal favorites from the cartoon's history as well as previously unpublished sketches and strips rejected by his editor.

In 2003, ''The Complete Far Side'' was released, containing nearly every ''The Far Side'' comic ever published (except for a few cartoons written for Christmas cards). The collection is also missing parody art pieces from ''Wiener Dog Art'', some material from ''The Prehistory of The Far Side'', and a panel run for a caption writing contest in the ''[[The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|Telegram-Tribune]]'' newspaper. The set was released in two volumes (1980–1986 and 1987–1994) with a foreword by [[Steve Martin]] and an introduction by Larson's longtime editor, Jake Morrisey. The first-edition hardcover boxed set weighs {{convert|19.5|lb|kg}}. Some of the comics were altered for this book, either featuring a different caption, correcting errors, or simply becoming colorized.

== Television productions==
{{main|Gary Larson's Tales from the Far Side}}
In 1994, Larson produced an animated special, ''[[Tales from the Far Side]]'', featuring his art style and gags from the strips. He produced a sequel in 1997.

== Online ==
Larson has asked people not to use ''Far Side'' cartoons on the internet, writing a widely distributed letter in which he explains the "emotional cost" to him of people displaying his cartoons on their websites and asks them to stop doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portmann.com/farside/home.html letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
In 1987, a special exhibit of 527 black and white ''Far Side'' panels was shown in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington D.C.]] 127 of the panels were originals, displayed in the rotunda on boards that held 50 panels each. Later the display became a traveling exhibit that was shown in [[San Francisco]], Washington D.C., [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Chicago]], [[Toronto]], [[New York City]], [[Denver]], and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Reilly|first=David|title=The Far Side Of The Smithsonian Through Gary Larson's Lens, The World's A Naturally Wacky Place, So A Temple To Natural History Is A Fitting Place For A Show Of His Cartoons|url=http://articles.philly.com/1987-04-16/news/26191943_1_dinosaur-bones-cartoons-natural-history|accessdate=12 March 2014|newspaper=Inquirer|date=April 16, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a ''Far Side'' gallery at the [[California Academy of Science]] that featured some of Larson's panels. The exhibit included a giant microscope under which visitors could stand, based on one of Larson's cartoons. Looking up through the objective lens revealed a giant blinking eyeball.  The building was torn down and replaced and the exhibit is no longer in the new facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/academy_tour/naturalhistory/farside.html |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=12 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002093606/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/academy_tour/naturalhistory/farside.html |archivedate=October 2, 2013 |title=California Academy of Sciences - Academy Tour - Natural History Museum: }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The International Pharmacopoeia''''' ('''''Pharmacopoeia Internationalis''''', '''''Ph. Int.''''') is a [[pharmacopoeia]] issued by the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref name="apps_who_int_PhInt"&gt;{{Citation |author=WHO |authorlink=World Health Organization |year=2017 |title=The International Pharmacopoeia |edition=7th |url=http://apps.who.int/phint/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a recommendation, with the aim to provide international quality specifications for pharmaceutical substances (active ingredients and [[excipient]]s) and [[dosage form]]s, together with supporting general methods of analysis, for global use. Its texts can be used or adapted by any WHO member state wishing to establish legal pharmaceutical requirements.

The ''Ph.Int.'' is based primarily on medicines included in the current WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) and medicines included in the current invitations to manufacturers to submit an expression of interest (EOI) to the WHO Prequalification Team – Medicines (PQT) and those of interest to other UN Organizations. In recent years, priority has been given to medicines of importance in low and middle income countries, which may not appear in any other pharmacopoeias, including child-friendly dosage forms.

The ''Ph.Int.'' is designed to serve all Member States, especially their national and regional regulatory authorities, organizations in the United Nations system, and regional and interregional harmonization efforts, and they underpin important public health initiatives, including the prequalification and procurement of quality medicines through major international entities, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNICEF.

The monographs published in the ''Ph.Int.'' are established in an independent manner via a consultative procedure and based on international experience. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/pharmacopoeia/Annex1-TRS992.pdf?ua=1 Procedure for the development of monographs and other texts for The International Pharmacopoeia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Third Position''' is an [[ideology]] that was developed in the late 20th century by [[political parties]] including [[Terza Posizione]] in Italy and [[Third Way (France)|Troisième Voie]] in France. It emphasizes opposition to both [[communism]] and [[capitalism]]. Advocates of Third Position politics typically present themselves as "beyond left and right" while [[syncretic politics|syncretizing]] ideas from each end of the [[political spectrum]], usually [[reactionary]] [[Cultural conservatism|right-wing cultural]] views and [[political radicalism|radical]] [[Left-wing politics#Economics|left-wing economic]] views.&lt;ref name="Berlet 1990-1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Chip Berlet|Berlet, Chip]] | title = Right Woos Left: Populist Party, LaRouchite, and Other Neo-fascist Overtures To Progressives, And Why They Must Be Rejected | date = 20 December 1990 |quote= revised 4/15/1994, 3 corrections 1999 | url = http://www.publiceye.org/rightwoo/rwooz9_TOC.html |publisher= Political Research Associates| accessdate = 2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1995"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Roger Griffin|Griffin, Roger]] | title = [[Fascism (book)|Fascism]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-19-289249-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coogan 1999"&gt;{{cite book| author = Kevin Coogan | title = Dreamer of the Day: Francis Parker Yockey and the Postwar Fascist International | publisher = Autonomedia | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-57027-039-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee 1999"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Martin A.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
The term "Third Position" was coined in Europe and the main precursors of Third Position politics were [[National Bolshevism]] (a synthesis of far-right ultranationalism and far-left [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] socialism) and [[Strasserism]] (a radical, mass-action, worker-based, socialist form of [[National Socialism]], advocated by the "left-wing" of the [[Nazi Party]] until it was crushed in the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934 ). [[Neo-fascist]], [[Neo-Nazi]] author [[Francis Parker Yockey]] had proposed an alliance between [[Communism|communists]] and fascists called ''Red-Brown Alliance'' (Red being the color of communism and Brown being the color of Nazism) which would have been anti-Semitic, anti-American, and anti-Zionist in nature. Yockey lent support to [[Third World]] liberation movements as well.

==Argentina==
At the peak of the [[Cold War]], the former [[Argentine]] [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Juan Perón]] (1946–1955; 1973–1974) defined the international position of his doctrine ([[Peronism]]) as a Third Position between capitalism and communism, a stance which became a precedent of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} 

{{quote|Until we proclaimed our doctrine, in front of us, capitalist individualism and communist collectivism rose triumphal, the shadow of their imperial wings extending in every path open to mankind… This way, Justicialism was born, under the supreme aspiration of a high ideal. The Justicialism, created by us and for our descendants, as a third ideological position aimed to liberate us from capitalism without making us fall into the oppressing claws of collectivism.| Juan Domingo Peron addressing the Congress in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;http://archivohistorico.educ.ar/sites/default/files/VI_53.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==France==
{{main|Third Way (France)}}
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
During the 1930s and 1940s, a number of splinter groups from the [[Far-left politics|radical left]] became associated with [[radical nationalism]]. [[Jacques Doriot]]'s [[French Popular Party]] (from the [[French Communist Party]]) and [[Marcel Déat]]'s [[National Popular Rally]] (from the [[French Section of the Workers' International]]). Third Position ideology gained some support in [[France]], where in 1985 [[Jean-Gilles Malliarakis]] set up a "Third Way" political party, [[Third Way (France)|Troisième Voie]] (TV). Considering its main enemies to be the [[United States]], [[communism]] and [[Zionism]], the group advocated radical paths to national revolution. Associated for a time with the [[Groupe Union Défense]], TV was generally on poor terms with [[National Front (France)|Front National]] until 1991, when Malliarakis decided to approach them. As a result, TV fell apart and a radical splinter group under [[Christian Bouchet]], [[Nouvelle Résistance]], adopted National Bolshevik and then [[Eurasianism|Eurasianist]] views.

==Italy==
{{main|Terza Posizione}}
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In [[Italy]], the Third Position was developed by [[Roberto Fiore]], along with [[Gabriele Adinolfi]] and [[Giuseppe Dimitri|Peppe Dimitri]], in the tradition of Italian [[neo-fascism]]. Third Position’s ideology is characterized by a [[militarism|militarist]] formulation, a [[palingenetic ultranationalism]] looking favourably to national [[Liberation movement|liberation movements]], support for [[Racism|racial separatism]] and the adherence to a [[Political Soldier|soldier lifestyle]]. In order to construct a cultural background for the ideology, Fiore looked to the [[ruralism]] of [[Julius Evola]] and sought to combine it with the desire for a cultural-spiritual revolution. He adopted some of the positions of the contemporary [[Far-right politics|far-right]], notably the [[ethnopluralism]] of [[Alain de Benoist]] and the [[Europe]]-wide appeal associated with such views as the [[Europe a Nation]] campaign of [[Oswald Mosley]] (amongst others). Fiore was one of the founders of the [[Terza Posizione]] movement in 1978. Third Position ideas are now represented in Italy by [[Forza Nuova]], led by Fiore; and by the movement [[CasaPound]], a network of [[far-right social centres]].

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[Political Research Associates]] argue that Third Position politics has been promoted by some [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] and [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups such as the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], [[American Front]], [[Traditionalist Worker Party]] and [[White Aryan Resistance]] as well as some [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] groups such as the [[Nation of Islam]], since the late 20th century.&lt;ref name="Berlet 1990-1999"/&gt; In 2010, the American Third Position Party (later renamed [[American Freedom Party]]) was founded in part to channel the [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] resentment engendered by the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] and the policies of the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]].&lt;ref name="SPLC 2010"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] | title = Prof Has New Job Running Racist Political Party: Academic Anti-Semitism | date = Spring 2010 | url = http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2010/spring/psych-prof-has-new-job-running-racist | accessdate = 2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11159">A '''three-letter acronym''' ('''TLA'''), or '''three-letter abbreviation''', is an [[abbreviation]], specifically an [[Acronym|acronym, alphabetism, or initialism]], consisting of three letters. These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as ''etc.'' and ''Mrs.'' are not three-letter acronyms, but "TLA" {{em|itself}} is a TLA (an example of an [[Autological word|autological]] abbreviation).

Most three-letter abbreviations are ''initialisms'': all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in ''[[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|p|iː|ˈ|eɪ}} {{respell|AY|pee|AY|'}}. Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; [[computed axial tomography]], CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in "CAT scan".

==History and origins==

The exact phrase ''three-letter acronym'' appeared in the sociology literature in 1975.&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. J. |last=Levy |title=Review of ''The Logic of Social Systems'' |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |year=1975 |jstor=2777655 |doi=10.1086/226119 |page=658 |quote=The acronyms DSE and DNA have something in common: each is a three-letter acronym.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-letter acronyms were used as [[mnemonic]]s in biological sciences, from 1977&lt;ref name=Seavey&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. R. |last=Seavey |first2=P. H. |last2=Raven |year=1977 |title=Chromosomal Differentiation and the Sources of the South American Species of ''Epilobium'' (Onagraceae) |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=57 | doi = 10.2307/3038128 |jstor=3038128 |quote=All taxa indicated by three-letter acronyms with strains indicated by a fourth letter if necessary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. A. |last=Weber |year=1982 |title=Mnemonic Three-Letter Acronyms for the Families of Vascular Plants: A Device for More Effective Herbarium Curation |journal=Taxon |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=74–88 |jstor=1220592 |doi=10.2307/1220592}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. D. |last=Nilsen |first2=A. P. |last2=Nilsen |year=1995 |title=Literary Metaphors and Other Linguistic Innovations in Computer Language |journal=The English Journal |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=65–71 |jstor=820897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair [[ZX81]] home computer used and explained TLA.&lt;ref name=ZX81&gt;[[Steve Vickers (academia)|Steven Vickers]] ''ZX81 Basic Programming'', Sinclair Research Limited, page 161 "As you can see, everything has a three letter abbreviation (TLA)."&lt;/ref&gt; The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a [[JPL]] report of 1982.&lt;ref name=JPL&gt;[http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-70/70R.PDF TDA Progress Report] R. Hull (1982) An Introduction to the new Productivity Information Management System page 176&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, in a paper titled "On the cruelty of really teaching computer science", eminent computer scientist [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] wrote &lt;!-- disparagingly (see quote in context) --&gt;
"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA  ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html On the cruelty of really teaching computer science]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992 it was in a [[Microsoft]] handbook.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Gookin (1992) ''The Microsoft Guide to Optimizing Windows'' page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinatorics==

The number of possible three-letter abbreviations (or [[permutations]]) using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Another 26 × 26 × 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third element is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336.

In [[English language|English]], [[WWW (disambiguation)|WWW]] is the longest possible TLA to [[Pronunciation of "www"|pronounce]], typically requiring nine [[syllable]]s. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is quicker to say the [[acronym]] instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, "www" is sometimes abbreviated as "dubdubdub" in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.brynmawr.edu/features/digispeak-a-glossary-of-the-new-lingo/|title=DigiSpeak: A Glossary of the New Lingo|date=May 2011|website=bryn mawr alumnae bulletin|publisher=Bryn Mawr College Alumnae Association|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Journalism sidebar}}
A '''video news release''' ('''VNR''') is a [[video]] segment made to look like a news report, but is instead created by a [[public relations|PR]] firm, advertising agency, marketing firm, [[corporation]], or [[government agency]]. They are provided to television newsrooms to shape [[public opinion]], promote commercial products and services, [[publicity|publicize]] individuals, or support other interests. [[News producer]]s may air VNRs, in whole or in part, at their discretion or incorporate them into news reports if they contain information appropriate to a story or of interest to viewers.

Critics of VNRs have called the practice deceptive or a [[propaganda]] technique, particularly when the segment is not identified to the viewers as a VNR. Firms producing VNRs disagree and equate their use to a [[press release]] in video form and point to the fact that editorial judgement in the worthiness, part or whole, of a VNR's content is still left in the hands of journalists, program producers or the like. The United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] is currently investigating the practice of VNRs.

==Details==
Most VNRs feature a professional news reporter, someone with on-air news experience, or an [[actor]].  VNRs also often include interviews with experts (who often have legitimate, if biased, expertise); so called "man on the street" interviews with "average" people; and pictures of celebrities, products, service demonstrations, corporate [[logos]] and the like, where applicable.  In some cases the "man on the street" segments feature persons randomly selected and interviewed spontaneously, and in other cases actors are hired and directed by VNR producers to deliver carefully scripted comments. In addition, regardless of whether real people or professional actors appear, VNR [[Film producer|producers]] and [[film director|directors]], just like [[journalist]]s, have complete discretion to excerpt and edit these "interviews" into '[[sound bites]]' that help make the point they are trying to make.

== Media broadcasting ==

Commercial television stations and other media outlets often broadcast only portions of a VNR. Sometimes they use the script provided by the VNR producer but frequently they write their own script.

In a report released on April 6, 2006, the [[Center for Media and Democracy]] listed detailed information on 77 television stations that it said had broadcast VNRs in the prior 10 months, and which VNRs had been broadcast. Most of these VNR uses were of partial feeds.  However, CMD said that in each case the television station actively disguised the VNR content to make it appear to be its own reporting, and that more than one-third of the time, stations aired the pre-packaged VNR in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Farsetta, Diane (March 16, 2006). [http://www.prwatch.org/fakenews/execsummary "Fake TV News: Widespread and Undisclosed"]. ''PRwatch.org'', Center for Media and Democracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business production in the United States==
VNRs have been used extensively in business since at least the early 1980s.  Corporations such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], and the pharmaceutical industry generally, have all made use of the technique.

According to the trade-group [[Public Relations Society of America]], a VNR is the video equivalent of a press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prsa.org/_News/leaders/vnrs0404.asp | title = Statement of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) on Video News Releases (VNRs) |date=April 2004| work=Your Leaders Speak Out| publisher = [[Public Relations Society of America]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040505233456/http://www.prsa.org/_News/leaders/vnrs0404.asp |archivedate=2004-05-05| accessdate = 2011-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and presents a client's case in an attractive, informative format. The VNR placement agency seeks to garner media attention for the client's products, services, brands or other marketing goals. The VNR affords local TV stations free broadcast quality materials for use in reports offered by such stations.

Public Relations agencies have their video tapes encoded allowing very accurate tracking of where such video is used. (see: [[SIGMA (verification service)]] for additional information).

One critic of the VNR technique, John Stauber, an observer and critic of the Public Relations business says, "These fellows are whistling past the graveyard, assuring themselves that this all is no big deal. There was no hint of shame, certainly no apologizing, just apparent disdain for having their business practices dissected on the front page of the New York Times. They are proud of their work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = PR Execs Undeterred by Fake News "Flap" | author = Stauber, John | date = March 16, 2005 | accessdate = 2006-08-17 | url = http://www.prwatch.org/node/3374 | publisher = [[Center for Media and Democracy]] | authorlink = John Stauber }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in March 2005 that "In all, at least 20 federal agencies, including the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] and the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]], have made and distributed hundreds of television news segments in the past four years, records and interviews show. Many were subsequently broadcast on local stations across the country without any acknowledgement of the government's role in their production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Message Machine: How the Government Makes News; Under Bush, a New Age of Prepackaged News | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 2005-03-13 | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50914FC3E580C708DDDAA0894DD404482 |author1=Barstow, David  |author2=Stein, Robin  |lastauthoramp=yes | accessdate = 2006-08-17 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A VNR financed by the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] was aired on a number of local news programs around the country, as conventional journalism when in fact, it was produced to promote the new [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] plan.  The creation of the [[Karen Ryan]] video, named so because of the on-screen "reporter," was ruled in May 2004 to be in violation of federal law by the [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO), the investigative arm of the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.gov/dingell/documents/pdfs/GAO_HHS.pdf GAO decision - Matter of: Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services&amp;mdash;Video News Releases] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207021448/http://www.house.gov/dingell/documents/pdfs/GAO_HHS.pdf |date=December 7, 2006 }} (pdf). File: B-302710. U.S. House of Representatives. May 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
*In September, 2005, the GAO concluded that the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] had violated the law when it distributed a similar video news release using Karen Ryan as a "reporter" touting the [[No Child Left Behind]] program of the Bush administration.  In May 2003 the Department had hired the [[Ketchum Inc.|Ketchum]] public relations firm; the contract specified, among other things, that the firm create "audio products, videos and some print materials that present clear, coherent, targeted messages regarding ED’s programs and that relate to the Department’s legislative initiatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/304228.htm GAO decision B-304228, "Department of Education--No Child Left Behind Act Video News Release and Media Analysis"].

==VNRs and U.S. law==
* In January 1948, the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, also known as the [[Smith-Mundt Act]], was passed by Congress and signed into law by U.S. President [[Harry Truman]], placing international overseas information activities, including VOA, under an Office of International Information at the [[Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About VOA - VOA History - Historical Highlights | url = http://www.voanews.com/english/About/historical-highlights.cfm | work = [[Voice of America]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041104034516/http://voanews.com/english/About/historical-highlights.cfm |archivedate=2004-11-04| accessdate = 2011-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In February 2005, the "Stop Government Propaganda Act" was introduced in the U.S. Senate.  It was referred to the Judiciary Committee and no further action occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.+266: "S.266 -- Stop Government Propaganda Act (Introduced in Senate - IS)"]. Thomas.loc.gov. February 2, 2005. Retrieved 2011-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In April 2005, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] warned television stations that they could be fined for airing news stories provided by the government and by companies without disclosing who made them.&lt;ref name="Roland"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aIeR2Prf88nE&amp;refer=us | title = FCC's Martin Orders Probe of TV Stations That Air Ads as News | date = 2006-05-26 | first = Neil | last = Roland | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.]] | accessdate = 2006-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In May 2006, FCC chairman [[Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin]] ordered a review of airing of VNRs by television stations, following the April 2006 report by the [[Center for Media and Democracy]].&lt;ref name="Roland"/&gt;
*In August 2006, the FCC mailed letters to the owners of 77 television stations, asking for information regarding agreements between the stations and the creators of VNRs.  The letters also asked whether there was any "[[consideration]]" given to the stations in return for airing the material. Stations were given 60 days to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = TV Stations' 'Fake News' Scrutinized | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/16/national/main1900602.shtml | agency = [[Associated Press]] | publisher=CBS News |date = August 16, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Witches of Anaga''' were (according to popular belief) women who were devoted to [[covens]] in the mountainous area of [[Macizo de Anaga|Anaga]] in the northeast of the island of [[Tenerife]] ([[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]]).

These rituals were held in an area in the mountains of Anaga in the dorsal between [[San Andrés, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|San Andrés]] and [[Taganana]].&lt;ref name="bienmesabe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bienmesabe.org/noticia.php?id=4580 |title=Los bailaderos |publisher=Bienmesabe.org |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area is called ''"El Bailadero"'', which refers to the dances performed by witches around a bonfire.&lt;ref name="bienmesabe1"/&gt; It was believed that after the covens, witches came down to the coast to swim naked. With the passage of time, due to the influence of vampire stories in [[Eastern Europe]], this led to the myth that witches incorporated the aspect of drinking [[blood]], thus making them [[witch]]-[[vampire]], typically tales were created that these witches sucked the blood of newborns as they slept in their cribs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lanzarotelandia.com/noticiasyavisos/mujeres-y-otros-demonios-brujeria-e-inquisicion-en-canarias-2/ |title=Mujeres y otros demonios: Brujería e Inquisición en Canarias |publisher=Lanzarotelandia |date= |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also a theory that the origin of this legend, was from pagan rituals associated with rituals that celebrated [[guanches]] rain, these rituals were considered as an act of [[witchcraft]] by the [[Catholic Church]].
