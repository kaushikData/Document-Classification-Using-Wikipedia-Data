'''Aghadoe Cathedral''' was a church that may have been the seat of a bishop at [[Aghadoe]], [[Ireland]] (later joined with the [[Bishop of Ardfert and Aghadoe|Bishopric of Ardfert]]).  The now ruined [[cathedral]] overlooks the [[Lakes of Killarney]] from [[Aghadoe]], a few miles from [[Killarney]]. Aghadoe may have been the site of a church as early as the seventh century, but extant remains are of a stone structure built in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

==History==
Aghadoe, ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Achadh Deo'' "place with two yews"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-ireland.com/attractions/munster/kerry/aghadoe.htm |accessdate=June 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |title=All Ireland Travel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707112521/http://www.all-ireland.com/attractions/munster/kerry/aghadoe.htm |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) may have begun as a pagan religious site.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Tom. "Tracing Our Faith." ''Fossa &amp; Aghadoe: Our Heritage and History''. ed. Jim Larner. Fossa Historical Society. 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9557739-0-7}}. p 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The site has also been associated with the fifth century missionary [[St. Abban]], but seventh century [[ogham]] stones mark the first clear evidence of Aghadoe being used as an important site.&lt;ref name="Long1"&gt;Long, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to legend, [[St. Finian Lobhar|St. Finian]] founded a monastery at Aghadoe in the sixth or seventh century.  The first written record of a monastery dates from 939 AD in the [[Annals of Innisfallen]] where the Aghadoe monastery is referred to as the "Old Abbey."&lt;ref name="Long1"/&gt; The monastery at Aghadoe had a close relationship with the one on nearby [[Innisfallen Island]]. [[Maelsuthain O'Carroll]], one of Innisfallen's greatest scholars, was buried at Aghadoe after his death in 1010 AD, and a legend suggests that the two monasteries were connected by a causeway across [[Loch Lein]].&lt;ref name="Long1"/&gt; In 1027 the Annals make the first reference to a stone building on the site, noting the construction of Damh Liag Maenig (Maenach’s house of stone).  Construction on the [[Irish round tower|round tower]] began the same year.&lt;ref name="Long1"/&gt;  Aghadoe witnessed the turbulence of the times. In 1061, an O'Cathail, the heir to the local dynasty of [[Eóganacht Locha Léin]], was taken from the church and murdered.&lt;ref name="Long2"&gt;Long, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the middle of the twelfth century Amhlaoibh Mór Ó Donoghue, the leader of the Ó Donoghue—the new rulers of Eóganacht Locha Léin, had a new church building, later called the "Great Church," constructed in the [[romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] and dedicated to the [[Holy Trinity]].  The new structure, completed in 1158, incorporated part of the old stone building in its northwest section and makes up the western section of the extant remains.&lt;ref name="Long2"/&gt; When Amhlaoibh Mór Ó Donoghue was killed, his body was carried to Aghadoe and interred in the church.&lt;ref name="Long3"&gt;Long, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The final addition to the church was constructed in the twelfth century.  The addition served as a [[chancel]] or [[choir]], and was later separated from the rest of the church by a wall.&lt;ref name="Long3"/&gt;

After being incorporated into the Bishopric of Ardfert, Aghadoe operated as a parish church under an [[archdeacon]].  The church is mentioned in a 1615 report, but it is excluded from a list of abbeys in the report suggesting it had become only an archdeaconry.  The town of Aghadoe was sacked in the 1650s by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] forces.  By 1740, Aghadoe is no longer listed as an active parish and seems to have ceased functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artifacts==
Two [[Ogham|ogham stones]] have been found at Aghadoe.  One is currently cemented in the south wall of the chancel and bears an inscription transcribed as "BRRUANANN" The inscription may have actually been intended as "BRREANANN," a possible reference to [[St. Brendan]].&lt;ref name="Long6"&gt;Long, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A second ogham stone has since gone missing, but its inscription was transcribed as "GGVVSS MN."&lt;ref name="Long6"/&gt;  The presence of these ogham stones suggests the site's importance dates back to the mid-seventh century.&lt;ref name="Long6"/&gt;  Another early Christian artifact, a [[bullaun]], can be found outside of church by the northwest corner of the nave.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cathedrals of the [[Church of Ireland]]" [[John Godfrey FitzMaurice Day|Day, J.G.F./]] [[Henry Edmund Patton|Patton, H.E.]] p159: [[London]], [[SPCK|S.P.C.K.]], [[1932]]&lt;/ref&gt;   The bullaun may have been originally been used as a [[quern-stone]], but it was later used as a holy water receptacle and rainwater collected in the hollow of the stone had healing properties according to lore.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aghadoe Cathedral western doorway romanesque April 2010.jpg|thumb|Western dooryway of the cathedral with Romanesque carvings]]
The "Aghadoe Crosier" from Aghadoe was made of walrus ivory and carved in the [[Urnes style]] of the Vikings.  The carvings are similar to those on the [[jambs]] of Romanesque doorway to the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sawyer | first = Peter | title = The Age of the Vikings and before / Peter Sawyer | publisher = Oxford : Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-19-285434-6 }} p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another crosier, possibly associated with Aghadoe,&lt;!-- Source refers to it as the "Aghadoe Crozier," but its clearly different from the current one. Probably what is now known as the Innisfallen Crozier.  --&gt; was found in the lakes in 1867 by a fisherman who thought it was a salmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Donoghue |first=Denis |title=The Aghadoe Crozier |journal=Journal of the Cork Historical and Archæological Society |publisher=Cork Historical and Archæological Society |volume=5 Second series |year=1899 |location=Cork, Ireland |pages=235–243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wg97AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=aghadoe+crozier&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rqEeKx_kBg&amp;sig=u6Z5VxIAlThxo2DaJyPoDxwkaf0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cxxVTJWVHYL68Aa-vYD_BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aghadoe%20crozier&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Annals of Innisfallen'', Aghadoe Cathedral's [[high cross]] toppled in a strong wind in 1282.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sheehan | first = John | title = Early Medieval Munster | publisher = Cork University Press | location = Cork | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-1-85918-107-2 }} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sculpture carving fragment aghadoe.jpg|thumb|Seventeenth century carving of the crucifixion]] 
A carved stone fragment found on the site is thought to date from the seventeenth century.  It depicts the crucifixion with a female figure passing a chalice to Christ on the cross.   The stone suggests Aghadoe was still used as a religious site during the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Long, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society''' ('''AIFACS''') is an independent arts organisation in [[India]], founded in [[Delhi]] in 1928. In the decade after Indian independence, many of its functions were transferred to three national academies: [[Lalit Kala Akademi]], [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] and [[Sahitya Akademi]] for the fields of visual arts, theatre arts and literature. 

AIFACS organises art exhibitions and makes awards to artists across the country. Among the most prominent artists exhibited in the 1940s were [[Amrita Sher-Gil]], [[Sailoz Mookherjea]] and [[Manishi Dey]]. Many other followed in the long history of the AIFACS.

Its most prestigious awards include the Kala Shree, Kala Vibhushan and Kala Ratna, inaugurated in 1988. Twelve awards are given in each of these grades every three years. The highest award is the Kala Samrat.

The Society also published a newsletter several times a year, and older editions are posted on the society's website since 2010.

'''Anne Dudley''' (born 7 May 1956) is an English composer, keyboardist, conductor and pop musician. She was the first [[BBC Concert Orchestra]]'s Composer in Association in 2001.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/concertorchestra/about_us/annedudley.shtml|title=Anne Dudley|publisher=BBC Concert Orchestra|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has worked in both the [[European classical music|classical]] and pop genres, but she is perhaps best known as one of the core members of the [[synthpop]] band [[Art of Noise]] and as a film composer. In 1998 Dudley won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] for ''[[The Full Monty]]''. In addition to over twenty other film scores, in 2012 she served as music producer for the film version of ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Career==
Dudley was born Anne Jennifer Beckingham, in [[Beckenham, Kent]]. Trained as a classical performer, she moved into the competitive commercial field as a [[session musician]], where her professional relationship with [[Trevor Horn]] began. In 1982 Dudley made significant contributions to the Horn-produced ''[[The Lexicon of Love]]'' album by [[ABC (band)|ABC]]. She went from fleshing-out keyboard parts to scoring the album's orchestrations (which were, according to Horn, her first-ever string arrangements)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/people/trevor-horn|title=Trevor Horn|publisher=Red Bull Music Academy Lecture, Madrid 2011|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[songwriter|co-writing]] some of the [[songs]]. Her association with Horn led on to working with artists such as [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Marc Almond]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Robbie Williams]] and, more recently, [[Siphiwo Ntshebe|Siphiwo]]. She has co-written songs with [[Malcolm McLaren]] ("[[Buffalo Gals (Malcolm McLaren song)|Buffalo Gals]]"), [[Cathy Dennis]] ("[[Too Many Walls]]"), and a 1930s-inspired song with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] called "This Was Never Meant To Be".

She produced the [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] hit "[[You Can Leave Your Hat On]]" (1988) and a [[Debbie Harry]] single "[[Strike Me Pink]]" (1993). Dudley produced two tracks on the 2002 [[Opera Babes]] album ''Beyond Imagination'' (ranking No.1 on the UK classical charts for 11 weeks, and No.4 on the US billboard charts). In 2004 she produced the album ''[[Voice (Alison Moyet album)|Voice]]'' for [[Alison Moyet]]. The album, an eclectic collection of cover versions, reached No.7 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].

Dudley was a founding member of the successful band [[Art of Noise]], which helped pioneer the use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] within the pop genre. Their stand-out hits include "[[Beat Box (song)|Beat Box]]" (1984), "[[Moments in Love]]" (1985), "[[Close (to the Edit)]]" (1984) and, with Tom Jones, "[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]" (1988).

Her works for orchestra include "Northern Lights", a 14-minute reflection of Norway's [[Aurora Borealis]] for full orchestra, performed in 2005 and 2006 at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]]'s ''[[Late Junction]]'' programme in May 2005. Her first commission as Composer in Association with the BBC Concert Orchestra was "Music and Silence", inspired by the novel of the same name by [[Rose Tremain]] and first performed at The Royal Festival Hall in 2002. Dudley arranged Bach's [[Partita for Violin No. 2 (Bach)|Chaconne from Partita in D minor]] for [[piano trio]], and a recording by the [[Eroica Trio]] appears on their ''Baroque'' album. Her album ''Ancient and Modern'', with modern versions of some traditional [[hymns]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] [[chorales]], was released in 1999. She was the musical director for ''[[Bill Bailey]]'s Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra'', first performed in Brighton then at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 2008, which was recorded and released as a DVD in December 2009. The show was toured in 2009 with eight different regional orchestras participating. It involved the orchestra playing the [[Nokia tune|Nokia theme tune]] and a [[french horn]] concerto evolving into the theme from ''[[Coronation Street]]''.

Dudley collaborated with [[Sam Taylor-Wood]] in producing the sound and video installation ''Sigh'' at the [[White Cube]] in 2008. This work featured the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] on eight large projected screens, miming to Dudley's score.

{{Arab culture}}
'''Arab culture''' is the culture of the [[Arabs]], from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Arabian Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. [[Language]], [[literature]], [[gastronomy]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[music]], [[spirituality]], [[philosophy]], [[mysticism]] (etc.) are all part of the cultural heritage of the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40043536|title=Beauty in Arabic culture|last=Doris.|first=Behrens-Abouseif,|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|isbn=1558761993|oclc=40043536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab world is sometimes divided into separate regions including [[Greater Maghreb|Al-Maghrib Al-Arabi]] (consisting of Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania), [[Fertile Crescent]] (consisting of Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Jordan) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (consisting of south Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Al Ahwaz Al Arabiya,  Oman and the UAE) and the Arabian Peninsula's Al-Janoub Al-Arabi (consisting of Yemen and Oman).

==Literature==
{{main article|Arabic literature}}
[[Arabic literature]] is the writing produced, both [[prose]] and [[poetry]], by speakers of the [[Arabic language]]. It does not include works written using the [[Arabic alphabet]] but not in the Arabic language such as [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Urdu literature]]. The Arabic word used for literature is ''[[Adab (literature)|adab]]'' which is derived from a word meaning "to invite someone for a meal" and implies politeness, culture and enrichment. Arabic literature emerged in the 6th century, with only fragments of the written language appearing before then. The [[Qur'an]], from the 7th century, had the greatest and longest-lasting effect on Arabic culture and literature. [[Al-Khansa]], a female contemporary of Muhammad, was an acclaimed Arab poet.

[[File:Antarah ibn Shaddad &amp; Abla.jpg|thumb|[[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antara and Abla]], the Arab [[Romeo and Juliet]]]]

===Mu'allaqat===
{{Main article| Muallaqat}}
The [[Mu'allaqat]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المعلقات, {{IPA-ar|al-muʕallaqaːt|}}) is the name given to a series of seven Arabic poems or [[qasida]] that originated before the time of Islam. Each poem in the set has a different author, and is considered to be their best work. Mu'allaqat means "The Suspended Odes" or "The Hanging Poems," and comes from the poems being hung on the wall in the Kaaba at Mecca.

The seven authors, who span a period of around 100 years, are [[Imru' al-Qais]], [[Tarafa]], [[Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma|Zuhayr]], [[Labīd]], [['Antara Ibn Shaddad]], [['Amr ibn Kulthum]], and [[Harith ibn Hilliza]]. All of the Mu’allaqats contain stories from the authors’ lives and tribe politics. This is because poetry was used in pre-Islamic time to advertise the strength of a tribe’s king, wealth and people.

The ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' ({{lang-ar|أَلْف لَيْلَة وَلَيْلَة}} ''ʾAlf layla wa-layla''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Arabian Nights|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_0021|edition=3rd|quote=Arabian Nights, the work known in Arabic as ''Alf layla wa-layla''|author=Marzolph, Ulrich|editors=Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a medieval folk tale collection which tells the story of Scheherazade, a Sassanid queen who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King Shahryar (Šahryār), to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day. The individual stories were created over several centuries, by many people from a number of different lands.

During the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 8th century, Baghdad had become an important cosmopolitan city. Merchants from Persia, China, India, Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time, many of the stories that were originally folk stories are thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and ninth-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar. The frame story of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.

==Music==
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 730 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fresco]] from [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbî]], [[Syria]], [[Ummayad]] [[caliphs]] Palace, built in the early 7th century]]
[[Arabic music]] is the [[music]] of [[Arabs|Arab people]], especially those centered around the Arabian Peninsula. The world of Arab music has long been dominated by [[Cairo]], a cultural center, though musical innovation and regional styles abound from [[Tunisia]] to [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Beirut]] has, in recent years, also become a major center of Arabic music. [[Classical Arab music]] is extremely popular across the population, especially a small number of superstars known throughout the Arab world. Regional styles of [[popular music]] include Iraqian el Maqaam, [[Algeria]]n ''[[raï]]'', [[Kuwait]]i ''[[sawt (music)|sawt]]'' and [[Egypt]]ian ''[[el gil]]''.

"The common style that developed is usually called 'Islamic' or 'Arab', though in fact it transcends religious, ethnic, geographical, and linguistic boundaries" and it is suggested that it be called the [[Near East]] (from Morocco to India) style ([[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]] 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;9).

[[Habib Hassan Touma]] (1996, p.xix-xx) lists "five components" which "characterize the music of the Arabs:
# The [[Arab tone system]] (a [[musical tuning]] system) with specific interval structures, invented by [[al-Farabi]] in the 10th century (p.&amp;nbsp;170).
# [[Rhythmic-temporal structures]] that produce a rich variety of [[rhythm]]ic patterns, ''[[Rhythm in Arabian music|awzan]]'', used to accompany the metered vocal and instrumental genres and give them form.
# [[Musical instrument]]s that are found throughout the Arabian world and that represent a standardized [[tone system]], are played with standardized performance techniques, and exhibit similar details in construction and design.
# Specific social contexts for the making of music, whereby [[Music genre|musical genres]] can be classified as urban (music of the city inhabitants), rural (music of the country inhabitants), or [[Bedouin]] (music of the desert inhabitants).
# A musical mentality that is responsible for the aesthetic homogeneity of the tonal-spatial and rhythmic-temporal structures in Arabian music, whether [[musical composition|composed]] or [[improvise]]d, [[instrumental]] or [[vocal]], [[secular]] or [[sacred]]. The Arab's musical mentality is defined by:
## The maqām phenomenon.
## The predominance of vocal music.
## The predilection for small instrumental ensembles.
## The mosaiclike stringing together of musical form elements, that is, the arrangement in a sequence of small and smallest melodic elements, and their repetition, combination, and permutation within the framework of the tonal-spatial model.
## The absence of polyphony, polyrhythm, and motivic development. Arabian music is, however, very familiar with the ostinato, as well as with a more instinctive heterophonic way of making music.
## The alternation between a free rhythmic-temporal and fixed tonal-spatial organization on the one hand and a fixed rhythmic-temporal and free tonal-spatial structure on the other. This alternation... results in exciting contrasts."

Much Arab music is characterized by an emphasis on [[melody]] and [[rhythm]] rather than [[harmony]]. Thus much Arabic music is [[homophony|homophonic]] in nature. Some genres of Arab music are [[polyphonic]]—as the instrument [[Kanun (instrument)|Kanoun]] is based upon the idea of playing two-note [[chord (music)|chords]]—but quintessentially, Arabic music is melodic.

It would be incorrect though to call it [[Musical mode|modal]], for the Arabic system is more complex than that of the [[Greece|Greek]] modes. The basis of the Arabic music is the [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] (pl. maqamat), which looks like the mode, but is not quite the same. The maqam has a "[[tonality|tonal]]" note on which the piece must end (unless modulation occurs).

[[File:Riqq.jpg|thumb|left|The [[riq]] is widely used in Arabic music]]

The maqam consists of at least two jins, or scale segments. "Jins" in Arabic comes from the ancient Greek word "genus," meaning type. In practice, a jins (pl. ajnas) is either a [[trichord]], a [[tetrachord]], or a [[pentachord]]. The trichord is three notes, the tetrachord four, and the pentachord five. The maqam usually covers only one [[octave]] (two jins), but sometimes it covers more than one octave. Like the [[Minor scale|melodic minor]] scale and Indian ragas, some maqamat have different ajnas, and thus notes, while descending or ascending. Because of the continuous innovation of jins and because most music scholars don't agree on the existing number anyway, it's hard to give an accurate number of the jins. Nonetheless, in practice most musicians would agree on the 8 most frequently used ajnas: Rast, Bayat, Sikah, Hijaz, Saba, Kurd, Nahawand, and Ajam — and a few of the most commonly used variants of those: Nakriz, Athar Kurd, Sikah Beladi, Saba Zamzama. Mukhalif is a rare jins used exclusively in Iraq, and it does not occur in combination with other ajnas.

The main difference between the western [[chromatic scale]] and the Arabic scales is the existence of many in-between notes, which are sometimes referred to as [[quarter tone]]s for the sake of practicality. However, while in some treatments of theory the quarter tone scale or all twenty four tones should exist, according to [[Yusuf Shawqi|Yūsuf Shawqī]] (1969) in practice there are many fewer tones (Touma 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;170).

In fact, the situation is much more complicated than that. In 1932, at International Convention on Arabic music held in Cairo, Egypt (attended by such Western luminaries as [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Henry George Farmer]]), experiments were done which determined conclusively that the notes in actual use differ substantially from an even-tempered 24-tone scale, and furthermore that the intonation of many of those notes differ slightly from region to region (Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iraq). The commission's recommendation is as follows: "The tempered scale and the natural scale should be rejected. In Egypt, the Egyptian scale is to be kept with the values, which were measured with all possible precision. The Turkish, Syrian, and Iraqi scales should remain what they are..." (translated in Maalouf 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;220). Both in modern practice, and based on the evidence from recorded music over the course of the last century, there are several differently tuned "E"s in between the E-flat and E-natural of the Western Chromatic scale, depending on the maqam or jins in use, and depending on the region.

Musicians and teachers refer to these in-between notes as "quarter-tones" ("half-flat" or "half-sharp") for ease of nomenclature, but perform and teach the exact values of intonation in each jins or maqam by ear. It should also be added, in reference to Touma's comment above, that these "quarter-tones" are not used everywhere in the maqamat: in practice, Arabic music does not modulate to 12 different tonic areas like the [[Well-Tempered Klavier]], and so the most commonly used "quarter tones" are on E (between E-flat and E-natural), A, B, D, F (between F-natural and F-sharp) and C.

The prototypical Arab ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the [[Takht (music)|takht]], which includes, (or included at different time periods) instruments such as the [['oud]], [[qanun (instrument)|qanún]], [[rabab]], nay, [[violin]] (which was introduced in the 1840s or 50s), [[riq]] and [[goblet drum|dumbek]]. In Iraq, the traditional ensemble, known as the chalghi, includes only two melodic instruments—the jowza (similar to the rabab but with four strings) and [[Santoor (Persian instrument)|santur]]—with [[riq]] and [[dumbek]].

Prior to the Islamic Era, [[poetry]] was regarded as the main means of communication on the [[Arabian Peninsula]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It related the achievements of tribes and defeats of enemies and also served as a tool for [[propaganda]]. After the arrival of [[Islam]] other forms of communication replaced poetry as the primary form of communication. [[Imams]] (preachers) played a role in disseminating information and relating news from the authorities to the people. The suq or marketplace gossip and interpersonal relationships played an important role in the spreading of news, and this form of communication among [[Arabs]] continues today. Before the introduction of the [[printing press]] [[Muslims]] obtained most of their news from the imams at the [[mosque]], friends or in the marketplace. [[Colonial powers]] and [[Christian Missionaries]] in [[Lebanon]] were responsible for the introduction of the printing press. It was not until the 19th century that the first newspapers began to appear, mainly in [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]], which had the most newspapers per capita.

During [[France|French]] rule in [[Egypt]] in the time of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] the first newspaper was published, in French. There is debate over when the first Arabic language newspaper was published; according to Arab scholar Abu Bakr, it was ''Al Tanbeeh'' (1800), published in Egypt, or it was ''Junral Al Iraq'' (1816), published in [[Iraq]], according to other researchers. In the mid-19th century the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]] dominated the first newspapers. In the [[Northern Africa]]n countries of [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]] the French colonial power built a press link between mainland countries.

The first newspapers were limited to official content and included accounts of relations with other countries and civil trials. In the following decades Arab media blossomed due to [[journalist]]s mainly from Syria and Lebanon, who were intellectuals and published their newspapers without the intention of making a profit. Because of the restrictions by most governments, these intellectuals were forced to flee their respective countries but had gained a following and because of their popularity in this field of work other intellectuals began to take interest in the field.
The first émigré Arab newspaper, ''Mar’at al Ahwal'', was published in Turkey in 1855 by Rizqallah Hassoun Al Halabi. It was criticized by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and shut down after only one year. Intellectuals in the [[Arab world]] soon realized the power of the press. Some countries' newspapers were government-run and had political agendas in mind. Independent newspapers began to spring up which expressed opinions and were a place for the public to out their views on the state. Illiteracy rates in the Arab world played a role in the formation of media, and due to the low reader rates newspapers were forced to get political parties to subsidize their publications, giving them input to editorial policy.

Freedoms that have branched through the introduction of the Internet in [[Middle East]] are creating a stir politically, culturally, and socially. There is an increasing divide between the generations. The Arab world is in conflict internally. The internet has brought economic prosperity and development, but [[blog]]gers have been incarcerated all around in the Middle East for their opinions and views on their regimes, the same consequence which was once given to those who publicly expressed themselves without anonymity. But the power of the internet has provided also a public shield for these bloggers since they have the ability to engage public sympathy on such a large scale. This is creating a dilemma that shakes the foundation of Arab culture, government, religious interpretation, economic prosperity, and personal integrity.

Each country or region in the Arab world has varying colloquial languages which are used for everyday speech, yet its presence in the media world is discouraged. Prior to the establishment of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), during the 19th century, the language of the media was stylized and resembled literary language of the time, proving to be ineffective in relaying information. Currently MSA is used by Arab media, including newspapers, books and some television stations, in addition to all formal writing. Vernaculars are however present in certain forms of media including satires, dramas, music videos and other local programs.

=== Media values ===

Journalism ethics is a system of values that determines what constitutes "good" and "bad" journalism.&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hafez|first=Kai|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=147–64|authorlink=The Unknown Desire for "Objectivity": Journalism Ethics in Arab (and Western) Journalism|editor=Kai Hafez}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A system of media values consists of and is constructed by journalists'  and other actors'  decisions about issues like what is "newsworthy," how to frame the news, and whether to observe topical "red lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Itule|first=Bruce|title=News Writing and Reporting for Today's Media|date=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|author2=Douglas Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a system of values varies over space and time, and is embedded within the existing social, political, and economic structures in a society. William Rugh states, "There is an intimate, organic relationship between media institutions and society in the way that those institutions are organized and controlled. Neither the institution nor the society in which it functions can be understood properly without reference to the other. This is certainly true in the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Media values in the Arab world therefore vary between and within countries. In the words of Lawrence Pintak and Jeremy Ginges, “The Arab media are not a monolith.”&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=The Mission of Arab Journalism: Creating Change in a Time of Turmoil|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=2008|volume=13|issue=3|page=219|doi=10.1177/1940161208317142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists in the Arab world hold many of the same values with their news generation as do journalists in the [[Western world]]. Journalists in the Arab world often aspire to Western norms of objectivity, impartiality, and balance. Kuldip Roy Rampal's study of journalist training programs in North Africa leads him to the conclusion that, "the most compelling dilemma faced by professional journalists, increasingly graduates of journalism degree programs, in the four Maghreb states is how to reconcile their preference for press freedom and objectivity with constraints imposed by political and legal factors that point to a pro-government journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rampal|first=Kuldip Roy|title=Professionals in Search of Professionalism: Journalists' Dilemma in Four Maghreb States|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=1996|volume=58|issue=1|pages=25–43|doi=10.1177/001654929605800102}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Iyotika Ramaprasad and Naila Nabil Hamdy state, “A new trend toward objectivity and impartiality as a value in Arab journalism seems to be emerging, and the values of Arab and Western journalism in this field have started to converge.”&lt;ref name="Function"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramaprasad|first=Jyotika|author2=Naila Nabil Hamdy|title=Functions of Egyptian Journalists: Perceived Importance and Actual Importance|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=2006|volume=68|issue=2|pages=167–85|doi=10.1177/1748048506062233}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Further, many journalists in the Arab world express their desires for the media to become a fourth estate akin to the media in the West. In a survey of 601 journalists in the Arab world, 40% of them viewed investigation of the government as part of their job.&lt;ref name=Mission /&gt;

Important differences between journalists in the Arab world and their Western counterparts are also apparent.  Some journalists in the Arab world see no conflict between objectivity and support for political causes.&lt;ref name="Inside Arab Newsroom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=Inside the Arab Newsroom|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2009|volume=10|issue=2|page=173|doi=10.1080/14616700802337800}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ramprasad and Hamdy’s sample of 112 Egyptian journalists gave the highest importance to supporting [[Pan-Arabism|Arabism]] and Arab values, which included injunctions such as “defend Islamic societies, traditions and values” and “support the cause of the Palestinians.” Sustaining democracy through “examining government policies and decisions critically,” ranked a close second.&lt;ref name=Function /&gt;  This view is further endorsed in Kirat’s survey where 65 percent of Algerian journalists agreed that the task for the press is to "help achieve the goals and objectives of development plans.&lt;ref&gt;Kirat, Mohamed. "The Algerian News People: A Study of Their Backgrounds, Professional Orientations and Working Conditions". Diss. Indiana University, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such an approach to media fits within the larger scope of  [[development communication]] and journalism. The extent to which professional and political aims conflict is a subject of study for scholars of the Arab world's media.

Other journalists reject the notion of media ethics altogether because they see it as a mechanism of control. Kai Hafez states, “Many governments in the Arab world have tried to hijack the issue of media ethics and have used it as yet another controlling device, with the result that many Arab journalists, while they love to speak about the challenges of their profession, hate performing under the label of media ethics.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt;

Historically, news in the Arab world was used to inform, guide, and publicize the actions of political practitioners rather than being just a consumer product. The power of news as political tool was discovered in the early 19th century, with the purchase of shares from Le Temps a French newspaper by Ismail the grandson of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. Doing so allowed Ismail to publicize his policies.&lt;ref name=Ayalon&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayalon|first=Ami|title=The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History|date=1995|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab Media coming to modernity flourished and with it its responsibilities to the political figures that have governed its role. Ami Ayalon argues in his history of the press in the Arab Middle East that, “Private journalism began as an enterprise with very modest objectives, seeking not to defy authority but rather to serve it, to collaborate and coexist cordially with it. The demand for freedom of expression, as well as for individual political freedom, a true challenge to the existing order, came only later, and hesitantly at that, and was met by a public response that can best be described as faint." &lt;ref name=Ayalon /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Media researchers stress that the moral and social responsibility of newspeople dictates that they should not agitate public opinion, but rather should keep the status quo. It is also important to preserve national unity by not stirring up ethnic or religious conflict.&lt;ref name="Mellor, Noha 2005"&gt;Mellor, Noha. The Making of Arab News. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The values of media in the Arab world have started to change with the emergence of “new media." Examples of new media include news websites, blogs, and satellite television stations like [[Al Arabiya]]. The founding of the Qatari [[Al Jazeera]] network in 1996 especially affected media values. Some scholars believe that the network has blurred the line between private- and state- run news. Mohamed Zayani and Sofiane Sabraoui state, “Al Jazeera is owned by the government, but has an independent editorial policy; it is publicly funded, but independent minded.”&lt;ref name="Culture of Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zayani|first=Mohamed|title=The Culture of Al Jazeera: Inside an Arab Media Giant|date=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, NC|author2=Sofiane Sahroui}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Al Jazeera media network espouses a clear mission and strategy, and was one of the first news organizations in the Arab world to release a code of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;"Code of Ethics." Al Jazeera English. Al Jazeera Media Network, 07 Nov. 2010. Web. 02 Mar. 2014. http://www.aljazeera.com/aboutus/2006/11/2008525185733692771.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its government ties, it seeks to “give no priority to commercial or political over professional consideration” and to “cooperate with Arab and international journalistic unions and associations to defend freedom of the press.” With a motto of “the view and the other view,” it purports to “present the diverse points of view and opinions without bias and partiality.” It has sought to fuse these ostensibly Western media norms with a wider “Arab orientation,” evocative of the social responsibility discussed by scholars such as Noha Mellor above.

Some more recent assessments of Al Jazeera have [[Al Jazeera controversies and criticism|criticized]] it for a lack of credibility in the wake of the Arab Spring. Criticism has come from within the Arab Middle East, including from state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunham|first=Jillian|title=Syrian TV Station Accuses Al Jazeera of Fabricating Uprising|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/syrian-tv-station-accuses-al-jazeera-of-fabricating-uprising/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent commentators have criticized its neutrality vis-a-vis the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Peter|title=In Syria, al Jazeera’s Credibility Implodes|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/05/in-syria-al-jazeeras-credibility-implodes/|publisher=CounterPunch|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media values are not the only variable that affects news output in Arab society. Hafez states, “The interaction of political, economic, and social environments with individual and collective professional ethics is the driving force behind journalism.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt; In most Arab countries, newspapers cannot be published without a government-issued license. Most Arab countries also have press laws, which impose boundaries on what can and cannot be said in print.

Censorship plays a significant role in journalism in the Arab world. Censorship comes in a variety of forms: [[Self-censorship]], Government [[Censorship]] (governments struggle to control through technological advances in ex. the internet), [[Ideology]]/Religious Censorship, and Tribal/Family/Alliances Censorship. Because [[Journalism]] in the Arab world comes with a range of dangers – journalists throughout the Arab world can be imprisoned, tortured, and even killed in their line of work – self-censorship is extremely important for many Arab journalists. A study conducted by the Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) in Jordan, for example, found that the majority of Jordanian journalists exercise self-censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hazaimeh |first=Hani |title=Majority of Jordanian Journalists Exercise Self-censorship - Survey |url=http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |publisher=The Jordan Times |accessdate=22 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708083856/http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |archivedate=8 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Committee to Protect Journalists|CPJ]] found that 34 journalists were killed in the region in 2012, 72 were imprisoned on December 1, 2012, and 126 were in exile from 2007 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attacks on the Press: Journalism on the Front Lines in 2012|url=http://cpj.org/2013/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2012-mideast.php|publisher=Committee for the Protection of Journalists|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related point is that media owners and patrons have effects on the values of their outlets. Newspapers in the Arab world can be divided into three categories: government owned, [[partisan (military)|partisan]] owned, and independently owned. Newspaper, radio, and television patronization in the Arab world has heretofore been primarily a function of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   "Now, newspaper ownership has been consolidated in the hands of powerful chains and groups. Yet, [[profit (economics)|profit]] is not the driving force behind the launching of newspapers; [[publishers]] may establish a newspaper to ensure a platform for their political opinions, although it is claimed that this doesn’t necessarily influence the news content".&lt;ref&gt;Pintak, Lawrence. "Arab Media: Not Quite Utopia"&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arab world, as far as content is concerned, news is politics. Arab states are intimately involved in the economic well-being of many Arab news organizations so they apply pressure in several ways, most notably through ownership or advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Justin D. |url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/102479/Investigative-Journalism-in-the-Arab-World.aspx |title=Nieman Reports &amp;#124; Investigative Journalism in the Arab World |publisher=Nieman.harvard.edu |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts hold that cultural and societal pressures determine journalists' news output in the Arab world. For example, to the extent that family reputation and personal reputation are fundamental principles in Arab civilization, exposes of corruption, examples of weak moral fiber in governors and policy makers, and [[investigative journalism]] may have massive consequences. In fact, some journalists and media trainers in the Arab world nevertheless actively promote the centrality of investigative journalism to the media’s larger [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] function. In Jordan, for example, where the degree of government and security service interference in the media is high, non-governmental organizations such as the Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) and Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) train journalists to undertake investigative journalism projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pies|first=Judith|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|date=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=165–81|chapter=Agents of Change? Journalism Ethics in Lebanese and Jordanian Journalism Education.|editor=Kai Hafez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jordan Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists sign.JPG|thumb|The Jordanian Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) posted this sign in protest of the country's 2012 Press and Publications law. It reads, "The right to obtain information is a right for all people".]]

Some Saudi journalists stress the importance of enhancing Islam through the media. The developmental role of media was acknowledged by an overwhelming majority of Saudi journalists, while giving the readers what they want was not regarded as a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Tash, Abdulkader. A Profile of Professional Journalists Working in the Saudi Arabian Daily Press. Diss. Southern Illinois University, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, journalism codes, as an important source for the study of media values, complicate this notion. Kai Hafez states, “The possible hypothesis that Islamic countries might not be interested in ‘truth’ and would rather propagate ‘Islam’ as the single truth cannot be verified completely because even a code that limits journalists’ freedom of expression to Islamic objectives and values, the Saudi Arabian code, demands that journalists present real facts.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt; In addition, [[Media of Saudi Arabia|Saudi journalists]] operate in an environment in which anti-religious talk is likely to be met with censorship.

Patterns of consumption also affect media values. People in the Arab world rely on newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet to differing degrees and to meet a variety of ends. For Rugh, the proportion of radio and television receivers to Arab populations relative to UNESCO minimum standards suggests that radio and television are the most widely consumed media. He estimates that television reaches well over 100 million people in the region, and this number has likely grown since 2004. By contrast, he supposes that Arab newspapers are designed more for elite-consumption on the basis of their low circulation. He states, "Only five Arab countries have daily newspapers which distribute over 60,000 copies and some have dailies only in the under-10,000 range. Only Egypt has dailies which distribute more than a half million copies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimating newspaper readership is complicated, however, by the fact that single newspapers can change hands many times in a day. Finally, the internet continues to be a fairly common denominator in Arab societies. A report by the Dubai School of Government and Bayt.com estimates that there are more than 125 million Internet users in the region, and that more than 53 million of them actively use social media. They caution, however, that while "the internet has wide-ranging benefits, these benefits do not reach large segments of societies in the Arab region. The digital divide remains a significant barrier for many people. In many parts of the Arab world levels of educational attainment, economic activity, standards of living and internet costs still determine a person's access to life-changing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arab World Online: Trends in Internet Usage in the Arab Region|url=http://img.b8cdn.com/images/uploads/article_docs/dsg-gip_bayt_report_final_16822_EN.pdf|publisher=The Dubai School of Government with Bayt.com|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, according to Leo Gher and Hussein Amin, the Internet and other modern telecommunication services may serve to counter the effects of private and public ownership and patronage of the press. They state, "Modern international telecommunications services now assist in the free flow of information, and neither inter-Arab conflicts nor differences among groups will affect the direct exchange of services provided by global cyberspace networks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gher|first=Leo A.|author2=Hussein Y. Amin|title=New and Old Media Access and Ownership in the Arab World|journal=International Communications Gazette|date=1999|volume=61|series=1|pages=59–88|doi=10.1177/0016549299061001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
In most Arab countries, [[magazines]] cannot be published without a government-issued license. Magazines in the Arab world, like many of the magazines in the Western world, are geared towards women. However, the number of magazines in the Arab world is significantly smaller than that of the Western world. The Arab world is not as advertisement driven as the Western world. Advertisers fuel the funding for most Western magazines to exist. Thus, a lesser emphasis on [[advertisement]] in the Arab world plays into the low number of magazines.

=== Radio ===
There are 90 private radio stations throughout [[the Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. ([http://www.newarabia.net/arabic_radio_stations.php list of private radio stations in the Arab world])

Arab radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, but only a few Arab countries had their own broadcasting stations before [[World War II]]. After 1945, most Arab states began to create their own radio broadcasting systems, although it was not until 1970, when [[Oman]] opened its radio transmissions, that every one of them had its own radio station.

Among Arab countries, [[Egypt]] has been a leader in radio broadcasting from the beginning. Broadcasting began in Egypt in the 1920s with private commercial radio. In 1947, however, the Egyptian government declared radio a government monopoly and began investing in its expansion.

By the 1970s, Egyptian radio had fourteen different broadcast services with a total air time of 1,200 hours per week. Egypt is ranked third in the world among radio broadcasters. The programs were all government controlled, and much of the motivation for the government's investment in radio was due to the aspirations of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] to be the recognized leader of the Arab world.

Egypt's "Voice of the Arabs" station, which targeted other Arab countries with a constant stream of news and political features and commentaries, became the most widely heard station in the region. Only after the [[June 1967 war]], when it was revealed that this station had misinformed the public about what was happening, did it lose some credibility; nevertheless it retained a large listenership.

On the [[Arabian Peninsula]], radio was slower to develop. In [[Saudi Arabia]], radio broadcasts started in the [[Jidda]]-[[Mecca]] area in 1948, but they did not start in the central or eastern provinces until the 1960s. Neighboring [[Bahrain]] had radio by 1955, but [[Qatar]], [[Abu Dhabi]], and [[Oman]] did not start indigenous radio broadcasting until nearly a quarter century later.

===Television===
Almost all television channels in the Arab world were [[government]]-owned and strictly controlled prior to the 1990s. In the 1990s the spread of satellite television began changing television in Arab countries. Often noted as a pioneer, [[al-Jazeera]] represents a shift towards a more professional approach to news and current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |title=Arab media: television |publisher=Al-bab.com |accessdate=2011-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505045604/http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |archivedate=2011-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financed by the [[Qatar]] government and established in 1996, [[al-Jazeera]] was the first Arabic channel to deliver extensive live news coverage, going so far as to send reporters to "unthinkable" places like Israel. Breaking the mold in more ways than one, al-Jazeera’s discussion programs raised subjects that had long been prohibited. However, in 2008, [[Egypt]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] called for a meeting to approve a charter to regulate [[satellite]] [[broadcasting]]. The [[Arab League]] Satellite Broadcasting Charter (2008) lays out principles for regulating satellite broadcasting in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Arab Media &amp; Society (March, 2008):[http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20080314081327_AMS_Charter_English.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (Unofficial Translation)] Retrieved 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arab Media &amp; Society (March, 2008): [http://www.arabmediasociety.com/UserFiles/AMS%20Charter%20Arabic.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (in Arabic)] Retrieved 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Other satellite channels:

* [[Al-Arabiya]]: established in 2003; based in Dubai; offshoot of MBC
* [[Al-Hurra]] ("The Free One"): established in 2004 by the United States; counter perceives "biases" in Arab news media
* Al-Manar: owned by Hizbullah; Lebanese-based; highly controversial

"Across the [[Middle East]], new [[television stations]], [[radio stations]] and [[websites]] are sprouting like incongruous electronic mushrooms in what was once a media desert. Meanwhile [[newspapers]] are aggressively probing the red lines that have long contained them".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"&gt;Pintak, Lawrence. Reporting a Revolution: the Changing Arab Media Landscape. Arab Media &amp; Society (February, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] is playing a significant role in the changing Arab media. Pintak furthers, "Now, there are 263 free-to-air (FTA) satellite television stations in the region, according to Arab Advisors Group. That’s double the figure as of just two years ago".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"/&gt; [[Freedom of speech]] and money have little to do with why [[satellite television]] is sprouting up everywhere. Instead, "A desire for political influence is probably the biggest factor driving channel growth. But ego is a close second".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"/&gt; The influence of the West is very apparent in Arab media, especially in television. [[Arab soap operas]] and the emerging popularity of [[reality TV]] are evidence of this notion.

"In the wake of controversy triggered by ''Super Star'' and ''Star Academy'', some observers have hailed reality television as a harbinger of democracy in the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraidy |first=Marwan |url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85 |title=Arab Media &amp; Society |publisher=Arabmediasociety.com |accessdate=2011-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110405121157/http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85| archivedate= 5 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Star Academy]]'' in [[Lebanon]] is strikingly similar to ''[[American Idol]]'' mixed with ''[[The Real World]]''. ''Star Academy'' began in 2003 in the Arab world. "Reality television entered Arab public discourse in the last five years at a time of significant turmoil in the region: escalating violence in [[Iraq]], contested elections in Egypt, the struggle for women’s political rights in [[Kuwait]], [[political assassination]]s in [[Lebanon]], and the protracted [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]]. This geo-political crisis environment that currently frames Arab politics and Arab-Western relations is the backdrop to the controversy surrounding the social and political impact of Arab reality television, which assumes religious, cultural or moral manifestations."&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, Marwan M. Reality Television and Politics in the Arab World: Preliminary Observations. Transnational Broadcasting Studies, 15 (Fall/ Winter, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinema ===
{{main article|Arab cinema}}
Most Arab countries did not produce films before nation independence. In [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], production is even now confined to short films or television. [[Bahrain]] witnessed the production of its first and only full-length feature film in 1989. In [[Jordan]] national production has barely exceeded half a dozen feature films. [[Algeria]] and [[Iraq]] have produced approximately 100 films each, [[Morocco]] around seventy, [[Tunisia]] around 130, and [[Syria]] some 150. [[Lebanon]], owing to an increased production during the 1950s and 1960s, has made some 180 feature films. Only [[Egypt]] has far exceeded these countries, with a production of more than 2,500 feature films (all meant for cinema, not television).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Shafik, Viola. Arab Cinema: History and Cultural Identity.&lt;/ref&gt; As with most aspects of [[Arab media]], censorship plays a large art of creating and distributing films. "In most Arab countries, film projects must first pass a state committee, which grants or denies permission to shoot. Once this permission is obtained, another official license, a so-called visa, is necessary in order to exploit the film commercially. This is normally approved by a committee of the Ministry of Information or a special censorship authority".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The most significant taboo topics under state supervision are consistent with those of other forms of media: [[religion]], [[sex]], and [[politics]].

=== Internet ===
The [[Internet]] in the Arab world is powerful source of expression and information as it is in other places in the world. While some believe that it is the harbinger of freedom in media to the [[Middle East]], others think that it is a new medium for [[censorship]]. Both are true. The Internet has created a new arena for discussion and the dissemination of information for the Arab world just as it has in the rest of the world. The youth in particular are accessing and utilizing the tools. People are encouraged and enabled to join in political discussion and critique in a manner that was not previously possible. Those same people are also discouraged and blocked from those debates as the differing regimes try to restrict access based on religious and state objections to certain material.

The internet in the Arab world has a snowball effect; now that the snowball is rolling, it can no longer be stopped. Getting bigger and stronger, it is bound to crush down all obstacles. In addition, to the stress caused by the Arab bloggers, a new forum was opened for Arab activists; Facebook. Arab activists have been using Facebook in the utmost creative way to support the democracy movement in the region, a region that has one of the highest rates of repression in the world. Unlike other regions where oppressive countries (like China, Iran and Burma) represent the exception, oppression can be found everywhere in the Arab world. The number of Arab internet users interested in political affairs does not exceed a few thousands, mainly represented by internet activists and bloggers, out of 58 million internet users in the Arab world. As few as they are, they have succeeded in shedding some light on the corruption and repression of the Arab governments and dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;How the Internet has snowballed in the Arab world. &lt;http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929043556/http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470 |date=September 29, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public Internet use began in the US in the 1980s. Internet access began in the early 1990s in the Arab world, with [[Tunisia]] being first in 1991 according to Dr. Deborah L. Wheeler. The years of the Internet's introduction in the various Arab countries are reported differently. Wheeler reports that [[Kuwait]] joined in 1992, and in 1993, [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]] and the [[UAE]] came online. In 1994 [[Jordan]] joined the Internet, and [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Syria]] followed in the late 1990s. Financial considerations and the lack of widespread availability of services are factors in the slower growth in the Arab world, but taking into consideration the popularity of [[internet cafe]]s, the numbers [[online]] are much larger than the subscription numbers would reveal.&lt;ref&gt;Hofheinz, Albrecht. "The Internet in the Arab World: Playground for Political Liberalization." (n.d.): 96&lt;/ref&gt;

The people most commonly utilizing the Internet in the Arab world are youths. The [[café]] users in particular tend to be under 30, single and have a variety of levels of [[education]] and language proficiency. Despite reports that use of the internet was curtailed by lack of [[English language|English]] skills, Dr. Wheeler found that people were able to search with [[Arabic]]. Searching for jobs, the unemployed frequently fill cafes in [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]]. They are [[men]] and [[women]] equally. Most of them chat and they have email. In a survey conducted by Dr. Deborah Wheeler, she found them to almost all to have been taught to use the Internet by a friend or family member. They all felt their lives to have been significantly changed by the use of the Internet. The use of the Internet in the Arab world is very political in the nature of the posts and of the sites read and visited. The Internet has brought a medium to Arabs that allows for a [[free will|freedom]] of expression not allowed or accepted before. For those who can get online, there are blogs to read and write and access to worldwide outlets of information once unobtainable. With this access, regimes have attempted to curtail what people are able to read, but the Internet is a medium not as easily manipulated as telling a [[newspaper]] what it can or cannot [[publish]]. The Internet can be reached via [[proxy server]], mirror, and other means. Those who are thwarted with one method will find 12 more methods around the blocked site. As [[journalists]] suffer and are imprisoned in traditional media, the Internet is no different with [[bloggers]] regularly being imprisoned for expressing their views for the world to read. The difference is that there is a worldwide audience witnessing this crackdown and watching as [[laws]] are created and recreated to attempt to control the vastness of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Rinnawi, Khalil. "The Internet and the Arab world as a virtual public shpere." (n.d.): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jihadists]] are using the Internet to reach a greater audience. Just as a simple citizen can now have a worldwide voice, so can a movement. Groups are using the Internet to share video, photos, programs and any kind of information imaginable. Standard media may not report what the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] would say on their site. However, for the interested, the Internet is a tool that is utilized with great skill by those who wish to be heard. A file uploaded to 100 sites and placed in multiple forums will reach millions instantly. Information on the Internet can be thwarted, slowed, even redirected, but it cannot be stopped if someone wants it out there on the Internet.

The efforts by the various regimes to control the information are all falling apart gradually. Those fighting crime online have devised methods of tracking and catching criminals. Unfortunately those same tools are being used to arrest bloggers and those who would just wish to be heard. The Internet is a vast and seemingly endless source of information. Arabs are using it more than perhaps the world is aware and it is changing the media.

==Society==
[[File:Cairo Cafe.JPG|thumb|right|A café in [[Cairo]]]]
Social loyalty is of great importance in Arab culture. Family is one of the most important aspects of the Arab society. While self-reliance, individuality, and responsibility are taught by Arabic parents to their children, family loyalty is the greatest lesson taught in Arab families.  "Unlike the extreme individualism we see in North America (every person for him or herself, individual rights, families living on their own away from relatives, and so on), Arab society emphasizes the importance of the group. Arab culture teaches that the needs of the group are more important than the needs of one person."&lt;ref&gt;J. Esherick, Women in the Arab World (Philadelphia: Mason Crest Publishers, 2006), 68&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bedouin tribes of Saudi Arabia, "intense feelings of loyalty and dependence are fostered and preserved"&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Gannon, Understanding Global Culture: Metaphorical Journeys Through 28 Nations, 3rd Edition, (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004), 70&lt;/ref&gt; by the family.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Samovar, et al., Communication Between Cultures, 7th Ed., (Boston: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2010), 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times'', writes "family loyalty and obligations take precedence over loyalty to friends or demands of a job."&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"&gt;M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times, 4th Ed., (Boston: Intercultural Press, 2006), 71&lt;/ref&gt;  She goes on to state that "members of a family are expected to support each other in disputes with outsiders. Regardless of personal antipathy among relatives, they must defend each other’s honor, counter criticism, and display group cohesion..."&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;  Of all members of the family, however, the most revered member is the mother.

Family honor is one of the most important characteristics in the Arab family. According to Margaret Nydell, social exchanges between men and women happen very seldom outside of the work place.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt; Men and women refrain from being alone together. They have to be very careful in social situations because those interactions can be interpreted negatively and cause gossip, which can tarnish the reputation of women. Women are able to socialize freely with other women and male family members, but have to have family members present to socialize with men that are not part of the family.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt; These conservative practices are put into place to protect the reputation of women. Bad behavior not only affects women but her family’s honor. Practices differ between countries and families. Saudi Arabia has stricter practices when it comes to men and women and will even require marriage documents if a woman and man are seen together alone.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;

'''Arab values'''
One of the characteristics of Arabs is generosity and they usually show it by being courteous with each other. Some of the most important values for Arabs are honor and loyalty. Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times' &lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;  '' says that Arabs can be defined as, humanitarian, loyal and polite. Tarek Mahfouz explains in the book "Arab Culture" &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mahfouz, Tarek. Arab Culture, Vol. 1: An In-depth Look at Arab Culture Through Cartoons and Popular Art (English and Arabic Edition). Ed. Thane Floreth. 2011 ed. Vol. 1. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is common for Arabs in dinner situations to insist on guests to eat the last piece of the meal or to fight over who will pay the bill at a restaurant for generosity.''

'''Female Infanticide''' 
Like many societies around the world, the preference for a son is much higher than that for a daughter in the Arab world. In pre-Islamic Arabia, husbands would go as far as burying female infants alive because of the shame it caused them among their peers. Women are typically seen as a burden whereas men represent honor and dignity to a family. Muhammad revealed a verse which deals with this phenomenon. It says, "And God will ask the female infant who had been buried alive (''"mau'udda"'') for what wrongdoing was she killed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://quran.com/81/8-9 Surah At-Takwir]&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is long gone in the Arab world, but the sentiment of having a son over a daughter still resides and women are still subject to divorce for failure to give birth to a son as a first born child.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sports==

===Pan Arab Games===
{{Main article|Pan Arab Games}}
The Pan Arab Games are a regional multi-sport event held between nations from the Arab world. The first Games were held in 1953 in Alexandria, Egypt. Intended to be held every four years since, political turmoil as well as financial difficulties has made the event an unstable one. Women were first allowed to compete in 1985. By the [[2007 Pan Arab Games|11th Pan Arab Games]], the number of countries participating reached all 22 members of the [[Arab League]], with roughly over 8,000 Arab athletes participating, it was considered the largest in the Games History, with the [[2011 Pan Arab Games|Doha Games]] in 2011 expected to exceed that number.

===Arab women in sports===
Women around the world have struggled in the professional world of sports since it has been something that has been dominated by men. When looking at the Arab world currently there is an emergence of Arab women playing sports, something that for the most part is not much discussed but is of great importance. Muslim Arab women are taking part in playing on futsal, football (soccer), softball, basketball, and various other teams. Some women are participating in boxing, archery, running, swimming, tennis and other individual sports. Because more Muslim women are playing sports, sportswear is being developed so that a woman can still be able to participate in sports like swimming without limiting their participation due to the way they choose to dress. Although women have received great support from family members in playing sports, there is still much criticism towards female athletes in the Arab world. Many conservative men have criticized that sports and women do not go together and that a woman would not be able to wear her headscarf or should not wear shorts while playing sports.

Some people do not see Islam and women playing sports as being compatible. Despite the various criticisms Arab women around the Arab world face, it has not stopped the popularity of women’s participation in sports. Football is one of the sports that has exploded in popularity with women in the Arab world. With the coming of the Women’s World Cup in 2011, there is a Women’s Football Cup Arabia occurring in Bahrain which is bringing together women’s teams from all over the Arab world to play in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com/2010/10/womens-football-cup-arabia-2010-on-road.html |title=Muslim Women in SPORTS: WOMEN'S FOOTBALL CUP ARABIA 2010 - on the road to Germany |publisher=Muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are teams in Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Jordan and events like this show that, as said by Dr. Sahar al Hawary who is a member of FIFA’s Women’s Committee from Egypt, "women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world... women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=90760.html |title=Princess champions game for Arab women |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2004-02-11 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab women are also challenging and becoming a part of sports that even outside of the Arab world are considered not for women. There are Arab women who are participating in boxing, even reaching international competition levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cY2p8fjX1s |title=Everywoman - Sport and playing for gold - 30 May 08 - Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab women are not limiting themselves and although they receive criticism from some of society, their families and communities have been very supportive while still considering themselves conservative and faithful to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2jYLCloFo&amp;feature=channel |title=Everywoman - Sport and playing for gold - 30 May 08 - Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women and their families are challenging the very narrow view that society at times has of the capabilities of women and have inspired women all around the Arab world to not limit themselves. Despite this occurring in the Arab world, what these Arab female athletes are doing is an inspiration to women all over the globe.

==Cuisine==
{{Main article|Arab cuisine}}
[[File:Petra metzes.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of Jordanian [[Meze|mezze]], appetizers or small dishes, in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].]]
Originally, the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula relied heavily on a diet of [[date palm|dates]], wheat, barley, rice and meat, with little variety, with a heavy emphasis on yoghurt products, such as [[leben (food)|leben]] (لبن) (yoghurt without butterfat). Arabian cuisine today is the result of a combination of richly diverse cuisines, spanning the Arab world and incorporating [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], Egyptian, and others. It has also been influenced to a degree by the cuisines of India, Turkey, Berber, and others. In an average Arab household in the [[Persian Gulf]] area, a visitor might expect a dinner consisting of a very large platter, shared commonly, with a vast mountain of rice, incorporating lamb or chicken, or both, as separate dishes, with various stewed vegetables, heavily spiced, sometimes with a tomato sauce. Most likely, there would be several other items on the side, less hearty. [[Tea]] would certainly accompany the meal, as it is almost constantly consumed. [[Coffee]] would be included as well.

===Tea culture===
{{further|Arabic tea}}
Tea is a very important drink in the Arab world, it is usually served with breakfast, after lunch, and with dinner. For Arabs tea is a hospitality drink that is served to guests. It is also common for Arabs to drink tea with dates.

== Dress ==

===Men===
Arab dress for men ranges from the traditional flowing robes to blue jeans, T-shirts and business suits. The robes allow for maximum circulation of air around the body to help keep it cool, and the head dress provides protection from the sun. At times, Arabs mix the traditional garb with clothes.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/arabculture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thobe'''
In the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] men usually wear their national dress that is called "thobe" but can be also called "Dishdasha" (Kuwait) or "Kandoura" (UAE). "Thobes" differ slightly from state to state within the Gulf, but the basic ones are white. This is the traditional attire that Arabs wear in formal occasions.

'''Headdress'''
The male headdress is also known as [[Keffiyeh]]. Headdress pattern might be an indicator of which tribe, clan, or family the wearer comes from. However, this is not always the case. While in one village, a tribe or clan might have a unique headdress, in the next town over an unrelated tribe or clan might wear the same headdress.
[[File:Jissr-groom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A wedding carriage in [[Jisr az-Zarqa]], Israel]]
* Checkered headdresses relate to type and government and participation in the [[Hajj]], or a pilgrimage to Mecca.
* Red and white checkered headdress – Generally of Jordanian origin. Wearer has made Hajj and comes from a country with a Monarch.
* Black and white checkered headdress – The pattern is historically of Palestinian origin.
* Black and grey represent Presidential rule and completion of the Hajj.

'''Guthra (headdress) in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]'''
The male headdress in the Gulf states is called Guthra and it is different in each country (size and shape). It is usually worn with a black cord called "agal" that keeps the guthra on the wearer's head.
* The Qatari guthra is heavily starched and it is known for its "cobra" shape.
* The Saudi guthra is a square shaped cotton fabric. The traditional is white but the white and red (shemagh) is also very common in Saudi Arabia.
* The Emirati guthra is usually white and can be used as a wrapped turban or traditionally with the black agal.

===Women===
Adherence to traditional dress varies across Arab societies. [[Saudi Arabia]] is more traditional, while [[Egypt]] is less so. Traditional Arab dress features the full length body cover ([[abaya]], [[jilbāb]], or [[chador]]) and veil ([[hijab]]). Women are only required to wear ''[[abaya]]s'' in Saudi Arabia. In most countries, like [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]], the veil is not prevalent.

The '''Beehive Design Collective''' is a [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-driven [[non-profit]] [[arts organization]] that uses graphical media as educational tools to communicate stories of [[Resistance movement|resistance]] to [[corporate globalization]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2011|title="Drawing Common Ground: An Interview with Lara Bee of the Beehive Design Collective:|url=|journal=Upping the Anti: a journal of theory and action|volume=12|pages=55-71|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the group, based in [[Machias, Maine]], is to "Cross-pollinate the [[grassroots]]" by creating collaborative, [[anti-copyright]] images that can be used as educational and organizing tools.  The most recognizable of these images are large format pen and ink posters, which seek to provide a visual alternative to [[deconstruction]] of complicated social and political issues ranging from [[globalization]], [[free trade]], [[militarism]], [[resource extraction]], and [[biotechnology]].

==Graphic campaigns==

The Collective creates graphic campaigns addressing diverse geo- and socio-political issues.  The illustrations are informed and developed through extensive research. The most recent campaign resulted from travel to [[Mexico]] and interviews of a broad spectrum of people. The group adheres to self-imposed rules during their campaign production, including absence of literal human depictions, use of cross-cultural imagery, and avoidance of cultural appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beehivecollective.org/english/graphics_campaigns.htm About Beehive Graphic Campaigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trilogy in progress details globalization in the western hemisphere through a series of three graphics.
 
==Storytelling==
The Collective's educational work involves storytelling, international lecture circuits using giant reproductions of their posters as storytelling aids. "Picture lectures" feature a 30-feet high graphic and a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} fabric flipbook/storybook. Audiences are led through a two-hour interactive, conversational presentation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beehivecollective.org/english/tour.htm Beehive Collective presentation info and presentation schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print distribution==
One of the Beehive's goals in their graphic distribution is to have 50% of each print run distributed to communities in the global south free of charge.  The remaining half are distributed internationally for donations.  Posters are distributed at a wide range of venues, events, college campuses and academic events.

All of the Beehive Collective's materials are distributed as [[anti-copyright]], and their production is encouraged for non-profit, non-commercial use to assist in publications and productions.  The black and white imagery is designed to facilitate ease of reproduction.  The Beehive distributes free clip-art digital imagery via their website and graphic CD-ROMs distributed from their webstore.

==Machias Valley Grange Hall==
[[Image:Grange-roofing.jpg|thumb|150px|Installing a new roof on the Machias Valley Grange Hall.]]
Since the year 2000, the Collective has been engaged in the restoration of the Machias Valley [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] Hall, located in [[Machias, Maine]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beehivecollective.org/english/thegrange.htm About the Grange Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; built in 1904. The restoration labor was sourced from visiting volunteers. The building was initially used as the Collective's center of its stone mosaics program.

Annually, the Collective throws a no-cost dress-up dance party of immense proportions called the "Blackfly Ball".&lt;ref&gt;They had a Ball - Ellsworth American news report on the Machias Blackfly Ball [https://archive.is/20070619044406/http://ellsworthmaine.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9779&amp;Itemid=185]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beehivecollective.org/images/blackflyball-article2.jpg |title=Downeast Coastal Press Eyewitness Account of Blackfly Ball |access-date=2007-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921175329/http://www.beehivecollective.org/images/blackflyball-article2.jpg |archive-date=2007-09-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are ongoing events such as a weekly Open Mic night and annual Halloween celebration.

'''''Blind Man's Bluff''''' (Spanish: '''''La gallina ciega''''') is one of the [[Rococo]] [[List of Francisco Goya's tapestry cartoons|oil-on-linen cartoons]] produced by the [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Francisco de Goya]] for tapestries for the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]]. The work shows boys and girls playing the popular pastime "[[blind man's buff]]" with one figure in the middle blindfolded and holding a large spoon while trying to entice others dancing around him in a circle.

The children are dressed in the attire of Spanish aristocrats. Some wear velvet jackets and feather headdresses.

The picture is an example of Goya's Rococo period, and is typically lively and with a soft color scheme of pink and yellow in the skirts of women and luminous background scenery. As with many of his tapestry cartoons, it captures a charming moment of life.

The creation of art in the geographic area now known as [[Brazil]] begins with the earliest records of its human habitation. The original inhabitants of the land, [[pre-Columbian]] Indian peoples, produced various forms of art; specific cultures like the [[Marajoara]] left sophisticated painted [[pottery]]. This area was colonized by [[Portugal]] in the 16th century and given the modern name of [[Brazil]]. '''Brazilian art''' is most commonly used as an umbrella term for art created in this region post Portuguese colonization.

==Pre-Columbian traditions==
{{main|Indigenous peoples in Brazil}}
The oldest known art in Brazil is the [[cave painting]]s in [[Serra da Capivara National Park]] in the state of [[Piauí]],&lt;ref&gt;''Almanaque Abril 2007''. São Paulo: Editora Abril, 2007, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to c. 13,000 BC. More recent examples have been found in [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Goiás]], showing geometric patterns and animal forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historiadaarte.com.br/prehistoriabras.html Martins, Simone B. &amp; Imbroisi, Margaret H. ''História da Arte'', 1988] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031010548/http://historiadaarte.com.br/prehistoriabras.html |date=2010-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most sophisticated kinds of Pre-Columbian artifact found in Brazil is the sophisticated [[Marajoara]] pottery (c.  800–1400 AD), from cultures flourishing on [[Marajó Island]] and around the region of [[Santarém, Brazil|Santarém]], decorated with painting and complex human and animal reliefs. Statuettes and cult objects, such as the small carved-stone amulets called [[muiraquitã]]s, also belong to these cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Correa, Conceição Gentil. ''Estatuetas de cerâmica na cultura Santarém''. Belém: Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mina culture|Mina]] and [[Periperi]] cultures, from [[Maranhão]] and [[Bahia]], produced interesting though simpler pottery and statuettes.

In the beginning of the 21st century, the ancient Indian traditions of [[body painting]], pottery, cult statuettes, and feather art are still being cultivated by the remaining Indian peoples.

==Baroque==
{{main|Baroque in Brazil}}
The first Western artists active in Brazil were [[Roman Catholic]] priests who came from Portugal to “civilize” the Indians. [[Jesuit]]s assumed an important role in this process, with their many missionary establishments called "[[Reductions]]" teaching religion through art in the form of sacred plays, music, statuary, and painting. [[José de Anchieta]] was the first important playwright; [[Agostinho de Jesus]] and [[Agostinho da Piedade]] produced the first known sculptures; [[Belchior Paulo]], [[João Felipe Bettendorff]], [[Ricardo do Pilar]], and a few others did the first paintings; while [[Francisco de Vaccas]] and Pedro da Fonseca started organizing the musical life of the infant colony. [[Basílio da Gama]] and [[Gregório de Mattos]] were the first secular poets. All of them worked under the influence of the [[Baroque]], the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;KARNAL, Leandro.

Encyclopaedia Itaú Cultural]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 17th and 18th centuries Baroque art flourished with increasing richness and craftsmanship, mainly in [[Bahia]] and [[Pernambuco]] along the coast and in some inland regions, reaching the highest levels of originality in [[Minas Gerais]], where a [[gold rush]] nurtured a rich and cultured local society. In Minas lived the greatest artists of Brazilian Baroque: [[Painting|painter]] [[Manuel da Costa Ataíde]] and [[sculptor]]-[[architect]] [[Aleijadinho]]. Minas was also the birthplace of a proto-[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] school of [[music]] and [[literature]], with composers [[Lobo de Mesquita]] and [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]], and poets [[Tomás Antônio Gonzaga]] and [[Cláudio Manuel da Costa]].&lt;ref name="itaucultural.org.br" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MARIZ, Vasco.

==19th century: Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism==
{{See also|Academic art in Brazil}}
One single event in the 19th century sowed the seeds for a complete renewal in Brazilian visual arts: the arrival of the [[Missão Artística Francesa|French Artistic Mission]] in 1816, which strongly reinforced the Neoclassical style, previously seen in Brazil only in timid attempts. [[Joachim Lebreton]], its leader, proposed the creation of an Academy of Fine Arts, later restructured as the [[Imperial Academy of Fine Arts (Brazil)|Imperial Academy of Fine Arts]]. The Academy was the most important center for the [[visual arts]] through nearly the whole of the 19th century. It imposed a new concept of artistic education and was the basis for a revolution in Brazilian painting, sculpture, architecture, graphic arts, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;CONDURU, Roberto. ''Araras Gregas''. In: 19&amp;20 - A revista eletrônica de DezenoveVinte. Volume III, n. 2, abril de 2008 [http://www.dezenovevinte.net/arte%20decorativa/ad_conduru.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; A few decades later, under the personal patronage of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], who was engaged in an ambitious national project of modernization, the Academy reached its golden age, fostering the emergence of the first generation of Romantic painters. [[Victor Meirelles]] and [[Pedro Américo]], among others, produced lasting visual symbols of national identity. It must be said that in Brazil Romanticism in painting took a peculiar shape, not showing the overwhelming dramaticism, fantasy, violence, or interest in death and the bizarre commonly seen in the European version, and because of its academic and palatial nature all excesses were eschewed.&lt;ref&gt;BISCARDI, Afrânio &amp; ROCHA, Frederico Almeida.

[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|thumb|250px|Pedro Américo: ''[[Independence or Death (painting)|Independence or Death!]]'', 1888. [[Museu Paulista]]]]

Meanwhile, literature too evolved towards a romantic-nationalist school with the works of [[Casimiro de Abreu]] and [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]]. Around 1850, a transition began, centered upon [[Álvares de Azevedo]], who was influenced by the poetry of [[Lord Byron]]. This second generation of Romantics was obsessed with morbidness and death, and soon after, social commentary could be found in literature, both features not seen in the visual arts. [[Antônio Castro Alves]] wrote of the horrors of [[slavery]], and the persecuted Indians were rescued through art by poets and novelists like [[Antônio Gonçalves Dias]] and [[José de Alencar]]. These trends combined in one of the most important accomplishments of the Romantic era in Brazil: the establishment of a Brazilian national identity based on Indian ancestry and the rich natural environment of the country.&lt;ref&gt;''O Indianismo como Projeto de Nacionalidade''. Secretaria Municipal de Educação - Prefeitura da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro [http://www.multirio.rj.gov.br/historia/modulo02/tema65_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, the 19th century produced only two composers of outstanding talent: neoclassical sacred composer [[José Maurício Nunes Garcia]], for a while [[music director]] to the court, and later, Romantic [[Opera|operist]] [[Antônio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]], the first Brazilian musician to win international acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;''A Música na Corte de D. João VI e D. Pedro I; Antonio Carlos Gomes''. In MARIZ, Vasco. ''História da Música no Brasil''. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 2005.pp 52-61; 76-95&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, Brazilian art became acquainted with [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]. Descriptions of nature and of the people of Brazil's varied regions as well as psychological romances proliferated with [[João Simões Lopes Neto]], [[Aluísio Azevedo]], [[Euclides da Cunha]], and, above all, [[Machado de Assis]], while [[Almeida Junior]], [[Pedro Weingärtner]], [[Oscar Pereira da Silva]], and other Realist painters depicted folk types and the distinctive colors and light of Brazilian landscape.

==20th century: Modern Art==

The beginning of the 20th century saw a struggle between old schools and modernist trends. The [[Week of Modern Art]] festival, held in [[São Paulo]] in 1922, was received with fiery criticism by conservative  sectors of the society, but it was a landmark in the history of Brazilian art. It included plastic arts exhibitions, lectures, concerts, and the reading of poems. Due to the radicalism (for the times) of some of their poems and music, the artists were vigorously booed and pelted by the audience, and the press and art critics in general were strong in their condemnation. However, those artists are now seen as the founders of Modern art in Brazil. Modernist literature and theory of art were represented by [[Oswald de Andrade]], [[Sérgio Milliet]], [[Menotti del Picchia]], and [[Mário de Andrade]], whose revolutionary novel ''[[Macunaíma (novel)|Macunaíma]]'' (1928) is one of the founding texts of Brazilian Modernism. Painting was represented by [[Anita Malfatti]], [[Tarsila do Amaral]], [[Emiliano Di Cavalcanti]], [[Lasar Segall]], [[Vicente do Rego Monteiro]]; sculpture by [[Victor Brecheret]]; and music by [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], the leader of a new musical nationalism, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitoresco.com.br/art_data/semana/ ''Semana da Arte Moderna''. Pitoresco Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414025546/http://www.pitoresco.com.br/art_data/semana/ |date=2010-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brazil.Brasilia.01.jpg|thumb|250px|Oscar Niemeyer: [[Cathedral of Brasília]]. The statues are works by [[Alfredo Ceschiatti]]]]
The Week not only introduced to a wider public modern, experimental tendencies derived from European [[Expressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Surrealism]], but also wanted to make use of national [[folklore]] as a basis for an art more relevant to the Brazilian reality, with an enhanced social awareness. This "cannibalization" of european movements and transformation into genuine brazilian expression is the motto between the [[Manifesto Antropófago|Anthropophagic Manifesto]], published by Oswald de Andrade in 1928, that draws parallels between art history and the cannibal rituals of the Tupi people.

However, the radicalism of those first Modernists couldn't last for long in a society used to traditional fashions, and the original core members had separated by 1929, pursuing individual paths. What Brazilian art then became was a mix of some important achievements of the Moderns, meaning freedom from the strict academic agenda, with more conventional traits, giving birth in the following generation to a moderate Modernism, best exemplified by painter [[Cândido Portinari]], who was something like the official painter of the Brazilian government in mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia_ic/index.cfm?fuseaction=termos_texto_ing&amp;cd_verbete=4900&amp;lst_palavras=&amp;cd_idioma=28556&amp;cd_item=8 ''Modernism in Brazil''. Encyclopedia Itaú Cultural]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Copan ST.jpg|thumb|181x181px|left|''Oscar Niemeyer: ''Copan Building'']]

Within the group of Brazilian artists, Chico Niedzielski's artwork has been spread all over the country. His work is known to be inspired by Sacred Geometry, breaking the tendency to focus on Brazilian themes and searching for a more universal and atemporal form of [http://chiconiedzielski.com Brazilian art].
The erosion of radical Modernism in the visual arts in the early 20th century was not reflected in Brazilian literature. [[Clarice Lispector]] wrote [[Existentialism|existentialist]] novels and developed a highly personal style, filled with [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] and epiphanies. [[João Guimarães Rosa]] changed the face of Brazilian literature with his experimental language, and playwright [[Nelson Rodrigues]] dealt with crime, prejudice, passion, and sexual pathologies. In the 1950s, painting and sculpture regained strength through [[Abstractionism]], and architecture began also to display advanced features, influenced by [[Le Corbusier]]. Its greatest achievement was the urban core of [[Brasília]], designed by urbanist [[Lúcio Costa]] and architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]], now a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itaucultural.org.br/aplicexternas/enciclopedia_ic/index.cfm?fuseaction=artistas_biografia_ing&amp;cd_verbete=3948&amp;lst_palavras=&amp;cd_idioma=28556&amp;cd_item=1 ''Niemeyer, Oscar''. Encyclopedia Itaú Cultural]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== 1960s onwards: Contemporary Art ==
Around the 1960s, the so-called "modernist" art movements started giving way to most contemporary means of expression, such as appropriation, political art, [[Conceptual art]] and [[Pop art|Pop]]. Right at the turn of the decade, some Brazilian [[Concrete art|Concrete]] artists began ditching the traditional "strictness" of concrete art in favor of a more phenomenological approach, exploring the relations between the art object and the viewer. Among the primary leaders of this [[Neo-Concrete Movement|Neo-Concrete movement]] were the poet [[Ferreira Gullar]], and the visual artists [[Hélio Oiticica]], [[Lygia Pape]] and [[Lygia Clark]], this last one internationally cited as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/most-influential-artists-1093196|title=Who Are the Most Influential Artists of the Last Century? 26 Industry Leaders Weigh In {{!}} artnet News|date=2017-10-13|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|Coup d'état of 1964]] and subsequential takeaway of civil rights and freedom of expression in Brazil is commonly marked as the shifting point, whence artists such as [[Cildo Meireles]] and [[Rubens Gerchman]] began creating explicitly political art &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://memoriasdaditadura.org.br/artes-plasticas/index.html|title=Artes plásticas na ditadura - Memórias da ditadura|date=2014-11-14|work=Memórias da ditadura|access-date=2018-04-27|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Particularly after 1968, when the military government legalized torture, brazilian art was marked by rather radical actions and [[Happening|happenings]]. The [[São Paulo Art Biennial]], the second oldest art biennial in the world, opened up with most of its walls empty due to a boycott from the artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bienal.org.br/post.php?i=537|title=O boicote à Bienal de 1969 - Bienal|last=Paulo|first=Bienal São|website=www.bienal.org.br|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; . In 1970, the exhibit Do Corpo à Terra ("From Body to Earth") took place in [[Belo Horizonte]], and included rather shocking actions such as Cildo Meireles setting live chickens on fire in front of a live audience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://memoriasdaditadura.org.br/obras/tiradentes-totem-monumento-ao-preso-politico-1970-de-cildo-meireles/index.html|title=Tiradentes – Totem-monumento ao Preso Político (1970), de Cildo Meireles - Memórias da ditadura|work=Memórias da ditadura|access-date=2018-04-27|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Artur Barrio]] ditching blood-soaked packages in a river, giving off the impression that the people who disappeared under the military government had "reappeared" in this gruesome fashion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53099013|title=Inverted utopias : avant-garde art in Latin America|last=1955-|first=Ramírez, Mari Carmen,|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Olea, Héctor., Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.|isbn=0300102690|location=New Haven|oclc=53099013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Brazilian [[Pop art]] didn't come without its share of criticism, sometimes adopting an outright rejection of consumer culture instead of the ambivalent, distant criticism of american pop. [[Waldemar Cordeiro]] is one of the most expressive artists that began exploring digital art and robotics in its work around the 60s and 70s, while Antonio Dias, Carlos Vergara brought the aethetics of comic books, playing cards and other popular forms of visuality into his work. Hélio Oiticica's "Tropicália", a colorful immersive installation piece, incorporated references to the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The title relates to the [[Tropicália|cultural movement of the same name]], that called back to the Antropophagic Manifesto of the 1920s to offer a more tongue-in-cheek perspective on the myths of an exotic and "wild" Brazil.

Some artists as: [[Hélio Oiticica]], [[Lygia Clark]], [[Naza (artist)|Naza]], [[Cildo Meireles]] among others, have been featured on the international stage. Brazilian contemporary art and photography are among the most creative in Latin America, growing an international prominence each year with exhibitions and publications. Names like Miguel Rio Branco, [[Vik Muniz]], [[Sebastião Salgado]], [[Guy Veloso]], and others, get strong.

A '''Brunaille''' is a painting executed entirely or primarily in shades of brown.  Such a painting is described as having been painted "''en brunaille''".&lt;ref&gt;Christie’s, ''Sale 2437, Old Master Pictures'', lot 51, Amsterdam, Christie’s, 8 November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  

''Brunaille'' has its roots in 12th century [[stained glass]] made for [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monasteries,  which prohibited the use of colored art in 1134. However, it was only in the early 17th century that the French term “''brunaille''” was coined to describe pictures painted in shades of brown.&lt;ref&gt; Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Brunaille are less common than paintings executed in grey (''[[grisaille]]''), though more common than those in green ([[verdaille]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''critical apparatus''' ({{lang-la|apparatus criticus}}) is the critical and [[primary source]] material that accompanies an edition of a text. A critical apparatus is often a by-product of [[textual criticism]].

Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from ''[[Hamlet]]'', which the Oxford ''Complete Works'' (1988) prints as follows:&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Complete Works'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|{{sc|LAERTES}}. Alas, then is she drowned.}}

The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|4.7.156 Alas, then is she drowned.] {{sc|'''HIBBARD'''}}; Alas then, is she drown'd? '''F''';&lt;br&gt;Alas then is she drownd. '''Q3'''; Alas, then, she is drownd. '''Q2''';&lt;br/&gt;So, she is drownde: '''Q1'''.}}

The format of the apparatus has several parts:
* The location of the variant in the text (act, scene, line number)
* The ''lemma'', which is the portion of the text to which the note applies
* A right bracket (])
* The source from which the edition took its reading
* A list of variants, in each case followed by the source in which the variant is found, and set off with a semicolon.

To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a ''siglum''. In Shakespeare editions, '''F''' always signifies the [[First Folio]]; the second through fourth folios are referred to as '''F2''' through '''F4''' respectively. Similarly, '''Q1''' is the first [[quarto]], '''Q2''' the second quarto, and '''Q3''' the third.

In the example given, the first folio ('''F''') and the three early quartos ('''Q1''' to '''Q3''') each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by [[G. R. Hibbard]]. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.

This format has been used for critical apparatuses of [[Shakespeare]] and many other authors. In [[variorum]] editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford ''Complete Works'' breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.

In the United States, bibliographer [[Fredson Bowers]] established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.

==Bible==
The first printed edition of the [[New Testament]] with ''critical apparatus'', noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for "received text"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' ("now received by all").

==Electronic representation==
The de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html&lt;/ref&gt; While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format.&lt;ref&gt; See also James Cummings, "[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-6-6&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-6-6&amp;brand=9781405148641_brand The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature]" in 'A Companion to Digital Literary Studies', ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8493">'''Developmental editing''' is a form of writing support that comes into play before or during the production of a publishable manuscript, especially in the area of [[Non-fiction|non-fiction writing]]. As explained by Scott Norton in his book ''Developmental editing: a handbook for freelancers, authors, and publishers'', developmental editing involves "significant structuring or restructuring of a manuscript's discourse".&lt;ref name="DevEdit" /&gt; Developmental editors are a type of [[language professional]].

==The work of developmental editors==
A developmental editor may guide an author (or group of authors) in conceiving the topic, planning the overall structure, and developing an outline—and may coach authors in their writing, chapter by chapter. This is true developmental editing, but not the most common way of working.&lt;ref name="DevEdit" /&gt; More commonly, a developmental editor is engaged only after someone (usually the publisher) decides that the authors' draft requires substantial revision and restructuring. In these cases, developmental editing is a radical form of substantive editing.&lt;ref name="DefiningEdit" /&gt;

Irrespective of when the developmental editor is brought into a writing project, authors retain control over the document and are responsible for providing the content. An editor who creates significant amounts of content is no longer an editor but a contributing author or a [[ghostwriter]].&lt;ref name="DevEdit" /&gt;

==Textbooks==
[[Textbook]]s represent one book genre in which developmental editors are involved from the beginning, and often serve as the book's project manager.&lt;ref name="PatBrewer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt;  Their role is fundamental in textbook publishing because it is often the publisher, not the author, who decides on the book's content, scope, and level. Thus, developmental editors are often on staff at scholastic publishing houses.&lt;ref name="UChicago" /&gt; In textbook publishing, the developmental editor may be responsible for creating the outline to guide the author's writing—and may also prepare short parts of text, such as legends, exercises, and supporting materials.&lt;ref name="PatBrewer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; Furthermore, the editor manages text length, edits the developing manuscript, and may instruct an artist regarding illustrations.&lt;ref name="IntBookPub" /&gt;

==In the setting of academic research==
In the academic research setting, career advancement and funding depend on the number and quality of published papers. However, not all researchers are naturally skilled writers, especially among those in the hard and clinical sciences, and many do not receive formal training in how to write the specific [[genre]] of the [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|research paper]]. These researchers can benefit from a [[language professional]] such as a teacher of academic writing or an [[Author editing|authors' editor]] who provides substantive editing. In extreme cases, when the drafted manuscript does not match the genre and requires substantial restructuring before being able to meet readers' and peer reviewers' expectations, the language professional may offer developmental editing; however certain professional and ethical issues must be considered.&lt;ref name="CollabWrite" /&gt;

There are two main situations when developmental editing in the research setting can be useful.&lt;ref name="CollabWrite" /&gt; First, researchers may recognize their inability to produce a manuscript with reasonable chances of passing peer review in their target journal; they may contact a language professional for assistance and guidance during the writing process. In addition, researchers whose manuscript has suffered multiple rejections&lt;ref name="MultiRej" /&gt; from different journals may seek help resolving the complex issues raised by peer reviewers. In both cases, the type of writing support goes beyond [[author editing]] and becomes a form of academic [[mentoring]]. Mentoring programs using a developmental editing approach to teach scholarly writing skills have been offered, for example, by an international education journal&lt;ref name="Compare" /&gt; and at a US medical school.&lt;ref name="CMP" /&gt; Developmental editing is also at the heart of [[AuthorAID]], a program that matches authors from the developing world with experienced scientist mentors and professional editors to improve the dissemination of knowledge from poor countries.&lt;ref name="AuthorAid" /&gt;

Whether the language professional is an authors' editor, a teacher of academic writing, or a translator, the particularly challenging situation requires developmental editing alongside other writing support services (e.g., education about good writing practices, translation, and linguistic editing). Language professionals who support such novice researcher-authors know to perform editorial—not authorial—duties, so they avoid [[ghost writing]] if [[authorship]] is not wanted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">The '''Edinburgh Film Guild (EFG)''' is a [[film society]] based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. Founded in 1929, it is notable as the oldest continually running film society in the world. Though pre-dated by the original (London) Film Society, founded five years earlier, it has outlasted it, with the Film Society having ceased operation in 1939. The EFG is also of note for having established the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] in 1947.

According to Scottish [[Film theory|film theorist]] and documentarian [[John Grierson]] the EFG was of particular importance for promoting a wide view of [[film|cinema]]. Writing in 1951 he commented:

"The old London Film Society was the first to break from somewhat exclusive attention to the [[avant-garde]] and take the longer and harder way of the [[Russia]]ns and more purposive users of the cinema. But it was the Edinburgh Film Guild which completed the movement - as the London Film Society did not - and saw the infinite variety of a Film Society's obligations to all categories of the medium".&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghfilmguild.org.uk/about.php Article about the history of the Edinburgh Film Guild]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1980 the EFG has been based in the Filmhouse Cinema in Lothian Road, Edinburgh, where it has its clubrooms, [[office]]s and cinema.

Run by volunteers on a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] basis, the EFG screens films three days a week from late September through to April. The programme is organised on the basis of mini-seasons linked by some common element, of [[Film director|director]], [[performer]], country, [[genre]] or theme.

Since 2005 the EFG has hosted the bi-annual Edinburgh International Film Audiences Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmaudiencesconference.co.uk/ EIFAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Frederic Watts''', {{Post-nominals|post-noms=OM}} &lt;small&gt;[[Royal Academician|RA]]&lt;/small&gt; (London 23 February 1817 – 1 July 1904) was an English [[Victorian era|Victorian]] painter and sculptor associated with the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement. He said "I paint ideas, not things."&lt;ref name=ELS /&gt; Watts became famous in his lifetime for his allegorical works, such as ''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'' and ''Love and Life''. These paintings were intended to form part of an epic symbolic cycle called the "House of Life", in which the emotions and aspirations of life would all be represented in a universal symbolic language.

== Life ==
Watts was born in [[Marylebone]], London on the birthday of [[George Frederic Handel]] (after whom he was named), to the second wife of a poor piano-maker. Delicate in health and with his mother dying while he was still young, he was home-schooled by his father in a conservative interpretation of Christianity as well as via the classics such as the ''[[Iliad]].''  The former put him off conventional religion for life, while the latter was a continual influence on his art. He showed artistic promise very early, learning sculpture from the age of 10 with [[William Behnes]], starting to devotedly study the [[Elgin Marbles]] (later writing "It was from them alone that I learned") and then enrolling as a student at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] at the age of 18. He first exhibited at the Academy in 1837.&lt;ref name=ELS&gt;[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward.]] (1972) ''Symbolist Art''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 47. {{ISBN|0-500-20125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also began his portraiture career, receiving patronage from his close contemporary [[Alexander Constantine Ionides]], who later came to be a close friend.

He came to the public eye with a drawing entitled ''Caractacus'', which was entered for a competition to design murals for the new [[Palace of Westminster#Frescoes|Houses of Parliament]] at [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] in 1843. Watts won a first prize in the competition, which was intended to promote narrative paintings on patriotic subjects, appropriate to the nation's legislature. In the end Watts made little contribution to the Westminster decorations, but from it he conceived his vision of a building covered with murals representing the spiritual and social evolution of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;The complex history surrounding the decoration is best summarized by
[[T. S. R. Boase]], ''The Decorations of the New Palace of Westminster 1841–1863'', in: ''Journal of the [[Warburg Institute|Warburg]] and [[Courtauld Institute|Courtauld]] Institutes'' 17:1954, pp. 319–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize from the Westminster competition did, however, fund a long visit to Italy from 1843 onwards, where Watts stayed and became friends with the British ambassador [[Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland]] and his wife [[Augusta Fox, Baroness Holland|Augusta]] at their homes in [[Casa Feroni]] and the [[Villa Careggi]]. Also while in Italy Watts began producing landscapes and was inspired by [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel]] and [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]'s [[Scrovegni Chapel]]. In 1847, while still in Italy, Watts entered a new competition for the Houses of Parliament with his image of [[Alfred the Great]], ''Alfred Inciting the Saxons to Prevent the Landing of the Danes by Encountering them at Sea'', on a patriotic subject but using [[Phideas|Phidean]] inspiration. Leaving Florence in April 1847 for what was intended to be a brief return to London, he ended up staying. Back in Britain he was unable to obtain a building in which to carry out his plan of a grand fresco based on his Italian experiences, though he did produce a 45&amp;nbsp;ft by 40&amp;nbsp;ft fresco on the upper part of the east wall of the Great Hall of [[Lincoln's Inn]] entitled ''Justice, A Hemicycle of Lawgivers'' (completed 1859), inspired by [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]''. In consequence most of his major works are conventional oil paintings, some of which were intended as studies for the House of Life.

In his studio he met [[Henry Thoby Prinsep]] (for 16 years a member of the [[Council of India]]) and his wife Sara (née Pattle). Watts thus joined the [[Prinsep]] circle of [[bohemianism|bohemians]], including Sara's seven sisters (including Virginia, with whom Watts fell in love but who married [[Charles Somers-Cocks, 3rd Earl Somers|Charles, Viscount Eastnor]] in 1850), and [[Julia Margaret Cameron]]. Previously staying at 48 Cambridge Street, and then in Mayfair, in 1850 he helped the Prinseps into a 21-year lease on [[Little Holland House]], and stayed there with them and their [[salon (gathering)|salon]] for the next 21 years. (The building was the dower house on the Hollands' London estate in [[Kensington]], near the house of [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Lord Leighton]].)

One of only two pupils Watts ever accepted was Henry's son [[Valentine Cameron Prinsep]]; the other was [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]] – both remained friends, but neither became a major artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbTd5_RuzisC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22virginia+woolf%22+%22john+prinsep%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=8MIvC8zgm2&amp;sig=E6CiJ7PMAQLCKzCra2kdZMiMOg0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result|title=Clouds}}&lt;/ref&gt; While living as tenant at Little Holland House, Watts's epic paintings were exhibited in [[Whitechapel]] by his friend the social reformer Canon [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel Barnett]], and he finally received a commission for the Houses of Parliament, completing his ''The Triumph of the Red Cross Knight'' (from ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'') in 1852–53. He also took a short trip back to Italy in 1853 (including Venice, where Titian became yet more of an inspiration) and with [[Charles Thomas Newton]] to excavate [[Halicarnassus]] in 1856–57, via Constantinople and the Greek islands.

In the 1860s, Watts' work shows the influence of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], often emphasising sensuous pleasure and rich colour. Among these paintings is a portrait of his young wife, the actress [[Ellen Terry]], who was 30 years his junior – having been introduced by mutual friend [[Tom Taylor]], they married on 20 February 1864, just seven days short of her 17th birthday. When she eloped with another man after less than a year of marriage, Watts was obliged to divorce her. Watts's association with Rossetti and the [[Aesthetic movement]] altered during the 1870s, as his work increasingly combined [[Classicism|Classical]] traditions with a deliberately agitated and troubled surface, to suggest the dynamic energies of life and evolution, as well as the tentative and transitory qualities of life. These works formed part of a revised version of the House of Life, influenced by the ideas of [[Max Müller]], the founder of [[comparative religion]]. Watts hoped to trace the evolving "mythologies of the races [of the world]" in a grand synthesis of spiritual ideas with modern science, especially [[Darwinian]] evolution.
[[File:Assistants and George Frederic Watts - Hope - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'', painted in 1886 and given to the nation in 1897]]

With the lease on Little Holland House nearing its end and the building soon to be demolished, in the early 1870s he commissioned a new London home nearby from [[C. R. Cockerell]]: New Little Holland House (backing onto the estate of Lord Leighton), and acquired a house at [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight]] – his friends [[Julia Margaret Cameron]] and [[Lord Tennyson]] already had homes on the island. To maintain his friendship with the Prinsep family as their children began leaving home, he built The Briary for them near Freshwater, and adopted their relative [[Blanche Clogstoun]]. In 1877, his [[decree nisi]] from Ellen Terry finally came through, and the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] was opened by his friend [[Coutts Lindsay]]. This was to prove his ideal venue for the next ten years.

In 1886, at the age of 69, Watts remarried, to [[Mary Fraser Tytler]], a Scottish designer and potter, then aged 36. In 1891 he bought land near [[Compton, Guildford|Compton]], south of [[Guildford]], in [[Surrey]]. The couple named the house "Limnerslease" (combining the words "limner" or artist with "leasen" or glean) and built the [[Watts Gallery]] nearby, a museum dedicated to his work – the first (and now the only) purpose-built gallery in Britain devoted to a single artist – which opened in April 1904, shortly before his death, and received a major expansion between 2006 and 2011.

Watts's wife Mary had designed the nearby earlier [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]], which Watts paid for; he also painted a version of ''[[The All-Pervading]]'' for the [[altar]] only three months before he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compton-surrey.co.uk/#/wattschapel/4518411494|title=Watts Chapel|publisher=compton-surrey.co.uk|accessdate=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Limnerslease and the chapel are now maintained, and the house owned, by the Watts Gallery. In 2016 Watts' studio in the house re-opened, restored as far as possible using photographs from Watts' lifetime, as part of the Watts Gallery, and the main residential section can be visited on a guided tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wattsgallery.org.uk/en-gb/about-us/artists-village/watts-studios/|title=Watts Studios – Watts Gallery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his paintings are owned by [[Tate Britain]] – he donated 18 of his symbolic paintings to Tate in 1897, and three more in 1900. Some of these have been loaned to the Watts Gallery in recent years, and are on display there.

Refusing the baronetcy twice offered him by [[Queen Victoria]], he was elected as an Academician to the Royal Academy in 1867 and accepted to be one of the original members of the new [[Order of Merit]] (OM) in 1902 – in his own words, on behalf of all English artists. The order was announced in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he received the insignia from King [[Edward VII]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 8 August 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36842| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27470|page=5679|date=2 September 1902|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his late paintings, Watts' creative aspirations mutate into mystical images such as ''The Sower of the Systems'', in which Watts seems to anticipate [[abstract art]]. This painting depicts God as a barely visible shape in an energised pattern of stars and nebulae. Some of Watts' other late works also seem to anticipate the paintings of [[Picasso's Blue Period]]. He was also admired as a portrait painter. His portraits were of the most important men and women of the day, intended to form a "House of Fame". Many of these are now in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]: 17 were donated in 1895, with more than 30 more added subsequently. In his portraits Watts sought to create a tension between disciplined stability and the power of action. He was also notable for emphasising the signs of strain and wear on his sitter's faces. Sitters included [[Charles Dilke]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] , [[James Martineau]], and [[William Morris]].

'''''Physical Energy'''''

Although best known as a painter, G F Watts was also a renowned sculptor. He began work on the plaster model for ''Physical Energy'' (Watts Gallery) around 1883 and was still working on it at the time of his death in 1904. In that year the first bronze cast of the work became the artist’s last submission to the Royal Academy’s summer exhibition. It marked a new prominence for the courtyard of Burlington House as a site for dramatic contemporary sculpture, a role continued today by the Annenberg Courtyard.''Physical Energy'' is an allegory of the human need for new challenges – of our instinct to always be scanning the horizon, looking towards the future. In the artist’s own words, it is ‘a symbol of that restless physical impulse to seek the still unachieved in the domain of material things’.

Physical Energy was the culmination of Watts’s ambition in the field of public sculpture, embodying the artist’s belief that access to great art would bring immense benefits to the country at large. Having completed a commission for the Duke of Westminster for an equestrian monument to commemorate his ancestor, Hugh Lupus, in 1883 G F Watts set to work on a new plaster model of another horse and rider, without specific reference to any individual. Reinvigorating the rhetoric of the equestrian monument for the modern age, Watts conceived Physical Energy as an allegory of human vitality and humanity’s ceaseless struggle for betterment.

The plaster model of Physical Energy was part of the artist’s bequest to Watts Gallery upon his death in 1904. The first bronze cast of the model, made in 1902, was exhibited in the courtyard of the Royal Academy in 1904, as part of the annual Summer Exhibition. It then travelled to Cape Town to form part of a memorial to the founder of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Cecil Rhodes. In 1907, a posthumous cast was made and sited in Kensington Gardens, London, fulfilling the artist’s intention to gift the work to the British Government, insisting that it should be ‘for the nation’ and displayed ‘somewhere in London’. A third cast, created in 1959, is situated in the grounds of the National Archives of Zimbabwe in Harare.

An admirer of royalty – he had painted [[François d'Orléans, Prince of Joinville|Prince de Joinville]] and [[Edward VII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] – Watts proposed, in 1887, to commemorate the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]] by creating a Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice to commemorate ordinary people who had died saving the lives of others, and who might otherwise have been forgotten. The scheme was not accepted at that time, but in 1898 Watts was approached by [[Henry Gamble]], the vicar of [[St Botolph's Aldersgate]] church. He suggested the memorial could be created in [[Postman's Park]] in the [[City of London]].

The memorial was unveiled in an unfinished state in 1900, consisting of a 50-foot (15&amp;nbsp;m) wooden loggia designed by Ernest George, sheltering a wall with space for 120 ceramic memorial tiles to be designed and made by [[William De Morgan]]. At the time of opening, only four of the memorial tiles were in place. Watts died in 1904, and his widow Mary Watts took over the running of the project.

== Reception ==
Several reverent biographies of Watts were written shortly after his death. With the emergence of [[Modernism]], however, his reputation declined. [[Virginia Woolf]]'s comic play ''Freshwater'' portrays him in a satirical manner, an approach also adopted by [[Wilfrid Jasper Walter Blunt|Wilfred Blunt]], former curator of the Watts Gallery, in his irreverent 1975 biography ''England's Michelangelo''. In his 1988 book on [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], the art critic [[Peter Fuller]] emphasised Watts's spiritual and stylistic importance, also noting that late post-symbolist works such as ''The Sower of the Systems'' "stretched beyond the brink of abstraction".&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Peter. ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace''. London, Chatto and Windus, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; On the centenary of his death Veronica Franklin Gould published ''G.F. Watts: The Last Great Victorian'', a positive study of his life and work.

The composer [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] wrote his Sixth Symphony "In Memoriam G. F. Watts". It was composed in 1905 and first performed on 18 January 1906 in London under Stanford's direction. The four movements, although not having a detailed programme, are inspired by several works of art by Watts.

Literary references to Watts and his work include [[Elizabeth Taylor (novelist)|Elizabeth Taylor]]'s 1953 novel ''[[Angel (novel)|Angel]]'', where a picture by Watts is donated to a provincial museum by the protagonist, and mention of Watts' painting "Progress" in ''Bella Donna'' by [[Robert Smythe Hichens|Robert Hichens]] (1909, p.&amp;nbsp;34). Watts features (not altogether favourably) as a character in [[Lynne Truss]]'s comic novel ''Tennyson's Gift'' (1996).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8819">'''Hainteny''' (pronounced {{IPA-mg|hajnˈtenʲ|}}, [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] for "knowledge of words") is a traditional form of [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] [[oral literature]] and [[poetry]],  involving heavy use of [[metaphor]]. It is associated primarily with the [[Merina]] people of [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;Houlder, J.A. (1929). ''Ohabolana, or Malagasy Proverbs, Illustrating the Wit and Wisdom of the Hova of Madagascar.'' Antananarivo: Friends' Foreign Missionary Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In its use of metaphor and allusion it resembles another type of poetry, the [[Malay language|Malay]] [[pantun]], and Fox&lt;ref&gt;Fox, L. (trans.). (1990). ''Hainteny, the Traditional Poetry of Madagascar.'' Lewisburg, PA: Bucknell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests "it seems likely the Merina brought with them a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] poetic tradition" to Madagascar. The [[Ibonia]], an epic poem related for centuries in different versions across Madagascar, reflects the value placed on the linguistic skills celebrated in the hainteny tradition, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Ibonia: the text in 17 sections |last = Unknown |publisher = University of Virginia | accessdate = November 15, 2010 |url = http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Public/Ibonia/text.html |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/604h5KUmV |archivedate = July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Collections of hainteny were first gathered in print form on the orders of Queen [[Ranavalona I]] in the 19th century. The [[France|French]] writer [[Jean Paulhan]], who stayed in Madagascar from 1908 to 1910, made an intensive study of the hainteny and published a book of translations in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Paulhan, J. (1913). ''Les Hainteny merina.'' Paris: Geuthner.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hainteny often incorporates '''ohabolana''' (proverbs) and '''kabary''' (public discourse).  Both of these two oral traditions remain integral parts of Malagasy daily life, where they are pronounced at such events as weddings, funerals, births and [[famadihana]] and constitute an essential component of [[hiragasy]] performances.  They may also include ''angano'' (folktales and fables), ''tantara'' (historical narratives) or ''ankamantatra'' (riddles).&lt;ref&gt;Peek, P. and Yankah, K. (2004). "Malagasy Folklore and its Study." In ''African Folklore: an Encyclopedia.'' New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These diverse Malagasy oral traditions were advanced in the 20th century by such artists as [[Jean Joseph Rabearivelo]], who is considered Africa's first modern poet,&lt;ref&gt;Rabearivelo (2007), p. x&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elie Rajaonarison]], an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Auzias &amp; Labourdette (2007), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ohabolana ==
"Proverb" offers a weak approximation of the meaning of '''ohabolana''', which constitute no less than concise expressions of the Malagasy philosophical worldview.  While the exact number of existing ohabolana is unknown, the largest published collection includes over 6,500 of them relating to all aspects of life and particularly the human condition.  Fox has described ohabolana as constituting "a universal philosophy of life that transcends its Malagasy context and merits admiration as one of man's noble attempts to construct a valid moral and philosophical framework for his existence."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, L. (1990). ''Hainteny: the traditional poetry of Madagascar.'' London: Associated University Presses. (p. 37)&lt;/ref&gt; Ohabolana are not the property of a particular class but are rather at the disposition of anyone who finds a salient application of a particular expression to a given situation.  Their form persists unchanged from ancient times even when grammar and syntax of contemporary speech have since evolved because, as Fox notes, altering an ohabolana would constitute disregard for the venerated ancestors who are their originators.  Ohabolana are characteristically brief, metaphorical, symmetrical in pattern and syntax.&lt;br&gt;
Examples:&lt;ref&gt;Sibree, J. &amp; Baron, R. (Eds.). (1893).''The Antananarivo annual and Madagascar magazine.'' 5(17)&amp;mdash;Part 1. Antananarivo: L.M.S. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{quote|''Manasa lamba be tseroka; na madio aza, mangarahara.''&amp;mdash;Washing a very dirty dress: even though it gets clean, it becomes full of holes.&lt;br&gt;
''Ny tsiny toy ny rivotra: mikasika ny tena, fa tsy hita tarehy.''&amp;mdash;Blame is like the wind: felt but not seen.&lt;br&gt;
''Ny voky tsy mahaleo ny tsaroana.''&amp;mdash;A good belly-full doesn't equal a kind remembrance.&lt;br&gt;
''Aza asesiky ny fitia tanteraka, ka tsy mahalala ny ranonorana ho avy.''&amp;mdash;Don't be so much in love that you can't tell when the rain is coming.}}

== Kabary ==
The tradition of '''kabary''' in Madagascar, which predates Merina King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787&amp;ndash;1810), nonetheless owes much of its modern form, usage and meaning to standards set at his court.  Kabary is a highly stylized form of speech that has formed an important part of Malagasy culture for centuries. One who speaks kabary is known as ''mpikabary''.  Skill in this form of ceremonial public speaking&amp;mdash;in which ''ohabolana'' proverbs play a privileged role&amp;mdash;is highly esteemed and one who shows himself to be a ''tompon'ny kabary'' (master of kabary) enjoys a higher level of respect and even authority. According to the classic collection of Malagasy folklore ''"[[Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara]]"'' the right to rule could even be determined by one's eloquence and skills in kabary, to the point where ''tompon'ny kabary'' and sovereign become interchangeable concepts:
{{quote|We understand therein the function of the kabary:&lt;br&gt;
there is a master of the words,&lt;br&gt;
there is somebody who answers.&lt;br&gt;
It is the master of the words who rules the kingdom;&lt;br&gt;
As for the one who answers to the kabary,
it is the public acknowledgment of his submission.&lt;ref&gt;Ottino, P. (1983). Ancient Malagasy Dynastic Succession: The Merina Example.  ''History in Africa, 10'', 247&amp;ndash;292. (''"Dia hita eo ny fomban'ny kabary: 
misy tompon'ny teny,
dia misy mamaly.
Izay tompon'ny teny no mitondra ny fanjakana;
ary ny olona kosa mamaly kabary, 
fanehoana fa mpanoa."'' p. 261)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kabary forms an integral part of numerous important social ceremonies, including marriage, [[famadihana]], [[circumcision]] and burial.  By choosing to use the kabary speech style, a speaker can render any situation more formal and ceremonial, such as can happen when expressing condolences, offering thanks, formally addressing a gathering or giving a political address.  To this day, skill in kabary can play a deciding role in the success of a Malagasy politician's career.

Kabary may be delivered by two or more mpikabary at the same occasion, and each one generally was nominated by and represents a portion of the audience present, as during [[hiragasy]] performances.  When this happens, kabary speech can take on somewhat competitive overtones as the speakers attempt to demonstrate their superior skills. The mpikabary typically addresses himself to the audience of his opponent, and while direct confrontation is generally frowned upon in polite society in the Highlands of Madagascar, if an opponent mpikabary makes an error in the form of the kabary or misstates an ohabolana, this is commonly pointed out in an indirect or delicate manner as evidence of greater mastery.  The use of indirect language such as proverbs is viewed as the more challenging, adult manner of speaking and demonstrates skill, while direct criticism, bluntness, hateful speech or anything that causes loss of face to the audience or a rival speaker is censured and despised as lacking in skill.  Kabary is generally the domain of men and not women, because women are believed and expected to speak in a more straightforward way&amp;mdash;including the expression of anger that can cause loss of face to the speaker&amp;mdash;while men are expected to preserve face by taking the time to choose their words carefully when speaking to others.  Nonetheless, some women may exceptionally engage in kabary (for instance, all queens), although men represent the vast majority of mpikabary.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, E. (1998).

== Woodblock printing ==
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]]), which is widely seen as the earliest extant printed book]]

Traditionally, there have been two main printing techniques in Asia: woodblock printing ([[xylography]]) and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Fifty Wonders of Korea"&gt;Fifty Wonders of Korea: Volume 1. Seoul: Samjung Munhwasa, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9797263-1-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest specimen of woodblock printing on paper, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them, was discovered in 1974 in an excavation of [[Xi'an]] (then called [[Chang'an]], the capital of Tang China), [[Shaanxi]], China.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;Pan, Jixing. "On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries", in ''Chinese Science Bulletin'', 1997, Vol. 42, No. 12: 976–981. ISSN 1001-6538. Pages 979&amp;ndash;980.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[dharani]]'' sutra printed on [[hemp]] paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt; Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang dynasty has also been found, the Saddharmapunṇḍarīka sutra or [[Lotus Sutra]] printed from 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt;

[[File:Dharani sutra.jpg|thumb|The Pure Light Dharani Sutra is the world's oldest surviving woodblock print.]]

In [[Korea]], an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the [[Buddhist]] [[Dharani Sutra]] called the [[Pure Light Dharani Sutra]] ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}), discovered in [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]] in a [[Silla]] dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751 AD,&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=149,150}}&lt;/ref&gt; was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the [[Seokgatap|Shakyamuni Pagoda]] of [[Bulguk Temple]], Kyongju Province in 751 AD.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Keith|title=Everlasting Flower: A History of Korea|date=August 15, 2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn= 978-1861893352|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000593746&amp;danrak_no=&amp;clss_cd=&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000808 Early Printing in Korea.

Rightreading.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/7.htm North Korea - Silla. Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; The document is estimated to have been created no later than 704 AD.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150" /&gt;

=== The printing process ===

The manuscript is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed sheets of paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which a thin layer of rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four proof-readings are normally required – the transcript, the corrected transcript, first sample print from block and after any corrections have been made. A small correction to a block can be made by cutting a small notch and hammering in a wedge-shaped piece of wood. Larger errors require an inlay. After this the block is washed to remove any refuse.

To print, the block is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round horsehair inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then laid on the block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done on one side of the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.

Sample copies were sometimes made in red or blue, but black ink was always used for production. It is said that a skilled printer could produce as many as 1500 or 2000 double sheets in a day. Blocks can be stored and reused when extra copies are needed. 15,000 prints can be taken from a block with a further 10,000 after touching up.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spread of printing in East Asia ===
Printing started in China in 593 AD.&lt;ref name="minnesota-china.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213025/http://www.minnesota-china.com/education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was promoted by the spread of Buddhism.
 
The Buddhist scroll known as the "Great Dharani Sutra of Immaculate and Pure Light" or "Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra" ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}) is currently the oldest surviving woodblock print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|title=Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra|publisher=National Museum of Korea|accessdate=17 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001405/http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/736|title=Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple|publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Korea before the year 751 A.D. during the Silla Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt; This Darani Sutra was found inside the Seokga Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, Korea. Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju in October 1966 within the seokgatap (释迦塔) while dismantling the tower to repair much of the sari was found with the prints. One row of the darani gyeongmun 8-9 are printed in the form of a roll. [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was printed between 1011 and 1082. It is the world's most comprehensive and oldest intact version of Buddhist canon. A reprint in 1237–51 used 81,258 blocks of magnolia wood, carved on both sides, which are still kept almost intact at [[Haeinsa]]. A printing office was established in the National Academy in 1101 and the [[Goryeo]] government collection numbered several tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=323–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], one thousand copies of the [[Lotus sutra]] were printed in 1009 as a pious work, not intended to be read and therefore legibility was not so important. The spread of printing outside Buddhist circles didn't develop until the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=338–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The westward movement of printing started from eastern [[Turkestan]] where printing in the [[Uyghur language]] appeared in about 1300, though the page numbers and descriptions are in Chinese. Both blocks and moveable type printing has been discovered at [[Turfan]] as well as several hundred wooden type for Uighur. After the [[Mongol]]s conquered Turfan, a great number of Uighurs were recruited into the Mongol army and after the Mongols incorporated [[Persia]] in the middle of the 13th century, paper money was printed in [[Tabriz]] in 1294, following the Chinese system. The [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani#Book transmission: printing and translation|first description of the Chinese printing system]] was made by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in 1301–11 in his history of the world.

Some fifty pieces of printed matter have been found in [[Egypt]] printed between 900 and 1300 in black ink on paper by the rubbing method in the Chinese style. Although there is no transmission evidence, experts believe there is a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, 1955, pp 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the print scholar [[A. Hyatt Mayor]], "it was the Chinese who really discovered the means of communication that was to dominate until our age."&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos. 1–4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both woodblock and movable type printing were replaced in the second half of the 19th century by [[Typography|western-style printing]], initially [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;
"The phase of technological development that distinguished China's and particularly Shanghai's early Westernized printing industry was that involving lithography."

== Movable type ==
{{Further|Movable type}}

=== Ceramic movable type in China ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;Man, John. ''The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world'' (c) 2002 Headline Book Publishing, a division of Hodder Headline, London. {{ISBN|0-7472-4504-5}}. A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

:When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

:For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

:If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

In 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂杂记》).&lt;ref name="Yinong"&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐忆农《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay type printing was practiced in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001, p22&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1844 there were still books printed in China with ceramic movable types.&lt;ref name="Yinong" /&gt;

=== Wooden movable type in China ===
Wooden movable type was also first developed around 1040 AD by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051), as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), but was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = [[Dream Pool Essays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德县志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; In 1322，a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (马称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed 43 volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大学衍义》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版丛书》) was printed with 253500 wooden movable type on order of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and completed in one year.

A number of books printed in [[Tangut script]] during the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227) period are known, of which the ''[[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]]'' that was discovered in the ruins of [[Baisigou Square Pagoda]] in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]] (1139–1193).&lt;ref name="zhang-yuzhen-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zhang Yuzhen (张玉珍) |title=世界上现存最早的木活字印本—宁夏贺兰山方塔出土西夏文佛经《吉祥遍至口和本续》介绍 |trans-title=The world's oldest extant book printed with wooden movable type |journal=Library and Information (《图书与情报》) |year=2003 |issue=1 |url=http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |issn=1003-6938 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150528/http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展国博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular difficulty posed the logistical problems of handling the several thousand [[logograph]]s whose command is required for full literacy in [[Middle Chinese|Chinese language]]. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one was to use movable type for multitudes of the same document, the speed of printing would be relatively quicker.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces.

=== Metal movable type in China ===
Bronze movable type printing was invented in China no later than the 12th century, according to at least 13 material finds in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/ 韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步]&lt;/ref&gt; in large scale bronze plate printing of paper money and formal official documents issued by [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti counterfeit markers. Such paper money printing might date back to the 11th-century  [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, ''A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001'', pp. 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:五贯宝卷.jpg|thumb|right|Copperplate of 1215–1216 5000-[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|cash]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] [[paper money]] with bronze movable type counterfeit markers]]
The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed "check" of Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money has different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper money dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' for the purpose of preventing counterfeit; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole, apparently the associated copper metal type was lost.

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.{{clarify |reason = which others? names of cultures please. It beats saying "among others..." |date = February 2012}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages, a strong evidence that the books were printed in China.&lt;ref name="TsienACH"&gt;''Chinese Paper and Printing, A Cultural History'', by Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]
During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Hua Sui]] in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574 the massive 1000 volume encyclopedia [[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]] (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) were printed with bronze movable type.

In 1725, the [[Qing dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name="TsienACH" /&gt;

=== Metal movable type in Korea ===

The transition from wood type to movable metal type occurred in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, some time in the 13th century, to meet the heavy demand for both religious and secular books. A set of ritual books, ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'' were printed with movable metal type in 1234.&lt;ref name="christensen"&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. Unlike the metal punch system thought to be used by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], the Koreans used a sand-casting method. The following description of the Korean font casting process was recorded by the [[Joseon]] dynasty scholar Song Hyon (15th century):

:''At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy &lt;nowiki&gt;[clay]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters &lt;nowiki&gt;[molds]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative molds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While metal movable type printing was developed in Korea and the oldest extant metal print book had been printed in Korea,&lt;ref name="available online"&gt;Michael Twyman, ''The British Library Guide to Printing: History and Techniques'', London: The British Library, 1998 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0802081797&amp;id=KXoaalwyOjAC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=korea+gutenberg+surviving&amp;sig=4QBhy9ty1jbXJASJcUzFBDfKbGo available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Korea never witnessed a printing revolution comparable to Europe's:

:''Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.''&lt;ref&gt;Sohn, Pow-Key, "Early Korean Printing", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April–June  1959), pp.&amp;nbsp;96–103 (103).&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for two hundred years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable type invention in Europe&amp;mdash;when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters called [[Hangul]] for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible.

=== Movable type in Japan ===
Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a Western [[movable type]] [[printing-press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], printing equipment&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;[[Richard Douglas Lane|Lane, Richard]] (1978). ''Images of the Floating World''. Old Saybrook, CT: Konecky &amp; Konecky. P.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; brought back by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army in 1593 from Korea had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming ''[[shōgun]]'', effected the creation of the first native movable type,&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.

An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598 using metal moveable type printing equipment at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writings would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, George (1961).

== Comparison of woodblock and movable type in East Asia ==
[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|China Block Printing Museum in [[Yangzhou]]]]

Despite the introduction of movable type from the 11th century, printing using woodblocks remained dominant in East Asia until the introduction of [[lithography]] and [[photolithography]] in the 19th century. To understand this it is necessary to consider both the nature of the language and the economics of printing.

Given that the Chinese language does not use an alphabet it was usually necessary for a set of type to contain 100,000 or more blocks, which was a substantial investment. Common characters need 20 or more copies, and rarer characters only a single copy. In the case of wood, the characters were either produced in a large block and cut up, or the blocks were cut first and the characters cut afterwards. In either case the size and height of the type had to be carefully controlled to produce pleasing results. To handle the typesetting, Wang Zhen used revolving tables about 2m in diameter in which the characters were divided according to the five tones and the rhyme sections according to the official book of rhymes. The characters were all numbered and one man holding the list called out the number to another who would fetch the type.

This system worked well when the run was large. Wang Zhen's initial project to produce 100 copies of a 60,000 character gazetteer of the local district was produced in less than a month. But for the smaller runs typical of the time it was not such an improvement. A reprint required resetting and re-proofreading, unlike the wooden block system where it was feasible to store the blocks and reuse them. Individual wooden characters didn't last as long as complete blocks. When metal type was introduced it was harder to produce aesthetically pleasing type by the direct carving method.

It is unknown whether metal movable types used from the late 15th century in China were cast from moulds or carved individually. Even if they were cast, there were not the economies of scale available with the small number of different characters used in an alphabetic system. The wage for engraving on bronze was many times that for carving characters on wood and a set of metal type might contain 200,000–400,000 characters. Additionally, the ink traditionally used in Chinese printing, typically composed of pine soot bound with glue, didn't work well with the tin originally used for type.

As a result of all this, movable type was initially used by government offices which needed to produce large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally. But small local printers often found that wooden blocks suited their needs better.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

== Mechanical presses ==

Mechanical presses as used in [[Europe]]an printing remained unknown in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;printing. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 5, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]].&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, printing remained an unmechanized, laborious process with pressing the back of the paper onto the inked block by manual "rubbing" with a hand tool.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt; In Korea, the first printing presses were introduced as late as 1881–83,&lt;ref&gt;Albert A. Altman, "Korea's First Newspaper: The Japanese Chosen shinpo", ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 43, No. 4. (August 1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;685–696.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Melvin McGovern"&gt;Melvin McGovern, "Early Western Presses in Korea", ''Korea Journal'', 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; while in Japan, after an early but brief interlude in the 1590s,&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (34).&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg's printing press arrived in Nagasaki in 1848 on a Dutch ship.&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (33 ''et seq.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Gutenberg printing, which allowed printing on both sides of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed.&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p.&amp;nbsp;64–127 , Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963. {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.

There has been a long-standing '''influence of [[French language|French]] on [[English language|English]],''' in terms of [[syntax]], [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], spelling and pronunciation.

Most French vocabulary that entered English occurred after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 and the establishment of a French-speaking administration. French became the language of the court, the administration and the elites for several centuries, until after the [[Hundred Years War]]. English has been constantly influenced by French from that time till present day.
According to Laura K. Lawless, more than a third of the current [[English vocabulary]] is of French origin.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm |website=french.about.com |title=Terms of Enrichment: How French Has Influenced English |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216063051/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm# |archive-date=2016-12-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist [[Henriette Walter]], words of French origin represent more than two thirds of the English vocabulary. It is estimated by linguist Anthony Lacoudre that over 40 000 English words are directly French and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.&lt;ref name="dailymotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&amp;#039;incroyable histoire des mots français dans la langue anglaise – Vidéo dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of French in England ==

=== Before 1066 ===
At the beginning of XIth century, the English language did not have a well-defined status. Indeed, the inhabitants of what would become [[Great Britain]] did not have a language that allowed them to communicate with each other. There were many different [[dialect]]al forms. Great Britain, in which various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] idioms had coexisted since the IVth century, had experienced partial [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] since the 1st century A.D., and this for four centuries.

From 450 onwards, the [[Saxons]], the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] and the [[Jutes]], who came from the continent, settled in the south and east. Germanic dialects would prevail in these regions, supplanting Celtic dialects, which would remain in the west and north of the island ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]]) and [[Ireland]]. In the VIIIth century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] settled on the island. Their languages, also Germanic, in turn influence the languages already present on the island. Thus, at the dawn of XIth century, the country was made up of a series of peoples with significantly different speeches, most of them Germanic, with multiple influences.

=== Norman conquest of England and its consequences ===
It is therefore a linguistically disunited people that the Normans will get massively in contact with, from 1066. [[William II of Normandy]], supported by his King, [[Philip I of France]], and his blood legitimacy to the throne of England, landed at [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], on 29 September 1066. His men are deployed around the city waiting for the king [[Harold II]]'s troops. On October 14, exhausted by the long journey to Hastings, Harold II's troops lost the battle after a day. Following the defeat of the English, Duke William II of Normandy became King of England on December 25, 1066, crowned under the name of William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. This date marks the beginning of a long period of ties between the peoples and languages.

In fact, these links already existed before the Battle of Hastings. Indeed, the geographical location of Normandy, facing the English Channel, favoured commercial contacts with England. These ties will be further strengthened at the beginning of the XIth century when the daughter of the Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], Emma, marries King [[Æthelred II of England]]. But it is really from the 1066 conquest that [[proto-English]] becomes massively impregnated with [[Old French]], then modern French. It should be noted, however, that only French will influence English in the centuries following the conquest. The reverse contribution of English to French will only be real from the XVIIIth century.

The arrival of William the Conqueror and his barons significantly changed the linguistic situation in England. [[Norman language|Norman]] is essentially imposed in the upper layers of society. The Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the circles of the court and aristocracy, justice and the Church. The influential circles, who came from Normandy and settled in England, kept their Norman mother tongue, while the more modest rural and urban strata continued to speak English.

Norman is a particular variety of the [[Gallo-Roman]] language, spoken in Normandy. It is one of the [[Oil languages]] alongside, among others, the [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. The Norman language is modified in contact with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language. It then integrates words and phrases from English and will give birth to a dialect, [[Anglo-Norman (language)|Anglo-Norman]], still spoken on the [[Anglo-Norman isles]]. Anglo-Norman can be described as a [[vernacular language]], on English soil in the XIth century, in the field of literature, culture, court and among the clergy. French was therefore, at first, spoken in England under the form of this Anglo-Norman dialect.

During the XIIth century, continental French has a greater influence on Old English. It acquires great prestige in England, especially within the aristocracy and the clergy. It becomes the language of law and justice nationwide. Rich and noble families, most of them of Norman origin, teach their children French or send them to study in France. The expansion of the French language in England was also encouraged by royal marriages. From [[Henry II Plantagenet]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] at the beginning of the century, to [[Henri VI]] and [[Marguerite of Anjou|Marguerite]] in the XVth century, all kings of England married French princesses. These marriages made French the language of the English court for several centuries and were decisive in strengthening the use of French in England. This period (XIIth-XVth centuries) is characterized by a massive influx of French words into Old English vocabulary.&lt;ref name="le-mot-juste-en-anglais"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html |title=Comment le français a influencé la langue anglaise |website=Le mot juste en anglais |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221242/https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html# |archive-date=2018-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1204, [[Philippe Auguste]] Normandy is officially annexed to the kingdom of France, politically isolating England from the continent. Normans who choose to stay in England move further away from France and, therefore, from the French language. Keeping its status as the language of justice and the language of power, England saw the first teaching manuals for teaching French to the English. These manuals were intended for English nobles who wish to perfect their knowledge of French and teach it to their children. Two types of French spoken in the higher spheres of English society can be distinguished during the XIIIth century : the Anglo-Norman dialect, which was the aristocrats' mother tongue, and a more prestigious type of French as a second language. Knowing "parisian" French was a mark of social distinction. As a language of culture, French supplanted Latin from the XIIth century onward as the language of diplomacy and worldly relations throughout Europe. The mass and influence of French literature reinforced its reputation and appeal.

=== The developing use of French ===
The [[XVIth century]], that of the [[Renaissance]], is a decisive century for French since king [[François I of France]], through the [[Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] ([[1539]]), makes French the official language of administration in the whole kingdom.
Although troubled by the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Italian Wars]], the language is marked by intellectual, technical and scientific effervescence. It ushered in an era of prosperity that would also spread to England through French.

The XVIIth century announces the apogee of the Kingdom of France. This period was characterized by the political, literary and artistic prestige of France and the French language. Peace restored and unity ensured in the country, economy grew considerably. Personalities such as the King [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], the [[Cardinal of Richelieu]] or the [[Sun King]] contribute to fixing and enhancing the French language in Europe, the Americas, India and Oceania.

The creation of the [[Académie française]] by Richelieu in 1635, under [[Louis XIII]], was a step that led to the standardization of French in continental Europe and abroad, including England. French is then the second language of all the elites in Europe, from Turkey to Ireland and from Moscow to Lisbon. The greatest scholars and intellectuals, writers and scientists, express themselves and correspond in this new standardised French. French is considered a perfect language, whose beauty and elegance are determined by the development of scientific logic, aided by dictionaries and grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/caief_0571-5865_1992_num_44_1_1775|title=Le Français face à l'anglais : aspects linguistiques|first=Michael D.|last=Picone|date=22 November 1992|publisher=|journal=Cahiers de l'Association internationale des études francaises|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9–23|doi=10.3406/caief.1992.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the XXIst Century ==
The geographical use of French has continuously and greatly diversified in the last five hundred years, with countries and states like [[New-Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tchad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Senegal]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] adopting it as their official language. This geographical diversity has led to many different contacts with [[vernacular]] dialects, regional and international languages, from which French has often been enriched locally.
In a number of countries and regions where French shares co-officiality with English (Cameroon, [[Canada]], [[Jersey]], [[Mauritius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113430/http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rwanda]], Vanuatu), particular lexical regionalisms are observed where French and English terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/articles.php?pg=850|title=Avenir de la Langue Française (ALF) - Ile Maurice|first=|last=MAR|website=www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contribution of the French lexicon to English ==
Several elements must be observed.

* Sometimes, the English words' form has kept traces of Old French, written or oral, such as certain consonants (''forest'' / forest) or certain vowels or diphthongs (''veil'' / voil; ''leisure'' / leisure), the current French sometimes deviating more from its old form than the English (i.e. Old French ''ante'' gives "tante" in modern French and is written 'aunt' in modern English).
* Many English nouns, verbs and adjectives borrowed from Old French have not always kept the meaning they had in Old French. Sometimes, they have developed a different meaning from French. In both cases, these words are [[false friend]]s (''egre'' giving 'sour' (''aigre'') in French while mutating into 'eager' in English).
* Other English words are composed of both words of French and Germanic origins (''handkerchief'': ''hand'' is from the proto-Germanic ''k'''hand'''uz'' and ''kerchief'' is a mutation on the old French ''core chief'')
* Some forms of Old French did not survive in modern French, while they still exist in English (''soulace'',''conceler'',''estriver'',''gone'').
* It is not uncommon either for an English concept to have two or even three vocabulary words to describe it, one of French origin, a part from proto-Germanic and another of Latin origin (''royal'', ''kingly'', and ''regal'' all mean the same thing, 'royal').
* Most of the English words ending in ''-ous'', ''-ty'' (on the model of ''-té''),''-tion'', ''-ture'', ''-ture'', ''-ent'' are of French origin.
* Uses in social and intellectual life, but also certain domestic and food uses, demonstrate the omnipresence of French in English society in many fields, for example the names of meat: "beef" comes from the French ''buef'' (beef), "mutton" from ''moton'' (sheep), "pork" from ''pork'', "veal" from ''vel'' (calf).
* Some words borrowed in the XIXth and XXth centuries are still considered foreign words, French words (such as ''chic''). They are generally used by educated English people or by the press and other media and are seen as part of a distinguished language.
* Some [[Anglicisms]] are actually words that were borrowed from French a long time ago and have recently been borrowed back from English (such as ''bacon'').

The following French glossary in English is in no way exhaustive. These words come as examples to illustrate the countless French words that are part of the English language.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In this section, examples of French-to-English lexical contributions are classified by field and in chronological order.

The '''International Society of Typographic Designers''' (ISTD) is a [[professional body]] run by and for [[typographers]], [[graphic designers]], and [[educators]]. The society has an international membership and its aims are to establish and maintain standards of typography and to provide a forum for debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istd.org.uk/flash_content/index.htm|title=ISTD - International Society of Typographic Designers|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ISTD was originally formed as the British Typographers' Guild (BTG) in 1928 when [[Vincent Steer]] and friends met in a Sicilian restaurant in [[Holborn]], to found the society. Steer recognized the need and the potential for the creative typographer's skills in a world where most 'design' was carried out through compositors' layouts. From his own background in printing, and the opportunity to observe the trade in America, he determined to develop the profession of typography in the UK, and to that end started the British Typographers Guild with six other like-minded founding members.&lt;ref name=steer&gt;{{cite journal|title=Facts concerning the origins of the STD|first=Vincent|last=Steer|journal=TypoGraphic|issue=2|year=1971|publisher=Society of Typographic Designers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 the guild became the Society of Typographic Designers (STD),&lt;ref name=steer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Monotype Chronicles | first = Lawrence W. | last = Wallis | url = http://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/MT1926_1933.aspx | accessdate = April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999, recognizing its influence in other countries, and at the behest of then President [[Colin Banks]], it became the International Society of Typographic Designers (ISTD).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== TypoGraphic ==
''TypoGraphic'' is the journal of the ISTD and was first published in 1971. Selected writings from 30 years of ''TypoGraphic'' were published in an anthology in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TypoGraphic Writing|isbn=0-9540127-0-4|editor-first=David|editor-last=Jury|publisher=ISTD [International Society of Typographic Designers]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete set of ''TypoGraphic'' journals is available at the [[St Bride Library]].

== ISTD International Typographic Awards ==
The ISTD runs the International Typographic Awards which are held as an appraisal of current standards in typographic design and are judged by some of today's leading graphic, interactive and typographic design specialists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awards.istd.org.uk/|publisher=ISTD [International Society of Typographic Designers]|title=ISTD Awards 2011| accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A Certificate of Excellence, awarded to all finalists, signifies a high standard of design in conjunction with a high standard of typography.
* Premier Awards, awarded to designers of outstanding submissions, are offered for work that has not only met the criteria for the award of a Certificate of Excellence, but which is also considered outstanding by a majority of the jurors.
* The winning submission, selected from all of the Premier Awards, is judged to be the most significant typographical achievement, exemplifying excellence.

The ISTD Awards are held every three years: there were awards in 2011 and 2014, and {{as of|2016|lc=yes}} the next award will be given during 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=http://www.istd.org.uk/awards|publisher=International Society of Typographic Designers|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories of membership ==

The ISTD has several categories of membership,&lt;ref name=become_a_member&gt;{{cite book|title=Become a member|publisher=ISTD [International Society of Typographic Designers]|url= http://www.istd.org.uk/flash_content/pdf/istd_membership.pdf|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; some with designatory [[postnominal]]s:

* Honorary Fellowship (HonFISTD) is awarded in recognition of outstanding typographic design work, or significant contribution to the aims of, or service to, the ISTD or the typographic industry.
* Fellowship (FISTD) is awarded in recognition of the nominee's professional standing or for their services to the ISTD.
* Membership (MISTD) is open to all practising typographers, graphic designers, and educators who show, by submission of their typographic design work, or through evidence of competence in their field of activity, that their professional ability has reached the high standard required by the ISTD.
* Student Membership is open to students who are successful in the [[#ISTD Student Assessment|Student Assessment]].
* Corporate Membership  is open to design organizations, companies, and other commercial institutions to support the ISTD.
* Institutional Membership is open to educational institutions involved in the delivery of typographic studies. This offers a range of benefits including reduced submission fees for students submitting projects for assessment and teaching materials from the ISTD education archive.

== ISTD Student Assessment ==

The annual Student Assessment, started in 1975, allows students to gain entry to the ISTD.&lt;ref name=become_a_member/&gt; This is achieved by assessment of their work applied to a rigorous brief (five new project briefs are published in October each year), and is open to those registered on a recognised full-time [[undergraduate]] or [[postgraduate]] course. Assessment is carried out by teams of practicing designers and typographic educators.

Student Assessments are held in England, Ireland, Middle East, South Africa and Australia to deal with the submissions relating to each location. These are coordinated by the ISTD Education Team under the aegis of the Education Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISTD Assessment FAQ|publisher=ISTD [International Society of Typographic Designers]|url=http://assessment.istd.org.uk/faq/|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jame Mosque of Qazvin''' ({{lang-fa|مسجد جامع عتيق قزوین}} – ''Masjid-e-Jameh Atiq Qazvin'') is one of the oldest mosques in [[Iran]], and is the grand, congregational mosque ([[Jameh Mosque]]) of [[Qazvin]], in [[Qazvin Province]], [[Iran]].

==Specifications==
The oldest part of the mosque is said to have been constructed by the orders of [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 807CE.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Later additions were made, the last being during the late [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid era]]. The double layered main dome of the mosque is from the [[Great Seljuk Empire|Seljuk era]], and is locked to the public. It houses some precious examples of relief calligraphy from medieval times. Renovations have also been carried out on many sections of the mosque.

The foundation of the mosque is laid on a [[Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In spite of the devastating [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasion, the mosque still stands today in its full glory. It is still in use. Parts of the mosque have been turned into a public library.

The mosque also contains a [[Shabestan]] and [[Ab anbar]], both now under the protection of [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization]].

Part of the mosque  got on fire January 28, 2013 and that resulted in the historic tomb to be completely destroyed.

[[File:Johnjoyce.jpg|right|200px]]
'''John Stanislaus Joyce''' (4 July 1849 &amp;ndash; 29 December 1931) was the father of writer [[James Joyce]], and a well known [[Dublin]] man about town.  The son of James and Ellen (''née'' O'Connell) Joyce, John Joyce grew up in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], where his mother's family, which claimed kinship to "Liberator" [[Daniel O'Connell]], was quite prominent.

John Joyce attended St Colman’s College, Fermoy, from 1859 and later studied medicine at The Queen’s College, Cork, from 1867. However, he did not complete his university studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=John Stanislaus Joyce: The Voluminous Life and Genius of James Joyce's Father|last=Jackson|first=John Wyse|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2008|isbn=1-85702-417-6|location=UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his father's death in 1866, John Joyce inherited substantial property around Cork, but soon after he moved to Dublin, where he worked for several years as secretary at a distillery company.   He was also noted as a fine tenor singer, although he never pursued a musical career. On 5 May 1879, Joyce married Mary "May" Murray.  The next year, because of his work supporting [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidates in the [[United Kingdom general elections|General Election]] of [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880]], Joyce was given a post in the [[Dublin Custom House]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J.W. and P. Costello (1998) ''John Stanislaus Joyce: The Voluminous Life and Genius of James Joyce's Father'', Fourth Estate Ltd, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1882, his son [[James Joyce|James]] was born, the first of ten surviving children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ellmann|Ellmann, Richard]], (1959) ''[[James Joyce (biography)|James Joyce]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], revised edition 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  From eldest to youngest, names and ages given according to the 1901 census (see link below): James Augustine (aged 19 in 1901), Margaret Alice (17), [[Stanislaus Joyce|John Stanislaus]] (16), Chales [sic] Patrick (14), George Alfred (13), Eileen (12), May Kathleen (11), Eva May (10), Florence (9) and Mabel (8). Over the next ten years, Joyce gradually ran through his property.  A supporter of [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]], Joyce was crushed by what he saw as Parnell's betrayal and death following the revelation of his adultery with [[Kitty O'Shea]].  He remained a committed Parnellite and benefited from the patronage of political colleagues in later life when he had few other sources of income.&lt;ref&gt;Fintan Lane, ‘The Parnellite connection: Daniel John Hishon and the Joyces’, James Joyce Quarterly, vol. 37, no. 1 (1999), pp 225–8.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Parnell's death in 1891, Joyce had spent most of his inheritance and had been pensioned from his post at the custom house.  A spendthrift, he proved barely able to live on the small pension that was left to him, and spent much of his time drinking. His wife died in 1903, but despite his poor management of the household, he managed to outlive her by 28 years.  He died at the age of 82, which was rather advanced given the circumstances.

Of all his children, Joyce got along well only with his eldest, James, who enjoyed his father's company and shared in some of his traits, including his musical talent and his inability with money.  John Joyce inspired several characters in his son's works, such as [[Simon Dedalus]] in ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' and ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker in ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', and the narrator's uncle in the stories "The Sisters" and "Araby" in ''[[Dubliners]]''.

'''John Truby''' (born 1952) is a [[screenwriter]], [[film director|director]] and [[screenwriting guru|screenwriting teacher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He has served as a consultant on over 1,000 film scripts over the past three decades, and is also known for the [[screenwriting software]] program Blockbuster (originally "Storyline Pro").

Truby argues that most [[screenwriting guru|teachers of screenwriting]] emphasize inner transformation of the characters but not the moral effect their actions have on others. He is critical of [[Syd Field|Syd Field's]] [[Screenwriting theories|three-act “Paradigm”]] and has instead crafted his own 22-step outline. Truby's first book ''The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller'' was published in October, 2007 by [[Faber and Faber]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0865479518 The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOgcUsML?url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0865479518 |date=31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screenwriting career==
In the 1980s, Truby received his first credits, writing three episodes of [[21 Jump Street]]. He later received a co-writer credit on the 2011 Disney/BBC film ''[[African Cats]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0991399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kokoon Arts Club''', sometimes spelled Kokoon Arts Klub, was a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] artists group founded in 1911 by [[Carl Moellman]], [[William Sommer]] and [[Elmer Brubeck]] to promote [[Modernism]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moellman had been a member of [[New York City]]'s Kit Kat Club, which served as inspiration for Kokoon. From 1913 to 1946 Kokoon's annual Bal-Masque balls scandalized Cleveland with risqué activities, provocative art, and nudity, and was sometimes wagishly referred to as the "Cocaine Club". A fierce rivalry stood between Kokoon and the more conservative [[Cleveland Society of Artists]].

This is a '''list of genres''' of literature and entertainment, excluding [[:Category:Art genres|genres in the visual arts]]. [[Genre]] is the term for any category of literature or other forms of art or entertainment, e.g. music, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria. Genres are formed by conventions that change over time as new genres are invented and the use of old ones are discontinued. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions.

== Literary genres ==
{{Main|Literary genre}}
{{Main list|List of writing genres}}

===Absurdist/surreal/whimsical===
[[Absurdist fiction|Absurdist]] and [[Surreal humour|surreal]] fiction challenges causal reasoning and the purposefulness of life.  There is often, though not always, a connection to comedy.

Whimsical has to do with a sense of eccentric or quirky humor. Related styles exaggerate real life in a whimsical, eccentric, quirky or fanciful way, sometimes including 'magical' extensions of reality.

The [[Absurdist fiction|absurdist]] genre focuses on the experiences of characters in situations where they cannot find any inherent [[Meaning of life|purpose in life]], most often represented by ultimately meaningless actions and events that call into question the certainty of existential concepts such as truth or value.

The closely related/overlapping [[Surreal humour|surreal]] genre is predicated on deliberate violations of [[Causality|causal]] reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously [[illogical]]. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]], irrational or absurd situations and expressions of [[nonsense]].

Whimsical and related styles are exemplified by films such as [[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]], [[Amélie]], [[Micmacs (film)|Micmacs]] and Dieta Mediterranea (Mediterranean Food).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1198340/ |title=Dieta mediterránea |trans-title=Mediterranean Food |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Action===
An [[Action (fiction)|action]] story is similar to [[adventure]], and the protagonist usually takes a risky turn, which leads to desperate situations (including [[explosion]]s, [[stage combat|fight scenes]], daring escapes, etc.). Action and Adventure are usually categorized together (sometimes even as "action-adventure") because they have much in common, and many stories fall under both genres simultaneously (for instance, the [[James Bond]] series can be classified as both).

* [[Heroic bloodshed]]: [[Hong Kong]] action revolving around stylized sequences and dramatic themes such as brotherhood, duty, honor, redemption and violence.
* [[Military fiction]]: A story about a war or battle that can either be historical or fictional. It usually follows the events a certain warrior goes through during the battle's events.
* [[Spy fiction]]: A story about a secret agent (spy) or military personnel member who is sent on a secret [[espionage]] mission. Usually, they are equipped with special gadgets that prove useful during the mission, and they have special training in things such as [[unarmed combat]] or [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]]. They may or may not work for a specific [[government]].
* [[Wuxia]]: A martial arts genre with chivalrous protagonists on fantastic adventures.
* [[Girls with guns]] and swords: This is a lsdkfh of action films and animation, often Asian films and [[anime]], that portray a strong female protagonist who makes use of dgfhj to defend against or attack a group of antagonists. The genre typically involves gun-play, stunts and martial arts action.

===Adventure===
An [[Adventure fiction|adventure story]] is about a [[protagonist]] who journeys to epic or distant places to accomplish something. It can have many other genre elements included within it,
because it is a very open genre. The protagonist has a mission and faces obstacles to get to their destination. Also, adventure stories usually include unknown settings and characters with prized properties or features.

* [[Shōnen manga]]: A [[manga]] usually tends to be marketed to males roughly aged 10 and above. It is typically characterized by high-action, often humorous plots featuring male protagonists. The camaraderie between boys or men on sports teams, fighting squads, and the like is often emphasized. Attractive female characters with exaggerated features are also common.
* [[Superhero fiction]]: A story that examines the adventures of costumed crime fighters known as superheroes, who often possess superhuman powers and battle similarly powered criminals known as supervillains.

===Comedy===
[[Comedy]] is a story that tells about a series of funny, or comical events, intended to make the audience laugh. It is a very open genre, and thus crosses over with many other genres on a frequent basis.

* [[Comedy of manners]]: A film [[satire|satirizes]] the manners and affectations of a [[social class]], often represented by [[stock character]]s. The plot of the comedy is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other [[scandal]], but is generally less important than its witty [[dialogue]]. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]''.
* [[Laughter in literature|Humorous]]: Fiction full of fun, fancy, and excitement. Meant to entertain.
* [[Tall tale]]: A humorous story with blatant exaggeration, swaggering heroes who do the impossible with nonchalance.
* [[Parody]]: A story that mocks or [[satire|satirizes]] other genres, people, [[fictional character]]s or works. Such works employ [[sarcasm]], [[stereotype|stereotyping]], mockery of scenes, symbols or lines from other works, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Such stories may be "affectionate parodies" meant to entertain those familiar with the references of the parody, or they may well be intended to undercut the respectability of the original inspiration for the parody by pointing out its [[wiktionary: flaw|flaw]]s (the latter being closer to [[satire]]).
* [[Romantic comedy]] aka RomCom: A subgenre that combines the romance genre with comedy, focusing on two or more individuals as they discover and attempt to deal with their [[romantic love]], attractions to each other. The [[stereotypical]] plot line follows the "boy-gets-girl", "boy-loses-girl", "boy gets girl back again" sequence. Naturally, there are innumerable variants to this plot (as well as new twists, such as reversing the [[gender role]]s in the story), and much of the generally lighthearted comedy lies in the social interactions and [[sexual tension]] between the characters, who very often either refuse to admit they are attracted to one another or must deal with others' meddling in their affairs.
* [[Comic fantasy]]: A subgenre of fantasy that is primarily humorous in intent and tone. Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy. It is sometimes known as low fantasy in contrast to high fantasy, which is primarily serious in intent and tone. The term "low fantasy" is also used to represent other types of fantasy, so while comic fantasies may also correctly be classified as low fantasy, many examples of low fantasy are not comic in nature.
* [[Comedy horror]]: See ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Jennifer's Body]]''.
* [[Black comedy]] (or dark comedy): A parody or satirical story that is based on normally tragic or [[taboo]] subjects, including [[death]], [[murder]], [[suicide]], [[illicit drug]]s and [[war]]. So-called "dead baby comedy" sometimes falls under this genre.
* [[Zombie comedy]]: Often called zom com or zomedy, this is a genre that blends zombie horror motifs with slapstick comedy as well as dark comedy.
* [[Comic science fiction]]: A comedy that uses [[science fiction]] elements or settings, often as a lighthearted (or occasionally vicious) parody of the latter genre.
* [[Satire]]: Often strictly defined as a [[literary genre|literary genre or form]], though in practice it is also found in the [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s. In [[satire]], human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, [[burlesque]], [[irony]], or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Satire is usually meant to be funny, but its purpose is not primarily humour as an attack on something the author disapproves of, using [[wit]]. A common, almost defining feature of satire is its strong vein of irony or [[sarcasm]], but [[parody]], burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] all frequently appear in satirical speech and writing. The essential point, is that "in satire, irony is militant." This "militant irony" (or sarcasm) often professes to approve (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist actually wishes to attack.

===Crime===
(See also: '''Mystery''' below)

A [[Crime fiction|crime]] story is about a crime that is being committed or was committed. It can also be an account of a criminal's life. It often falls into the action or adventure genres.

* [[Legal drama|Courtroom drama]]: A television show subgenre of dramatic programming. This subgenre presents fictional drama about law. Law enforcement, crime, detective-based mystery solving, lawyer work, civil litigation, etc., are all possible focuses of legal dramas. Common subgenres of legal dramas include detective dramas, police dramas, courtroom dramas, legal thrillers, etc. Legal dramas come in all shapes and sizes and may also span into other forms of media, including novels, plays, television shows, and films.
* [[Detective fiction|Detective story]]: A story about a detective or person, either professional or amateur, who has to solve a crime that was committed. They must figure out who committed the crime and why. Sometimes, the detective must figure out 'how' the criminal committed the crime if it seems impossible.
** [[Whodunnit]]: This is a complex, plot-driven variety of the detective story in which the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its climax. The investigation is usually conducted by an eccentric amateur or semi-professional detective.
* [[Gangster]]: Literature that focuses on gangs, criminal organizations that provide a level of organization, and resources that support much larger and more complex criminal transactions than an individual criminal could achieve. Gangsters are the subject of many movies, particularly from the period between 1930 and 1960.  A revival of [[gangster]] type movies took place since the 1990s with the explosion of hip-hop culture.  Unlike the earlier gangster films, the newer films share similar elements to the older films but is more in a hip-hop urban setting.
* [[Gentleman thief]]: Centers around particularly well-behaving and apparently well-bred thieves. They rarely bother with anonymity or force, preferring to rely on their charisma, physical attractiveness, and clever misdirection to steal the most unobtainable objects{{snd}}sometimes for their own support, but mostly for the thrill of the act itself.
* [[Gong'an fiction]]: A subgenre of historical [[Chinese crime fiction|crime fiction]] that involves government magistrates who solve criminal cases.
* [[Hardboiled]]: This is a literary genre sharing the setting with crime fiction (especially detective stories). Though deriving from the romantic tradition, which emphasized the emotions of apprehension, horror and terror, and awe, hardboiled fiction deviates from the tradition in the detective's cynical attitude towards those emotions. The attitude is conveyed through the detective's self-talk describing to the reader (or{{snd}}in the film{{snd}}to the viewer) what he is doing and feeling.
*Heist: A thriller in which a criminal or group of criminals conceives and executes a major robbery. The theft usually involves gaining access to valuables stored in a high-security location, and the thieves may or may not use subterfuge to trick their way into and/or out of the stronghold.
* [[Legal thriller]]: A subgenre of thriller and crime fiction in which the major characters are lawyers and their employees. The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters. In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller much as the system of modern police work does for the police procedural. Usually, crusading lawyers become involved in proving their cases (usually their client's innocence of the crime he is accused of, or the culpability of a corrupt corporation that has covered its malfeasance) to such an extent that they imperil their own interpersonal relationships and frequently, their own lives.
* [[Crime fiction|Murder mystery]]: A mystery story that focuses on [[homicide]]s. Usually, the detective must figure out who killed one or several victims. They may or may not find themselves or loved ones in danger because of this investigation. The genre often includes elements of the [[suspense|suspense story]] genre, or of the [[Action (fiction)|action]] and [[adventure]] genres.

===Drama===
{{main|Drama (film and television)}}
Within film, television and radio (but not [[theatre]]), [[Drama (genre)|drama]] is a genre of [[narrative]] [[fiction]] (or [[docudrama|semi-fiction]]) intended to be more serious than [[humor]]ous in tone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|title=Drama|year=2015|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drama|quote=a play, movies, television show, or radio show that is about a serious subject and is not meant to make the audience laugh}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on in-depth [[characterization|development]] of realistic characters who must deal with realistic emotional struggles. A drama is commonly considered the opposite of a [[comedy]], but may also be considered separate from other works of some broad genre, such as a [[fantasy]].

* [[Comedy-drama]]
* [[Crime drama]] 
* [[Docudrama]]
* [[Historical period drama]]
* [[Horror film|Horror drama]]
* [[Legal drama]]
* [[Melodrama]]
* [[Military drama]]
* [[Romance film|Romantic drama]]
* [[Teen drama]]

===Fantasy===
[[File:The Whirlwind Seizes the Wreath.jpg|thumb|The Whirlwind Seizes the Wreath]]
A [[fantasy]] story is about [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] or [[supernatural]] forces, rather than technology (as [[science fiction]]) if it happens to take place in a modern or future era. Depending on the extent of these other elements, the story may or may not be considered to be a "hybrid genre" series; for instance, even though the [[Harry Potter]] series [[canon (fiction)|canon]] includes the requirement of a particular [[gene]] to be a wizard, it is referred to only as a fantasy series.

* [[Bangsian]]: A fantasy genre that concerns the use of famous literary or historical individuals and their interactions in the afterlife. It is named for [[John Kendrick Bangs]], who often wrote in this genre.
* [[Contemporary fantasy]] (also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy): A subgenre of fantasy, set in the present day. These are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds.
** [[Urban fantasy]]: A subgenre of fantasy defined by place; the fantastic narrative has an urban setting. Many urban fantasies are set in contemporary times and contain supernatural elements. However, the stories can take place in historical, modern, or futuristic periods, as well as fictional settings. The prerequisite is that they must be primarily set in a city.
* [[Dark fantasy]]: A subgenre of fantasy that can refer to literary, artistic, and filmic works that combine fantasy with elements of horror. The term can be used broadly to refer to fantastical works that have a dark, gloomy atmosphere or a sense of horror and dread and a dark, often brooding, tone.
* [[Fable]]s: A type of narration demonstrating a useful truth. Animals speak as humans, legendary, supernatural tale.
* [[Fairy Tale]]s: A literary genre about various magical creatures, environments, et cetera. Many  fairy tales are generally targeted for children.
*[[Hard fantasy]]: Fantasy where the magical elements are constructed in a logical and rational manner.
* [[High fantasy|Epic/High fantasy]]: Mythical stories with highly developed characters and story lines. E.g. Malazan Book of the Fallen and The Lord of the Rings
* [[Heroic fantasy]]: subgenre of fantasy that chronicles the tales of heroes in imaginary lands. Frequently, the protagonist is reluctant to be a champion, is of low or humble origin, and has royal ancestors or parents but does not know it. Though events are usually beyond their control, they are thrust into positions of great responsibility where their mettle is tested in a number of spiritual and physical challenges.
* [[Historical fantasy]]: a category of fantasy and genre of historical fiction that incorporates fantastic elements (such as magic) into the historical narrative.
* [[Legend]]s: Stories, oftentimes of a national hero or other [[Folklore|folk]] figure, which have a basis in fact, but also contain imaginative material.
* [[Magical girl]]: Popular in Japan, of girls who use magic in either their training, idol stardom or even to fight evil.
* [[Mythic fiction]]: Literature that is rooted in, inspired by, or that in some way draws from the tropes, themes and symbolism of myth, folklore, and fairy tales.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://endicottstudio.typepad.com/jomareadinglists/2007/10/a-mythic-fictio.html A Mythic Fiction Reading List]", ''The Journal of Mythic Arts''&lt;/ref&gt; The term is widely credited to Charles de Lint and Terri Windling. Mythic fiction overlaps with urban fantasy and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but mythic fiction also includes contemporary works in non-urban settings. Mythic fiction refers to works of contemporary literature that often cross the divide between literary and fantasy fiction.
* [[Science fantasy]]: A story with mystical elements that are scientifically explainable, or that combine science fiction elements with fantasy elements. Note that [[science fiction]] was once referred to by this name, but that it no longer denotes that genre, and has somewhat fallen out of favor as a genre descriptor.
** [[Sword and planet]]: A [[subgenre]] of [[science fantasy]] that features rousing adventure stories set on other planets, and usually featuring Earthmen as protagonists.  There is a fair amount of overlap between "Sword &amp; Planet" and "[[planetary romance]]" though some works are considered to belong to one and not the other. In general, Planetary Romance is considered to be more of a [[Space Opera]] subgenre, influenced by the likes of ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' yet more modern and technologically savvy, while Sword &amp; Planet more directly imitates the conventions established by Burroughs in the [[Barsoom|Mars series]].
** [[Dying Earth (subgenre)|Dying Earth]]: A sub-[[subgenre]] of [[science fantasy]] that takes place either at the [[Future of the Earth|end of life on Earth]] or the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|End of Time]], when the laws of the universe themselves fail. More generally, the Dying Earth subgenre encompasses [[science fiction]] works set in the far distant future in a milieu of stasis or decline. Themes of world-weariness, [[innocence]] (wounded or otherwise), idealism, [[entropy]], (permanent) exhaustion/depletion of many or all resources (such as soil nutrients), and the hope of renewal tend to pre-dominate.
** [[Gaslamp fantasy]]: Fantasy's counterpart to [[steampunk]], in which the settings are often Victorian or Edwardian socially or technologically, but with non-scientific elements or characters included. 
* [[Shenmo]]: A genre of fantasy that revolves around the gods and monsters of [[Chinese mythology]].
* [[Sword and sorcery]]: A blend of heroic fantasy, adventure, and frequent elements of the horrific in which a mighty barbaric warrior hero is pitted against both human and supernatural adversaries. Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan the Cimmerian, Kull of Atlantis, the Pictish king Bran Mak Morn, etc. is generally acknowledged as the founder of the genre, chiefly through his writings for ''[[Weird Tales]]'' and other 1920s and 1930s pulp magazines.

===Historical===
A story about a real person or event. Often, they are written in a [[text book]] format, which may or may not focus on solely that.

* [[Biography]]: The details of the life story of a real person, told by someone else.
** [[Autobiography]]: Essentially the same as a [[biography]], with the exception that the story is written by the person who is the subject of the story.
** [[Memoir]]: Similar to [[autobiography]], with the exception that it is told more "from memory", i.e. it is how the person personally remembers and feels about their life or a stage in their life, more than the exact, recorded details of that period. Though memoirs are often more [[subjectivity|subjective]] than  [[autobiography]] works, memoirs are generally still considered to be [[nonfiction]] works. There are also some [[fiction]] works that purport to be the "memoirs" of [[fictional character]]s as well, done in a similar style, however, these are in a separate genre from their nonfiction counterparts.
* [[Historical fiction]]: A story that takes place in the real world, with real world people, but with several fictionalized or dramatized elements. This may or may not [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] with other genres; for example, [[fantasy fiction]] or [[science fiction]] may play a part, as is the case for instance with the novel ''[[George Washington's Socks]]'', which includes [[time travel]] elements.
** [[Alternate history]]: A more extreme variant of [[historical fiction]] which posits a "what if" scenario in which some historical event occurs differently (or not at all), thus altering the course of [[history]]; for instance, "What if Nazi Germany had won World War II?" is an alternate history concept that has had treatment in fiction. Alternate History is sometimes (though not universally) referred to as a subgenre of [[science fiction]] or [[speculative fiction]], and like [[historical fiction]], may include more fantastical elements (for instance, the ''[[Temeraire (series)|Temeraire'' series]] uses the fantasy element of [[dragon]]s to create an Alternate History plot set during the [[Napoleonic Era]]).
** [[Counterfactual history]]: Referred to as '''virtual history''', it is a recent form of [[historiography]] that attempts to answer counterfactual "what if" questions. It seeks to explore history and historical incidents by means of extrapolating a timeline in which certain key historical events did not happen or had a different outcome. This exercise ascertains the relative importance of the event, incident or person the counter-factual hypothesis negates.
** [[Period piece]]: This type features historical places, people, or events that may or not be crucial to the story. Because history is merely used as a backdrop, it may be fictionalized to various degrees, but the story itself may be regarded as "outside" history. Genres within this category are often regarded as significant categories in themselves.
*** [[Jidaigeki]]: A story usually set in the Edo period of [[Japan]]ese history, from 1603 to 1868.
** [[Costume drama]]: A type of drama that especially relies on lavish costumes and designs. This type crosses over with many other genres.

===Historical fiction===
The genre historical fiction includes stories that are about the past. To distinguish historical fiction from any fiction that is written about an era in the past, the criteria that the book must have been written about a time that occurred in a historical context in relation to the author of the book.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction|last = Saricks|first = Joyce|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0-8389-0989-8|location = |pages = 291–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genreflecting|last = Orr|first = Cynthia|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-1-59884-841-0|location = |pages = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria that the story be set before the middle of the previous century is sometimes added.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Historical fiction stories include historical details and includes characters that fit into the time period of the setting, whether or not they are real historical people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Horror===

A [[Horror fiction|horror]] story is told to deliberately scare or frighten the audience, through suspense, violence or shock. [[H. P. Lovecraft]] distinguishes two primary varieties in the "Introduction" to ''Supernatural Horror in Literature'': 1) Physical Fear or the "mundanely gruesome" and 2) the true Supernatural Horror story or the "Weird Tale". The supernatural variety is occasionally called "dark fantasy", since the laws of nature must be violated in some way, thus qualifying the story as "fantastic".

* [[Ghost story]]: A story about the intrusion of the spirits of the dead into the realm of the living. There are subgenres: The Traditional Haunting, Poltergeists, The Haunted Place or Object (i.e. the hotel in Stephen King's ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''), or the etching in M. R. James' [http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/mezztint.htm "The Mezzotint"], etc. Some would include stories of Revenants such as [[W. W. Jacobs]]' [http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/mnkyspaw.htm "The Monkey's Paw."]
* [[Monster]]: A story about a monster, creature or mutant that terrorizes people. Usually, it fits into the horror genre, for instance, [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]''. Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is often also considered the first [[science fiction]] story (biological science reanimating the dead), but it does present a monstrous "creature.  Other clear Monster stories are of the creatures of folklore and fable: the Vampire, the Ghoul, the Werewolf, the Zombie, etc.  Beings such as that depicted in Karloff's ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' would also qualify.
** [[Kaiju|Giant monsters]]: A story about a giant monster, big enough to destroy buildings. Some such stories are about two giant monsters fighting each other, a genre known as ''[[kaiju]]'' in Japan, which is famous for such works after the success of such films and franchises such as ''[[Godzilla]]''.
* [[Werewolf fiction]]: Stories about [[werewolf|werewolves]], humans with the ability to shapeshift into wolves.
* [[Jiangshi fiction]]: Stories about [[jiangshi]], the hopping corpses under the control of Taoist priests derived from [[Chinese literature]] and folklore.
* [[Vampire literature]]: A story about [[vampire]]s, reanimated bodies that feed on the blood of the living, based on European folklore. [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' created many of the genre's conventions.
* [[Ghost story|Occult stories]]: Stories that touch upon the adversaries of Good, especially the "Enemies" of the forces of righteousness as expressed in any given religious philosophy.  Hence, stories of devils, demons, demonic possession, dark witchcraft, evil sorcerers or warlocks, and figures like the Antichrist would qualify. The nature of such stories presupposes the existence of the side of Good and the existence of a deity to be opposed to the forces of Evil.
* [[Slasher film|Slasher]]: A horror genre featuring a [[serial killer]] or other [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] as an [[Antagonist (literature)|antagonist]], methodically killing a number of protagonists in succession. Dramatic suspense is heightened by the victims' obliviousness of the killer. The victims are typically in isolated settings and often engaged in sexual activity previous to the attacks. The "slasher" kills their victims by sneaking up on them and then bloodily stabbing and slicing them to death with a sharp object, such as a [[chef's knife]]. Gender roles in slasher films are of particular interest in [[feminist film theory]], which has extensively examined the trope of the [[Final girl]].
* [[Survival horror]]: A horror story about a protagonist in a risky and life-threatening situation that they must endure, often as a result of things such as [[zombie]]s or other monsters, and the rest of the plot is how the main characters overcome this.

===Magical realism===
Magical realism, also called [[Magic realism]], is literary works where magical events form part of ordinary life. The reader is forced to accept that abnormal events such as levitation, telekinesis and talking with the dead take place in the real world. The writer does not invent a new world or describe in great detail new creatures, as is usual in Fantasy; on the contrary, the author abstains from explaining the fantastic events to avoid making them feel extraordinary. It is often regarded as a genre exclusive to [[Latin American literature]], but some of its chief exponents include English authors. [[One Hundred Years of Solitude]], by [[Gabriel García Márquez]], who received the 1982 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], is considered the genre's seminal work of style.

===Mystery===
A [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] story follows an investigator as he/she attempts to solve a puzzle (often a crime). The details and clues are presented as the story continues and the protagonist discovers them and by the end of the story the mystery/puzzle is solved.  For example, in the case of a crime mystery the perpetrator and motive behind the crime are revealed and the perpetrator is brought to justice. Mystery novels are often written in series, which facilitates a more in-depth development of the primary investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Readers' Advisory Guide to  Genre Fiction|last = Saricks|first = Joyce|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0-8389-0989-8|location = |pages = 197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genreflecting|last = Orr|first = Cynthia|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-1-59884-841-0|location = |pages = 129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific types of mystery story include [[Locked-room mystery|locked room mysteries]] and [[Cozy mystery|cozy mysteries]].

===Paranoid Fiction===
[[Paranoid fiction]] is works of [[literature]] that explore the [[subjectivity|subjective]] nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power. These forces can be external, such as a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, or they can be internal, such as a character's [[mental illness]] or refusal to accept the harshness of the world they are in.

===Philosophical===
[[Philosophical fiction]] is fiction in which a significant proportion of the work is devoted to a discussion of the sort of questions normally addressed in discursive philosophy. These might include the function and role of society, the purpose of life, ethics or morals, the role of art in human lives, and the role of experience or reason in the development of knowledge. Philosophical fiction works would include the so-called novel of ideas, including a significant proportion of science fiction, utopian and dystopian fiction, and Bildungsroman. The modus operandi seems to be to use a normal story to simply explain difficult and dark parts of human life.

* [[Bildungsroman]]: A [[coming-of-age]] novel presenting the psychological, moral and social shaping of the personality of a character, usually the [[protagonist]]. The genre arose during the [[German Enlightenment]].

===Political===
[[Political fiction]] is a subgenre of fiction that deals with [[political affairs]]. Political fiction has often used narrative to provide commentary on political events, systems and theories. Works of political fiction often "directly criticize an existing society or... present an alternative, sometimes fantastic, reality." Prominent pieces of political fiction have included the totalitarian dystopias of the early 20th century such as [[Jack London|Jack London's]] ''[[The Iron Heel]]'' and [[Sinclair Lewis|Sinclair Lewis's]] ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]''. Equally influential, if not more so, have been earlier pieces of political fiction such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), ''[[Candide]]'' (1759) and ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852). Political fiction frequently employs the literary modes of satire, often in the genres of [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]] or [[social science fiction]].

* [[Utopian fiction]]: The creation of an ideal world, or utopia, as the setting for a novel
* [[Dystopian fiction]]: The creation of a nightmare world, or dystopia, as the setting for a novel
* [[Survivalism]]: The creation of world where traditional society has collapsed usually due to some post apocalyptic or doomsday scenario, as a setting for a novel

===Romance===
The term "romance" has multiple [[Historical romance#Definition|meanings]]; ''[[historical romances]]'' like those of [[Walter Scott]] would use the term to mean "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;.Walter Scott, "Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p. 129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', Susan Maning, ed Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; But most often a romance is understood to be "love stories", emotion-driven stories that are primarily focused on the relationship between the main characters of the story. Beyond the focus on the relationship, the biggest defining characteristic of the romance genre is that a ''happy ending'' is always guaranteed...&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction|last = Saricks|first = Joyce|publisher = American Library Association|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0-8389-0989-8|location = Chicago|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genreflecting|last = Orr|first = Cynthia|publisher = Libraries Unlimited|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-59884-841-0|location = California|pages = 229–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps marriage and living "happily ever after", or simply that the reader sees hope for the future of the romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the wide definition of romance, romance stories cover a wide variety of subjects and often fall into other genre categories as well as romance,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  such as [[Comedy-Romance]] (also known as '''romcom''' films), [[romantic suspense]] and (less common now): subcategories such as '''hospital romances''', as found in the novels by [[Lucilla Andrews]]. See [[Mills &amp; Boon#Imprints|Mills &amp; Boon imprint categories]] and [[Harlequin Enterprises#Harlequin category romance imprints|Harlequin romances categories]] for a partial list of other sub-genres.

===Saga===
The [[saga]]s (from Icelandic saga, plural sögur) are stories about ancient Scandinavian and Germanic history, about early Viking voyages, about migration to Iceland, and of feuds between Icelandic families. They were written in the Old Norse language, mainly in Iceland. The texts are epic tales in prose, often with stanzas or whole poems in alliterative verse embedded in the text, of heroic deeds of days long gone, tales of worthy men, who were often Vikings, sometimes Pagan, sometimes Christian. The tales are usually realistic, except legendary sagas, sagas of saints, sagas of bishops and translated or recomposed romances. They are sometimes romanticised and fantastic, but always dealing with human beings one can understand.

* [[Family saga]]: The  family saga chronicles the lives and doings of a family or a number of related or interconnected families over a period of time. In novels (or sometimes [[novel sequence|sequences of novels]]) with a serious intent, this is often a thematic device used to portray particular historical events, changes of social circumstances, or the ebb and flow of fortunes from a multiple of perspectives.

===Satire===
Often strictly defined as a [[literary genre|literary genre or form]], though in practice it is also found in the [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s. In [[satire]], human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, [[burlesque]], [[irony]], or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Satire is usually meant to be funny, but its purpose is not primarily humour as an attack on something the author disapproves of, using [[wit]]. A common, almost defining feature of satire is its strong vein of irony or [[sarcasm]], but [[parody]], burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] all frequently appear in satirical speech and writing. The essential point, is that "in satire, irony is militant." This "militant irony" (or sarcasm) often professes to approve (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist actually wishes to attack.

===Science fiction===
[[Science fiction]] is similar to [[fantasy]], except stories in this genre use scientific understanding to explain the universe that it takes place in. It generally includes or is centered on the presumed effects or ramifications of [[computer]]s or [[machine]]s; travel through [[Intergalactic travel|space]], [[time travel|time]] or [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s; [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] life-forms; [[genetic engineering]]; or other such things. The science or technology used may or may not be very thoroughly elaborated on; stories whose scientific elements are reasonably detailed, well-researched and considered to be relatively plausible given current knowledge and technology are often referred to as [[hard science fiction]].

* [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction]]: concerned with the [[Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth|end of civilization]] either through [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], [[pandemic|plague]], or some other [[disaster|general disaster]].  Post-apocalyptic fiction  is set in a world or civilization after such a disaster. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between this form of science fiction and fiction that deals with false utopias or [[dystopia|dystopic societies]].
* [[Hard science fiction]]: where the science is detailed, well-researched, and considered plausible such as ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' or ''[[Prey (novel)]]''.
** [[Tech noir]]: A hybrid of other works of fiction combining the [[film noir]] and [[science fiction]] or [[cyberpunk]] genres such as seen in ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984). It is a form of [[Neo-noir]] concentrating more on [[List of science fiction themes|science fiction themes]]. The term was coined in ''The Terminator''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} as the name of a nightclub, ''Tech Noir''. The director [[James Cameron]] wanted a name for the particular style he was invoking.
* [[Soft science fiction]]: not detailed about the science involved, and typically deals more with cultural, social, and political interactions.
** [[Comic science fiction]]: exploits the genre's conventions for [[comedy|comic]] effect.
** [[Military science fiction]]: told from the point of view of the military, or a main character who is a soldier in the military. It usually has technology far superior to today's, but not necessarily implausible. Military science fiction essentially is the addition of science fiction elements into a [[war novel|military fiction]] story. (Note that some military science fiction stories fit at least somewhat into the "hard science fiction" subgenre as well.)
** [[Feminist science fiction]]: tends to deal with women's roles in society. It poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, the role reproduction plays in defining gender and the unequal political, economic and personal power of men and women. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using [[utopia]]s to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or [[dystopias]] to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.
** [[Libertarian science fiction]]: focuses on the politics and social order implied by [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] philosophies with an emphasis on [[individualism]] and a limited state{{snd}}and in some cases, [[anarcho-capitalism|no state whatsoever]]. As a genre, it can be seen as growing out of the 1930s and 1940s when the science-fiction [[pulp magazines]] were reaching their peak at the same time as [[fascism]] and [[communism]]. While this environment gave rise to [[dystopian]] novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', in the pulps, this influence more often give rise to speculations about societies (or sub-groups) arising in direct opposition to totalitarianism.
** [[Social science fiction]]: concerned less with the scientific background and more with sociological speculation about human society. In other words, it "absorbs and discusses anthropology", and speculates about human behavior and interactions. Exploration of fictional societies is one of the most interesting aspects of science fiction, allowing it to perform predictive and precautionary functions, to criticize the contemporary world and to present solutions, to portray alternative societies and to examine the implications of ethical principles.
* [[Space opera]]: A story characterized by the extent of [[Intergalactic travel|space travel]] and distinguished by the amount of time that protagonists spend in an active, space-faring lifestyle. ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Star Blazers]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' have often been categorized as such.
** [[Science fiction Western]]: has elements of science fiction in a [[Western (genre)|Western]] setting. It is different from a [[Space Western]], which is a frontier story indicative of [[American Old West|American Westerns]], except transposed to a backdrop of [[outer space|space]] exploration and settlement.
** [[Planetary romance]]: the bulk of the action consists of adventures on one or more exotic alien planets, characterized by distinctive physical and cultural backgrounds. Some planetary romances take place against the background of a future culture where travel between worlds by spaceship is commonplace; others, particularly the earliest examples of the genre, do not, and invoke [[flying carpet]]s, astral projection, or other methods of getting between planets. In either case, the planetside adventures are the focus of the story, not the mode of travel.
** [[Space Western]]: transposes themes of [[American Old West|American Western]] books and film to a backdrop of futuristic space frontiers; it is the complement of the [[science fiction Western]], which transposes science fiction ''themes'' onto an American Western ''setting''.
* Punk: Several different Science Fiction subgenres, normally categorized by distinct technologies and sciences. The themes tend to be [[cynical]] or [[dystopian]], and a person, or group of people, fighting the [[Political corruption|corruption]] of the government.
** [[Cyberpunk]]: A futuristic storyline dealing with people who have been physically or mentally enhanced with [[cybernetic]] components, often featuring [[cyborg]]s or [[Technological singularity|the singularity]] as a major theme, and generally somewhat [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] or [[dystopian]] (hence the "punk" portion of the name). This is often confused or placed with [[Techno-thriller]], which is actually a separate and less specialized genre.
*** [[Postcyberpunk]]: some critics suggest has evolved from [[cyberpunk]]. Like its predecessor, postcyberpunk focuses on technological developments in near-future societies, typically examining the social effects of a ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, [[genetic engineering]], modification of the human body, and the continued impact of perpetual technological change. Unlike "pure" cyberpunk, the works in this category feature characters who act to improve social conditions or at least protect the [[status quo]] from further decay.
** [[Retrofuturism|Retropunk]]: As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, playing off the cyberpunk label, and focusing on technology and its social effects in different ways.  Many derivatives of cyberpunk are retro-futuristic, based either on the futuristic visions of past eras, or more recent extrapolations or exaggerations of the actual technology of those eras.
*** [[Atompunk]]: relates to the pre-digital, cultural period of 1945–65, including mid-century [[Modernism]], the "[[Atom]]ic Age", the "[[Space]] Age", [[Communism]] and [[paranoia]] in the US along with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] styling, [[underground cinema]], [[Googie]] architecture, space and the [[Sputnik]], moon landing, superhero-comics, art &amp; radioactivity, the rise of the US military/industrial complex &amp; the fall-out of [[Chernobyl]]. Communist analog atompunk is an ultimate lost world. The [[Fallout (series)|Fallout]] series of computer games is an excellent example of atompunk.
*** [[Dieselpunk]]: Initially proposed as a genre by the creators of the role-playing game ''[[Children of the Sun (role-playing game)|Children of the Sun]]'', [[dieselpunk]] refers to fiction inspired by mid-century pulp stories, based on the aesthetics of the [[interbellum]] period through [[World War II]] (c. 1920–45). Similar to steampunk though specifically characterized by the rise of petroleum power and technocratic perception, incorporating neo-noir elements and sharing themes more clearly with [[cyberpunk]] than [[steampunk]]. Though the notability of [[dieselpunk]] as a genre is not entirely uncontested, installments ranging from the retro-futuristic film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'' to the 2001 Activision video game ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' have been suggested as quintessential [[dieselpunk]] works of fiction.
*** [[Steampunk]]: A story that takes place around the time [[steam power]] was first coming into use. The [[industrial revolution]] is a common time setting for [[steam punk]] stories, and the steam technology is often actually more advanced than the real technology of the time (for instance, ''[[Steam Detectives]]'' features steam-powered robots). The most immediate form of steampunk subculture is the community of fans surrounding the genre. Others move beyond this, attempting to adopt a "steampunk" aesthetic through fashion, home decor and even music.
*** [[Clockpunk]]: This term has occasionally referred to a subgenre of speculative fiction that is similar to steampunk, but deviates in its technology. As with steampunk, it portrays advanced technology based on pre-modern designs, but rather than the steam power of the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]], the technology used is based on springs, clockwork and similar. Clockpunk is based very intensively on the works of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and as such, it is typically set during the [[Renaissance]]. It is regarded as being a type of [[steampunk]].
** [[Biopunk]]: A story that is about genetics and biological research (often falling under the horror category). It often focuses on some harmful effects characters have created when they change an animal's code to (unintentionally) create a violent monster. Biopunk emerged during the 1990s and depicts the underground of the biotechnological revolution that was expected to start having a profound impact on humanity in the first half of the 21st century. Biopunk fiction typically describes the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of [[human experimentation]], against a backdrop of [[totalitarian]] governments or [[megacorporation]]s that misuse [[biotechnologies]] for [[social control]] or [[Profiteering (business)|profiteering]]. Unlike cyberpunk, it builds not on [[information technology]] but on [[synthetic biology]].
*** [[Nanopunk]]: similar bio-punk, but depicts a world where the use of [[biotechnology|biotechnologies]] are limited or prohibited, so only [[nanotechnology|nanotechnologies]] in wide use (while in [[biopunk]] bio- and nanotechnologies often coexist). Currently the genre is more concerned with the artistic and physiological impact of nanotechnology, than of aspects of the technology itself, which is still in its infancy. Unlike the cyberpunk, a low-life yet technologically advanced character, the personification of a nanopunk can be set 'hard' or 'soft', depending on your views of the impact nanotechnology will have on our future.

=== Social ===
{{Distinguish|Social film}}
In Indian cinema terminology, social films (or simply socials) are films with a contemporary setting, as opposed to those with mythological and period settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/menaka-1935/article3022401.ece|title=Menaka 1935|last=Guy|first=Randor|date=January 4, 2008|work=[[The Hindu]]|access-date=November 19, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speculative===
[[Speculative fiction|Speculative]] fiction speculates about worlds that are unlike the real world in various important ways.  In these contexts, it generally overlaps one or more of the following: science fiction, [[fantasy fiction]], [[horror fiction]], [[supernatural fiction]], [[superhero fiction]], [[utopian and dystopian fiction]], [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction]], and [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]].

* [[Slipstream (genre)|Slipstream]]: Fantastic or non-realistic fiction that crosses conventional genre boundaries between science fiction/[[fantasy]] and [[mainstream]] [[literary fiction]]. The term ''slipstream'' was coined by [[cyberpunk]] author [[Bruce Sterling]] in an article originally published in ''SF Eye #5'', July 1989. He wrote: ''"...this is a kind of writing which simply makes you feel very strange; the way that living in the 20th century makes you feel, if you are a person of a certain sensibility."'' Slipstream fiction has consequently been referred to as "the fiction of strangeness," which is as clear a definition as any others in wide use.
* [[Supernatural fiction]]: exploits or requires as plot devices or themes some contradictions of the commonplace [[Natural environment|natural world]] and [[materialist]] assumptions about it. It includes the traditional [[ghost story]]. ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' by [[Henry James]] is an example of a work of [[literary fiction]] that is also largely concerned with supernatural fiction elements, making play of the possibility that they are psychological at root, but requiring the option that they are not for effect. The newer [[speculative fiction]] genres of [[horror fiction]] and [[fantasy fiction]], growing out of some of the basic propositions and [[generic convention]]s, to a certain extent replaced it.
* [[Superhero fiction]]: deals with [[superhero]]es, [[supervillain]]s, super-powered humans, [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]], or [[Mutant (fictional)|mutants]], and their adventures.  Distinct from (but often derived from) [[comic book]]s, [[animation|animated films]], and [[graphic novels]], these are prose stories and full-length [[novel]]s.  Superhero fiction is a type of [[speculative fiction]].  The largest and longest running of the corporate series are those associated with the [[DC Universe]] and the [[Marvel Universe]].
* [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]]: The  utopia  and its offshoot, the  dystopia, are  genres of literature  that explore social and political structures.  Utopian fiction  is the creation of an ideal world, or [[utopia]], as the setting for a novel.  Dystopian fiction  is the opposite: creation of a [[nightmare]] world, or [[dystopia]]. Many novels combine both, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take in its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures. Both utopias and dystopias are commonly found in [[science fiction]] and other [[speculative fiction]] genres, and arguably are by definition a type of [[speculative fiction]]. More than 400 utopian works were published prior to the year 1900 in the [[English language]] alone, with more than a thousand others during the 20th century.
* [[Weird fiction]]: [[Speculative literature]] written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Weird fiction is distinguished from [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[fantasy]] in that it predates the [[niche marketing]] of [[genre fiction]]. Because genre or stylistic conventions had not been established, weird tales often blend the supernatural, mythical, and even scientific. British "weird" authors, for example, published their work in mainstream literary magazines even after American pulp magazines became popular. "Weird fiction" is chiefly a historical description for works through the 1930s, but the term has also been used since the 1980s, sometimes to refer to [[slipstream (genre)|slipstream]] fiction that blends horror, fantasy, and science fiction.

Suppositional fiction is a subcategory in which stories and characters are constrained within an internally consistent world, but this category is not necessarily associated with any particular genre.&lt;ref&gt;Izenberg, Orin. ''Being Numerous: Poetry and the Ground of Social Life. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011; p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Thomas M. ''What Stories Are: Narrative Theory and Interpretation'' University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1986; p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Domańska, Ewa. ''Encounters: Philosophy of History After Postmodernism'' Charlottesville, Virginia: University Press of Virginia, 1998; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; A work of suppositional fiction might be science fiction, alternate history, mystery, horror, or even suppositional fantasy, depending on the intent and focus of the author.

===Thriller===
[[File:RebeccaTrailer.jpg|thumb|200px|A common theme in thrillers involves innocent victims dealing with deranged adversaries, as seen in Hitchcock's film ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), where Mrs. Danvers tries to persuade Mrs. De Winter to leap to her death]]
A [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]] is a story that is usually a mix of fear and excitement. It has traits from the [[suspense]] genre and often from the [[Action (fiction)|action]], [[adventure]] or [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] genres, but the level of terror makes it borderline [[horror fiction]] at times as well. It generally has a dark or serious theme, which also makes it similar to [[drama]].

* [[Disaster]]-thriller: A story about mass peril, where the protagonist's job is to both survive, and to save many other people from a grim fate, often a [[natural disaster]] such as a storm or volcanic eruption, but may also be a [[terrorist]] attack or [[epidemic]] of some sort.
* [[Psychological thriller]]: emphasizes the psychological condition of the hero that presents obstacles to his objective, rather than the action. Some psychological thrillers are also about complicated stories that try to deliberately confuse the audience, often by showing them only the same confusing or seemingly nonsensical information that the hero gains.
* [[crime|Crime thriller]]: A story that revolves around the life of detectives, mobs, or other groups associated with criminal events in the story.
* [[Techno-thriller]]: A story whose theme is usually technology, or the danger behind the technology people use, including the threat of [[cyber terrorism]] such as ''[[State of Fear]]''.

===Urban===
[[Urban fiction]], also known as '''street lit''', is a [[literary genre]] set, as the name implies, in a city landscape; however, the genre is as much defined by the race and culture of its characters as the [[Urban area|urban]] setting.  The tone for urban fiction is usually dark, focusing on the underside. Profanity (all of [[George Carlin]]'s [[seven dirty words]] and urban variations thereof), sex and violence are usually explicit, with the writer not shying away from or watering-down the material.  In this respect, urban fiction shares some common threads with [[dystopian]] or [[survivalist]] fiction. In the second wave of urban fiction, some variations of this model have been seen.

===Western===
Stories in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] genre are set in the [[American Old West|American West]], between the time of the Civil war and the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Readers' Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction|last = Saricks|first = Joyce|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-0-8389-0989-8|location = |pages = 313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting of a wilderness or uncivilized area is especially important to the genre, and the setting is often described richly and in-depth. They focus on the adventure of the main character(s) and the contrast between civilization or society and the untamed wilderness, often featuring the characters working to bring civilization to the wilderness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genreflecting|last = Orr|first = Cynthia|publisher = |year = |isbn = 978-1-59884-841-0|location = |pages = 208–209}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genre periodically overlaps with historical fiction, and while a more traditional definition of westerns is that of stories about lone men facing the frontier, more modern definitions and writings are often expanded to include any person or persons in this time period that feature a strong tone of the contrast between civilization and wilderness and emphasize the independence of the main character(s).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Film and television formats and genres==
{{See also|Film genre}}
Genres are listed under the sub-sectioned formats:

===Animation===
{{See also|Animation}}

* [[Traditional animation]]: also known as "cel (short for celluloid) animation", this is one of the oldest animation subgenres. Basically, it is a way of animating a [[cartoon]] by drawing and painting pictures by hand. Each drawing or painting is a different frame of animation, and when they are flipped or put in sequence at the right speed, they give the illusion of movement. Examples are ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[Spirited Away]]''.
* [[Animated series]]: created or adapted with a common series title, usually related to one another and can appear as much as up to once a week or daily during a prescribed time slot. Animated cartoon series also approved ly outside broadcast television, as was the case for the ''Tom and Jerry'' short films that appeared in movie theaters from 1961 to 1962. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a miniseries, a definite end, or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes.
* [[Stop motion]]: similar to traditional animation; instead of using hand drawn pictures, stop motion films are made with small figurines or other objects that have their picture taken many times over a sequence of small movements to create animation frames. Examples are ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', ''[[Coraline]]'', and ''[[Corpse Bride]]''.
* [[Computer-generated imagery]] (CGI): A genre of animation that includes animating a cartoon on a computer modeling program. Models of characters or props are created on the computer, and then programmed to do something specific. Then, when the animation is completely programmed, the computer can play a completely computer generated movie. CGI is often used for the visual effects in Live Action films as well. Examples are ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' or ''[[Toy Story]]''.
* [[Puppetry]]: It is technically live action, but puppetry is a different way of "animating" a movie, and puppets are often used in lieu of live actors. Usually, there are small figurines or figures (similar to stop motion), but these are controlled and filmed in real time. Like CGI, puppetry can be found in live-action films as a method of achieving a special effect. Examples are ''[[The Muppets]]'' and ''[[The Dark Crystal]]''.

===Live-action scripted===
* [[Dramatic television series|Drama]]:
** [[Adult content]]: the portrayal of sexual or sensual subject matter for the purpose of sexual arousal. A distinction is also made between [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] and [[hardcore pornography]]. Softcore pornography can generally be described as focusing on nude modeling or suggestive, but not explicit, simulations of sexual activity, whereas hardcore pornography explicitly showcases [[Sexual penetration|penetrative intercourse]] or other sex acts.
** [[Quality television|Art television]] (also called "quality television"): shares some of the same traits of [[art film]]s. [[Television show]]s such as [[David Lynch]]'s  ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' series and [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Singing Detective]]'' also have "...a loosening of causality, a greater emphasis on psychological or anecdotal realism, violations of classical clarity of space and time, explicit authorial comment, and ambiguity."
** [[Action film|Action]]: where one or more heroes are thrust into a series of challenges that typically include physical feats, extended combat scenes, violence and frenetic chases. Action films tend to feature a resourceful character struggling against incredible odds, including life-threatening situations, a villain, or a pursuit, which generally conclude in victory for the hero.
** [[Adventure film|Adventure]]: features the hero in action scenes that display and explore exotic locations. The subgenres of adventure films include swashbuckler film, disaster films, and historical dramas—which is similar to the epic film genre. Main plot elements include quests for lost continents, a jungle or desert settings, characters going on a treasure hunts and heroic journeys into the unknown. Adventure films are mostly set in a period background and may include adapted stories of historical or fictional adventure heroes within the historical context. Kings, battles, rebellion or piracy are commonly seen in adventure films. Adventure films may also be combined with other movie genres such as, science fiction, fantasy and sometimes war films.
** [[Courtroom drama]]: presents fictional drama about law. Law enforcement, crime, detective-based mystery solving, lawyer work, civil litigation, etc., are all possible focuses of legal dramas. Common subgenres of legal dramas include detective dramas, police dramas, courtroom dramas, legal thrillers, etc.
** [[Detective fiction]]: a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detective&amp;nbsp;– either professional or amateur&amp;nbsp;– investigates a crime, often murder.
** [[Docudrama]]: A program depicting some sort of historical or current news event, with specific changes or fabrications for legal, continuity or entertainment reasons. Depending on the quality of the feature and intended audience, these changes can minimally or completely change the story in relation to the actual events. These programs often depict crime or criminals but can also be used to depict heroics or tell a less-explored side of a well-known story. Example: ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'' by Paul Greengrass depicts the events aboard [[United Airlines Flight 93]] on September 11, 2001 via reconstruction from the available evidence. Since the specific words the passengers exchanged while planning their assault on the cockpit will never be known, the filmmakers created the dialogue based on research and evidence. [[The Onion Field]] is another example. This genre is often criticized for creating sensationalized programs intended to capitalize on public interest in lurid news stories; in the case of the [[Scott Peterson]] murder trial, a [[The Perfect Husband: The Laci Peterson Story|docudrama]] starring [[Dean Cain]] was filmed and aired during jury deliberations.
** [[Fantasy television|Fantasy]]: featuring elements of the fantastic, often including magic, supernatural forces, or exotic fantasy worlds. Fantasy television programs are often based on tales from mythology and folklore, or are adapted from fantasy stories in other media. The boundaries of fantasy television overlap with science fiction and horror.
** [[Horror film|Horror]] is a film genre seeking to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on the audience's primal fears. Horror films often feature scenes that startle the viewer; the macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Thus they may overlap with the fantasy, supernatural, and thriller genres.
** [[Legal drama]]: Legal drama sometimes overlap with crime drama, most notably in the case of the show ''Law &amp; Order''.
** [[Medical drama]]: based around a team of medics helping patients who have been involved in accidents serious or otherwise. Most commonly, an accident occurs that requires the medics to help the injured. Most are usually based around a hospital, with some based around a mobile medical team etc. Examples of this genre are [[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]], [[Holby City]] and [[ER (TV series)|ER]].
** [[Police procedural]]: pioneered by the popular show ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''. The stories revolve around a crime that has been committed and must be solved by the end of the episode following a very generic and usually unchanging structure of events. The crime is committed, witnesses are questioned, an arrest occurs, and then a judicial conclusion wraps it up. As the name implies, the show communicates everything "by the book," as it would happen in real life. In such modern police procedurals, such as [[Law &amp; Order]], you see and hear even the officers reading freshly arrested criminals their [[Miranda rights]]. Not quite as dramatic or action-oriented as the [[Dick Tracy]]-style of detective shows.
***Philosophical and psychological drama (PPP): A genre of film that's primary focus is crime drama, told from the angle of different psychological conditions, that debates philosophies and psychology of the era depicted in film. Examples are ''[[True Detective]]'' and ''[[Mindhunters]]''.
** [[Political drama]] is a [[TV program]] that has a [[politics|political]] component, whether reflecting the author's political opinion, or describing a [[politician]] or series of political events. [[Dramatist]]s who have written political dramas include [[Aaron Sorkin]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Caryl Churchill]], and [[Federico García Lorca]]. [[Television series]] that can be classified as political drama include ''[[Yes Minister]]'', its sequel ''[[Yes, Prime Minister]]'', ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', ''[[Borgen (TV series)|Borgen]]'', ''[[Boss (TV series)|Boss]]'', ''[[Jack and Bobby]]'', ''[[The Bold Ones: The Senator]]'', ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'', and ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.
** [[Science-fiction]]
** [[Teen drama]]
** [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]
** [[Western (genre)|Western series]]: set in the American West and embody the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the new frontier. Western series use stock characters such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, and buckskins, use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival, and ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.
* [[Television comedy|Comedy]]:
** [[Action comedy]]: A subgenre of [[comedy]] that emphasizes physically humorous antics, unorthodox body-language and oftentimes exasperating situations. Examples are: [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Jackie Chan]], and [[Lucille Ball]].
** [[Comedy-drama]]
** [[Mockumentary]]: A story that employs the style of the documentary to present fictional, and generally humorous, events or characters. Very common in film and [[television program]]s, both as a full film or series, or as a brief sequence or episode within a larger work. Examples include ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best In Show]]''.
** [[Romantic comedy]] (aka Rom-com)

** [[Sketch comedy]]

===Live-action unscripted===
* [[Documentary film|Documentary]]: a feature-length or near-feature-length film depicting a real-world event or person, told in a journalistic style (if told in a literary narrative style the result is often a docudrama).

* [[Instructional television|Instructional]]: the use of television programs in the field of distance education. Educational television programs on instructional television may be less than one half hour long (generally 15 minutes in length) to help their integration into the classroom setting. These shows are often accompanied by teachers' guides that include material to help use this program in lessons. Instructional television programs are often shown during the daytime on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations in the United States. However, fewer public television stations devote their airtime to ITV today than they do in the past; these days, ITV programs are either seen on a digital subchannel of Non-commercial educational public television station, or passed on to a local educational-access television channel run by a Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV organization.

The number of specialty channels has increased during the 1990s and 2000s while the previously common concept of countries having just a few (national) TV stations addressing all interest groups and demographics became increasingly outmoded, as it already had been for some time in several countries. About 65% of today's satellite channels are specialty channels.

==Video game genres==
{{Main|Video game genre||List of video game genres}}

Genres in video games are somewhat different from other forms of art as most video game genres are based on the way in which the player interacts with the game. All genres from all other types of media can be applied to video games but are secondary to the genre types described below.

Genres unique to video games:

* Arcade games:
** Classic/Vintage: Games that require the player to navigate a maze or other obstacle.
* [[Shooter game|Shooter]]: Where the main purpose is to fight using guns.
** [[First-person shooter]] (FPS): A variant of the shooting game. In the game, the camera is actually in place of the character's eyes, so that you are playing the game from the character's view, looking down the barrel of a gun.
*** [[Massively multiplayer online first-person shooters|Massively multiplayer online First-person shooter]] (MMOFPS): An online gaming genre set in a persistent world with a large number of simultaneous players in a first-person shooter fashion. These games provide large-scale, sometimes team-based combat.
** [[Third-person shooter]]: A shooting game where the camera angle is actually hovering over the playable character as you play.
* [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]: Where the purpose is to strategize. You have an opponent with the same abilities as you, more or less, and to beat him, you must use your abilities in a much more tactical way.
** [[Real-time strategy]] (RTS): Where everybody plays at the same time, and races to think of a better strategy than the other players. Most of these video games are about military.
*** [[Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy]] (MMORTS): A Real Time Strategy game that is played online. Many players can sign on a play at the same time, creating empires and battling each other.
** [[Turn-based strategy]]: Where everybody takes turns. Once everybody has placed their units and military characters in the right spot they can't move again until the next turn begins. This structure is prominently used in [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]].
** [[Tower defense]]: Where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack.
* [[Music video game|Musical]]: Where music is usually played. To win, the players must match the rhythm of the music by pushing the right button combination until their opponents are unable to keep up with them. Not to be confused with the [[stage musical]] or [[musical film]], which are stories that feature characters singing about the events in the plot.
* [[Simulation game|Simulation]]: Where you must manage and develop fictitious business. For example, in a game you might be asked to manage and build a zoo, and the game simulates this for you in as accurate a way as possible.
** Simulation shooter: Features the basic mechanics of a shooter, where using a gun is the primary method of gameplay, but emphasizes realism, often incorporating features like ballistics and realistic character damage.
** Simulation strategy: A strategy game that emphasizes realism, such as the [[Total War (series)|Total War]] series of games, usually focusing on a specific time and location in human history, such as the [[Roman Empire]].
* [[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]]: Where you must solve puzzles to progress through the levels.
* [[Party game|Party]]: Mostly suitable for multiple players and social gatherings. In most of these, the player or players compete or cooperate in smaller games, or [[minigame]]s, within the main game.
* [[Platform game|Platform]]: Where the player must jump onto various platforms to evade obstacles and reach their goal, these games are fairly linear most of the time with levels adhering to a simple A to B structure.
* [[Fighting game|Fighting]]: Where two or more playable characters fight. Each character usually has their own unique moves, and the goal of the game, usually, is to be the last man standing.
* [[Racing video game|Racing game]]: Either in the first-person or third-person perspective, in which the player partakes in a racing competition with any type of land, air, or sea vehicles. They may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to entirely fantastical settings. In general, they can be distributed along a spectrum anywhere between hardcore simulations, and simpler arcade racing games. Racing games may also fall under the category of sports games.
* [[Role-playing game (video games)|Role-playing game]] (RPG): A game that is not (necessarily) about combat. It is a game where the player plays a character, and goes around pretending to be a real person in a fictitious world. This is also similar to non-video game forms of gaming that involve roleplaying, including [[play by post gaming]] and [[tabletop roleplaying game]]s.
** [[Massive multiplayer online role playing game]] (MMORPG): Similar to a regular Role Playing Game, but it is a multiplayer game played via the [[internet]]. During this game, thousands of players from around the world can play the same game at the same time and chat with each other. Players sign onto the game and complete quests while exploring the virtual world. Many MMORPGs are free to play by just signing up on the specific game site and downloading the game file but some require a monthly fee.
* Sports games: Games that simulate playing real-life sports.
* [[Survival Horror|Survival/horror]]: The player is placed in a horrifying situation of which they must escape. The major emphasis of most survival horror games is placed upon tension and a truly terrifying or grisly scenario. Puzzle-solving is a major characteristic of the genre. Examples of survival horror games include the ''Resident Evil'', ''Silent Hill'' and ''Clock Tower'' series.
* [[Stealth game|Stealth]]: The player must proceed through an environment or complete an objective without being seen.

==Music genres==
{{Main|Music genre|List of music styles}}

* [[Film score]]: is music produced specifically to accommodate a film. 
* [[Gospel music]]: is a music genre in [[Christian music]].
* [[Medieval music]]: Music composed from around the middle of the 5th century to the middle of the 15th century, largely characterized by monophonic and polyphonic music.
* [[Renaissance music]]: largely composed from the middle of the 15th century to around 1600.
* [[Baroque music]]: composed from around 1600 to the middle of the 18th century. Much Baroque music is written in the form of dance suites.
* [[Classical music|Classical]]: Music that was composed from around the middle of the 18th century until the early 19th century. The key musical forms were the symphony, the concerto, and the sonata. Also includes some more recently written music ([[Neo-classical music|Neo-classical]]) that contains many of the same musical elements.
* [[Romantic music|Romantic]]: composed from the early 19th century to about 1900, which emphasized dramatic themes and subject matter. Also includes more recently written music ([[Neo-romanticism (music)|Neo-romantic]]) that contains similar musical elements.

* [[Opera]], [[Operette]] and [[Zarzuela]]
* [[Folk music|Folk]]: adaptations of old stories that were passed from generation to generation. Considered somewhat more niche now. Also see [[Neofolk]], [[Neofolk|Folk Noir]], [[Neofolk|Pagan Folk]].
* [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]]: is a form of [[American roots music]], with roots in the English, Irish, and Scottish traditional music, a notable [[blues]] and [[jazz]] influence and a high lonesome sound, being later influenced by the music of African-Americans. Unlike country music, bluegrass is mostly accompanied by acoustic [[stringed instruments]].
* [[Country music]]: American popular music that began in the rural regions of the Southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from southeastern American folk music and Western music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, fiddles, and harmonicas.
The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.
* [[Rock music|Rock]]: originated from folk and blues. It used newer electrical instruments instead of relying solely on the classical woodwinds and stringed instruments. It first became popular in the mid-20th century because of famous bands like [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]].
** [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]]: Similar to rock, and generally considered a subgenre of it. It usually uses the same electrical instruments, but the music is more intense and less "pop" in style (see below) such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Metallica]].
** [[Punk rock]]: developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Includes work by [[The Adverts]], the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Clash]].
* [[Pop music|Pop]]: once referred to any popular music during the time period, though the term has slowly gained use as a more specific (yet still somewhat vague) genre descriptor for music with a catchy, relatively consistent melody, among other aspects. It is commonly placed as having started in the mid-20th century, alongside rock music. Much [[dance music]] falls under this genre, and much modern rock music is considered to include elements of it as well, since bands such as the Beatles were a significant stylistic influence on what is now considered pop.
* [[Rhythm and blues]] (R&amp;B): an evolving range of [[Music genre|genres]] of [[Popular music|popular]] [[African-American music]] that first began to develop in the early 20th century.
** [[Blues]]: A somewhat somber, quieter style of music whose name refers to the unhappiness of the performer. These became popular in the early 20th century alongside [[jazz]], and influenced the early development of rock music. A major genre within R&amp;B, and one of its earliest genres as well.
** [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]]: more [[rhythm]]ically based, mostly African-American urban-derived genres, with a wide array of subgenres between them.
** [[Funk]]: A intense [[Groove (music)|groovy]] style of music popular in the mid 20th century that contributed to the development of disco. 
** [[Jazz]]: originated at the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of African and European music traditions. Jazz has, from its early 20th-century inception, spawned a variety of subgenres, from New Orleans Dixieland dating from the early 1910s, big band-style swing from the 1930s and 1940s, bebop from the mid-1940s, a variety of Latin jazz fusions such as Afro-Cuban and Brazilian jazz from the 1950s and 1960s, jazz-rock fusion from the 1970s and late 1980s developments such as acid jazz, which blended jazz influences into funk and hip-hop.
* [[Electronic music]]: employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production. It consists of a number of separate genres, many of which are still evolving. One major category within this form of music is electronic dance music (EDM), with its own multitude of genres and subgenres, which is primarily associated with the dance and club scene.
** [[Breakbeat]]: usually characterized by the use of a {{clarify span|non-straightened|date=February 2013}} 4/4 drum pattern (as opposed to the steady beat of [[house music|house]] or [[trance music|trance]]). Includes work by [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Davy DMX]], [[Music Instructor]] and [[Bomfunk MC's]].

The '''Lyceum Theatre''' (pronounced ly-CEE-um) is a 2,100-seat [[West End theatre]] located in the [[City of Westminster]], on Wellington Street, just off the [[Strand, London|Strand]].  The origins of the theatre date to 1765. Managed by [[Samuel James Arnold|Samuel Arnold]], from 1794 to 1809 the building hosted a variety of entertainments including a circus produced by [[Philip Astley]], a chapel, and the first London [[Wax museum|exhibition of waxworks]] displayed by [[Madame Tussaud]]. From 1816 to 1830, it served as '''The English Opera House'''. After a fire, the house was rebuilt and reopened on 14 July 1834 to a design by [[Samuel Beazley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/art/architecture/classical/3.html The Victorian Web]&lt;/ref&gt; The building was unique in that it has a balcony overhanging the dress circle. It was built by the partnership of [[Samuel Morton Peto|Peto &amp; Grissell]]. The theatre then played opera, adaptations of [[Charles Dickens]] novels and [[James Planché]]'s "fairy extravaganzas", among other works.

From 1871 to 1902, [[Henry Irving]] appeared at the theatre in, especially, [[Shakespeare]], usually starring opposite [[Ellen Terry]]. In 1904 the theatre was almost completely rebuilt and richly ornamented in [[Rococo]] style by [[Bertie Crewe]], but it retained Beazley's [[façade]] and grand [[portico]]. It played mostly [[melodrama]] over the ensuing decades. The building closed in 1939 and was set to be demolished, but it was saved and converted into a [[Mecca Leisure Group|Mecca]] Ballroom in 1951, styled the '''Lyceum Ballroom''', where many well-known bands played. The Lyceum was closed in 1986 but restored to theatrical use in 1996 by Holohan Architects.&lt;ref&gt;Earl and Sells (2000), pp. 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, the theatre has hosted ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]''.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1765, a building was erected on an adjacent site by the architect James Payne for the exhibitions of The Society of Artists, which disbanded three years later when the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] succeeded it. The building was then leased out for dances and other entertainments, including musical entertainments by [[Charles Dibdin]]. Famed actor [[David Garrick]] also performed there. In 1794, the composer [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold Sr]] rebuilt the interior of the building, making it into a proper theatre, but through the opposition of the existing [[patent theatre]]s, he was not granted a patent. Therefore, he leased it to other entertainments again, including [[Philip Astley]], who brought his circus there when his [[Astley's Amphitheatre|amphitheatre]] was burned down at Westminster. It was also used as a chapel, a concert room, and for the first London [[Wax museum|exhibition of waxworks]] displayed by [[Madame Tussauds]] in 1802.&lt;ref&gt;Pope, W. Macqueen and Ronald Mayes. [http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/LyceumTheatre.htm "The Lyceum Theatre, Wellington Street, London"], Arthur Lloyd, accessed 16 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre finally became a [[Patent theatre|licensed]] house in 1809, and until 1812 it was used for dramatic performances by the Drury Lane Company after the burning of their own [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|theatre]], until the erection of the new edifice. It staged one of the earliest [[tableaux vivants]], as part of William Dimond's ''The Peasant Boy'' in 1811.&lt;ref name=Altick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altick|first1=Richard|title=The Shows of London|date=1878|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, Samuel Arnold rebuilt the house to a design by Beazley and opened it as The English Opera House, but it was destroyed by fire in 1830. The house was famous for hosting the London première of [[Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' (9 May 1811)&lt;ref name="Londontown profile of the theatre"&gt;[http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Entertainment/Lion_King_-_Lyceum_Theatre/04ff/ Londontown profile of the theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; and as the first theatre in Britain to have its stage lit by gas (6 August 1817).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatres Compete in Race to Install Gas Illumination – 1817|url=http://www.overthefootlights.co.uk/1817-18.pdf|work=Over The Footlights|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the "[[Beefsteak Club|Sublime Society of Beef Steaks]],"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sublimesocietyofbeefsteaks.org/ History of the Sublime Society of Beef Steaks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512123242/http://sublimesocietyofbeefsteaks.org/ |date=12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been founded in 1735 by theatre manager Henry Rich, had its home at the theatre for over 50 years until 1867. The members, who never exceeded twenty-four in number, met every Saturday night to eat beefsteaks and drink port wine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.uoguelph.ca/~swatland/rep239nr.htm Information about the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, the present house opened slightly to the west, with a frontage on Wellington Street,&lt;ref&gt;Wellington Street was a new thoroughfare constructed between [[Waterloo Bridge]] and [[Bow Street]]. The former site became an unsuccessful arcade, which was demolished to build the [[Strand Musick Hall]] (sic), another unsuccessful venture. In 1868, the auditorium was rebuilt and it reopened as the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]].&lt;/ref&gt; under the name '''Theatre Royal Lyceum and English Opera House'''. The theatre was again designed by Beazley and cost £40,000.  The new house championed English opera rather than the Italian operas that had played earlier in the century.&lt;ref name=Ivanhoe&gt;Gordon-Powell, Robin. ''Ivanhoe'', full score, Introduction, vol. I, p. VII, 2008, The Amber Ring&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[John Barnett]] produced a number of works in the first few years of the theatre, including ''[[The Mountain Sylph]]'' (1834), credited as the first modern English [[opera]]. It was followed by ''Fair Rosamund'' in 1837 and ''Farinelli'' in 1839 (both at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]),&lt;ref name=Ivanhoe/&gt; and ''Blanche of Jersey'' here in 1840.  In 1841–43, composer [[Michael William Balfe]] managed the theatre and produced National Opera here, but the venture was ultimately unsuccessful. From 1844 to 1847 the theatre was managed by husband and wife team [[Robert Keeley (comedian)|Robert Keeley]] and [[Mary Anne Keeley]], during which period the house became associated with adaptations of [[Charles Dickens]]'s novels and Christmas books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Summary of the theatre's history]&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an adaptation of Dickens' ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' ran for over 100 performances from 1844–45 here, a long run for the time.

The Lyceum was later managed by Madame [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris]] and [[Charles James Mathews]] from 1847–55, who produced [[James Planché]]'s "[fairy] extravaganzas" featuring spectacular stage effects.  Their first big success was [[John Maddison Morton]]'s ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]''.  [[Tom Taylor]]'s adaptation of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', with Dickens himself as consultant, played in 1860, shortly after end of its serialisation and volume publication.  [[Charles Fechter]], who managed the theatre from 1863–67 also favored spectacular productions. In 1866, [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''The Long Strike'' (his adaptation of [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s Manchester novels ''Mary Barton'' and ''Lizzie Leigh'') was produced here.  [[Ethel Lavenu]], the mother and grandmother of actors [[Tyrone Power, Sr.]] and [[Tyrone Power]] performed in a number pieces at the theatre in the 1860s.  [[W. S. Gilbert]] produced three plays here. In 1863, his first professional play, ''Uncle Baby'', premièred.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther (2011), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1867, he presented his Christmas [[pantomime]], called ''[[Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren]]'', and in 1884, he produced the drama ''Comedy and Tragedy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/gilbert/plays/harlequin/times1867.html "Lyceum Theatre",] ''The Times'', 27 December 1867; Howarth, Paul. [http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/gilbert/plays/com_trag/index.html "Comedy and Tragedy"], Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 14 August 2011, accessed 4 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, the world's finest Italian dramatic tenor, [[Francesco Tamagno]], appeared at the Lyceum, singing the leading role in the first London production of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Otello]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Irving years===
[[File:Henry Irving portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry Irving|Sir Henry Irving]]]]
Beginning in 1871, under manager [[Hezekiah Linthicum Bateman]] and his wife, [[Henry Irving]] appeared at the theatre in, among other things, many [[Shakespeare]] works. Irving began with the French [[melodrama]] ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', an instant hit in which he played the ghost-haunted burgomaster. The piece ran to sell-out crowds for 150 nights, which was an unusually long run at the time.  ''Charles I'', in 1872 was another hit, running for 180 nights. In 1874, Irving played ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the theatre, perhaps his greatest triumph, running for 200 nights.  In 1878, after Bateman's death, Irving took over management of the theatre from his widow. ''The Builder'', 28 September 1878 reported that there was a difference between Irving and Mrs. Bateman regarding the personnel of the company at the Lyceum.  "Mr. Irving is said to have told Mrs. Bateman that he was resolved to have actors to act with him, and not dolls, otherwise he would no longer play at the Lyceum. The result was that Mrs. Bateman threw up the management of the theatre, and Mr. Irving takes her place."  Mrs. Bateman became the manager of [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/landlord.htm Description of ownership of the Lyceum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614112443/http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/landlord.htm |date=14 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving continued to star in plays there, especially Shakespeare, until 1902, engaging co-star [[Ellen Terry]] for that entire period of 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/collections/object.php?object_id=343 Description of the Terry and Irving partnership and link to further information about Terry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504212410/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/collections/object.php?object_id=343 |date=4 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bram Stoker]] worked between 1878 and 1898 as business manager of the theatre, and Irving was Stoker's real-life inspiration for the character [[Count Dracula]] in his 1897 novel, ''[[Dracula]]''. Stoker hoped that Irving, with his dramatic, sweeping gestures, gentlemanly mannerisms, and speciality in playing villain roles, would play Dracula in the stage adaptation of his novel. However, Irving never agreed to appear in the stage version, although the play was produced at the Lyceum.

Irving and Terry began with ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 1878. Their  1879 production of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' ran for an unusual 250 nights, and success followed success in the Shakespeare canon as well as in other major plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ACterry.htm Information from Schoolnet.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030232953/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ACterry.htm |date=30 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other  celebrated productions included ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6162 Information from Findagrave.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]'' by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] (1878), ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'', ''The Lyons Mail'' by Charles Reade (1883), the immensely popular ''Faust'' by William Gorman Wills (1885, which even drew applications for reserved seats from foreigners), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1888, with incidental music by Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/sullivan/macbeth/index.html "Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's ''Macbeth''], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 January 2005, accessed 21 August 2016; Hugill, Robert.

Comyns Carr]], with incidental music by Sir Arthur Sullivan (1895),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c20th.com/GSearly.htm Information about ''King Arthur'' including an image of the program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720182507/http://www.c20th.com/GSearly.htm |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (1896) and [[Victorien Sardou]] and [[Émile Moreau (playwright)|Émile Moreau]]'s play ''Madame Sans-Gêne'' (1897).

When Irving and Terry toured America, as they did several times beginning in 1883, the theatre played works with many famous actors including [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]], [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]], [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Eleonora Duse]].  Martin Harvey, a pupil of Irving's played a season there in 1899. [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin]] appeared as [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]] in the summer of 1898.

===Later years===
[[File:KingArthurS.jpg|right|thumb|''King Arthur'' at the theatre, 1895]]
After being bought by [[Thomas Barrasford]], in 1904 the theatre was rebuilt and richly ornamented in [[rococo]] style by [[Bertie Crewe]], retaining only the façade and portico of the original building. The theatre presented [[music hall]] and [[Variety (magazine)|variety]], in an attempt to compete with the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] and the new Stoll built [[Coliseum Theatre|London Coliseum]], but this was not a success, and the theatre soon returned to presenting drama. From 1909–38 the Melville Brothers ran a successful series of spectacular melodramas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uklondontheatretickets.com/lyceumtheatre.html Profile of the theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207093150/http://www.uklondontheatretickets.com/lyceumtheatre.html |date=7 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, additional minor alterations to the theatre were made by Edward Jones. Between the wars, dramas played at the theatre for ten months each year, followed by Christmas pantomimes, including ''Queen of Hearts'' in 1938. The Lyceum was the last London theatre to continue the early practice of concluding pantomimes with a [[harlequinade]], a free standing entertainment of slapstick clowning, juggling and tumbling. The tradition ended with the closure of the theatre in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-behind-you.com/development.html ''The Development of Pantomime'' (It's Behind You!)] accessed 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the [[London County Council]] bought the building, with plans to demolish it to make room for road improvement. The theatre closed that year with a landmark performance of ''Hamlet'' directed by Sir [[John Gielgud]] (Ellen Terry's great nephew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lyceum Theatre – 'Hamlet' by William Shakespeare|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=29 June 1939|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The road improvement plans collapsed, and after the war, in 1945, it was converted to a huge ballroom and reopened by Matthews and Sons, as the '''Lyceum Ballroom'''. The [[Miss World]] contest was staged at the venue every year from 1951 to 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missworld.com/History/1951/ "1951"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411085310/http://www.missworld.com/History/1951/ |date=11 April 2013 }}, Miss World pageant, accessed 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Many big bands played here, including the [[Oscar Rabin Band]] which performed frequently. In the 1960s and 1970s, the theatre was used as a pop concert venue and for television broadcasts. [[The Grateful Dead]], [[The Groundhogs]], [[The Clash]], [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Police]], [[The Who]], [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]], [[U2]], [[The Smiths]] and [[Culture Club]] all played here.&lt;ref name="Londontown profile of the theatre"/&gt; Bob Marley and the Wailers recorded their ''[[Live! (Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers album)|Live!]]'' album here on 18–19 July 1975. [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] filmed a performance there in May 1980 for broadcast on the ''[[Old Grey Whistle Test]]''. This footage appears on the 2007 CD/DVD re-release of their 1980 album ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]''.

[[File:Lyceum Theatre 2.jpg|thumb|left|Side view of the theatre in 2006, with red ''Lion King'' displays visible]]
A proposed redevelopment of [[Covent Garden]] by the [[Greater London Council|GLC]] in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby [[Vaudeville Theatre|Vaudeville]], [[Garrick Theatre|Garrick]], [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]] and [[Duchess Theatre|Duchess theatre]]s. An active campaign by [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]], the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]], and theatre owners under the auspices of the ''Save London Theatres Campaign'' led to the abandonment of the scheme.&lt;ref name=Vaud&gt;&lt;cite&gt;[http://www.vaudevilletheatre.org.uk/ Vaudeville Theatre] accessed 28 March 2007&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the theatre gained protection and was [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] as ''Interior despite adaptation and alteration for present ballroom use retains [a] substantial part of Crewe's work''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=207546 English Heritage listing details] accessed 27 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre went dark in 1986, after the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre's]] promenade performances (in 1985) of [[Bill Bryden]]'s adaptation of the ''[[The Mysteries (play)|Mysteries]]'' trilogy. Brent Walker leased the theatre during this time but later gave up his lease, and in 1996 it was restored and reconverted into a theatre for large-scale musicals or opera (with a suitably large orchestra pit) by Holohan Architects.  A production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' played from 1996 to 1998.

The theatre has been home to the [[musical theatre]] version of ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' since 1999.  To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the production, which has grossed over £289 million and been seen by more than eight million people, 250 former cast members gathered onstage, together with designer-director [[Julie Taymor]].  Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and actor [[James Earl Jones]], who voiced the role of King Mufasa in the original Disney animated film, attended the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cavendish, Dominic.

The '''‘Made in Russia’''' national [[brand]] is a Russian communication project aimed at promoting and raising awareness of Russia’s [[export|exports]], [[business]], and culture in both domestic and foreign [[market (economics)|markets]]. 
The project was created by a team of professional translators, designers, marketers, and foreign trade specialists with the goal of improving communication - in every sense of the word - between Russian companies and international audiences.

Amongst its other activities, ‘Made in Russia’ is working to promote the country’s non-commodity goods, attracting necessary partners and target audiences through media platforms, a multi-lingual online portal, catalogues with information about domestic export companies, and a unified corporate style: visual identification systems combining all Russian exports.  
The concept and logo of ‘Made in Russia’ have been included in the second edition of an international textbook on branding called Nation Branding. Keith Dinnie, the author of the book, is a PhD candidate, an expert on branding, and a leading business school lecturer at Middlesex University in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandhorizons.com/book/nation-branding-concepts-issues-practice-2nd-edition Nation Branding: Concepts, Issues, Practice (2nd Edition) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Logo and corporate style''' 
[[File:MadeInRussiaLogoEn.jpg|thumb|The "Made In Russia" logo]]

"Commercial use of Made in Russia"
[[File:"Made in Russia" printed on a "Raketa" shoping bag (2).jpg|thumb|"Made in Russia" printed on a shopping bag]]

The logo for ‘Made in Russia’ is a combination of a bar code and birch bark texture. References to business, goods production and sales, and the rich culture and history of Russian entrepreneurship are all included in the logo.

The ‘Made in Russia’ logo has been legally registered in all Nice 45 classes ([[International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services|International Classification of Goods and Services]]).

The logo and corporate style of ‘Made in Russia’ have already become a visual support element used by Russian exporters in business missions around the world organized by the Russian Ministry for Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mid.ru/maps/cu/-/asset_publisher/ZCoR8WfDPJng/content/id/1920362/pop_up?_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_viewMode=print&amp;_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_qrIndex=0 http://www.mid.ru/maps/cu/-/asset_publisher/ZCoR8WfDPJng/content/id/1920362/pop_up?_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_viewMode=print&amp;_101_INSTANCE_ZCoR8WfDPJng_qrIndex=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rights to use the national brand’s logo'''

Companies that are registered, pay taxes, and create jobs in Russia are eligible to use the logo. All companies are selected and approved by the project’s expert advisory board. The logo is issued free of charge for a period of one year, with the possibility of extension upon entrance into the ‘Made in Russia’ register.

Foreign companies may also qualify for the logo if they have joint ventures in Russia or have localized their business inside the country.

'''Official ‘Made in Russia’ portal'''

There is currently a multi-lingual portal  www.madeinrussia.ru and media platform for promoting Russian exporters, and catalogues about Russian export companies have also been created.

'''International presentation of the ‘Made in Russia’ national brand'''

The ‘Made in Russia’ national brand was presented to the international business community at the [[Expo 2015|Milan EXPO 2015]] exhibition. Its presentation comprised part of Made in Russia Day at the Russian pavilion with the participation of Igor Shuvalov, the first deputy prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.wn.com/view/2015/06/06/The_First_VicePremier_Igor_Shuvalov_promotes_the_Made_in_Rus/ http://article.wn.com/view/2015/06/06/The_First_VicePremier_Igor_Shuvalov_promotes_the_Made_in_Rus/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the project participated as an informational and visual partner in a number of events for Russian exporters both in Russia and abroad. As a result, a number of agreements were signed and contacts made, as well as an assessment of the prospects for exporting Russian products, which included a study of reactions to the new brand.

'''International experience'''
[[File:InternEng.jpg|thumb|The international branding experience]]

National brands are a common trend in many countries’ foreign policies. Similar promotion programs have been implemented in other nations.  The national brands ‘Made in…’ are also available in Germany, Canada, the USA, China, Italy, Belarus, India and other countries.

'''Expert opinion'''

“The ‘Made in Russia’ national brand offers a single system for image promotion to domestic exporters that includes a variety of tools to help Russian producers effectively present their products in the process of entering foreign markets.” (Alexey Tyupano, CEO of EXIAR) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/12/08_a_7942769.shtml http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/12/08_a_7942769.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The idea and conception of the ‘Made in Russia’ national brand seemed very interesting to me, and worthy to talk about with readers.” (author of the Nation Brand textbook on branding, Keith Dinnie – a PhD candidate, branding expert, leading business school lecturer at Middlesex University in London) &lt;ref&gt;[http://madeinrussia.ru/ru/news/98 http://madeinrussia.ru/ru/news/98]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The idea of patriotism in our time often turns into clowning... from this point of view, the website www.madeinrussia.ru is interesting. It gives a reasonable attempt, devoid of ridiculous patriotic jingoism, to summarize all brands and people whom our country can be proud of in every field - from Faberge, the jeweler to the tsars, to Igor Butman, the contemporary jazz musician.” (Leonid Kaganov, author and scriptwriter) &lt;ref&gt;[http://lleo.me/dnevnik/2013/10/11_madeinrussia.html http://lleo.me/dnevnik/2013/10/11_madeinrussia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The project aims to support and promote the best domestic achievements in various arenas: science, production, education, business, society, culture, and sports. It brings together companies that are developing their business in Russia and are creating new technologies - be it architecture, marketing, or sales - and through its work, promotes these achievements as a brand of Russian business.” (Irina Dobrokhotova, chairman of the board of directors at Best-Novostroy) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The ‘Made in Russia’ project is a powerful label integrator whose mission is to gather Russian companies and become a forceful consolidation tool for them. International experience suggests that such initiatives are both strong and promising.” (Alexey Andreyev, managing partner of Depot WPF branding agency) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depotwpf.ru/publications/414/ http://www.depotwpf.ru/publications/414/]&lt;/ref&gt;

“The open, cooperative nature of this initiative has been highlighted at the communicative level. It was important for the creator of this idea to show that it’s possible to receive government assistance quickly and easily.” (Elena Yufereva, CEO of Brandson Branding Agency) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml http://www.gazeta.ru/eksport/2015/06/25_a_6853881.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War II]], di Suvero immigrated to [[San Francisco]], [[California]] with his family in February 1941 aboard the [[USS Tasker H. Bliss (AP-42)|S.S. ''President Cleveland'']].&lt;ref name='si1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='si2'/&gt;&lt;ref name='whitney'/&gt;&lt;ref name='ledger'/&gt;&lt;ref name='sfmoma'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfmoma.org/about/press/press_exhibitions/releases/947 |title=NEW PARTNERSHIP LAUNCHES SFMOMA’S OFF-SITE PROGRAMMING WITH MAJOR OUTDOOR EXHIBITION OF MARK DI SUVERO’S SCULPTURES NEAR GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE |date=December 12, 2012 |website=sfmoma.org |publisher=[[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='heinz'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/mark-di-suvero |title=Heinz Awards Mark di Suvero biography |website=heinzawards.net |publisher=[[Heinz Foundations]] |accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Di Suvero attended [[City College of San Francisco]] from 1953 to 1954, followed by the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] from 1954 to 1955. He began creating sculptures while at UCSB after reflecting that he couldn't make an original contribution in his philosophy major. Under the guidance of Robert Thomas, who allowed di Suvero to take his sculpting course, his work began to flourish. He transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and graduated with a B.A. in philosophy in 1957.&lt;ref name='si1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='si2'/&gt;&lt;ref name='sfmoma'/&gt;&lt;ref name='heinz'/&gt;

===Career===
After graduating from college, di Suvero moved to [[New York City]] in 1957 to pursue a sculpting art career.  He worked part-time in construction and began to incorporate wood and metal from demolition sites into his work.&lt;ref name='si2'/&gt;&lt;ref name='heinz'/&gt;

Shortly before his first solo exhibition at [[Green Gallery]], di Suvero was involved in a near-fatal elevator accident on March 26, 1960, while working at a construction site. He suffered a broken back and severe spinal injures; doctors believed he wouldn't be able to walk again. While in rehabilitation, he learned to work with an arc welder which became critical for later pieces.  He made a recovery in four years and could walk without assistance by 1965. He is one of the sixteen artists included in the book [[Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists]] as a result of this accident and the subsequent effect it had upon his health.&lt;ref name='si2'/&gt;&lt;ref name='whitney'/&gt;&lt;ref name='sfmoma'/&gt;&lt;ref name='heinz'/&gt;

Di Suvero was a founding member of the [[Park Place Gallery]] in 1963 with [[Forrest Myers]], [[Leo Valledor]], [[Peter Forakis]], among others, until the Gallery's closure on July 31, 1967.&lt;ref name='heinz'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/exhibitions/paula-cooper |title=Art and Space: Park Place and the beginning of the Paula Cooper Gallery |last=Kirwin |first=Liza |website=aaa.si.edu |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] [[Archives of American Art]] |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blantonmuseum.org/exhibitions/details/reimagining_space_the_park_place_gallery_group_in_1960s_new_york/ |title=Reimagining Space: The Park Place Gallery Group in 1960s New York |website=blantonmuseum.org |publisher=[[Blanton Museum of Art]] |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Di Suvero protested the [[Vietnam War]], for which he was twice arrested, before he left the United States in 1971.&lt;ref name='si1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='wsj'&gt;{{cite news |last=Dawson |first=Jessica |date=September 2, 2014 |title=At 80, Sculptor Mark Di Suvero Is Still Mixing It Up in New York |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-80-sculptor-mark-di-suvero-is-still-mixing-it-up-in-new-york-1409714846 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=[[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] |accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his four-year self-exile, he exhibited his works in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], taught at the Università Internazionale dell'Arte, and lived in [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], [[France]] where he maintained one of his studios on a barge until 1989.&lt;ref name='si1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='ledger'/&gt;&lt;ref name='petaluma'&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennett |first=Don |date=June 5, 2013 |title=Petaluma home to famous artist |url=http://www.petaluma360.com/csp/mediapool/sites/PressDemocrat/News/story.csp?page=0 |newspaper=[[The Press Democrat]] |location=[[Santa Rosa, California]] |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His French barge, ''Rêve de signes'', has since been turned into La Vie des Formes, an atelier for emerging artists, which has been moored at [[Montceau-les-Mines]] since 2009.&lt;ref name='si1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='sculpture'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Castro |first=Jan Garden |date=June 2005 |title=To Make Meanings Real: A Conversation with Mark di Suvero |url=http://www.sculpture.org/documents/scmag05/june_05/disuvero/disuvero.shtml |journal=[[Sculpture (magazine)|Sculpture]] |publisher=[[International Sculpture Center]] |volume=24 |issue=5 |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Roux |first1=Camille |last2=Berry |first2=Gilles |date=May 5, 2013 |title=Bateau logement pour artistes |url=http://www.lejsl.com/edition-de-montceau-les-mines/2013/05/05/bateau-logement-pour-artistes |newspaper=[[Le Journal de Saône-et-Loire]] |language=French |location=[[Chalon-sur-Saône]], [[France]] |accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later returned to the United States and opened a studio in [[Petaluma, California]] in 1975.&lt;ref name='petaluma'/&gt;  While the Petaluma studio is still active, di Suvero moved to [[New York City]] and opened a studio there.&lt;ref name='wsj'/&gt;&lt;ref name='petaluma'/&gt;  He founded the Athena Foundation in 1977 and [[Socrates Sculpture Park]] in 1986, both of which function to assist artists.&lt;ref name='si1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='heinz'/&gt;

===Personal life===
Di Suvero currently lives in the [[Astoria, Queens]] neighborhood of [[New York City]] with his second wife, Kate D. Levin, whom he married in 1993, and daughter.&lt;ref name='si1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='wsj'/&gt;  Levin, a former [[City College of New York]] teacher, served as Commissioner of the [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs]] from 2002 to 2013, and has worked under the [[Ed Koch]] and [[Michael Bloomberg]] administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smu.edu/News/2014/kate-levin-ncar-11feb2014 |title=Kate D.

His early works were large outdoor pieces that incorporated wooden timbers from demolition buildings, tires, scrap metal and structural steel. This exploration has transformed over time into a focus on H-beams and heavy steel plates. Many of the pieces contain sections that are allowed to swing and rotate giving the overall forms a considerable degree of motion. He prides himself on his hands-on approach to the fabrication and installation of his work. Di Suvero pioneered the use of a crane as a sculptor's working tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |date=May 2013  |title=Mark Di Suvero's Path to Steel |url=http://www.sfmoma.org/explore/multimedia/videos/558 |access-date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his work includes:

* ''[[Snowplow (di Suvero)|Snowplow]]'' (1968)

Di Suvero's sculptures and career were the subjects of the 1977 film, ''[[North Star: Mark di Suvero]]''. The film was produced by François De Menil and by art historian [[Barbara Rose]], and featured music composed by [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Philip Glass: Music |url=http://www.philipglass.com/music/films/north_star.php |accessdate=2015-07-22 |publisher=unvagen Music Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title| 0121520|North Star: Mark di Suvero}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released as a DVD in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=North Star: Mark di Suvero |work=DVD Verdict |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/northstarmarkdisuvero.php |first=James A. |last=Stewart |date=April 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722203906/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/northstarmarkdisuvero.php |archivedate=July 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MexiCali Biennial''' is a contemporary visual arts organization which focuses on the border between California and Mexico as a region of aesthetic production. The organization is migratory in nature and showcases exhibitions on both sides of the border. The MexiCali Biennial was originally started as a project critiquing the proliferation of international and regional art [[biennials]] and as a result may be shown at any time and at any location. The inaugural exhibition was in 2006 and subsequent programming occurred in the years spanning 2009 through 2010 and again in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Luis|title=The MexiCali Biennial: A Binational Art Project|url=http://beyondbordersnews.com/2016/04/17/the-mexicali-biennial-a-binational-art-project/|website=Beyond Borders Gazette|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The MexiCali Biennial was conceived in 2006 by artists Ed Gomez and Luis G. Hernandez.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Christopher|title=Art review: At MexiCali Biennial, cannibalism is consuming theme|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/28/entertainment/la-et-cm-0129-mexicali-biennial-review-20130129|website=LATimes.com|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Pilar Tompkins-Rivas was a founding member and curator of the inaugural exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pilar Tompkins:Mentors|url=http://btwconnect.com/pilar-tompkins-rivas|website=BTWConnect}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 round of programming first took place at La Casa de la Tia Tina, an artist-run space on the border town of [[Mexicali]], MX before traveling to Chavez Studios in East Los Angeles. Due to the nature of the biennial's programming, the second biennial didn't occur until 2009 through 2010, during which time it took place in four different locations in both Mexico and California. Dr. Amy Pederson Converse joined the board and served as co-curator for the 2009-2013 programming. Pederson Converse was instrumental in conceptualizing the theme for the third MexiCali Biennial, which was cannibalism, specifically in regard to philosopher {{ill|Cătălin Avramescu|ro|Cătălin Avramescu}}'s studies of cultural [[cannibalism]] and its relationship to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vikram|first1=Anuradha|title=The Art of Anthropophagy|url=http://x-traonline.org/article/the-art-of-anthropophagy/|website=X-Tra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MexiCali Biennial 2013: Cannibalism in the New World ==
The 2013 programming was the first time that an official theme was conceived for the exhibitions. The theme of Cannibalism was influenced by philosopher Catalin Avramescu's research on the cannibal throughout history, in particular its place in colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Christopher|title=Art review: At MexiCali Biennial, cannibalism is consuming theme|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/28/entertainment/la-et-cm-0129-mexicali-biennial-review-20130129|website=latimes|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabe|first1=John|title=Feast on the MexiCali Biennial at Vincent Price Art Museum.

Through ingestion, digestion, and subsumation, the cannibal bridges the gap between political science and moral philosophy, nature and civilization, north, south, east and west, the self and the other." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pederson Converse|first1=Amy|title=MexiCali Biennial 2013|url=http://mexicalibiennial.org/?page_id=52|website=mexicalibiennial.org|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists chosen for MB 2013 were:

Kaling has said she has never been called Vera, her first name,&lt;ref name="ImproperBost-Office-20112"/&gt; but has been referred to as Mindy since her mother was pregnant with her while her parents were living in [[Nigeria]]. They were already planning to move to the United States and wanted, Kaling said, a "cute American name" for their daughter, and liked the name Mindy from the TV&amp;nbsp;show ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]''. The name Vera is, according to Kaling, the name of the "incarnation of a [[Hindu]] goddess."&lt;ref name="ImproperBost-Office-20112"/&gt; Kaling graduated from [[Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols]], a private school in Cambridge, in 1997. The following year, she entered [[Dartmouth College]], where she was a member of the improvisational comedy troupe The Dog Day Players and the [[a cappella]] group The Rockapellas, was the creator of the comic strip ''Badly Drawn Girl'' in ''[[The Dartmouth]]'' (the college's daily newspaper), and was a writer for the ''[[Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern]]'' (the college's humor magazine).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Career ==
While a 19-year-old sophomore at Dartmouth, Kaling was an intern on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.&lt;ref name="YouTube-Conan-Intern-20122"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7f-R5ipL30|title=Mindy Kaling Was A Conan Intern - CONAN on TBS|date=November 7, 2012|publisher=''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''[[YouTube]] channel|format=Video interview|last1=O'Brien|first1=Conan|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaling said she was a terrible intern, "less of a 'make copies' intern and more of a 'stalk Conan' intern."&lt;ref name="YouTube-Conan-Intern-20122" /&gt; Kaling has said that she never saw a family like hers on TV, which gave her a dual perspective she uses in her writing.&lt;ref name="NPR-Immigrants-20092"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102572670|title=On TV, Immigrants' Kids Mine Cultural Convergence|authorlink=Neda Ulaby|last=Ulaby|first=Neda|date=February 4, 2009|publisher=[[NPR]]|work=[[Morning Edition]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She thinks the "everyone against me mentality" is what she learned as a child of immigrants.&lt;ref name="NPR-Immigrants-20092" /&gt; She named her ''Mindy Project'' character [[The Mindy Project|Mindy Lahiri]] after author [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/01/authors-share-their-all-time-favorite-summer-reads/slide/mindy-kaling|title=Authors share their all-time favorite summer reads|date=June 28, 2013|access-date=February 20, 2015 |magazine= Time| first= Mindy| last= Kaling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, Kaling moved to [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt; Kaling said one of her worst job experiences was as a production assistant for three months on the ''Crossing Over With [[John Edward]]'' psychic show.&lt;ref name="ImproperBost-Office-20112"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theoffice-us.livejournal.com/1322768.html|title=Mindy Kaling interview in Improper Bostonian|last=Soroff|first=Jonathan|work=[[The Improper Bostonian]]|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She described it as "depressing."&lt;ref name="AVClub-Office-20072"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/mindy-kaling-14079|title=Mindy Kaling - Interview| date=April 4, 2007|work=[[The A.V.

Kaling devised her stage name after discovering while doing stand-up comedy that emcees would have trouble pronouncing her last name, Chokalingam, and sometimes made jokes about it.&lt;ref name="NPR-Immigrants-20092" /&gt; She toured solo as well as with [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] before he was on ''The Office.''&lt;ref name="WTF-Maron-20122" /&gt;

In August 2002, Kaling portrayed [[Ben Affleck]] in an [[off Broadway|off-Broadway]] play called ''Matt &amp; Ben'',&lt;ref name="NYTimes-BaM-Review-20032"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9b07e2d81031f931a2575bc0a9659c8b63|title=Theater Review; Bad Will Hunting, Armed With Venom Darts|date=August 12, 2003|work=[[The New York Times]]| last1= Weber| first1= Bruce| accessdate= January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she co-wrote with her best friend from college, Brenda Withers—who played [[Matt Damon]]. The play was named one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's "Top Ten Theatrical Events of The Year" and was "a surprise hit" at the 2002 [[New York International Fringe Festival]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt; Initially, Withers and Kaling had, "for their own entertainment, mockingly pretended to be the best friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck; that pretending spawned ''Matt &amp; Ben'', the goofy play that reimagined how Damon and Affleck came to write the movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt;

Kaling wrote a blog, ''Things I've Bought That I Love'',&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt; which reemerged on her website on September 29, 2011.&lt;ref name="OngoingConcerns-20122"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconcernsofmindykaling.com/ongoing-concerns| title= Ongoing Concerns| date= January 27, 2012|publisher=The Concerns of Mindy Kaling| format= Blog| last1= Kaling| first1= Mindy| accessdate=January 28, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306085304/http://theconcernsofmindykaling.com/ongoing-concerns| archivedate= March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blog was written under the name Mindy Ephron, "a name Kaling chose because she was amused by the idea of her 20-something Indian-American self as a long-lost [[Nora Ephron|Ephron]] sister."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt;

=== ''The Office'' ===
{{Main|The Office (U.S. TV series)}}[[File:MindyKaling08.jpg|thumb|Kaling in 2008|left|237x237px]]
In 2004, when ''The Office'' producer [[Greg Daniels]] was working to adapt ''The Office'' from the [[BBC]] TV series of the same name, he hired Kaling as a writer-performer after reading a [[spec script]] she wrote. He said, "She's very original ... If anything feels phony or lazy or passé, she’ll pounce on it."&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt;

When Kaling joined ''The Office'', she was 24 years old and was the only woman on a staff of eight.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt; She took on the role of character [[Kelly Kapoor]], debuting in the series’s second episode, "Diversity Day."&lt;ref name="Dartmouth-Office-20062" /&gt;

In a 2007 interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', she stated that Kelly is "an exaggerated version of what I think the upper-level writers believe my personality is."&lt;ref name="AVClub-Office-20072" /&gt;

Kaling directed ''The Office'' webisode ''The 3rd&amp;nbsp;Floor''.&lt;ref name="OfficeTally-Webisodes-20102"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.officetally.com/the-office-webisodes-the-3rd-floor|title=The Office Webisodes: The 3rd Floor|date=November 5, 2010| work= OfficeTally.com| accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She directed the [[The Office (U.S. season 6)|Season&amp;nbsp;6]] episode titled "[[Body Language (The Office)|Body Language]]," which marked her television directorial debut. Her contract was set to expire at the end of Season 7. On September 15, 2011, she signed a new contract to stay with the show for Season 8 and was promoted to full executive producer.&lt;ref name="TVLine-Office-20112"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/09/mindy-kaling-office-contract-promotion-exec-producer|title=Scoop: Mindy Kaling Gets Major Office Promotion&amp;nbsp;— But There's a Twist!|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|date=September 15, 2011|work=[[TVLine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Universal Television]] contract included a development deal for a new show (eventually titled ''The Mindy Project''), in which she appears as an actress and contributes as a writer.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Office-20112" /&gt;

Kaling and her fellow writers and producers of ''The Office'' were nominated five consecutive times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. In 2010, she received a nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series with Daniels for the episode, "Niagara."&lt;ref name="Time100-20132"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time100.time.com/2013/04/18/time-100/slide/mindy-kaling|title=The 2013 Time 100 - Mindy Kaling: Comedian and creator, 33|last=Helms|first=Ed|date=April 13, 2013|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaling notes that she is sometimes described as a pioneer, as there are not yet very many Indian-American women on television.&lt;ref name="NPR-MorningEdition-TMP-20142"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/16/356390794/comedian-mindy-kaling-on-refusing-to-be-an-outsider-and-sexism-on-set|title=Mindy Kaling On Refusing To Be An Outsider And Sexism On Set|date=October 16, 2014|work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher= [[NPR]]|format=Audio interview|last1=Martin|first1=Rachel|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox canceled the series in May 2015 but it was later picked up by Hulu for a 26-episode fourth season and a 16-episode fifth season. In March 2017, Kaling announced that the show's sixth season, due to air starting September 2017, would be the last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2017/03/29/mindy-kalings-the-mindy-project-is-ending-after-six-seasons| title= Mindy Kaling’s 'The Mindy Project' is ending after six seasons| first= Kevin| last= Slane| website= Boston.com| publisher= Boston Globe Media Partners| date= March 29, 2017| access-date= December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series concluded on 14 November 2017.

'''Orientalism in early modern France''' refers to the interaction of pre-modern France with the [[Orient]], and especially the cultural, scientific, artistic and intellectual impact of these interactions, ranging from the academic field of [[Oriental studies]] to [[Orientalism]] in fashions in the [[decorative arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Baghdiantz McCabe, Ina 2008 ''Orientalism in Early Modern France'', {{ISBN|978-1-84520-374-0}}, Berg Publishing, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early study of Oriental languages==
{{main|Studia Linguarum}}
The first attempts to [[Oriental studies|study oriental languages]] were made by the Church in Rome, with the establishment of the ''[[Studia Linguarum]]'' in order to help the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] liberate Christian captives in Islamic lands. The first school was established in [[Tunis]] by [[Raymond Penaforte]] in the 12th and early 13th century.&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.29"&gt;McCabe, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; In 1311, the [[Council of Vienne]] decided to create schools for the study of oriental languages in the universities of [[Paris]], [[Bologna]], [[Oxford]], [[Salamanca]] and [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.29"/&gt;

==The first Orientalist, Guillaume Postel (1536)==
[[File:Hans_Holbein_the_Younger_-_The_Ambassadors_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|left|A symbol of French explorations under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]: the French ambassador [[Jean de Dinteville]] standing around an Ottoman [[Holbein carpet]] and various objects, 1533.]]
[[File:Arabic astronomical manuscript of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi annotated by Guillaume Postel.jpg|thumb|left|Arabic astronomical manuscript of [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], annotated by [[Guillaume Postel]].]]
From the 16th century, the study of oriental languages and cultures was progressively transferred from religious to royal patronage, as [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] sought [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|an alliance]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.37"&gt;McCabe, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman embassies soon visited France, [[Ottoman embassy to France (1533)|one in 1533]], and another [[Ottoman embassy to France (1534)|the following year]].&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.37"/&gt;

[[File:Ottoman Empire Coran copied circa 1536 bounded circa 1549 with arms of Henri II according to regulations set under Francis I.jpg|thumb|Ottoman Empire [[Qur'an]], copied circa 1536, bound according to regulations set under Francis I circa 1549, with arms of [[Henri II of France|Henri II]]. [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].]]
[[Guillaume Postel]] became the first French Orientalist after 1536, when he went to [[Constantinople]] as a member of the 12-strong French embassy of [[Jean de La Forêt]] to the Turkish [[sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.37"/&gt; Postel brought back numerous books in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], either religious or scientific in content (mainly [[mathematics]] and [[medicine]]), to France.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific exchange is thought to have occurred, as numerous works in Arabic, especially pertaining to [[astronomy]] were brought back, annotated and studied by Postel. Transmission of scientific knowledge, such as the [[Tusi-couple]], may have occurred on such occasions, at the time when [[Copernicus]] was establishing his own astronomical theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~gas1/project/visions/case1/sci.4.html ''Whose Science is Arabic Science in Renaissance Europe?'' by George Saliba Columbia University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Guillaume Postel envisioned a world where [[Muslims]], [[Christians]] and [[Jews]] would be united in harmony under one rule, a message he developed two decades before the [[Universalist]] [[Jean Bodin]].&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.15"&gt;McCabe, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that Islam was only a branch of Christianity, a simple [[heresy]] that could be reintegrated into Christianity, in his book ''Alcorani seu legis Mahometi et evangelistarum concordiae liber'' (1543).&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, p.40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

Postel also studied languages and sought to identify the common origin of all languages, before [[Tower of Babel|Babel]].&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.15"/&gt; He became Professor of Mathematics and  Oriental Languages, as well as the first professor of Arabic, at the [[Collège de France|Collège royal]].

==Second embassy to the Ottoman Empire (1547)==
[[File:Andre Thevet Cosmographie du Levant 1556 Lyon.jpg|thumb|[[André Thévet]], ''Cosmographie du Levant'', 1556, Lyon.]]

===Scientific research===
In 1547, a second embassy was sent by the French king to the Ottoman Empire, led by [[Gabriel de Luetz]]. The embassy included numerous scientists, such as the botanist [[Pierre Belon]], naturalist [[Pierre Gilles d'Albi]], the future cosmographer [[André Thévet]], philosopher [[Guillaume Postel]], traveler [[Nicolas de Nicolay]], or the cleric and diplomat [[Jean de Monluc]], who would publish their findings upon their return to France and contribute greatly to the early development of science in France.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political studies===
Knowledge of the Ottoman Empire allowed French philosophers to make comparative studies between the political systems of different nations. [[Jean Bodin]], one of the first such theorists, declared his admiration for the power and administrative system of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="McCabe 61"&gt;McCabe, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; He presented as a model Turkish frugality, the Ottoman system of punishments for looting, and promotion on merit in the [[Janissaries]].&lt;ref name="McCabe 61"/&gt; Such views would be echoed by 18th century comparative works such as ''L'Espion Turc'' or the ''[[Lettres persanes]]''.&lt;ref name="McCabe 61"/&gt;

===The arts===
French novels and tragedies were written with the Ottoman Empire as a theme or background.&lt;ref name="Ecouen Museum exhibit"&gt;Ecouen Museum exhibit&lt;/ref&gt; In 1561, [[Gabriel Bounin]] published ''La Soltane'', a [[tragedy]] highlighting the role of [[Roxelane]] in the 1553 execution of [[Şehzade Mustafa|Mustapha]], the elder son of [[Suleiman]].&lt;ref name="Ecouen Museum exhibit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;''The Literature of the French Renaissance'' by [[Arthur Augustus Tilley]], p.87 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UEzBBwwzjXkC&amp;pg=PA87]&lt;/ref&gt; This tragedy marks the first time the Ottomans were introduced on stage in France.&lt;ref&gt;''The Penny cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'' p.418 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7KsrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA418]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Turquerie]]'' and [[chinoiserie]] were notable fashions that affected a wide range of the decorative arts.

==Oriental studies==
[[File:Psautier by Gabriel Sionita 1625.jpg|thumb|Latin-Syriac [[psalter]] by [[Gabriel Sionita]], 1625, printed by [[Antoine Vitré]] with the fonts of [[François Savary de Brèves]].]]
Oriental studies continued to take place towards the end of the 16th century, especially with the work of [[Savary de Brèves]], also former French ambassador in Constantinople. Brèves spoke Turkish and Arabic and was famed for his knowledge of Ottoman culture.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kY92BMFNFjUC&amp;pg=PA35 ''Marbled paper: its history, techniques, and patterns'' by Richard J. Wolfe p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; Through his efforts, [[Capitulation (treaty)|Capitulations]] were signed between [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Sultan Ahmed I]] on 20 May 1604, giving a marked advantage for French trade, against that of the English and the Venetians.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA799 ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111-112 : Masrah Mawlid'' by Clifford Edmund Bosworth p.799]&lt;/ref&gt; In these capitulations, the protection of the French king over [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]] is also recognized. Brèves was interested in establishing an Arabic printing press under his own account in order to introduce Oriental studies in France. He had Arabic, Turk, Persian and Syriac types cast while in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="Toomer"/&gt; He also brought to France a large collection of Oriental manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Toomer"/&gt; These excellent types, followed those of [[Guillaume Le Bé]] at the end of the 16th century.

[[File:Alcoran de Mahomet 1647.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[Qur'an]] to be translated into a vernacular language: ''[[L'Alcoran de Mahomet]]'',  [[André du Ryer]], 1647.]]
While in Rome he set up a publishing house, the ''Typographia Savariana'', through which he printed a Latin-Arab bilingual edition of a catechism of Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmino]] in 1613, as well as in 1614 an Arabic version of the ''[[Book of Psalms]]''.&lt;ref name="Bosworth"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PvwUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA799 ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam: Fascicules 111–112 : Masrah Mawlid'' by Clifford Edmund Bosworth p.799]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toomer"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl8fniRER4kC&amp;pg=PA30 ''Eastern wisedome and learning: the study of Arabic in seventeenth-century...'' G. J. Toomer p.30''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; For the editorial work and the translations, Brèves used the services of two Lebanese [[Maronite]] priests, former students of the [[Maronite College]], [[Gabriel Sionita]] (Jibrā'īl aṣ-Ṣahyūnī) and [[Victor Scialac]] (Naṣrallāh Shalaq al-'Āqūrī).&lt;ref name="Toomer"/&gt;

In 1610–11, [[Al-Hajari]], a Moroccan envoy to France, met with the Orientalist [[Thomas Erpenius]] in September 1611 in [[Paris]], and taught him some [[Classical Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sl8fniRER4kC&amp;pg=PA43 ''Eastern wisedome and learning: the study of Arabic in seventeenth-century Europe'' by G. J. Toomer p.43''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; Through the introduction of Erpenius, Al-Hajari also met with the French Arabist [[Étienne Hubert (Arabist)|Étienne Hubert d'Orléans]], who had been a court physician for Moroccan ruler [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] in [[Marrakech]] from 1598 to 1601.&lt;ref name="RA 410"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=62SKVQNKMr0C&amp;pg=PA410 ''Romania Arabica'' by Gerard Wiegers p.410]&lt;/ref&gt;

A protégé of Savary de Brèves, [[André du Ryer]] published the first ever translation of the ''[[Qur'an]]'' in a vernacular language, ''[[L'Alcoran de Mahomet]]'' (1647), and published in the West the first piece of Persian literature ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' (1634).&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.97"&gt;McCabe, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McCabe, Orientalism played a key role "in the birth of science and in the creation of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]".&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.3"&gt;McCabe, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of trade==
[[File:DrugstoreOfLouisXIVWithDetails.jpg|thumb|Drugstore of [[Louis XIV]], with numerous oriental artifacts. [[Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]], Paris.]]
France started to set up numerous [[consulate]]s throughout the Ottoman realm, in [[Tripoli]], [[Beirut]], [[Alexandria]], and [[Chios]].&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.97"/&gt; Intense trade also started to develop, centered on the city of [[Marseille]], called "the door of the Orient". In Egypt, French trade was paramount, and Marseille was importing in large quantities linens, carpets, dyes, hides, leather, or waxes.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1682, the Sultan of Morocco, [[Moulay Ismail]], following the embassy of [[Mohammed Tenim]], allowed consular and commercial establishments,&lt;ref&gt;Bluche, François. "Louis XIV", p. 439, Hachette Litteratures, Paris (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1699 ambassador [[Abdallah bin Aisha]] was sent to [[Louis XIV]].

===Coffee drinking===
An Ottoman embassy was sent to [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] in 1607, and from [[Mehmed IV]] to [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1669 in the person of ambassador [[Müteferrika Süleyman Ağa]], who created a sensation at the French court and triggered a fashion for things Turkish.&lt;ref name="Göçek, p.8"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDljPtPJLbkC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=ottoman+alliance+%22Louis+XIV%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=F63TSeqbOIyENPuMhYYJ&amp;hl=en#PPA8,M1 Göçek, p.8]&lt;/ref&gt; The Orient came to have a strong influence in French literature, as about 50% of French travel guides in the 16th century were dedicated to the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mewtRI5CziUC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Van+Mour%22+first+orientalist&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=vO3WSbzWEJvuzQSWtNW6AQ&amp;hl=en#PPA73,M1 Goody, p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Paris, Suleiman set up a beautiful house where he offered [[coffee]] to Parisian society, with waiters dressed in Ottoman style, triggering enthusiastic responses, and starting the fashion for coffee-drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/books/chapters/1st-starbucked.html?pagewanted=3&amp;ref=arts New York Times ''Starbucked'', 16 December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Fashionable coffee-shops emerged such as the famous ''[[Café Procope]]'', the first coffee-shop of Paris, in 1689.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m1nAT7g7iysC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;hl=en ''Bound together'' by Nayan Chanda p.88]&lt;/ref&gt; In the French high society wearing [[turban]]s and [[caftan]]s became fashionable, as well as lying on rugs and cushions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m1nAT7g7iysC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;hl=en ''Bound together'' by Nayan Chanda p.87]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture of "Oriental" luxury goods in France==

The establishment of strong diplomatic and commercial relations with the [[Ottoman Empire]] through the [[Capitulation (surrender)|Capitulations]] led to French money being drained to the [[Levant]] and [[Persia]] for the purchase of luxury goods such as knotted-pile [[carpets]]. Due to these concerns, and also because French luxury arts had collapsed in the disorders of civil violence in the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] attempted to develop French luxury industries that could replace imports. The king provided craftsmen with studios and workshops. These efforts to develop an industry for luxury goods was continued by [[Louis XIII]] and [[Louis XIV]].

===Silk manufacturing===
Henry IV made the earliest attempt at producing substitutes for luxury goods from the Orient. He experimented with planting [[mulberry trees]] in the garden of the [[Palais des Tuileries]].&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, silk manufacturing would become one of the major industries of France into the 19th century, and one of the major reasons for the development of [[France–Japan relations (19th century)|France-Japan relations in the 19th century]].

During the 17th century, from being an importer, France became a net exporter of silk, for example shipping 30,000 pounds sterling worth of silk to England in 1674 alone.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish carpet-making===
The [[Savonnerie manufactory]] was the most prestigious European manufactory of knotted-pile [[carpet]]s, enjoying its greatest period circa 1650–1685. The manufactory had its immediate origins in a carpet manufactory established in a former soap factory (French ''savon'') on the [[Chaillot|Quai de Chaillot]] downstream of [[Paris]] in 1615 by [[Pierre DuPont (carpet maker)|Pierre DuPont]], who was returning from the [[Levant]] and wrote ''La Stromatourgie, ou Traité de la Fabrication des tapis de Turquie'' ("Treaty on the manufacture of Turkish carpets", Paris 1632).&lt;ref&gt;''Paris as it was and as it is, or, A sketch of the French capital'' by [[Francis William Blagdon]] p.512 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mWwDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA512]&lt;/ref&gt; Under a patent (''privilège'') of eighteen years, a monopoly was granted by [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] in 1627 to Pierre Dupont and his former apprentice Simon Lourdet, makers of carpets ''façon de Turquie'' ("in the manner of [[Turkey]]"). Until 1768, the products of the manufactory remained exclusively the property of the Crown, and "Savonnerie carpets" were among the grandest of French diplomatic gifts.

[[Chinese porcelain]] had long been imported from [[China]], and was a very expensive and desired luxury. Huge amounts of [[gold]] were sent from Europe to China to pay for the desired Chinese porcelain wares, and numerous attempts were made to duplicate the material.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC&amp;pg=PA240 ''Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation'' Nigel Wood p.240]&lt;/ref&gt; It is at the [[Nevers manufactory]] that Chinese-style [[blue and white porcelain|blue and white wares]] were produced for the first time in France, using the [[faience]] technique, with production running between 1650 and 1680.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mkJfbdTS--UC&amp;pg=PA38 ''The Grove encyclopedia of materials and techniques in art'' Gerald W. R. Ward p.38]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese porcelain was collected at the French court from the time of Francis I. [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] set up the [[Royal Factory of Saint-Cloud]] in 1664 in order to make copies (In the original ''"Contre-façons"'', i.e. "Fakes") of "Indian-style" porcelain.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"/&gt;

France was one of the first European countries to produce [[soft-paste porcelain]], and specifically frit porcelain, at the [[Rouen manufactory]] in 1673, which was known for this reason as "Porcelaine française".&lt;ref name="Barber 5"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AQH3op9kyvcC&amp;pg=PP12 ''Artificial Soft Paste Porcelain&amp;nbsp;– France, Italy, Spain and England'' Edwin Atlee Barber p.5–6]&lt;/ref&gt; These were developed in an effort to imitate high-valued Chinese [[hard-paste porcelain]].&lt;ref name="Barber 5"/&gt;

France however, only discovered the Chinese technique of [[hard-paste porcelain]] through the efforts of the [[Jesuit]] Father [[Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles]] between 1712 and 1722.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"&gt;McCabe, p.220''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XIV had received 1,500 pieces of porcelain from the [[Siamese embassy to France (1686)|Siamese Embassy to France]] in 1686, but the manufacturing secret had remained elusive.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"/&gt; The English porcelain-manufacturer [[Josiah Wedgwood]] may also have been influenced by the letter of Father d'Entrecolles and his description of Chinese mass-production methods.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; After this initial period, until the end of the 18th century, French porcelain manufactories would progressively abandon their Chinese designs, to become more French in character.&lt;ref name="McCabe 220"/&gt;

===Textiles: ''Siamoises'' and ''Indiennes''===
[[File:Siamoise flammee France 18th century.jpg|thumb|left|''Siamoise flammée'' textile, derived from [[Thailand|Thai]] [[Ikat]], French manufacture, 18th century.]]
[[File:Indienne, Wesserling.JPG|thumb|left|An ''[[Indienne]]'', a printed or painted textile in the manner of Indian productions.]]
The [[Siamese embassy to France (1686)|Siamese Embassy to France]] in 1686 had brought to the Court samples of multicolor Thai ''[[Ikat]]'' textiles. These were enthusiastically adopted by the French nobility to become ''Toiles flammées'' or ''Siamoises de Rouen'',  often with checkered blue-and-white designs.&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, p.222&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[French Revolution]] and its dislike for foreign luxury, the textiles were named "Toiles des Charentes" or cottons of [[Provence]].&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.223"&gt;McCabe, p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

Textiles imported from [[India]], types of colored [[Calico (textile)|calicoes]] which were called ''[[Indiennes]]'', were also widely adopted and manufactured, especially in [[Marseille]], although there were difficulties in obtaining comparable dyes, especially the red dye [[Rose madder|madder]].&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.223"/&gt;

===Literature===
French literature also was greatly influenced. The first French version of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' was published in 1704.&lt;ref name="Goody, p.75"/&gt; French authors used the East as a way to enrich their philosophical work, and a pretext to write commentaries on the West: [[Montesquieu]] wrote the ''[[Lettres persanes]]'', a satirical essay on the West, in 1721, and [[Voltaire]] used the Oriental appeal to write ''[[Zaïre (play)|Zaïre]]'' (1732) and ''[[Candide]]'' (1759).&lt;ref name="Goody, p.75"/&gt; French travelers of the 17th century, such as [[Jean de Thévenot]] or [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] routinely visited the Ottoman Empire.

By that time, the [[Confucian canon]] had already been translated into [[Latin]] by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] to China's [[Ming Empire|Ming]] and [[Qing Empire]]s. [[Michele Ruggieri]]'s work in the 1580s remained long unpublished but [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Nicolas Trigault]]'s work ''[[On the Christian Expedition among the Sinae|On the Christian Expedition...]]'' ([[Augsburg]], 1615), [[Philippe Couplet]] and others' ''[[Confucius Sinarum Philosophus|Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese]]'' (Paris, 1687), [[Francois Noel (missionary)|François Noël]]'s ''[[Sinensis Imperii Libri Classici Sex|Six Classics of the Chinese Empire]]'' ([[Prague]], 1711), and [[Jean-Baptiste Du Halde]]'s ''[[Description of China]]'' (Paris, 1735) all spoke in glowing terms of the moral and cultural achievements of the Chinese, supposedly reached through the use of reason. It is thought that such works had considerable importance on European thinkers of the period, particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;"Windows into China", John Parker, p.25, {{ISBN|0-89073-050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Eastern origins of Western civilization", John Hobson, p194-195, {{ISBN|0-521-54724-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Japanese alphabet Diderot Encyclopedia 18th century.jpg|thumb|left|[[Japanese writing system|Japanese alphabets]], including [[Hiragana]], [[Katakana]] and "[[Imatto-canna]]". [[Denis Diderot]], [[Encyclopédie]], 18th century.]]
In particular, cultural diversity with respect to religious beliefs could no longer be ignored.  As Herbert wrote in ''On Lay Religion'' ({{lang|la|De Religione Laici}}, 1645):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many faiths or religions, clearly, exist or once existed in various countries and ages, and certainly there is not one of them that the lawgivers have not pronounced to be as it were divinely ordained, so that the Wayfarer finds one in Europe, another in Africa, and in Asia, still another in the very Indies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Starting with Grosrichard, analogies were also made between the harem, the Sultan's court, oriental [[despotic monarchy|despotism]], luxury, gems and spices, carpets, and silk cushions with the luxury and vices of France's own monarchy.&lt;ref name="McCabe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XnS6lVLapI4C&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=15 July 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual arts===
By the end of the 17th century, the first major defeats of the Ottoman Empire reduced the perceived threat in European minds, which led to an artistic craze for things Turkish, ''[[Turquerie]]'', just as there was a fashion for Chinese things with ''[[Chinoiserie]]'', both of which became constitutive components of the [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref name="Goody, p.75"&gt;Goody, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orientalism]] started to become hugely popular, first with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste van Mour]], who had accompanied the embassy of [[Charles de Ferriol]] to Istanbul 1699 and stayed there until the end of his life in 1737, and later with the works of [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]].&lt;ref name="Goody, p.75"/&gt;

==Cultural impact==
According to historian McCabe, early orientalism profoundly shaped French culture and gave it many of its modern characteristics. In the area of science, she stressed "the role of Orientalism in the birth of science and in the creation of the [[French Academy of Science]]".&lt;ref name="McCabe, p.3"/&gt; In the artistic area, referring to Louis XIV's fashion efforts that contrasted with the contemporary fashion for austere Spanish dress: "ironically, endorsing oriental sartorial splendor at court gave rise to the creation of 'Frenchness' through fashion, which became an umbrella definition that broke through the class barrier".&lt;ref&gt;McCabe, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pauline Rita.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Pauline Rita as a young woman]]
'''Pauline Rita''' (c.1842 – 28 June 1920) was an English [[soprano]] and actress.  During her early career, she was best known for her performances in [[operetta]]s and [[comic opera]]s at the Opera Comique and was associated with impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].  Later, she married flautist John Radcliff, and the two performed together for many years.

==Biography==

===Oratorio and operetta===
In 1872, Rita took part in a joint recital with [[Charles Santley]] at [[St James's Hall]], London.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily News'', 22 May 1872, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year she sang in [[Handel]]'s oratorio ''[[Athalia (Handel)|Athalia]]'' in [[Glasgow]], where the local critic was unimpressed: "Mdlle. Rita has a voice nearly always in tune, but of a shrill and unsympathetic quality, and she indulges from time to time in that fatal ''vibrato'' to which we have so often objected."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Glasgow Herald]]'', 23 October 1872, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, she performed in [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]'s light opera company at the [[Opera Comique]], in ''The Broken Branch'', an English version of [[Gaston Serpette]]'s ''La branch cassée'', in which she received better notices: "Madame Pauline Rita has achieved a triumph in her first appearance on the stage. She possesses a voice of singular flexibility, acts well, and looks attractive."&lt;ref&gt;''The Graphic'', 29 August 1874, p. 211; also ''The [[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 29 August 1874, p. 11: "Mdme Pauline Rita has in her part a very pretty 'vocal waltz', which she executes with all possible neatness and fluency."&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1874 she played the lead role of the Prince de Conti in [[Charles Lecocq]]'s ''Les Prés St. Gervais'' at the [[Criterion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Graphic'', 5 December 1874, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she starred in the title role, Clairette Angot, in a revival of Lecocq's ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' at the Opera Comique, which replaced ''[[La Périchole]]'' on the bill with ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fitz-Gerald, S. J. Adair. [https://archive.org/details/storyofthesavoyo009133mbp ''The Story of the Savoy Opera''], p. 12, D. Appleton and Company (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year she appeared as Barbara in [[Alfred Cellier]]'s ''The Tower of London'' at the Prince's Theatre, [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Manchester Weekly Times]]'', 9 October 1875, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1876 at the [[Royalty Theatre]], she appeared under Carte's management as Gustave Muller in ''The Duke's Daughter''.&lt;ref name="Whos"&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/R/RitaPauline.htm Pauline Rita] at ''Who was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', 27 August 2001, accessed 7 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May 1876, Rita was the beneficiary of a special matinée at the [[Princess's Theatre]] at which [[Selina Dolaro]], Mrs. Howard Paul, [[Arthur Cecil]] and many others contributed, and [[Alfred Cellier]] conducted his operetta ''[[Dora's Dream]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 7 May 1876, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, she repeated her roles of Gustave Miller and also played the Plaintiff in ''Trial by Jury'' on tour with Carte's Opera Bouffe Company (with Carte himself as musical director).&lt;ref name=Whos/&gt; In 1877, at a benefit performance for [[Henry Compton (actor)|Henry Compton]], described by ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' as "undeniably the greatest event known in the annals of the Stage", Rita played the Plaintiff in a star-studded performance of ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', conducted by [[Arthur Sullivan]], with [[W. S. Gilbert]] as the Associate, [[Arthur Cecil]] as the Usher, [[W. H. Cummings]] as the Defendant, and famous performers such as [[George Grossmith]], [[W. S. Penley]], [[Kate Bishop (actress)|Kate Bishop]] and [[Marion Terry]] in the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 4 March 1877, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Plaintiff, Rita played two [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] roles – one for D'Oyly Carte and one not. She played Aline in ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' on tour in [[Liverpool]] in March 1878, and in September 1879 she played Josephine in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in the production mounted by Carte's former partners in the Comedy Opera Company after he had separated from them.  She never returned to D'Oyly Carte management.&lt;ref name=Whos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 29 and 6; ''The Era'', 7 September 1879, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1870s, Rita performed with [[Charles Morton (impresario)|Charles Morton]]'s opera company at the Opera Comique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Henry Chance Newton| title = Sixty years' stage service: being a record of the life of Charles Morton, "The father of the halls."| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TT1AAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA122| year = 1905| publisher = Gale and Polden, Ltd.| page = 122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1881, Rita's voice suffered from overwork, and she moved to Australia to rest and stay with family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Leonardo De Lorenzo| title = My Complete Story of the Flute: The Instrument, the Performer, the Music| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qdxENVZtDccC&amp;pg=PA153| year = 1992| publisher = Texas Tech University Press| isbn = 978-0-89672-277-4| page = 153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1884, she married the celebrated [[flautist]], John Radcliff (1842–1917), to whom she had become engaged in London in 1881.  Together, they organised a successful three-year tour through Australia and New Zealand in 1884–86.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;''[[The Times]]'' Obituary, 26 July 1920, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 17 January 1885, p. 17, and 8 May 1886, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Britain, they continued to give the programme they had perfected on tour: "''Flutes of All Ages'': Mr Radcliff ... playing on twenty different instruments selections from the music of all countries and all times. The entertainment was varied by songs, rendered with finished vocal ability, by Madame Pauline Rita."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 25 December 1886, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; They then developed this show as ''Pan to Pinafore'' and presented it around Britain for several years with great success.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 7 July 1888, p. 7; ''The Bristol Mercury and Daily Post'', 8 January 1890; ''Jackson's Oxford Journal'', 20 February 20, 1892&lt;/ref&gt;

Rita undertook some vocal teaching, her success being noted in the press.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times]]'', 8 September 1894, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years, she became blind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Musical Times| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GY4PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA160| year = 1917| publisher = Novello| page = 160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died at her home in [[Kensington]], London, after a long illness.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18964">'''Playing For Change''' is a [[multimedia]] music project, co-founded in 2002 by American music engineer/producer Mark Johnson and film producer/philanthropist [[Whitney Ann Kroenke|Whitney Kroenke]], that seeks to inspire, connect, and bring peace to the world through music. Playing For Change also created a separate [[non-profit organization]] called the Playing For Change Foundation, which builds music and art schools for children around the world.

== Origin ==
Playing For Change was born in 2002 as a shared vision between co-founders, Mark Johnson and [[Whitney Kroenke Burditt|Whitney Kroenke]], to hit the streets of America with a mobile recording studio and cameras in search of inspiration and the heartbeat of the people. Producers Johnson and Enzo Buono traveled around the world to places including [[New Orleans]], [[Barcelona]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Ireland]]. Using mobile recording equipment, the duo recorded local musicians performing the same song, interpreted in their own style. Among the artists participating or openly involved in the project are [[Vusi Mahlasela]], [[Louis Mhlanga]], [[Clarence Bekker]], [[David Guido Pietroni]], Tal Ben Ari (Tula), [[Bono]], [[Keb' Mo']], [[David Broza]], [[Manu Chao]], [[Grandpa Elliott]], [[Keith Richards]], Toots Hibbert from [[Toots &amp; the Maytals]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]]. This resulted in the award-winning documentary ''A Cinematic Discovery of Street Musicians''.

In 2005, Mark Johnson was walking in [[Santa Monica, California]], when he heard the voice of Roger Ridley (now deceased) singing "Stand By Me." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerridleybluesman.com/|title=Roger Ridley - Roger Ridley/street performer - HOME|work=rogerridleybluesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger had so much soul and conviction in his voice, and Mark approached him about performing "Stand By Me" as a Song Around The World. Roger agreed, and when Mark returned with recording equipment and cameras he asked Roger, "With a voice like yours, why are you singing on the streets?" Roger replied, "Man I’m in the Joy business, I come out to be with the people." Ever since that day, the Playing For Change crew has traveled the world recording and filming musicians, creating Songs Around The World, and building a global family.

Creating Songs Around The World inspired the PFC crew to unite many of the greatest musicians they met throughout their journey through the creation of the Playing For Change Band. These musicians come from many different countries and cultures, but through music they speak the same language. The PFC Band is now touring the world and spreading the message of love and hope to audiences everywhere.

The founders of Playing For Change created the Playing For Change Foundation, a separate 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to building music and art schools for children around the world, and creating hope and inspiration for the future of our planet.

== PFC Online Global Community ==
PFC videos have exceeded an estimated 500 million online views, continuing to grow steadily through active &amp; dedicated community members from 195 countries.

In 2011, the Playing For Change Foundation established an annual Playing For Change Day.&lt;ref name="playingforchangeday.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playingforchangeday.org/about|title=Playing for Change Day - September 24th, 2016|work=playingforchangeday.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Playing For Change Day is to "unite a global community through the power of music to affect positive social change".&lt;ref name="playingforchangeday.org"/&gt; In 2012, the PFC Day consisted of over 330 events across 52 countries and helped raise over $150,000 for the Playing For Change Foundation, and in 2014, PFC Day saw over 400 events in 60 countries.&lt;ref name="playingforchangeday.org"/&gt;  It is held on the Saturday nearest the United Nations' [[International Day of Peace]], which takes place each year on Sept. 21. In 2015, Playing for Change Day was celebrated on September 19. The sixth-annual Playing for Change Day was on September 24, 2016.&lt;ref name="playingforchangeday.org" /&gt;

In 2013, the Foundation introduced the Stand by Me Scholarship program, allowing people to sponsor a child to learn music for an entire year. Scholarships are need-based and are given to children who could not participate otherwise. Donors can either make a one-time gift to fund a student, or set up monthly contributions.

{{Literature}}
A '''poet''' is a person who creates poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.

[[File:Leopardi, Giacomo (1798-1837) - ritr. A Ferrazzi, Recanati, casa Leopardi.jpg|thumb|200px|The Italian [[Giacomo Leopardi]] was mentioned by the University of Birmingham as "one of the most radical and challenging of nineteenth-century thinkers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/leopardi/projects/index.aspx The Zibaldone project], University of Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The work of a poet is essentially one of communication, either expressing ideas in a literal sense, such as writing about a specific event or place, or metaphorically. Poets have existed since antiquity, in nearly all languages, and have produced works that vary greatly in different cultures and periods.&lt;ref name="Orban"&gt;{{cite book |last=Orban |first=Clara Elizabeth |title=The Culture of Fragments: Word and Images in Futurism and Surrealism |publisher=Rodopi |year=1997 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbCVyt6MWg0C |isbn=90-420-0111-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout each [[civilization]] and language, poets have used various styles that have changed through the course of literary history, resulting in a history of poets as diverse as the literature they have produced.

==History==
{{hatnote|This is about the history of the poet profession. For a history of poetry, see [[History of poetry]]}}

In [[Ancient Rome]], professional poets were generally sponsored by [[patronage|patrons]], wealthy supporters including nobility and military officials.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara K. Gold, (2014) ''Literary and Artistic Patronage in Ancient Rome", University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Gaius Cilnius Maecenas]], friend to [[Caesar Augustus]], was an important patron for the Augustan poets, including both [[Horace]] and [[Virgil]].

Poets held an important position in pre-Islamic Arabic society with the poet or ''[[sha'ir]]'' filling the role of historian, [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]] and propagandist. Words in praise of the tribe (''qit'ah'') and lampoons denigrating other tribes (''hija''') seem to have been some of the most popular forms of early poetry. The ''sha'ir'' represented an individual tribe's prestige and importance in the [[Arabian peninsula]], and mock battles in poetry or ''[[zajal]]'' would stand in lieu of real wars. 'Ukaz, a market town not far from [[Mecca]], would play host to a regular poetry festival where the craft of the ''sha'irs'' would be exhibited.

In the [[High Middle Ages]], [[troubadors]] were an important class of poets and came from a variety of backgrounds. They lived and travelled in many different places and were looked upon as actors or musicians as much as poets. They were often under patronage, but many travelled extensively.

The [[Renaissance]] period saw a continuation of patronage of poets by royalty. Many poets, however, had other sources of income, including 
Italians like [[Dante Aligheri]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]]'s works in a pharmacist's guild and [[William Shakespeare]]'s work in the theater.

In the [[Romantic period]] and onwards, many poets were independent writers who made their living through their work, often supplemented by income from other occupations or from family.&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Murphy (2005) "Poetry as an Occupation and an Art in Britain" Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; This included poets such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Robert Burns]].

Poets such as [[Virgil]] in the [[Aeneid]] and [[John Milton]] in [[Paradise Lost]] invoked the aid of a [[Muse]].

==Education==
Poets of earlier times were often well read and highly educated people while others were to a large extent self-educated. A few poets such as [[John Gower]] and [[John Milton]] were able to write poetry in more than one language. Some Portuguese poets, as [[Francisco de Sá de Miranda]], wrote not only in Portuguese but also in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Francisco-de-Sa-de-Miranda Encyclopaedia Britanncia.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Kochanowski]] wrote in Polish and in Latin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08685b.htm Jan Kochanowski at Catholic Encyclopaedia.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[France Prešeren]] and [[Karel Hynek Mácha]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.private-prague-guide.com/article/karel-hynek-macha-a-leading-poet-of-czech-romanticism/ Karel Hynek Mácha: A leading poet of Czech Romanticism.]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote some poems in German, although they were poets of Slovenian and Czech respectively. [[Adam Mickiewicz]], the greatest poet of Polish language, wrote a Latin ode for emperor [[Napoleon III]]. Another example is [[Jerzy Pietrkiewicz]], a Polish poet. When he moved to Great Britain, he ceased to write poetry in Polish, but started writing novel in English.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jerzy-peterkiewicz-polish-poet-turned-english-novelist-774317.html Independent.]&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated poetry from English and into English.

Many universities offer degrees in creative writing though these only came into existence in the 20th century. While these courses are not necessary for a career as a poet, they can be helpful as training, and for giving the student several years of time focused on their writing.&lt;ref&gt;Nikki Moustaki (2001), ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Poetry'', Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''police procedural''', or '''police crime drama''', is a subgenre of [[detective fiction]] that emphasizes the investigative procedure of a [[police officer]] or department as the [[protagonist]](s), as contrasted with other genres that focus on a private investigator or amateur detective. Unlike traditional mysteries, which conceal the criminal's identity until the police solve the crime in the [[Climax (narrative)|narrative climax]] (the so-called [[whodunnit]]), police procedurals often reveal the perpetrator's identity to the audience early in the narrative, making it an [[inverted detective story]] or "howcatchem" {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Police procedurals attempt to accurately depict such police-related topics as [[forensic science]], [[autopsy|autopsies]], gathering [[Evidence (law)|evidence]], [[search warrant]]s, [[interrogation]] and adherence to legal restrictions and procedure.

==Early history==
The roots of the police procedural have been traced to at least the mid-1880's. [[Wilkie Collins]]'s novel ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), a tale of a [[Scotland Yard]] detective investigating the theft of a valuable diamond, has been described as perhaps the earliest clear example of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Wheat, Carolyn (2003) How to Write Killer Fiction: The Funhouse Of Mystery &amp; The Roller Coaster Of Suspense. Santa Barbara, PA: Perseverance Press, {{ISBN|1880284626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As detective fiction rose to worldwide popularity in the late 1800's and early 1900's, many of the pioneering and most popular characters, at least in the English-speaking world, were private investigators or amateurs. See [[C. Auguste Dupin]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Sam Spade]], [[Miss Marple]] and others. [[Hercule Poirot]] was described as a veteran of the Belgian police but as a protagonist he worked independently. Only after WW2 would police procedural fiction rival the popularity of PIs or amateur sleuths.

[[Lawrence Treat]]'s 1945 novel ''V as in Victim'' is often cited as the first police procedural, by [[Anthony Boucher]] (mystery critic for the ''[[New York Times]] Book Review'') among others. Another early example is [[Hillary Waugh]]'s ''[[Last Seen Wearing ... (Hillary Waugh novel)|Last Seen Wearing ...]]'', 1952.  Even earlier examples from the 20th Century, predating Treat, include the novels ''Vultures in the Dark'', 1925, and ''The Borrowed Shield'', 1925, by [[Richard Enright]], retired [[New York City Police Commissioner]], ''Harness Bull'', 1937, and ''Homicide'', 1937, by former Southern California police officer [[Leslie T. White]], ''P.C. Richardson's First Case'', 1933, by Sir [[Basil Thomson]], former [[Assistant Commissioner]] of [[Scotland Yard]], and the short story collection ''Policeman's Lot'', 1933, by former Buckinghamshire High Sheriff and Justice of the Peace [[Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 6th Baronet|Henry Wade]].

The procedural became more prominent after [[World War II]], and, while the contributions of [[novelist]]s like Treat were significant, a large part of the impetus for the post-war development of the procedural as a distinct subgenre of the mystery was due, not to prose fiction, but to the popularity of a number of American films which dramatized and fictionalized actual crimes.  Dubbed "[[semidocumentary]] films" by movie critics, these motion pictures, often filmed on location, with the cooperation of the law enforcement agencies involved in the actual case, made a point of authentically depicting police work. Examples include ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), ''[[The Street with No Name]]'' (1948), ''[[T-Men]]'' (1947), ''[[He Walked by Night]]'' (1948), and ''[[Border Incident]]'' (1949).

Films from other countries soon began following the semi-documentary trend.  In [[France]], there was ''[[Quai des orfevres]]'' (1947), released in the [[United States]] as ''Jenny Lamour''.  In [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]], there was [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1949 film ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'', a serious police procedural [[film noir]] that was also a precursor to the [[buddy cop film]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FilmInt|journal=Film International|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y50qAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 April 2012|page=163|publisher=[[Arts Council Norway|Kulturrådet]]|location=Sweden|quote=In addition to being a masterful precursor to the buddy cop movies and police procedurals popular today, Stray Dog is also a complex genre film that examines the plight of soldiers returning home to post-war Japan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], there were films such as ''[[The Blue Lamp]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Long Arm (film)|The Long Arm]]'' (1956) set in London and depicting the Metropolitan Police.

One semidocumentary,  ''[[He Walked By Night]]'' (1948), released by [[Eagle-Lion Films]], featured a young radio actor named [[Jack Webb]] in a supporting role.  The success of the film, along with a suggestion from [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective [[Sergeant]] Marty Wynn, the film's [[technical advisor]], gave Webb an idea for a [[radio drama]] that depicted police work in a similarly semi-documentary manner. The resulting series, ''[[Dragnet (drama)|Dragnet]]'', which debuted on radio in 1949 and made the transition to television in 1951, has been called "the most famous procedural of all time" by mystery novelists [[William L. DeAndrea]], [[Katherine V. Forrest]] and [[Max Allan Collins]].

The same year that ''Dragnet'' debuted on radio, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning playwright [[Sidney Kingsley]]'s stage play ''[[Detective Story (play)|Detective Story]]'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  This frank, carefully researched dramatization of a typical day in an [[NYPD]] [[police station|precinct]] detective squad became another benchmark in the development of the police procedural.

Over the next few years, the number of novelists who picked up on the procedural trend grew to include writers like Ben Benson, who wrote carefully researched novels about the [[Massachusetts State Police]], retired police officer [[Maurice Procter]], who wrote a series about North England cop Harry Martineau, and Jonathan Craig, who wrote short stories and novels about [[New York City]] police officers.  Police novels by writers who would come to virtually define the form, like [[Hillary Waugh]], [[Evan Hunter|Ed McBain]], and [[John Creasey]] started to appear regularly.

In 1956, in his regular ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' column, mystery critic [[Anthony Boucher]], noting the growing popularity of crime fiction in which the main emphasis was the realistic depiction of police work, suggested that such stories constituted a distinct subgenre of the mystery, and, crediting the success of ''Dragnet'' for the rise of this new form, coined the phrase "police procedural" to describe it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Written stories==

===Ed McBain===
Ed McBain, the [[pseudonym]] of [[Evan Hunter]], wrote dozens of novels in the ''[[87th Precinct]]'' series beginning with ''[[Cop Hater]],'' published in 1956. Hunter continued to write 87th Precinct novels almost until his death in 2005. Although these novels focus primarily on Detective Steve Carella, they encompass the work of many officers working alone and in teams, and Carella is not always present in any individual book.

As if to illustrate the universality of the police procedural, many of McBain's 87th Precinct novels, despite their being set in a slightly fictionalized New York City, have been filmed in settings outside New York, even outside the US. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1963 film, ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'', based on McBain's ''King's Ransom'' (1959), is set in [[Tokyo]].  ''Without Apparent Motive'' (1972), set on the [[French Riviera]], is based on McBain's ''Ten Plus One'' (1963). [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Blood Relatives|Les Liens de Sang]]'' (1978), based on ''Blood Relatives'' (1974), is set in [[Montreal]].  Even ''[[Fuzz (film)|Fuzz]]'' (1972), based on the 1968 novel, though set in the US, moves the action to [[Boston]].

===John Creasey/J. J. Marric===
Perhaps ranking just behind McBain in importance to the development of the procedural as a distinct mystery subgenre is [[John Creasey]], a prolific writer of many different kinds of crime fiction, from espionage to criminal protagonist. He was inspired to write a more realistic crime novel when his neighbor, a retired [[Scotland Yard]] detective, challenged Creasey to "write about us as we are." The result was ''Inspector West Takes Charge'', 1940, the first of more than forty novels to feature Roger West of the [[London Metropolitan Police]]. The West novels were, for the era, an unusually realistic look at Scotland Yard operations, but the plots were often wildly melodramatic, and, to get around thorny legal problems, Creasey gave West an "amateur detective" friend who was able to perform the extra-procedural acts that West, as a policeman, could not.

In the mid-1950s, inspired by the success of television's ''Dragnet'' and a similar British TV series, ''[[Fabian of the Yard]]'', Creasey decided to try a more down-to-earth series of cop stories. Adopting the pseudonym "J.J. Marric", he wrote ''[[Gideon's Day]]'', 1955, in which [[George Gideon]], a high-ranking detective at Scotland Yard, spends a busy day supervising his subordinates' investigations into several unrelated crimes. This novel was the first in a series of more than twenty books which brought Creasey his best critical notices. One entry, ''Gideon's Fire'', 1961, won an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for Best Mystery Novel. The Gideon series, more than any other source, helped establish the common procedural plot structure of threading several autonomous story lines through a single novel.

===Sjöwall and Wahlöö===
[[Maj Sjöwall]] and [[Per Wahlöö]] planned and wrote the [[Martin Beck]] police procedural series of ten books between the 1960s and 1970s, set in [[Sweden]]. The series is particularly renowned for its extensive character development throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Scene of the Crime: The Importance of Place in Crime and Mystery Fiction|last = Geherin|first = David|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck himself is gradually promoted from [[detective]] in a newly nationalised Swedish police force to [[Chief of staff|Chief]] [[Inspector]] of the National Murder Squad, and the realistic depiction, as well as criticism of the Swedish [[welfare state]] at the time whilst the tedium of the police procedural continues in the background, is something still widely used today, with authors such as [[Jo Nesbø]] and [[Stieg Larsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gumshoes: A Dictionary of Fictional Detectives|last = Brunsdale|first = Mitzi|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books gave rise to the [[Scandinavian noir|Swedish noir]] scene, and ''[[The Laughing Policeman (novel)|The Laughing Policeman]]'' earned a "Best Novel" Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1971. The books were translated from Swedish into 35 different languages, and have sold roughly ten million copies. Sjöwall and Wahlöö used [[Black comedy|black humour]] extensively in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.crimefictionlover.com/2014/09/cis-a-guide-to-the-martin-beck-series/|title = CIS: A GUIDE TO THE MARTIN BECK SERIES|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Megraw|first = Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is widely recognised as one of the finest police procedural series.

===Elizabeth Linington/Dell Shannon/Lesley Egan===
A prolific author of police procedurals, whose work has fallen out of fashion in the years since her death, is [[Elizabeth Linington]] writing under her own name, as well as "Dell Shannon" and "Lesley Egan." Linington reserved her Dell Shannon pseudonym primarily for procedurals featuring LAPD Central [[Homicide]] [[Lieutenant]] Luis Mendoza (1960–86). Under her own name she wrote about Sergeant Ivor Maddox of LAPD's North Hollywood Station, and as Lesley Egan she wrote about suburban cop Vic Varallo. These novels are often considered severely flawed, partly due to the author's far-right political viewpoint (she was a proud member of the [[John Birch Society]]), but primarily because Miss Linington's books, notwithstanding the frequent comments she made about the depth of her research, were all seriously deficient in the single element most identified with the police procedural, technical accuracy. However, they have a certain charm in their depiction of a kinder, gentler California, where the police were always "good guys" who solved all the crimes and respected the citizenry.

===Georges Simenon===
It has been suggested{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that the ''[[Inspector Maigret]]'' novels of [[Georges Simenon]] aren't really procedurals because of their strong focus on the lead character, but the novels have always included subordinate members of his staff as supporting characters. More importantly, Simenon, who had been a journalist covering police investigations before creating Maigret, was giving an accurate depiction, or at least the appearance of an accurate depiction, of law enforcement in Paris. Further, Simenon's influence on later European procedural writers, like [[Sweden]]'s [[Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö]], or [[A. C. Baantjer|Baantjer]], is obvious.

===Joseph Wambaugh===
Though not the first police officer to write procedurals, [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s success has caused him to become the exemplar of cops who turn their professional experiences into fiction.  The son of a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], policeman, Wambaugh joined the Los Angeles Police Department after a stint of military duty.  In 1970, his first novel, ''[[The New Centurions]]'', was published.  This followed three police officers through their training in the Academy, their first few years on the street, culminating in the Watts riots of 1965.  It was followed by such novels as ''The Blue Knight'', 1971, ''[[The Choirboys (book)|The Choirboys]]'', 1975, ''Hollywood Station'', 2006, and acclaimed non-fiction books like ''[[The Onion Field]]'', 1973, ''Lines and Shadows'', 1984, and ''Fire Lover'', 2002.  Wambaugh has said that his main purpose is less to show how cops work on the job, than how the job works on cops.

===Tony Hillerman===
[[Tony Hillerman]], the author of 17 novels involving Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, wrote procedurals in which the procedures were those of the [[Navajo Tribal Police]].

===Detective novel writers===
It is difficult to disentangle the early roots of the procedural from its forebear, the traditional detective novel, which often featured a police officer as protagonist. By and large, the better known novelists such as [[Ngaio Marsh]] produced work that falls more squarely into the province of the traditional or "cozy" detective novel. Nevertheless, some of the work of authors less well known today, like [[Freeman Wills Crofts]]'s novels about Inspector French or some of the work of the prolific team of [[G. D. H. Cole|G.D.H.]] and [[Margaret Cole]], might be considered as the antecedents of today's police procedural.  British mystery novelist and critic [[Julian Symons]], in his 1972 history of crime fiction, ''Bloody Murder'', labeled these proto-procedurals "humdrums," because of their emphasis on the plodding nature of the investigators.

===TV series===
{{Main|List of police television dramas}}

====United States====
* ''[[Dragnet (series)#Television|Dragnet]]'' (1951–59, 1967–70, 1989–91 and 2003–04) was a pioneering police procedural that began on radio in 1949 and then on television in 1951. ''Dragnet'' established the tone of many police dramas in subsequent decades, and the rigorously authentic depictions of such elements as organizational structure, professional jargon, legal issues, etc., set the standard for technical accuracy that became the most identifiable element of the police procedural in all media.  The show was occasionally accused of presenting an overly idealized portrait of law enforcement in which the police (represented by Sgt. [[Joe Friday]]) were invariably presented as "good guys" and the criminals as "bad guys", with little moral flexibility or complexity between the two. However, many episodes depicted sympathetic perpetrators while others depicted unsympathetic or corrupt cops.  Further, though Jack Webb may have seemed to go to extremes to depict the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] in a favorable light, most depictions of cops at the time of ''Dragnet'''s debut were both unsympathetic and unrealistic.  Webb's depiction was meant to offer balance.  Also, the show benefited from the unprecedented technical advice, involvement, and support of the LAPD, a first in TV, which may also have been an incentive to depict the Department favorably.  After the success of ''Dragnet'', Webb produced other procedural shows like ''[[The DA's Man]]'', about an undercover investigator for the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s Office, ''[[Adam-12]]'', about a pair of uniformed [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers patrolling their beat in a radio car, and ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]'', with [[David Janssen]] as a trouble-shooting federal officer.
* ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' (1959–63)  fictionalized real-life Federal Agent [[Eliot Ness]]'s ongoing fight with prohibition-era gangs in [[Chicago]] and elsewhere.  Originally a two-part presentation on the anthology series ''[[Desilu Playhouse]]'', it made such a splash that a series was launched the following fall.  That two-part pilot, later released to theaters under the title ''The Scarface Mob'', stuck comparatively close to the actual events, with Ness, as played by [[Robert Stack]], recruiting a team of incorruptible investigators to help bring down [[Al Capone]]. Later episodes showed Ness and his squad, after Capone, going after just about every big name gangster of the era, and when the writers ran out of real-life figures to pit against Ness, they created new ones. [[Quinn Martin]], who would become closely associated with police and crime shows like this, produced the series during its first season, leaving to found his own company, QM Productions, which would go one to produce police procedural shows like ''[[The New Breed (TV series)|The New Breed]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Dan August]]'', and ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'' over the next twenty years.  The success of the series led to an [[Academy Award]]-winning [[The Untouchables (1987 film)|motion picture]] in 1987, and a new TV [[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|series]] that was syndicated to local stations in 1993.
* ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'' (1973–78) was an anthology series set in Los Angeles created by [[LAPD]] Detective Sergeant Joseph Wambaugh.  Hard-hitting and unflinchingly realistic, its anthology format made it possible to look at LAPD police work from many different perspectives, what it was like to be a woman in a male-dominated profession, an honest cop suspected of corruption, a rookie cop, an undercover narc, a veteran facing retirement, or a cop who had to adjust to crippling injuries incurred in the line of duty.  Despite its anthology format, there were a number of characters who appeared in more than one episode, including Robbery/Homicide partners Tony Calabrese ([[Tony Lo Bianco]]) and Bert Jameson ([[Don Meredith]]), vice cop turned homicide detective Charlie Czonka ([[James Farentino]]), and stakeout-surveillance specialist Joe LaFrieda ([[Vic Morrow]]).  Several series were spun off from the show, including ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', ''Joe Forrester'', and ''[[David Cassidy: Man Under Cover|Man Undercover]]''.  During its last two seasons, the show appeared as an irregular series of two-hour [[TV movies]] rather than a weekly one-hour program.  The show was revived for a season in 1988, using old scripts reshot with new casts when a writers' strike made new material inaccessible.
* ''[[Kojak]]'' (1973–78, 1989–90) created by [[Abby Mann]], focused on a veteran [[New York City]] detective-lieutenant played by [[Telly Savalas]].  Its exteriors were filmed at New York's Ninth Precinct, the same place where ''[[NYPD Blue]]'''s exteriors would be filmed.  In 1989 Savalas returned to the role briefly for five two-hour episodes, in which Kojak had been promoted to [[inspector]] and placed in charge of the Major Crimes Squad. It rotated with three other detective shows on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  A 2005 remake for the [[USA Network]] starred [[Ving Rhames]]. Kojak's most memorable character trait was his signature lollipop.
* ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' (1981–87) featured a number of intertwined storylines in each episode, and pioneered depiction of the conflicts between the work and private lives of officers and detectives on which the police procedural was centered.  The show had a deliberate "documentary" style, depicting officers who were flawed and human, and dealt openly with the gray areas of morality between right and wrong.  It was set in an unidentified east coast or Midwestern US city.  The show was written by [[Steven Bochco]] and Michael Kozoll.
* ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]'' (1982–88) revolved around two female NYPD detectives who led very different lives. Christine Cagney, played by [[Sharon Gless]], was a single-minded, witty, brash career woman. Mary Beth Lacey was a resourceful, sensitive working mom. [[Loretta Swit]] was the original choice for Cagney [she played the role in a TV movie] however she couldn't get out of her contract on ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. During the first season, [[Meg Foster]] played the part of Cagney, while [[Tyne Daly]] played Lacey, the role she had originated in the pilot. [[CBS]] canceled the series claiming low ratings. It was brought back due both to a letter-writing campaign which drew millions of letters nationwide and because the ratings went ''up'' during summer reruns. A ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine read "Welcome Back". Daly continued as Lacey, but Foster was replaced with Gless, who would become the actress most identified with the part. It had 36 nominations and 14 wins during its run.  Four TV movies were broadcast after the series ended.
* ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1984–90) and ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' (1987–91) showed the MTV style of Police procedurals.
* The [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]], which started with the long-running series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' (1990–2010), focuses on the two 'halves' of a criminal proceeding in the [[New York City]] criminal justice system: the investigation of the crime by the [[New York City Police Department]] homicide detectives and the subsequent prosecution of the criminals by the [[New York County District Attorney]]'s office. The success of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' inspired nine other [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series in four different countries:
** Five in the U.S.: ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999–present), which focuses on sex crimes such as rape and child molestation, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' (2001–11), focusing on major crimes from the point of view of the criminal and capturing them from a psychological side, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]'' (2005–06), which focuses more on the trial from both the prosecution and the defense teams' points of view, ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'' (2006) and ''[[Law &amp; Order: LA]]'' (2010–11). ''Special Victims Unit'', ''Criminal Intent'', and ''LA'' series focused more on the police procedurals than ''Trial by Jury'' and ''Conviction''.  As of August 2011, ''Special Victims Unit'' is the only currently running American series in the ''Law &amp; Order'' franchise.
** Two in [[Russia]]: Adaptations of ''Special Victims Unit'' (2007) and ''Criminal Intent'' (2007), both set in [[Moscow]].
** ''[[Paris enquêtes criminelles]]'' (2007), a [[France|French]] adaptation of ''Criminal Intent'' set in [[Paris]].
** ''[[Law &amp; Order: UK]]'' (2009–2014), a [[United Kingdom|British]] adaptation of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' set in [[London]].
:Aside from being its depiction of police investigation, this program also relates to the [[legal drama]] and "forensic pathology" subgenres, and has inspired such other programs as the ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' [[CSI (franchise)|series]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' (1993–99; TV movie in 2000), a police procedural focusing on the homicide unit of the [[Baltimore]] city police department. Critically praised{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} (although frequently struggling in the ratings), the show was more of an ensemble piece, focusing on the activities of the unit as a whole (although significant characters such as Detective [[Frank Pembleton]] and Detective [[John Munch]], who has also appeared on the various ''Law &amp; Order'' shows, among others, became popular with viewers). The show (particularly in its first three seasons) used long-form arcs to depict ongoing criminal investigations, such as the investigation of a murdered child in the first season, which ran through 13 episodes but ended without an arrest or conviction, or even conclusive proof of who committed the crime. The show also heavily featured the complex internal politics of the police department, suggesting that rising through the ranks has more to do with personal connections, favors and opportunism than genuine ability.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' (1993–2005) explored the internal and external struggles of the assorted investigators of the fictional 15th Precinct of Manhattan.  The show gained notoriety for profanity and nudity never previously broadcast on American network television. ''NYPD Blue'' was created by genre veteran [[Steven Bochco]] and [[David Milch]]. The cast of ''NYPD Blue'' included actor Dennis Franz, who previously played Detective Buntz on ''Hill Street Blues'', as well as on a spin-off series, ''Beverly Hills Buntz''. Another cast member, David Caruso, would later play Lt. Horatio Caine on ''CSI: Miami''.
* The [[CSI (franchise)|CSI franchise]] which started with ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' (2000–2015) and eventually spawned two  spin-offs focused on solving ordinary crimes using forensics, ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' (2002-2012) and ''[[CSI: NY]]'' (2004-2013).  Produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], these three shows focus on three groups of forensic scientists in [[Las Vegas]], [[Miami]] and [[New York City]] who investigate how and why a person has died and if it is a murder or not by investigating not only [[whodunit]] but also howdunit. A third spin-off, ''[[CSI: Cyber]]'' (2015-2016), focused on cybercrime and its impact on modern society.
** The CSI franchise inspired other forensic shows such as ''[[Body of Proof]]'' (2011–2013), ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' (2005-2017) and ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'' (2001–2007).
** The CSI franchise also inspired other crime dramas involving teams solving crimes but not relying on forensics; these include victim and witness memory for cold cases and missing people in ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'' (2003–2010) and ''[[Without a Trace]]'' (2002-2009) respectively, psychological profiling in ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' (2005-), using [[mathematics]] in ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numbers]]'' (2005-2010) and using deception in ''[[The Mentalist]]'' (2008–2015).
* ''[[The Shield]]'' (2002–08) is about an experimental division of the Los Angeles Police Department set up in the fictional Farmington district ("the Farm") of Los Angeles, using a converted church ("the Barn") as their police station, and featuring a group of detectives called "The Strike Team", who will do anything to bring justice to the streets. Michael Chiklis (Chiklis previously played the title character in the TV series ''The Commish'') has top billing with his portrayal of Strike Team leader Detective Victor "Vic" Mackey. The show has an ensemble cast that will normally run a number of separate story lines through each episode. It was on the [[FX network]] and was known for its portrayal of police brutality and its realism. The show inspired other shows similar to ''The Shield'' such as ''[[Dark Blue (TV series)|Dark Blue]]'' and ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]''. ''The Shield'' was created by writer/producer [[Shawn Ryan]].
* The ''[[NCIS (franchise)|NCIS]]'' franchise was spun off from the CBS series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' in 2003. The original series, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (2003-present) follows the Major Case Response Team of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], as they investigate crimes related to the [[US Navy]] and [[Marine Corps]]. ''NCIS'' has been among the top scripted series on U.S. television, and has received two spin-offs; ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' (2009-) deals with an LA-based branch dealing in special undercover assignments, and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' (2014-) focuses on a small group of agents who handle cases from the Mississippi River to the Texas Panhandle.
* ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'' (2009-2016), ''[[The Mentalist]]'' (2008-2015), ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' (2002–2009) and ''[[Psych]]'' (2006-2014) feature quirky investigators with their own distinct methods of solving crimes and are equally comedic shows as they are police procedurals.
* [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'']] is a multi-genre franchise that focuses on the [[Chicago]] [[Chicago P.D. (TV series)|Police Department]], the [[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Fire Department]] and the [[Chicago Med|Medical branch]] respectively.

====India====
* ''[[C.I.D. (India TV series)|C.I.D.]]'' (1995–present) C.I.D. is an Indian crime detective series that airs on Sony TV. It is about a team of detectives belonging to the Criminal Investigation Department in Mumbai. The protagonists of the show are played by [[Shivaji Satam]], [[Aditya Srivastava]], [[Dayanand Shetty]], [[Dinesh Phadnis]], [[Hrishikesh Pandey]], [[Vivek Mashru]], [[Jasveer Kaur]], [[Ansha Saeed]].The forensic experts are played by [[Narendra Gupta]] and [[Shraddha Musale]] respectively.

====Austria====
* ''[[Inspector Rex]]'' (1994–2003) was an Austrian homicide detective series, whiched aired all over the world and was (and still is) incredibly popular in Australia when broadcast on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]. It is about a German Shepherd police dog named Rex and his owner, Detective-Inspector Richard Moser of the Vienna Kriminalpolizei. Rex was a bomb squad dog whose handler was killed at a crime scene that Moser was investigating. Moser's team consisted of Ernst Stockinger (seasons 1 and 2), and Peter Hollerer (seasons 1 to 4), and Christian Bock (seasons 3 to 6). Dr Leo Graf served as forensic pathalogist/coroner throughout the whole series, who often described autopsy scenes &amp; procedures much to the disgust of the police staff. Moser was murdered by a psychotic serial killer halfway through season 4. New detective inspector Alexander Brandtner took over Moser's role after Moser's untimely death. 
Rex frequently saved the team's necks during pursuits and catching criminals, sniffing out clues, rescuing child victims, as well as occasionally being a nuisance around the office or while interviewing suspects.
The show mixes series themes with occasional comedy, such as Rex's penchant for [[ham rolls]] (wurstsemmeln), demanding to buy many dog toys, and interfering with Moser's &amp; Brandtner's erratic love lives.

====United Kingdom====
* ''[[Fabian of the Yard]]'', (1954–55) – possibly the first police drama to be made for British TV, this series, based on the memoirs of real-life Scotland Yard detective Robert Fabian, had a lot in common with ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''.  Just as ''Dragnet'' had been the first network drama series with continuing characters to be shot on film, so ''Fabian of the Yard'' was one of the first British series to be filmed.  Both shows featured voice-over narration by the main character; both fictionalized stories derived from real-life cases; and both ended with an epilogue that revealed the ultimate fate of the criminals.  On ''Fabian'', this took the form of a medium-shot of Bruce Seton, who played Fabian in the series, seated at a desk.  The shot slowly dissolved into one of the real-life Fabian in the same pose at the same desk.  At that point, the actual Fabian stood up and told the audience what happened to the criminal he'd caught in the real-life case that had just been dramatized.
* ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', (1955–76) – [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] reprised the role of [[Constable]] George Dixon, the uniformed beat cop he had played in ''[[The Blue Lamp]]'', despite the fact that the Dixon character had been tragically murdered in that film.  During the course of this somewhat gentle series, Warner's character became, for many, the living embodiment of what every British "bobby" was supposed to be.  As the series progressed, Dixon went through several promotions, eventually winding up as the [[Station Sergeant]] at his local division.  By the final season, with Warner now over 80, Dixon retired and the focus shifted to the younger officers he'd trained up over the years.
* ''[[No Hiding Place]]'', (1957–67) – Produced with the cooperation of Scotland Yard, this long-running series featured Raymond Francis as high-ranking Met detective Tom Lockhart.  During its run, the series went through several title changes.  When it began in 1957, it was known as ''Murder Bag'', referring to the [[murder bag|bag of investigative tools]] that [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] Lockhart carried with him whenever he was called to a case.  In 1959, with Lockhart promoted to [[Chief Superintendent]], it became ''Crime Sheet''.  Later in 1959, the series was given its final and best-remembered title, ''No Hiding Place'', which lasted until the series ended in 1967.
* ''[[Z-Cars]]'', (1962–78) – a police drama about two teams of uniformed constables ([[Brian Blessed]], [[Joseph Brady (actor)|Joseph Brady]], [[James Ellis (actor)|James Ellis]], and [[Jeremy Kemp]]) assigned to "Crime Patrol" duties in a pair of powerful [[Ford Zephyr]]s, under the supervision of Detective Sergeant John Watt ([[Frank Windsor]]) and Detective [[Chief Inspector]] Charlie Barlow ([[Stratford Johns]]).  A franker, and often less flattering portrait of police work than audience were used to seeing on ''Dixon of Dock Green'', the show was an immediate hit, its popularity generating spin-offs like ''[[Softly, Softly (TV series)|Softly, Softly]]'' (1966–76), ''[[Barlow at Large]]'' (1971–75), and ''[[Second Verdict]]'' (1976).
* ''[[Gideon's Way]]'', (1965–66) – a crime series produced during 1964/65 and based on the novels by [[John Creasey]] (as J. J. Marric). The series was made at Elstree in twin production with [[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]] TV series. It starred Liverpudlian [[John Gregson]] in the title role as Commander George [[Gideon of Scotland Yard]], with [[Alexander Davion]] as his assistant, Detective Chief Inspector David Keen, [[Reginald Jessup]] as Det. Superintendent LeMaitre (nicknamed Lemmy), [[Ian Rossiter]] as Detective Chief Superintendent Joe Bell and [[Basil Dignam]] as Commissioner Scott-Marle.
* ''[[New Scotland Yard (TV series)|New Scotland Yard]]'', (1972–74) – a police drama series produced by [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network between 1972 and 1974. It features the activities of two officers from the [[Criminal Investigations Department]] (CID) in the [[Metropolitan Police]] force headquarters at [[New Scotland Yard]], as they dealt with the assorted villains of the day.
* ''[[The Sweeney]]'', (1975–78) – a drama series focusing on the [[Flying Squad]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]] and their twenty-four-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job of catching some of the most dangerous and violent criminals in London. The [[television program]] featured [[Detective Inspector]] Jack Regan ([[John Thaw]]) and other tough-talking hard-drinking members of his elite unit, both on and off duty. With its high level of violence, location filming, bold frankness, and well written scripts, ''The Sweeney'' revolutionized the genre.  The series was so phenomenally popular that two feature-length movies, ''Sweeney!'' (1976) and ''Sweeney 2'' (1978) were released to theatres during the show's original broadcast run.
*''[[The Gentle Touch]]'', (1980–84) – a British police drama television series made by London Weekend Television for ITV. Commencing transmission on 11 April 1980, the series is notable for being the first British series to feature a female police detective as its leading character, ahead of the similarly themed BBC series Juliet Bravo by four months.
*''[[Juliet Bravo]]'', (1980–85) – a British television series, which ran on BBC1. The theme of the series concerned a female police inspector who took over control of a police station in the fictional town of Hartley in Lancashire.
* ''[[Taggart]]'' (1983–2010)
* ''[[The Bill]]'', (1984–2010) – a drama series focusing on both the uniformed and plain-clothes police officers working out of a fictional inner-London police station. The original conception of this series was as purely procedural, with an almost fly-on-the-wall approach that survived to an extent throughout.
* The ''[[Prime Suspect (UK TV series)|Prime Suspect]]'' series, (1991–2006) – featuring [[Helen Mirren]] as Detective Chief Inspector (later Chief Superintendent) Jane Tennison, which focused on the police investigations and on Tennison's conflicts with her fellow officers as a prominent female detective in a heavily male-dominated work environment, as well as her personal problems concerning her family and after-work life.
* ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'' (1993–95) - hard-hitting drama series following dysfunctional  criminal psychologist Dr Edward "Fitz" Fitzgerald, played by [[Robbie Coltrane]]
* ''[[McCallum (TV series)|McCallum]]'' (1995–98)
* ''[[Hamish Macbeth (TV series)|Hamish Macbeth]]'' (1995–97) - police drama-comedy set in the west coast Highlands of Scotland, starring [[Robert Carlyle]]
* ''[[The Cops (TV series)|The Cops]]'' (1998–2000) – perhaps the most realistic police drama series yet seen on British TV, noted for its documentary-style camerawork and uncompromising portrayal of the police force.
* ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' (1992–2010) is made by [[Yorkshire Television]] at [[The Leeds Studios]] for broadcast on [[ITV Network|ITV]]. It lasted 18 series. Set in 1960s [[Yorkshire]], in the fictional town of Ashfordly and the nearby village of Aidensfield in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], the motorcycle-riding Aidensfield village bobby was originally played by [[Nick Berry]].
* ''[[Rebus (TV series)|Rebus]]'' (2000–07)
* ''[[Law &amp; Order: UK]]'' (2009–2014) is an adaptation of the [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]] for the British market. The programme is financed by [[Kudos Film and Television]], Wolf Films (a company owned by [[Dick Wolf]], the creator of the franchise) and [[NBC Universal]] and airs on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The show is adapted from scripts and episodes of the original U.S. ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''.
* ''[[Suspects (TV series)|Suspects]]'' (2014–present) is an East London-based police procedural shot in a stripped-back documentary style using improvised dialogue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a549763/suspects-channel-5s-stripped-back-cop-drama-its-electrifying.html |title=Suspects - Channel 5's stripped back cop drama: "It's electrifying". |work=Digitalspy.co.uk |author=Morgan Jeffery |date=10 February 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and follows DS Jack Weston ([[Damien Molony]]), DC Charlie Steele ([[Claire-Hope Ashitey]]) and their superior DI Martha Bellamy ([[Fay Ripley]]) as they investigate various crimes.

==Comic strips and books==
The [[comic strip]] ''[[Dick Tracy]]'' is often pointed to as an early procedural. Indeed, in his introduction to a 1970 collection of ''Tracy'' strips entitled ''The Celebrated Cases of Dick Tracy'', no less an authority than [[Ellery Queen]] suggested that Tracy, predating Webb, Treat, Creasey, and McBain, was the first "truly" procedural policeman in any fictional medium.

Certainly ''Tracy'' creator [[Chester Gould]] seemed to be trying to reflect the real world. Tracy himself, conceived by Gould as a "modern-day [[Sherlock Holmes]]", was partly modeled on real-life law enforcer Eliot Ness, and his first, and most frequently recurring, antagonist, the [[Alphonse "Big Boy" Caprice|Big Boy]], was based on Ness's real-life nemesis Al Capone. Other members of Tracy's [[Recurring characters in Dick Tracy|Rogues Gallery]], like Boris Arson, [[Flattop Jones]], and Maw Famon, were inspired, respectively, by [[John Dillinger]], [[Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd]], and [[Ma Barker|Kate "Ma" Barker]].

More to the point, Gould was making a genuine attempt to portray police work realistically.  Once ''Tracy'' was sold to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' syndicate, Gould enrolled in a criminology class at [[Northwestern University]], met with members of the [[Chicago Police Department]], and did research at the Department's crime lab, to make his depiction of law enforcement more authentic.  Ultimately, he hired retired [[Chicago]] policeman Al Valanis, a pioneering forensic sketch artist, as both an artistic assistant and police technical advisor.

Later stories, in which Gould veered into [[space opera]] and extraterrestrial contacts, mitigated somewhat against the strip's being recognized for its early use of realistic police procedure, but any examination of the ''Tracy'' strip from its beginnings in 1931 through the 1950s makes Gould's status as a pioneer in the police procedural subgenre clear.

The success of ''Tracy'' led to many more police strips.  While some, like Norman Marsh's ''[[Dan Dunn]]'' were unabashedly slavish imitations of ''Tracy'', others, like [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s and [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Secret Agent X-9]]'', took a more original approach.  Still others, like Eddie Sullivan's and Charlie Schmidt's ''[[Radio Patrol]]'' and Will Gould's ''Red Barry'', steered a middle course. One of the best post-''Tracy'' procedural comics was ''[[Kerry Drake]]'', written and created by Allen Saunders and illustrated by [[Alfred Andriola]]. It diverged from the metropolitan settings used in ''Tracy'' to tell the story of the titular Chief Investigator for the District Attorney of a small-town jurisdiction. Later, following a personal tragedy, he leaves the DA's Office and joins his small city's police force in order to fight crime closer to the grass roots level.  As both a DA's man and a city cop, he fights a string of flamboyant, Gould-ian criminals like "Stitches", "Bottleneck", and "Bulldozer."

Other syndicated police strips include [[Zane Grey]]'s ''[[King of the Royal Mounted]]'', depicting police work in the contemporary Canadian Northwest, Lank Leonard's ''[[Mickey Finn (comics)|Mickey Finn]]'', which emphasized the home life of a hard-working cop, and ''Dragnet'', which adapted stories from the pioneering radio-TV series into comics. Early [[comic books]] with police themes tended to be reprints of syndicated newspaper strips like ''Tracy'' and ''Drake''.  Others adapted police stories from other mediums, like the radio-inspired anthology comic ''[[Gang Busters]]'', Dell's ''87th Precinct'' issues, which adapted McBain's novels, or ''The Untouchables'', which adapted the fictionalized TV adventures of real-life policeman Eliot Ness.

More recently, there have been attempts to depict police work with the kind of hard-edged realism seen in the novels of writers like Wambaugh, such as [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] four-issue mini-series ''Cops:  The Job'', in which a rookie police officer learns to cope with the physical, emotional, and mental stresses of law enforcement during her first patrol assignment. With [[superhero]]es having long dominated the comic book market, there have been some recent attempts to integrate elements of the police procedural into the universe of costumed crime-fighters.  ''[[Gotham Central]]'', for example, depicts a group of police detectives operating in [[Batman]]'s [[Gotham City]], and suggested that the caped crime-fighter is disliked by many Gotham detectives for treading on their toes. Meanwhile, ''[[Metropolis SCU]]'' tells the story of the Special Crimes Unit, an elite squad of cops in the police force serving [[Superman]]'s [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].

The use of police procedural elements in superhero comics can partly be attributed to the success of [[Kurt Busiek]]'s groundbreaking 1994 series ''[[Marvels]]'', and his subsequent ''[[Astro City]]'' work, both of which examine the typical superhero universe from the viewpoint of the common man who witnesses the great dramas from afar, participating in them tangentially at best.

In the wake of Busiek's success, many other writers mimicked his approach, with mixed results&amp;nbsp;– the narrative possibilities of someone who does not get involved in drama are limited. In 2000, however, [[Image Comics]] published the first issue of [[Brian Michael Bendis]]'s comic ''[[Powers (comics)|Powers]]'', which followed the lives of homicide detectives as they investigated superhero-related cases. Bendis's success has led both Marvel Comics and [[DC Comics]] to begin their own superhero-themed police procedurals (''[[District X]]'' and the aforementioned ''Gotham Central''), which focus on how the job of a police officer is affected by such tropes as secret identities, superhuman abilities, costumes, and the near-constant presence of [[vigilante]]s.

While the detectives in ''Powers'' were "normal" (unpowered) humans dealing with super-powered crime, [[Alan Moore]] and [[Gene Ha]]'s ''[[Top 10 (comics)|Top 10]]'' mini-series, published by [[America's Best Comics]] in 2000–01, centered around the super-powered police force in a setting where powers are omnipresent. The comic detailed the lives and work of the police force of Neopolis, a city in which everyone, from the police and criminals to civilians, children and even pets, has super-powers, colourful costumes and secret identities.

'''''Portrait of Francisco de Pisa''''' is a 1614 painting by [[El Greco]], now in the [[Kimbell Art Museum]] in Fort Worth, Texas. Most art historians identify it as doctor [[Francisco de Pisa]], a Spanish cleric, though a minority identify it as the Italian historian [[Giacomo Bosio]] due to the words shown in the open book. Francisco de Pisa was an enemy of [[Teresa of Ávila]], who he criticised because he felt that her works contained "much that contradicts truth and sound doctrine and all good use of mental prayer". The pose of the subject is similar to that in ''[[Portrait of Cardinal Tavera]]'', which is of a similar date.

The '''Santa Fe Indian Market''' is an annual art market held in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]] on the weekend following the third Thursday in August. The event draws an estimated 150,000 people to the city from around the world.&lt;ref name=Wunderman&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/meet-artists-displaying-years-santa-fe-indian-market-largest-juried-native-art-show-world-180964571/|title=Meet the Artists Displaying at This Year’s Santa Fe Indian Market, the Largest Juried Native Art Show in the World|last=Wunderman|first=Ali|date=2017-08-18|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southwestern Association for Indian Arts (SWAIA) organizes the market, showcasing work from 1,200 of the top [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] artists from tribes across the country.&lt;ref name="tryk" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Santa-Fe-Indian-Market-fuses-tradition-with-11818045.php|title=Santa Fe Indian Market fuses tradition with contemporary art|last=Montoya Bryan|first=Susan|date=|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814234650/http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Santa-Fe-Indian-Market-fuses-tradition-with-11818045.php|archive-date=2017-08-14|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
Indian Market was organized by Kenneth Chapman in 1922 as part of an expanded [[Fiesta de Santa Fe]] sponsored by the [[Museum of New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartley|first1=Cody|title=Art in an Arid Climate : The Museum of New Mexico and the Cultivation of the Arts in Santa Fe|date=2005|publisher=University of California|location=Santa Barbara|pages=166-171}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the New Mexico Association on Indian Affairs took over the event.&lt;ref name="tryk"&gt;Tryk, Sheila, ''Santa Fe Indian Market: Showcase of Native American Art'', Santa Fe: Tierra Publications, 1993. {{ISBN|0-9622807-4-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts organizes the market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Featured art ==
The market features [[pottery]], [[Jewellery|jewelry]], [[Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas|textile weavings]], painting, sculpture, beadwork, [[Basket weaving|basketry]], and other traditional and contemporary work. It is the oldest and largest [[Juried (competition)|juried]] Native American art showcase in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilotguides.com/destination_guide/north_america/south_west_usa/santa_fe_indian_market.php Guide to the Indian Market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016202444/http://www.pilotguides.com/destination_guide/north_america/south_west_usa/santa_fe_indian_market.php |date=2006-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic impact of the Market has been calculated at more than $19 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2002/01/21/daily16.html "Santa Fe Indian Market's economic impact more than $19 million, survey shows."] ''New Mexico Business Weekly'', 24 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authenticity standards for featured artists ===
Artists display their work in booths around the [[Santa Fe Plaza]] and adjacent streets, selling directly to the general public. In order to participate, all artists must provide proof of enrollment in one of the [[federally recognized tribe|federally recognized tribes]], and their work must meet strict quality and authentic materials standards.&lt;ref name="Wunderman" /&gt; Art experts judge the work and distribute awards and prize money in various categories. On the evening before the Market's opening, members of SWAIA may attend a preview of representative works by the artists as well as the winners in each category. It is a way for potential buyers to preview the winning artworks and items for sale. Many buyers make a point of arriving downtown very early in the morning, and it is not unusual to find artists having sold out within a few hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5838">{{for|the physics and fluid mechanics effect called "shear layer"|Boundary layer}}
'''Shearing layers''' is a concept coined by architect [[Frank Duffy (architect)|Frank Duffy]], which was later elaborated by [[Stewart Brand]] in his book, ''[[How Buildings Learn|How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They’re Built]]'' (Brand, 1994), and refers to buildings as composed of several layers of change. The concept has been adopted by a number of technology vendors to also describe the different layers of systems within an organisation.

==Description==
The Shearing layers concept views buildings as a set of components that evolve in different timescales; Frank Duffy summarized this view in his phrase: “Our basic argument is that there isn't any such thing as a building. A building properly conceived is several layers of longevity of built components” (quoted in (Brand, 1994)).

The layers are (quoted from Brand, 1994):

;Site: This is the geographical setting, the urban location, and the legally defined lot, whose boundaries and context outlast generations of ephemeral buildings. "Site is eternal." Duffy agrees. 
;Structure: The foundation and load-bearing elements are perilous and expensive to change, so people don't. These are the building. Structural life ranges from thirty to three hundred years (but few buildings make it past sixty for other reasons). 
;Skin: Exterior surfaces now change every twenty years or so, to keep up with fashion or technology, or for wholesale repair. Recent focus on energy costs has led to re-engineered skins that are air-tight and better-[[Building insulation|insulated]]. 
;Services: These are the working guts of a building: communications wiring, electrical wiring, [[plumbing]], [[fire sprinkler system]]s, [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning), and moving parts like [[elevator]]s and [[escalators]]. They wear out or obsolesce every seven to fifteen years. Many buildings are demolished early if their outdated systems are too deeply embedded to replace easily. 
;Space Plan: The Interior layout—where walls, ceilings, floors, and doors go. Turbulent commercial space can change every three years or so; exceptionally quiet homes might wait thirty years. 
;Stuff: Chairs, desks, phones, pictures; kitchen appliances, lamps, hairbrushes; all the things that twitch around daily to monthly. [[Furniture]] is called ''mobile'' in [[Italian language|Italian]] for good reason.

==Theory==
The concept is based on the work of ecologists (O’Neill et al., 1985) and systems theorists (Salthe, 1993). The idea is that there are processes in nature, which operate in different timescales and as a result there is little or no exchange of energy/mass/information between them. Brand transferred this intuition to buildings and noticed that traditional buildings were able to adapt because they allowed “slippage” of layers: i.e. faster layers (services) were not obstructed by slower ones (structure).

The concept of Shearing Layers leads to an architectural design principle, known as '''Pace-Layering''', which arranges the layers to allow for maximum adaptability.

==Variations==
The technology advisory firm [[Gartner]] uses the term pace layering in its variation of the shearing layer concept.  They describe how within organisations there are different layers of software applications. Applications which need to adapt and change at different speeds.  They refer to these layers as Systems of Record, Systems of Differentiation and Systems of Innovation. Their proposition is that firms need to look at how these application layers are governed, managed, sourced, maintained and interact to enable companies to better adapt and react to changing business requirements.  Gartner have trade marked this variant/adaptation of pace layering in connection with how companies should manage their application portfolio, referring to is as the PACE layered application strategy (trademark).

==Application==
The Shearing Layers concept has been applied to other man-made artifacts such as software (Simmonds et al., 2000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3341">[[File:Mappa Soleto.jpg|thumb]]
The '''Soleto Map''' is a possibly ancient [[map]], which depicts [[Salento]] on a small piece of [[ostrakon]] derived from a [[terracotta]] vase.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of 2005 colloquium on Soleto Map an Moonpellier, France: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080307125758/http://www.unc.edu/awmc/soletomap.html A New Ancient Map? The Salentine peninsula in the 5th century BC] (page taken down: link from Wayback Machine).&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the ostrakon is undoubtedly ancient, doubts have been raised about the age of the map.

==Background==
The map was discovered in [[Soleto]] (southern [[Italy]]) by [[Belgium|Belgian]] archaeologist Thierry van Compernolle of [[Montpellier University]] on August 21, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper article on the discovery of the map:[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/11/18/wmap18.xml Telegraph - Archaeologists find western world's oldest map]&lt;/ref&gt; The map itself dates back to 500 BC and contains letters derived from a [[Greek script]]. The languages expressed on the map are both [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and [[Messapian language|Messapian]]. Moreover, the Soleto Map describes the city of [[Taranto]] (called Taras), as well as other cities of Salento such as Soleto, [[Santa Maria di Leuca|Leuca]], [[Ugento]], and [[Otranto]]. The map went on public display in 2005 at the Archaeological National Museum of Taranto.

==Controversy==
Even though the Soleto Map is considered the oldest map in [[Western culture|Western civilization]], there are allegations that it is a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;One of those allegations is here: http://www.maproomblog.com/2006/02/is_the_soleto_map_a_forgery.php (read on November 26th, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In the January/February 2006 issue of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] newspaper ''Geschiedenis Magazine'', Dutch [[archaeologist]] Douwe Yntema of Vrije University in [[Amsterdam]] found the authenticity of the map questionable.&lt;ref&gt;See this article for more discussion on this controversy:[http://mailman.geo.uu.nl/pipermail/maphist/2006-February/006646.html Maphist - 'World's oldest map' a fake? (Soleto map 5th century BC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713101518/http://mailman.geo.uu.nl/pipermail/maphist/2006-February/006646.html |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the ostrakon is ancient, the authenticity of the engravings are dubious.&lt;ref&gt;See this article for more discussion on this controversy:[http://mailman.geo.uu.nl/pipermail/maphist/2006-February/006646.html Maphist - 'World's oldest map' a fake?

Moreover, the Soleto Map shows the towns as points rather than house symbols found on other ancient maps. Finally, the engravings follow the precise borders of the ostrakon itself, which can lead anyone to interpret the Soleto Map as being made after the terracotta vase was first broken.&lt;ref&gt;Claus Moser, [http://www.kartentisch.de/?p=70 (in German)] at kartentisch.de&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9607">{{Other uses|Street Wars (disambiguation){{!}}Street Wars}}
'''StreetWars''' is a three-week-long [[water gun]] "assassination" tournament that travels to cities around the world. Created by Franz Aliquo and Liao Yutai, the tournament is based on the college and high school game [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]].

The June 2007 issue of [[Maxim (magazine)|''Maxim'' magazine]] has an article written by one of the participants of the 2006 London Streetwar.

==History and background of the tournament==
The tournament is loosely based on the game [[Assassin (game)|Assassin]], popular among some high school and college students. Aliquo and Liao took the game citywide and opened it to anyone above the age of 18, and changed it to a 3 week long, 24/7 format. Featured in the book "Spray," by Harry Edge, as a tournament known as Water Wars, with different directors than the actual game.

The first StreetWars took place in the summer of 2004 in [[New York City]]; subsequent tournaments took place in [[Vancouver]] (2004), [[Vienna]] (2004), [[New York City]] (2005, 2006, 2008, 2009), [[San Francisco]] (2005, 2007, 2010), [[Los Angeles]] (2006), [[London]] (2006, 2007,2010), [[Chicago]] (2007), and [[Paris]] (2007).

==Controversy==
===Mayor Bloomberg blasts StreetWars===
In July 2005, when asked of his opinion on StreetWars, Mayor [[Mike Bloomberg]] of [[New York City]] said that the creators of StreetWars could probably 'use some psychiatric help'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/17576?page_no=1 Bloomberg Says Creator of StreetWars Could Probably 'Use Some Psychiatric Help'], [[New York Sun]], July 26, 2005. Accessed 25 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police concerns in London===
Before the start of the game in London in July 2006, police voiced concerns that the associated suspicious activities might lead to deployment of officers and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/5211998.stm Water pistol game 'irresponsible'], [[BBC]] online, 25 July 2006. Accessed 13 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Shadow Government==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mustache-commander-with-plumber.jpg|frame|thumb|right|Mustache Commander and Agent Plumber in the SF2005 game]] --&gt;
While StreetWars was created by Aliquo and Liao, the tournament itself is operated by an organization that calls itself "The Shadow Government", led by two mysterious figures known only as "Supreme Commander" and "Mustache Commander". His signature is a [[Fedora (hat)|fedora]], [[Cheongsam|mandarin gown]], [[pipe (material)|pipe]], bottle of [[Jack Daniel's|Jack Daniels]], and [[mustache]]. The "Mustache Commander" is the fictional alter ego of Yutai Liao, and the "Supreme Commander" – of Franz Aliquo.

Alter ego of StreetWars co-creator, Yutai Liao, Mustache Commander made his first appearance in StreetWars during the San Francisco 2005 game. Previous to the SF 2005 game, there has only been the Supreme Commander and the mysterious "Assigner".

The now famous giant bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] that greets each and every player at the beginning of every tournament, started with the second appearance of the Mustache Commander (the first was with his signature fedora), in an underground tunnel in Golden Gate Park in the SF 2005 tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://streetwars.net/media/Weekend_America2005-streetwars.mp3 The Warriors], radio show Weekend in America follows the Mustache Commander as he meets his players in an underground tunnel in San Francisco (links to an MP3 file)&lt;/ref&gt; The Mustache Commander is now often portrayed with a bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] in hand.

'''Sword swallowing''' is a skill in which the performer passes a [[sword]] through the mouth and down the esophagus to the [[stomach]]. This feat is not [[swallowing]] in the traditional sense; the natural processes that constitute swallowing do not take place, but are repressed in order to keep the passage from the [[mouth]] to the stomach open for the sword. The practice is dangerous and there is risk of injury or death.

==History==
[[File:The great Victorina Troupe.jpg|thumb|alt=circus poster: The great Victorina Troupe|The Great Victorina Troupe: originators and presenters of the most marvelous sword swallowing act on earth|left]]
[[File:Sword swallower in 1980.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;Center&gt;Street performer&lt;/center&gt;]]

Sword swallowing spread to [[Greece]] and [[Rome]] in the 1st century AD and to [[China]] in the 8th century. In [[Japan]], it became a part of the Japanese acrobatic theatre, [[Sarugaku|Sangaku]], which included [[fire eating]], [[tightrope walking]], [[juggling]] and early [[illusion]]. In [[Europe]] it developed into yet a third distinct type of performance associated with the medieval [[jongleur]]s, that of the [[busking|street performance]].

Sword swallowing was performed during the [[Middle Ages]] as part of [[street theatre]] and was popular at festivals and other large gatherings. It began to die out in the mid-19th century, and was outlawed in Scandinavia in 1893.

According to an early 19th-century English magazine article&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvQ0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=%22jugglers+in+india,+from+a+late+narrative%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4xvhdvcBFJ&amp;sig=0uXUrVhapNx1Vv3EYtqO2L68QMc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iCXQUr2TEIWe0QXb3YDgCQ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jugglers%20in%20india%2C%20from%20a%20late%20narrative%22&amp;f=false] 'Jugglers in India, from a late narrative', quoted in ''Select Reviews and Spirit of Foreign Magazines'', ed. Enos Bronson, Philadelphia, 1810: p.124&lt;/ref&gt; the abilities of sword-swallowers in India were considered incredible when first reported in England.  In 1813 'swallowing the sword' was advertised as among the new and astonishing feats&lt;ref&gt;'The swallowing of the sword, and the novelty of the other performances, have attracted the attention of the public beyond any thing that has appeared in the metropolis for many years past.' ''The Times''(London, England), 27 July 1813, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Indian Jugglers surprised the town by swallowing a sword...' ''The Times'',(London, England), 30 September 1820, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; performed by the Indian Jugglers then appearing in London. The troupe was led by the famous juggler and sword swallower Ramo Samee, who continued to perform until his death in London in August 1850, having at times also toured Europe and America.&lt;ref&gt;Article from the ''Salem Gazette'', 5 October 1819&lt;/ref&gt; From 1850 to the 1890s a small number of sword swallowers performed in the UK, such as Martha Mitchell (c 1855) and Benedetti (1863–95), and in the US, including Lawson Peck (c 1850s), Ling Look (c 1872), Wandana (died May 9, 1875), and Harry Parsons (died December 1880).  The best-known North American sword swallower of this time was Fred McLone, better known to the public as "Chevalier Cliquot", who performed from 1878 to the early 20th century.

In 1893 sword swallowing was featured at the [[World Columbian Exposition]] at the Chicago World's Fair.

In the early 1900s traveling [[circuses]] and [[sideshow]]s featured sword swallowers. In Europe performers tried to swallow large numbers of swords; in America there was a focus on the novel and bizarre.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} Some tried to swallow longer swords, many swords, hot swords, [[bayonet]]s or glowing [[neon sign|neon tubes]].  Sword swallowers appeared on the same bill as magicians such as [[Houdini]]. [[Western Europe]] and [[England]] also saw an increase in sword swallowing interest during this period, with many cross-Atlantic influences. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, traveling magic shows from the Orient toured Europe and America; some included sword swallowing. The middle of the 20th century saw a demise in circuses in general and [[sideshow]]s in particular.

==Anatomy and method==
[[Image:Pharynx.gif|thumb|alt=pharynx|The pharynx|201x201px]]The performer must first lean the head back, hyper-extending the neck, and relax the upper esophageal sphincter (a generally involuntary muscle that contracts the top of the esophagus). Retching must be controlled while the sword, lubricated by saliva, is inserted through the mouth and past the pharynx.

Once past the pharynx and sphincter the sword passes swiftly, assisted by gravity, straightening the flexible esophagus. The stomach, at an angle to the esophagus, is brought into line as the sword enters through the cardiac opening.&lt;ref name="SSU"&gt;Witcombe, Brian. [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/331/7524/1080?? "Sword swallowing uncertainties."] ''British Medical Journal.'' 5 Nov 2005. Retrieved 16 Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some swallowers consume a large meal or drink water before performing to give the stomach a more vertical orientation, allowing for easier passage of the sword.&lt;ref name="SSU"/&gt;  Careful focus is required to complete the process without injury, as the sword passes within millimetres of vital body parts such as the aorta, heart and lungs.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt;

==Physical consequences==

Most serious sword swallowing injuries and fatalities occur after minor injuries or while attempting a feat beyond that of a "normal" sword swallow.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; The most common injury is a sore throat when first learning, after frequent consecutive performances, or after swallowing curved swords or several swords at once.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; Swallowing multiple swords simultaneously over time can also lead to distension of the esophagus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/ "Sword Diet Did Not Agree: M'Lone's Exhibition Had Rather Serious Results."] ''New York Times.'' 21 Jan. 1894. Retrieved 29 Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A minor injury may predispose the performer to sustaining a more major one, including perforation of the esophagus, stomach, heart, lungs, and other organs in proximity to the path of the sword, or intestinal bleeding. Twenty-nine deaths have been reported as a result of sword swallowing injuries since 1880.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt;

===Medical case reports===
* A 59-year-old man experienced chest pain and severe dysphagia following practice for his sword swallowing act. An esophageal perforation was found and surgically repaired; 19 days later a leak at the site required a transhiatal esophagectomy with a left cervical esophagogastrostomy. The patient recovered normally, but ceased the practice of sword swallowing.&lt;ref name="EPSS"&gt;Scheinin, Scott A., MD, and Patrick R. Wells, MD. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC101136/ "Esophageal Perforation in a Sword Swallower."] ''Texas Heart Institute Journal.'' 28(2001): 65-68. {{PMC|101136}}. 17 Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 27-year-old woman reported neck pain and a single episode of hematemesis (vomiting blood) after pricking her throat while practicing her sword swallowing act with a sharp dagger. The injury was found to be immediately below the esophageal sphincter, and the patient was admitted to intensive care and placed on intravenous antibiotics and a proton-pump inhibitor. She recovered well and returned to all previous activities with the exception of sword swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Matthew MD, Scott Steele, MD, Philip Mullenix, MD, William Long, MD, and Seth Izenberg, MD.

==Contributions to science==
[[File:Hans Rosling swallows sword.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Rosling]] of Gapminder Foundation swallows a [[bayonet]] during his [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk]]The abilities of sword-swallowers have proven useful to the progress of medical knowledge, specifically in the development and advancement of upper endoscopy.&lt;ref name="EPSS"/&gt;

In 1868 Adolf Kussmaul of Freiburg, Germany, performed an esophagoscopy on a sword-swallower using a rigid 47&amp;nbsp;cm tube, mirrors, and a gasoline lamp.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; The apparatus, an early endoscope, allowed him to examine the esophagus and the fundus of the stomach.&lt;ref name="EPSS"/&gt;

In 1897 a Scottish physician named Stevens performed digestive experiments with a sword swallower assistant; small metal tubes, pierced with holes and filled with meat, were swallowed and after a time regurgitated, allowing Stevens to examine the extent of the digestion that had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Albert A. ''Magic, Stage Illusions, and Scientific Diversions, Including Trick Photography''. New York: Munn &amp; Co., Inc., 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 a doctor named Cremer performed an electrocardiogram by passing an electrode down the  esophagus of a sword swallower.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This approach has since been proven useful by numerous studies; esophageal recording at a location in proximity to the heart improves signal detection.&lt;ref&gt;Machler, Heinrich E. et al. [http://www.anesthanalg.com/content/86/1/34.full.pdf+html "A New High-Resolution Esophageal Electrocardiography Recording Technique: An Experimental Approach for the Detection of Myocardial lschemia."] ''Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia.'' 86.1 (1998): 34-39. 21 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003 to 2006, a research study on the effects of sword swallowing was conducted by Brian Witcombe, consultant radiologist at the [[Gloucestershire Royal Hospital]] in Gloucester, England, and Dan Meyer. The results were published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;Witcombe, Brian and Meyer, Dan. [http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7582/1285.full ' 'Sword swallowing and its side effects.' '] ''British Medical Journal.'' 23 Dec. 2006. Retrieved 16 Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, Dan Meyer worked with physicians and researchers in swallowing disorders at Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Center at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] to explore whether the techniques involved in sword swallowing could be used to help patients who suffer from swallowing disorders such as [[dysphagia]] or [[achalasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.vanderbiltstallworthrehab.com/en/healthcare-professionals/leading-technologies/vitastim-therapy |title=Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Center |publisher=Vanderbilt Stallworth Rehabilitation Center |date= |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Dai Andrews]] worked with Dr. Sharon Caplan at [[Johns Hopkins University]] on a study to determine whether sword swallowing could be used to help patients who suffer from [[achalasia]], or those who had suffered severe throat trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/256861/how-to-swallow-a-sword|title=How to swallow a sword|author=Amy Kraft|publisher=The Week|date=25 February 2014|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Guinness World Records''==
In 2009, the [[Guinness World Record]] for longest sword swallowed was achieved by Natasha Veruschka with a 58&amp;nbsp;cm (22.83&amp;nbsp;in) long sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/longest-sword-swallowed/|title=Longest Sword Swallowed|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guinness World Record for 'Most swords swallowed underwater' is 4 and was achieved by Chayne Hultgren (a.k.a. [[Space Cowboy (performer)|The Space Cowboy]], Australia) on the set of 'Lo Show dei Record' in Milan, Italy, on 11 July 2014. He was also the first person to swallow a sword underwater on May 9, 2006 at Manly Ocean World Aquarium in Sydney Australia. He performed this under water feat in a tank of live sharks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-swords-swallowed-underwater|title=Most swords swallowed underwater|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chayne Hultgren (a.k.a. The Space Cowboy) also holds the most official 'Guinness World Record' for sword swallowing including 'Most swords swallowed at once' (24 swords), 'Most swords swallowed while juggling' (18 swords), 'Most swords swallowed while riding a unicycle' (3 swords swallowed on a 3m tall unicycle) and 'Longest lightning bolt to strike swallowed sword'. The measured distance the stream of electrical discharge traveled from Australia's largest Tesla Coil, owned and operated by Peter Terren (AKA: Dr Electric), to the handle of Chayne's swallowed sword was 3 feet 10 inches. The sword blade measured 62&amp;nbsp;cm and was swallowed all the way to the hilt on the 20th of April 2013. Perth, WA, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UMclIYkApM|title=Shocking World Record by The Space Cowboy!!!

As of July 2016 The Space Cowboy currently holds 44 official [[Guinness World Records]]. He is Australia's most prolific record breaker.

In 2009, the Guinness World Record for "Largest Curve in a Sword Swallowed" was achieved by [[Dai Andrews]] with a 120 degree curved sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-7000/largest-curve-in-a-sword-swallowed/|title=Largest Curve in a Sword Swallowed|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brad Byers]] holds the Guinness World Record for "The Most Swords Swallowed and Twisted at One Time" by swallowing ten 27 inch swords one at a time and then twisting all ten swords 180 degrees in his throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-11000/most-swords-swallowed-and-twisted/|title=Most Swords Swallowed and Twisted|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Blackthorne made the sword known as "The Sword of Swords". It holds the Guinness World Record for the most swallowed sword and has been swallowed by 40 of the world's most known sword swallowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/most-swallowed-sword/|title=Most Swallowed Sword|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Holy Family''''' is a 1518 painting of the [[Holy Family]] ([[Jesus]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Joseph]]), [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Saint Elisabeth]], an infant [[John the Baptist]] and two angels. It is signed by [[Raphael]], but most of the work was delegated to his workshop assistants. It was commissioned by [[Pope Leo X]] as a gift to [[Claude, Duchess of Brittany|Claude]], wife of [[Francis I of France]], hence its name. It is now in the [[Louvre]].

'''''The Joy Luck Club''''' ({{zh|t=喜福會|s=喜福会|p=Xǐ Fú Huì}}) is a 1993 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] about the relationships between [[Chinese-American]] women and their [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrant mothers. It was directed by [[Wayne Wang]] and stars [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Rosalind Chao]], [[Lauren Tom]], [[Tamlyn Tomita]], [[France Nguyen]], [[Kieu Chinh]], [[Lisa Lu]] and [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]]. The film is based on the [[The Joy Luck Club (novel)|eponymous 1989 novel]] by [[Amy Tan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Luck-Club-Amy-Tan/dp/0399134204/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|title=The Joy Luck Club|first=Amy|last=Tan|authorlink= Amy Tan|publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1989|edition=1st|isbn=978-0399134203}}&lt;/ref&gt; who co-wrote the screenplay with [[Ronald Bass]]. The film was produced by Bass, Tan, Wang and [[Patrick Markey]] while [[Oliver Stone]] served as an executive producer.&lt;ref name="Club"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/79925/The-Joy-Luck-Club/full-credits.html|title=The Joy Luck Club|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|location=United States|access-date=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four older women, all Chinese immigrants living in [[San Francisco]], meet regularly to play [[mahjong]], eat, and tell stories. Each of these women has an adult Chinese-American daughter. The film reveals the hidden pasts of the older women and their daughters and how their lives are shaped by the clash of Chinese and American cultures as they strive to understand their family bonds and one another.

Development of the project began when Wang approached Tan in 1989 at the time of the novel's release. Concerned about the novel's complex storytelling and character development, they teamed up with Bass in January 1990, who added a farewell party not in the original novel and [[voice-over]]s to compress the film's storytelling without changing the main plot. [[Carolco Pictures]] initially supported the project until 1990, when the filmmakers turned down the contract for not receiving the creative control that they demanded. After the first draft was written between August and November 1991, the filmmakers shifted to [[Hollywood Pictures]] in spring 1992. [[Principal photography]] took place in San Francisco, the novel and the film's main setting, in October 1992 and then in [[China]] in February 1993; filming ended in March 1993.

The film was privately screened in sneak previews in spring 1993 and film festivals in August and September 1993. It premiered in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], and San Francisco on September 8, 1993. With the film's $10.5 million budget, it was moderately successful in the box office, earning $33&amp;nbsp;M in the United States. It received positive critical reaction but also criticism for its negative portrayal of Asian American male characters.&lt;ref name="HarvardCrimson-Soong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate-joyluckclub"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/08/the-joy-luck-club-needs-to-be-forgiven-by-asian-americans.html |title=It’s Time to Forgive The Joy Luck Club |last=Kang |first=Inkoo |publisher=Slate |date=August 17, 2018 |access-date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HyphenMagazine"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hyphenmagazine.com/blog/2014/4/24/20th-anniversary-joy-luck-club |title=On The 20th Anniversary Of 'The Joy Luck Club' |last=Cho |first=Noah |publisher=HyphenMagazine |date=April 24, 2014 |access-date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!--Do not add details that were neither mentioned nor used in the film.--&gt;
{{further information|The Joy Luck Club (novel)#Plot|The Joy Luck Club (novel)#Characters}}
The Joy Luck Club was formed by four women in [[San Francisco]]: Lindo Jong ([[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]]), Ying-Ying St. Clair ([[France Nuyen]]), An-Mei Hsu ([[Lisa Lu]]), and Suyuan Woo ([[Kieu Chinh]]). The members have mainly played [[mahjong]] and told each other's stories over the years. They emigrated from their native country, China, remarried, and gave birth to [[Chinese American|children in America]]. Suyuan's daughter June ([[Ming-Na Wen]]) replaced her when Suyuan died four months before the time the film is set. The mothers have high hopes for their daughters' success, but the daughters struggle through "anxieties, feelings of inadequacy, and failures." Throughout the film, the mothers and daughters bond by learning to understand each other and by overcoming their conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVbRZdvw9ZUC&amp;pg=PA51|title=Multicultural films: a reference guide|pages=50–51|authors=Janice R. Welsch, J. Q. Adams|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film begins with June's prologue tale. In the prologue, a woman (presumably Suyuan) bought a swan in China from a market vendor who was selling it as "a duck that stretched its neck [to become] a goose." She kept it as her pet and brought it to the United States. When the immigration officials took it away from her, she plucked out only a swan feather instead while she struggled to grab the swan away. For a long time, the woman had kept the feather, planning to someday give the feather to her daughter.

Then the film [[film transition|transits]] to June's farewell surprise party in San Francisco for her upcoming reunion with her long-lost twin sisters in China. Among the guests are members of The Joy Luck Club, their daughters, other relatives, and friends. The following characters below narrate their journeys to the audience while they reflect upon their pasts.

===Lindo and Waverly Jong===
In China, four-year-old Lindo (Ying Wu) is arranged, by her mother ([[Xi Meijuan]]) and the matchmaker (Hsu Ying Li), to be married to Mrs Huang's son when she grows up. When Lindo turns fifteen ([[Irene Ng]]), her mother sends her to Mrs Huang, so Lindo marries Huang's son, Tyan Hu (William Gong), a pre-pubescent boy who has no interest in her. During four years of childless and loveless marriage, she is frequently abused by her frustrated mother-in-law, who believes Lindo's childlessness is her own fault. Lindo eavesdrops on the servant girl telling her lover that she is pregnant and he willfully abandons her. Lindo realizes her chance to leave the marriage without dishonouring herself, her family and her in-laws. Later, Lindo purportedly ruins her clothes and then claims that she had a nightmare in which Tyan Hu's ancestors threatened to punish her, Tyan Hu and the matchmaker. Then Lindo claims that the ancestors impregnated the servant girl with Tyan Hu's child and her own marriage to him is considered offensive to them. Mrs Huang does not believe Lindo until Mrs Huang quickly discovers the servant's pregnancy through inspection. Finally, Lindo claims that the matchmaker intentionally and wrongly paired Lindo and Tyan Hu for more money. Furious, Mrs Huang orders the matchmaker out of her family's life, allowing the servant girl to have her marriage. Lindo is able to escape the house and moves to [[Shanghai]].

Years later in America, Lindo has a new husband, a son,&lt;!--only one son is shown in the film; two sons are mentioned in only the novel--&gt; and a daughter named Waverly ([[Tamlyn Tomita]]). Aged between six and nine, Waverly (Mai Vu) has become a [[chess]] champion. Annoyed by Lindo using Waverly to "show off" at the streets, Waverly shouts at her mother and decides to quit chess. When she tries to play it again, Waverly loses one chess round, prompting her to retire from chess. Years later, she has a daughter Shoshana from her Chinese ex-husband&lt;!--do not use the character's name from novel--&gt; and is going to [[Interracial marriage in the United States#Asian and White|marry a Caucasian fiancé]], Rich ([[Christopher Rich (actor)|Christopher Rich]]), much to Lindo's chagrin. In order to make Lindo like Rich, Waverly brings him to a family dinner, but he fails to impress them especially by improperly using chopsticks and insulting Lindo's cooking by marinating the dish with a sauce, humiliating Waverly. While driving home, Waverly lets Rich know how humiliated she and her family are with him, prompting him to properly learn the Chinese table manners. A while later, at the hair salon, Lindo retells her moments with her own mother and declares that she likes Rich very much. She then gives marital blessings to Waverly and Rich, prompting her and Waverly to reconcile with each other. At June's farewell party, Rich almost successfully uses a chopstick (but accidentally drops a piece), impressing Lindo by trying to respect the Chinese table manners.

===Ying-Ying and Lena St. Clair===
In China, Ying-Ying St. Clair was happily married to Lin-Xiao ([[Russell Wong]]) with a baby boy in China until Lin-Xiao abuses her and abandons her for an opera singer. Overwhelmed by her depression, Ying-Ying drowns their baby son in the bathtub as an act of vengeance against her husband, which immediately horrifies and haunts her ever afterwards. Years later, she has emigrated to America and suffers from trauma of her past, worrying her new family, including her daughter Lena ([[Lauren Tom]]).

After Ying-Ying finally resolved her years of trauma, Lena shows Ying-Ying around her new apartment with her husband Harold ([[Michael Paul Chan]]), who is also Lena's boss. Ying-Ying learns that Lena is uncomfortable with her financial arrangements with Harold. They split the costs of their life evenly with a list of things that they share, making their home life contentious. Seeing that Lena is unhappy with her marriage, Ying-Ying reasserts herself by knocking over a table in the bedroom and causing the vase to fall from the table and break. Hearing the sudden noise, Lena goes to her mother and admits her unhappiness. Ying-Ying replies that Lena should leave and not come back until Harold gives her what she wants. At June's farewell party, Lena is shown to have a new vibrant fiancé, who has given Lena what she wants and is accepting of Ying-Ying.

===An-Mei and Rose Hsu===
Nine-year-old An-Mei Hsu ([[Yi Ding (actress)|Yi Ding]]) has been raised with her relatives and grandmother. She is reunited with her long-lost mother ([[Vivian Wu]]), who was disowned by her family for her "[[affair|dalliance]]" with a wealthy middle-aged man Wu-Tsing shortly after her husband's death, and who arrives to see her dying mother ([[Lucille Soong]]). In order to not lose her again, An-Mei moves out with her mother to Wu-Tsing's house against her relatives' wishes for her to remain with them. They claim that in allowing An-Mei live with her and Wu-Tsing, the mother will ruin her future. She finds that Wu-Tsing has another three wives, making An-Mei's mother [[Concubinage|the Fourth Wife]]. Later, she learns that the Second Wife ([[Elizabeth Sung]]) tricked An-Mei's mother into being raped and impregnated by Wu-Tsing. When the relatives did not believe An-Mei's mother and kicked her out, she reluctantly became Wu-Tsing's Fourth Wife as she had nowhere else to turn. After An-Mei's mother gave birth to a boy, the Second Wife took him away from her and claimed him as her own. After An-Mei discovers the past, her mother ultimately commits suicide by eating "[[Tangyuan (food)|sticky rice balls]]" laced with [[opium]], choosing the day of her death carefully to threaten Wu-Tsing with the vengeance of her angry ghost. Afraid of this curse, Wu-Tsing vows to raise An-Mei and her half-brother with great care and promises to honor their mother as an honorable first wife. When Second Wife tries to pay respects to An-Mei's late mother, An-Mei screams at the Second Wife, destroys the Second Wife's faux pearl necklace (the Second Wife initially tried to win An-Mei over with a similar necklace), and loudly yells out "Mama!"

Years later in America, An-Mei's daughter Rose ([[Rosalind Chao]]) has been dating her boyfriend, Ted Jordan ([[Andrew McCarthy]]) since college. Ted is initially attracted to Rose's assertive, forthright nature. When he confronts his aristocratic mother ([[Diane Baker]]) for insulting Rose due to her race, Rose is impressed and agrees to marry him. Over the course of their marriage, however, Rose and Ted become distant from each other, mainly because Rose, desperate to prove herself to Ted's milieu, becomes submissive and demure at the cost of her own identity and interests. They have a daughter, Jennifer, but this does not resolve their marital problems. To make matters worse, Ted cheats on her with another woman and neither are actually happy in their marriage. A while later, An-Mei comes for a visit and relays the story of her own mother's fate to Rose. She encourages Rose to stand up for herself and Jennifer against Ted, or nothing will change. To avoid the same fate, Rose reclaims her strength and stands up to Ted by telling him to leave the house and not take their daughter away from her. This compels Ted to take her seriously and not continue taking her for granted. At June's farewell party, it is revealed the couple reconciled.

===Suyuan and June Woo===
In [[World War II]], when [[Operation Ichi-Go|the Japanese invaded China]], Suyuan Woo escaped the invasion with her twin baby daughters. When Suyuan became ill during her quest for refuge, her cart breaks down, causing the babies to fall. Near death, Suyuan was unable to carry the babies herself and abandoned them along with all of her other possessions, including a photo of herself. Suyuan survived, but was haunted by guilt in the loss of her daughters and never knew what happened to them.

After she remarried in America, Suyuan has high hopes for her new daughter June, but June constantly fails to meet her expectations out of a lack of interest. She performs badly during a piano recital at age nine (Melanie Chang), and when Suyuan pushes her to continue training to be a concert pianist, June refuses, saying that she wishes herself dead like Suyuan's other daughters, an action that offends Suyuan. When June grows into adulthood, at a dinner party a year before Suyuan's passing, Waverly, June's long-time rival whom she is freelancing for, turns down her business ideas, and Suyuan remarks that Waverly and June are not alike, and that ''style'' is something one's born with and cannot be taught implying Waverly has ''style''. June feels humiliated, believing her mother had betrayed her for being a failure in her eyes, and Lindo shows sympathy for June. The following day, June berates Suyuan for her remarks and admits she could never live up to her high expectations. June laments that Suyuan has always been disappointed in June because June dropped out of college, is not married, and has an unsuccessful career. However, Suyuan gives her a [[Chinese jade|jade]] necklace and assures June that she is the one who has the unteachable ''style'' and that while Waverly was the best in competitions, June always had the best heart, which made her mother prouder than she would have been otherwise.

Last [[Easter]] before the farewell party, June received the news from the Club that the long-lost twins were alive. When June could not understand the twins' letter [[Chinese language|written in Chinese]], Lindo purportedly mistranslated the letter to make June believe that the twins knew about Suyuan's death and their long-lost half-sister June. Back to the present, when the farewell party ends, Lindo confesses that she wrote letters to the twins and then signed [[Chinese name|Suyuan's name]]. June begs Lindo to tell them the truth, but Lindo tells her that it is too late because the twin sisters are anticipating their mother, Suyuan, still believing that Suyuan is alive. A short while later, June's father&lt;!--do not add his name from the novel--&gt; ([[Chao-Li Chi]]) retells the war story of Suyuan and her long-lost twin daughters. Then he gives her the swan feather, which came from Suyuan's—the woman's—swan as explained earlier in the prologue, saying that the feather looks worthless but has "good intentions." When she arrives in China to meet her sisters, June tells them the truth about Suyuan and embraces them. In finally accepting her Chinese heritage, June is able to make peace with her deceased mother.

[[Amy Tan]] and [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Academy Award]] winner [[Ronald Bass]] wrote the film adaptation. [[Wayne Wang]], who made prior films about Chinese Americans, such as his first film ''[[Chan Is Missing]]'', was the director.&lt;ref name=nytimespg1/&gt; Wang, Tan, Bass, and [[Patrick Markey]] were the producers.&lt;ref name=amytan93p4/&gt; [[Oliver Stone]] and [[Janet Yang]] were the executive producers.&lt;ref name=dutkapg1/&gt; The production designer was Don Burt.&lt;ref name=amytan93p7/&gt; Maysie Hoy was the film editor.&lt;ref name=amytan93p8/&gt;

When the novel ''[[The Joy Luck Club (novel)|The Joy Luck Club]]'' was released in 1989, Wayne Wang approached Amy Tan, the novel's author, with the idea of adapting the novel that he admired into a film.&lt;ref name=nytimespg1/&gt; Wang and Tan grew concerned about transforming it into a film, and Wang was almost reluctant to make another film about Chinese Americans since ''[[Eat a Bowl of Tea (film)|Eat a Bowl of Tea]]'' because Wang's prior films had not attracted wide audiences.&lt;ref name=nytimespg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=liu95/&gt; There were no known Hollywood movies with an all-Asian cast at the time,&lt;ref name=nytimespg1/&gt; and making a film with Chinese protagonists was risky especially because Asian actors were not well known to American audiences.&lt;ref name=liu95/&gt; Ronald Bass, with whom Wang and Tan teamed up since their meeting at the [[Hotel Bel-Air]] in January 1990, analyzed the novel&lt;ref name=amytan93p2/&gt; and outlined how to bring it to the screen, with "no single lead character."&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt; Because many studios found the novel's "characters and plot [...] too internal and complex" to adapt into a film, Bass added two additional changes without changing the main plot: June Woo's farewell party as the film's timeline setting and the first-person narration in addition to voiceovers to compress the film's storytelling.&lt;ref name=nytimespg1/&gt;

{{quote|1=A lot of executives and producers are afraid of voiceovers because they say it distances the audience from the action. I felt differently. It allowed you into the inner heart of the narrator [and] to understand their feelings in a way you could never do in dialogue.&lt;ref name=nytimespg1/&gt;|2=Ronald Bass}}

Wayne Wang, Amy Tan, and Ronald Bass teamed up with the Ixtlan Corporation, including its staff members, Oliver Stone and Janet Yang, who was the company's vice president and had a profound interest in the project.&lt;ref name=dutkapg1/&gt; Before the project, Stone and Wang disagreed with each other about their own portrayals of Chinese people.&lt;ref name=1993june27/&gt; Wang gave Stone's thriller ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'' a negative review for portraying Chinese characters as "[mobsters], gangsters, and prostitutes." Stone responded by calling Wang's ''[[Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart]]'' "boring" for its lack of action. Stone and Wang reconciled their differences enabling them to work together and finally agreed to produce the film together&lt;ref name=dutkapg1/&gt; along with other producers.

[[Carolco Pictures]] initially agreed to support the project in spring 1990, but the company had fiscal problems, and the filmmakers turned down the contract six months later in fall 1990 due to not receiving the level of creative control that they demanded.&lt;ref name=dutkapg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt; Therefore, Tan, Wang, and Bass outlined the screenplay themselves "in a narrative format" over three days in January 1991.&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt; Tan and Bass completed the first draft between August and November 1991.&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt; When they returned to Ixtlan on March 1992,&lt;ref name=dutkapg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt; [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], chairman of [[The Walt Disney Studios (production company)|Walt Disney Studios]], approved the project as proposed by Stone and Yang, and gave them full creative control.&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimespg2/&gt; In spring 1992, the [[Hollywood Pictures]] agreed to assist production and distribute the film.&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt;&lt;ref name=1993june27/&gt;

Despite that she lacked filmmaking experience, "[Amy] Tan found the process not nearly as bad as she had feared. She was happy that collaborating meant discussions and that they were followed by time to write on her own."&lt;ref name=readersguide86/&gt; Janet Yang said that although several studios were interested, Disney "was the only one to step up to the line". The producers were surprised, but Yang felt in retrospect that ''Joy Luck'' "fits in with Disney's agenda&amp;mdash;taking a chance on low-budget projects not dependent on star power". She described Disney as being "less hands-on than usual" through not being familiar with the subject matter.&lt;ref name=dutkapg1/&gt;

Filming began in [[San Francisco]] in October 1992&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt;&lt;ref name=1993june27/&gt; and then in [[China]] in February 1993.&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt; Amy Tan did not participate in the casting, even though Tan's mother, aunts, and four-year-old niece were extras in the movie, as well as Janet Yang's parents&lt;ref name=amytan93p7/&gt; and Tan herself briefly.&lt;ref name=readersguide86/&gt; The filming was completed in March 1993.&lt;ref name=amytan93p3/&gt; The film's budget totaled to $10.5–10.6 million.&lt;ref name=nytimespg1/&gt;&lt;ref name=liu95/&gt;

Hsu Ying Li (1910–1993), who portrayed the matchmaker in the film, and worked as a culture consultant on set, was killed in a car accident in [[Oakland, California]] on April 28, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=In Memoriam Hsu Ying Li (1910-1993) |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb3489n99m;NAAN=13030&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00146&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=calisphere |first1=Lindy |last1=Li Mark |first2=Peter |last2=Li |first3=Annie D |last3=Li |work=Calisphere |publisher=University of California |accessdate=July 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb3489n99m;NAAN=13030&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00147&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=calisphere |title=A Brief Biography of a Very Full Life |work=Calisphere |publisher=University of California |accessdate=July 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the film is dedicated in her memory in the end credits.

===Audience and critical response===
Reviews of ''The Joy Luck Club'' were generally positive. [[CinemaScore]] reported that audiences gave the film an "A+" grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 19, 2011 |first=Pamela |last=McClintock |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-cinemascore-matters-box-office-225563 |title=Why CinemaScore Matters for Box Office |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=August 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Gene Siskel]], singled out the script and performances, praising the film for presenting images of Asian-Americans outside the narrow range of childhood violinists and spelling bee winners, opining that its main accomplishments were its depiction of how the brutality of the lives of women in China could continue to influence the lives of their American daughters, and its ability to allow audiences to relate to a large group of Chinese-Americans as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=18|first=Gene|last=Siskel|title=The Joy of Watching 'The Joy Luck Club'|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=January 25, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A culture, et cetera: Beyond Stereotypes|first=Gene|last=Siskel|page=A2|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=February 14, 1997}} Record no.

[[Ty Burr]] from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' graded it a C+ and wrote that the film "covers primal issues of abandonment, infanticide, motherly love, and self-respect, pounds you with pathos [and] is extremely faithful to the novel". Burr found the story "exhausting" and preachy, he criticized the "cringingly bald, full of self-help blather" dialogue, and deemed male characters as "perfidies". However, he found the acting "generous [and] intelligent", and picked the segment of Rosalind Chao and Lisa Lu as "the only one that feels genuinely cinematic [yet] too late to save the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|issue=188|last=Burr|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Ty|date=September 17, 1993|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308029,00.html|authorlink=Ty Burr|title=Movie Review: ''The Joy Luck Club'' (1993)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called the film "a superb achievement" and praised the director's "impressive visual skills". However, Denby criticized the film  writing, "[I]ts tone is relentlessly earnest, its meanings limited or wanly inspirational, and my emotions, rather than well[ed] up, remained small." Moreover, he deemed men in the film as "caricatures" and the mothers' attempts to "teach [their daughters] the lesson of self-worth" as inadequate and pretentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=64–65|date=September 20, 1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-CwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=%22joy%20luck%20club%22%20(film%20OR%20movie)&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joy%20luck%20club%22%20(film%20OR%20movie)&amp;f=false|work=[[The New Yorker]]|authorlink=David Denby (film critic)|title=The Good Enough Mother|first=David|last=Denby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Emanuel Levy]] graded the film a B+, calling it an "emotionally heart-rending study of generational gap–but also continuity–between Chinese mothers and their Chinese-American daughters" and a visually well-done propaganda for "cultural diversity". However, he also found it too long with "too many stories and [..] flashbacks" and too mainstream and broad to be an art film, especially when it was screened in "prestigious film festivals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joy Luck Club, The|authorlink=Emanuel Levy|work=Emanuel Levy: Cinema 24/7|first=Emanuel|last=Levy|url=http://www.emanuellevy.com/review/joy-luck-club-the-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Hinrichs from ''[[DVD Talk]]'' rated the film four and a half stars out of five, commenting, "Despite the cultural and gender-specific nature of the story, [..] there are a lot of overriding themes explored here (such as the daughters fearing that they're repeating their moms' mistakes) that have a universal scope and appeal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 21, 2012|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/58305/joy-luck-club-the/|title=''The Joy Luck Club'' (Blu-ray)|first=Matt|last=Hinrichs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard Crimson writer, Allen Soong, reflected that "while the women in this film are fully fleshed-out characters who are a remarkable improvement over the "exotic Oriental" Cassandra from ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'', the male characters are merely additions to the long list of negative images of Asian men in our culture." He added that "the Asian men in ''The Joy Luck Club'', ... are either domineering and misogynist in the worst imaginable way, or they're just clueless and aloof."&lt;ref name="HarvardCrimson-Soong"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1993/10/8/unaccepted-images-pbtbhe-joy-luck-club/ |title=Unaccepted Images |last=Soong |first=Allen |publisher=Harvard Crimson |date=October 8, 1993 |access-date=August 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The soundtrack was released by [[Hollywood Records]] on September 28, 1993. It was composed and produced by [[Rachel Portman]], co-orchestrated by Portman and John Neufeld, conducted by [[J. A. C. Redford]].&lt;ref name=filmtracks/&gt; Chinese instruments were used as well as Western music. ''Filmtracks'' website and Jason Ankeny from ''[[Allmusic]]'' gave the soundtrack four stars out of five.&lt;ref name=filmtracks/&gt;&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; ''Filmtracks'' found the music cues not as "outstanding" as Portman's "other singular achievements in her career" but the website noted that the whole album "never becomes too repetitive to enjoy[,]" even when the music cues lack diversity from each other.&lt;ref name=filmtracks/&gt; The first 14 tracks were composed by Rachel Portman. The 15th and final track, "End Titles", was composed by David Arnold, Marvin Hamlisch, and Rachel Portman.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; The album duration is around 44 minutes.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

==Aftermath and sequel==
At the time the film was released, it was anticipated that Hollywood would begin to develop more films around the Asian experience, but this did not eventually happen. [[Flower Drum Song (film)|''Flower Drum Song'']], released in 1961, was the first film to feature a majority Asian cast telling a contemporary Asian-American story.&lt;ref name=NBC-2018-08-13&gt; {{Cite news |url= https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/six-decades-ago-flower-drum-song-featured-hollywood-s-first-n899576 |title= Six decades ago, 'Flower Drum Song' featured Hollywood's first Asian-American cast |date= 13 August 2018 |author= Melissa Hung |work= NBC News }} &lt;/ref&gt; ''The Joy Luck Club'' (1993) was the second, a third of a century later, and the latest was released a quarter century later in 2018, [[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|''Crazy Rich Asians'']].&lt;ref name=GMA-2018-08-16&gt; {{cite news |url= https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/crazy-rich-asians-joy-luck-club-cast-executive/story?id=57201495 |title= Before 'Crazy Rich Asians,' there was 'The Joy Luck Club': Cast, executive producer on the film, an all-Asian cast, 25 years later |author= Alexa Valiente |work= Good Morning America |publisher= ABC News |date= 16 August 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-2018-08-08&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/movies/crazy-rich-asians-cast.html |title= ‘Crazy Rich Asians’: Why Did It Take So Long to See a Cast Like This? |author= Robert Ito |date= 8 August 2018 |newspaper= New York Times }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, after the success of the film, Disney Studios contacted Amy Tan to discuss making her second novel, ''[[The Kitchen God's Wife]]'', into a film, a spiritual successor/sequel to the first; however, negotiations fell through. In the waning of the glow of Joy Luck Club, further Asian American stories were mostly shot down by studios after the brief rush following the film.&lt;ref name=NYT-2018-09-09&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/movies/joy-luck-club-crazy-rich-asians.html |title= In 1993, ‘Joy Luck Club’ Changed Hollywood. Until It Didn’t. |author= Andrew R. Chow |date= 9 September 2018 |publisher= New York Times }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Ronald Bass]], the producer of the film, revealed that a sequel is in the works, waiting to be picked up by a studio or a network. Both a TV series pilot script and a sequel feature film script has been made. The intention is to reunite the original cast for the sequel, making the film's mothers into grandmothers and daughters into mothers, with Millennial children, in a three-generation story, following the developments of the families since the original film. The setting would be 25-years after the setting of the film.&lt;ref name=WENN-2018-08-24&gt; {{cite news |url= https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/movies/joy-luck-club-sequel-and-tv-series-in-the-works/wcm/db5411ef-7bfc-4de3-8af4-b6edb6915939 |title= 'Joy Luck Club' sequel and TV series in the works |agency= World Entertainment News Network |publisher= Calgary Herald |date= 24 August 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ET-2018-08-23&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.etonline.com/joy-luck-club-producer-reveals-a-sequel-script-has-been-written-25-years-later-exclusive-108476 |title= ‘Joy Luck Club’ Producer Reveals a Sequel Script Has Been Written 25 Years Later (Exclusive) |author= Scott Baumgartner‍ |date= 23 August 2018 |publisher= Entertainment Tonight }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tom De Haven''' (born 1949) is an American [[author]], [[editing|editor]], [[journalist]], and writing teacher. His recurring subjects include literary and [[film noir]], the [[Studio system|Hollywood studio system]] and the American comics industry. De Haven is noted for his comics-themed novels, including the ''Derby Dugan'' trilogy and ''[[It's Superman]]''.

==Life and career==
De Haven was born in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="thunderchild" /&gt; He attended [[Catholic School]], where he was a classmate of fellow author [[George R. R. Martin]], though he notes that they weren't friends, even though Martin was an editor of the school newspaper where he was a [[cartoonist]].&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thethunderchild.com/Interviews/Books/TomDeHaven2.html |title=Tom DeHaven's Biography |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Caroline Miniscule |work= |publisher=ThunderChild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Haven originally wanted to be cartoonist before attending college,&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v4n2/features/de_haven_t_021506/de_haven_t_text.htm |title=An Interview with Tom De Haven |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Michaux Dempster |date=Fall 2005 |work=Vol 4, No. 2 |publisher=Blackbird}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the time he graduated from the university, he realized that he would never be a professional cartoonist, and considers the realization "the First Great Disappointment Of My Life".&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"/&gt; He received a [[Sociology]] degree from [[Rutgers University]] in 1971 and an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from [[Bowling Green State University]] in 1973.

An avid reader of [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s, De Haven considers himself a [[Narrative#Literary theory|narrative writer]], and considers the storytelling style of comics to have been a major influence on his writing since he was a child of almost six or seven.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt;

He began teaching creative writing [[part-time]] at [[Hofstra University]] in 1981, before moving in 1987 to Rutgers to teach [[American Studies]] (including one of the first college courses on American comics) before relocating to Richmond, Virginia to become a [[full-time]] teacher.

De Haven is currently{{When|date=December 2009}} a full professor of Creative Writing at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in the MFA program, and often teaches at least one American Studies course, including "The Graphic Novel",&lt;ref name="Caroline Miniscule"/&gt; De Haven is also the co-creator with author Laura Browder of the [[First Novelist|VCU's First Novelist Award]], honoring the best debut novel published during a calendar year. He is also a licensed private investigator.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He considers himself a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and has been criticized for anti-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] statements he has made over the years.&lt;ref name="thunderchild"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thethunderchild.com/Interviews/Books/TomDeHaven.html |title=The Thunder Child Interview |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Caroline Miniscule |work=interview |publisher=The ThunderChild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author noted in an interview that he agreed with [[Robert Crumb]]'s observation that the Thirties was the pinnacle of American culture. He also notes in the same interview that he finds truth to [[Art Spiegelman]]'s statement "that we are, for whatever reason, most nostalgic for the decade before the one we were born in", as he was born in the Forties.&lt;ref name="thunderchild" /&gt;

As a freelance journalist, he has written [[Literary criticism|criticism]] for publications such as the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. De Haven’s novels include the ''Funny Paper'' trilogy (consisting of ''Funny Papers'' (1985), ''Derby Dugan’s Depression Funnies'' (1996) and ''Dugan Under Ground'' (2001)). The trilogy's [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] stretches from  the beginnings of the newspaper [[comic strip]]s in the 1890s to the 1970s.

The ''New York Times Book Review'' called the ''Derby'' books "a mighty accomplishment: [[John Dos Passos]]’s [[U.S.A. trilogy]] for comic [[geeks]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/07/13/nnp/19817.html |title=Mighty Accomplishment |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author= |year=2001 |work=New York Times Book Review |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Globe]] hails the trilogy as a "wild ride" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclebooks.com/Chronicle/pressroom/0811844358.pdf |title=It's Superman! |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author= |work=Pressroom |publisher=Chronicle Books |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313233804/http://www.chroniclebooks.com/Chronicle/pressroom/0811844358.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, his novel ''It’s Superman'' reinvented the early years of the well-known superhero of the same name amidst the [[Great Depression]]. The author noted his initial apprehension when he was contacted by [[DC Comics]] in 1997 in regards to writing a novel about [[Superman]]: "[S]hould I do a novel with a character that I don’t own? So I had to think about it, but I didn’t think about it very long, really. I just thought...this is too good to let go...they were giving me [[blank cheque|carte blanche]]."&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt; He states that his prior novels about comic strips are what prompted DC to contact him about writing the [[period piece]]. For the novel, he took as his inspiration the early Superman stories of the thirties through the fifties; wherein the hero is not fighting super-villains and Lex Luthor, but clearing slums in the [[New Deal]] era and expose corrupt politicians.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt; De Haven says he was aiming for his hero to develop a social conscience during the Great Depression. He states in the interview that only real departure from the Superman that [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] originally created is that while their original hero lived in Cleveland, De Haven places his hero in the real "[[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]" of New York.&lt;ref name="Michaux Dempster"/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
De Haven's awards include a fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, and he has twice won fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v4n2/features/de_haven_t_021506/de_haven_t.htm |title=Tom De Haven |accessdate=12 November 2008 |author=Michaux Dempster |date=November 2005 |work=Interview |publisher=Blackbird}}&lt;/ref&gt; His novel, ''Depression Funnies'', received an [[American Book Award]] in 1997.

[[File:Barbarossaleuchter.jpg|thumb|[[Barbarossa chandelier]] in the [[Aachen Cathedral]]]]
[[File:Comburg Hartwigleuchter.jpg|thumb|Hartwig's chandelier in [[Comburg]]]]
A '''wheel chandelier''' is a [[lighting]] installment, in the form of a [[chandelier]] hanging from the ceiling in the form of a spoked wheel. The oldest and most important examples derive from the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period.

Wheel chandeliers were made for the practical purpose of lighting the [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches|great]] [[church architecture|churches]] and other public areas, but in religion they also had symbolic significance, depicting the [[Garden of Eden]] or the [[Kingdom of God]]. The wheel, its gates, and its towers, which are usually decorated with [[Prophet#Christianity|Prophet]]s and [[Apostle]]s or inscribed with their names, symbolise the city walls of the [[New Jerusalem]]. The buttresses, towers, and candles number twelve or a multiple of twelve, after the [[numerology]] of the [[Book of Revelation]]. This symbolism is first found on two wheel chandeliers of the [[Hildesheim Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Sedlmayr (Lit.), S. 125-128&lt;/ref&gt; The great wheel chandelier of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulcher]] was an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Gallistl (Lit.), S. 44-45; 76-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanesque wheel chandeliers==
In [[Germany]] there are four great Romanesque wheel chandeliers. The fact that they are made from fire-gilt [[copper]] and not from pure [[gold]] has saved them from being melted down. They were decorated with Prophets and angels in silver and with precious gemstones, but for the most part these have been lost.

*The [[Barbarossa chandelier]] in [[Aachen Cathedral]] is attributted to [[Frederick Barbarossa]] (1122 - 1190).
*[[Hartwig's chandelier]] in [[Comburg]], [[Schwäbisch Hall]], with a 5-metre diameter, from the 12th century (also called ''Himmlische Jerusalem''(Heavenly Jerusalem) &lt;!--[http://www.kirchen.de/drs/wochbild/hallkron.html] --&gt; with saints and soldiers in the towers.
*[[Hezilo chandelier]] in [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] with a 6-metre diameter, a donation of Bishop [[Hezilo of Hildesheim]] (1054–79).
*[[Azelin chandelier]] in [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] with a donation inscription of Bishop [[Thietmar of Hildesheim]] (1038–44).

==Gothic wheel chandeliers==
In the [[Minster Church of St. Alexander (Einbeck)|Minster Church of St. Alexander]] in [[Einbeck]], there is a later gothic wheel chandelier of painted brass with a diameter of c. 3.5 metres. The inscription on its bracket dates it to 1420. It was presumably gifted by Degenhard Ree, a Canon of the collegiate church. The composition ought to go back to a lost moder in Pöhlde Cloister.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Franz Hoffmann|Periodical=Grosse Baudenkmäler|Title=St. Alexandri Einbeck |Edition=2|Issue=318|Publisher=Deutscher Kunstverlag|PublicationPlace=München|Year=1981|Date=  1981|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Gothic example is found in:
*The [[Halberstadt Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Stephan and St. Sixtus]], in bronze, in [[Halberstadt]] (1516)

==Neo-Romanesque wheel chandeliers==
[[File:Altarraum St Elisabeth Bonn.jpg|thumb|Electric wheel chandelier in St. Elisabeth Bonn]]
In some neo-Romanesque churches there are large wheel chandeliers too. Some of these were electric even when they were first installed
Some examples:
*[[St. Godehard's Basilica]] in Hildesheim, gifted in 1864 by [[Marie of Saxe-Altenburg]]
*[[St. Cäcilia (Harsum)|St. Cäcilia]] in [[Harsum]] (c.1886)
*[[Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune]] in [[Strasbourg]] (c.1890)
*[[Bethlehemkirche (Hannover)|Bethlehemkirche]] in [[Hannoverd]] (c.1904)
*[[St. Elisabeth (Bonn)|St. Elisabeth]] in [[Bonn]] under contemporary frescoes in the dome (c. 1910) (electrified from installation)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Kirche | url = http://www.st-elisabeth-bonn.de/kirche.html | publisher = Katholische Pfarrgemeinde St. Elisabeth Bonn | accessdate = 2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary wheel chandeliers==
There are also contemporary wheel chandeliers, which continue this tradition:
*[[Herrenhäuser Church]] in [[Hannover]] (c.1990)
*[[Great St. Martin Church, Cologne|Great St. Martin Church]] in [[Cologne]] (before 1993)
*Church of the [[Lippoldsberg Cloister]] (1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klosterkirche.de/raeume/radleuchter/ Webseite der Klosterkirche]; retrieved, 25 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wagon wheel==
Another type is wagon wheel chandelier. As name suggest it is usually made from old wagon wheels. As opposite to most of the wheel chandeliers, wagon wheel chandeliers were usually created as a cheap way to lighten the common spaces of large houses, businesses and public halls. Most of them were made from wood reinforced with steel.

'''Whittling''' may refer either to the art of [[carving]] shapes out of raw [[wood]] using a [[knife]] or a time-occupying, non-artistic (contrast [[wood carving]] for artistic process) process of repeatedly shaving slivers from a piece of wood.&lt;ref name="HBWilson"&gt;{{cite book | title=Democracy and the Work Place | publisher=Black Rose Books | author=Wilson, Harold B. | year=1996 | isbn=978-0919618220}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="EJTangerman"&gt;{{cite book | title=Whittling and Woodcarving | publisher=Dover | author=Tangerman, E. J. | year=1962  | isbn=978-0486209654}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}&lt;ref name="Pocketknife Art"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Pocketknife Art | author=Hunt, Lester I. | journal=Design For Arts in Education | year=1979 | volume=81 | issue=1 | pages=30–33 | doi=10.1080/07320973.1979.9939989}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

==Background==
Casual whittling is typically performed with a light, small-bladed knife, usually a [[pocket knife]]. [[File:Carvingknives.JPG|thumb|left|Specialized whittling or carving knives]] Specialized whittling knives, with fixed single blades, are preferred for sculpting artistic work. They have thick handles which are easier to grip for long periods and have better leverage, allowing more precise control and pressure.

Occasionally the terms "whittling" and "carving" are used interchangeably, but they are different arts. Carving employs the use of [[chisel]]s, [[Chisel#Gouge|gouge]]s, with or without a [[mallet]], while whittling involves only the use of a knife.&lt;ref name="EJTangerman"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Carving frequently involves powered equipment such as [[lathe]]s.

In industrialized areas of the world, whittling is mainly a hobby and not an occupational activity as it was before powered wood working equipment enabled modern production.

"Splash whittling" is a historical, decorative technique in Norway using an ax to create a [[herringbone pattern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Safety==

It's a good idea to protect your thumb with a leather [[thimble]], and your holding hand with a [[cut-resistant gloves|cut-resistant glove]].

==Wood types==
While any type of wood can be used for whittling, there are woods which are easier to work with and whittle better than others.  Soft woods with a small grain, such as [[basswood]], are easier to whittle and are relatively inexpensive.  Hardwoods are more difficult to whittle.
