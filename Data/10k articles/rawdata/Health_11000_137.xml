'''Proposition 71''' of 2004 (or the '''California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act''') is a law enacted by California voters to support [[stem cell research]] in the state. It was proposed by means of the [[initiative]] process and approved in the [[California state elections, 2004|2004 state elections]] on November 2. The Act amended both the [[Constitution of California]] and  the [[California Health and Safety Code|Health and Safety Code]].

The Act makes conducting [[stem cell]] research a state [[constitutional right]]. It authorizes the sale of general obligation [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to allocate three billion dollars over a period of ten years to stem cell research and research facilities.  Although the funds could be used to finance all kinds of stem cell research, it gives priority to [[human embryonic stem cell]] research.

Proposition 71 created the [[California Institute for Regenerative Medicine]] (CIRM), which is in charge of making "grants and loans for stem cell research, for research facilities, and for other vital research opportunities to realize therapies" as well as establishing "the appropriate regulatory standards of oversight bodies for research and facilities development".&lt;ref&gt;[http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2004/general/propositions/prop71-title.htm Title and Summary by the Attorney General's office of Proposition 71] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522165630/http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2004/general/propositions/prop71-title.htm |date=2013-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act also establishes a governing body called the Independent Citizen’s Oversight Committee (ICOC) to oversee CIRM.

Proposition 71 is unique in at least three ways. Firstly, it uses [[general obligation bond]]s, which are usually used to finance [[brick-and-mortar]] projects such as bridges or hospitals, to fund scientific research. Secondly, by funding scientific research on such a large scale, California is taking on a role that is typically fulfilled by the [[federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]]. Thirdly, Proposition 71 establishes the state constitutional right to conduct stem cell research. The initiative also represents a unique instance where the public directly decided to fund scientific research.

==Provisions==

Proposition 71 states that "This measure shall be known as the California Stem Cell Research
and Cures Act”. That is therefore the official citation. However the measure is also headed as the '''California Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2004/general/propositions/prop71text.pdf Full text of Proposition 71] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522165854/http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2004/general/propositions/prop71text.pdf |date=2013-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is long and complex. It amends the state constitution by adding "Article 35 – Medical Research". This article establishes the CIRM and guarantees a right to conduct stem cell research. Proposition 71 also amends the Health and Safety Code, by introducing a provision in Part 5 of Division 106 called "Chapter 3 – California Stem Cell Research and Cures Bond Act". This chapter, among other provisions, establishes the ICOC.

==Background==

[[Human embryonic stem cell]] research became a public issue in 1998 when two teams of scientists developed "methods for culturing cell lines derived, respectively, from: (1) cells taken from the inner cell mass of early embryos, and (2) the gonadal ridges of aborted fetuses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioethics.gov/reports/stemcell/chapter1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123065710/http://www.bioethics.gov/reports/stemcell/chapter1.html |archivedate=2005-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, this type of research has sparked intense controversy in the [[United States]].

Ever since 1996, Congress has attached to the Health and Human Services appropriations bill (which regulates the funding for the National Institutes of Health) a provision known as the "[[Dickey–Wicker Amendment]]".   This amendment, named after the former representative [[Jay Dickey]], Republican from Arkansas, prohibits the use of federal monies to fund "research that destroys or seriously endangers human embryos, or creates them for research purposes".&lt;ref name="bioethics.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioethics.gov/reports/stemcell/chapter2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228202226/http://www.bioethics.gov/reports/stemcell/chapter2.html |archivedate=2005-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, however, the General Counsel of the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] issued a legal opinion arguing, "that the wording of the law might permit an interpretation under which human embryonic stem cell research could be funded".&lt;ref name="bioethics.gov"/&gt; This interpretation stipulated that the government could fund this research so long as the embryos used had been destroyed by researchers privately paid.  Although the [[Clinton administration]] adopted this interpretation and wrote the corresponding guidelines, it did not have the time to enforce them.  The issue would pass on to the next administration.

On August 9, 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] announced his administration's policy regarding human embryonic stem cell research.  The President opted to fund only research on the existing 60 cell lines.  The small number of cell lines quoted by the President surprised many scientists. Furthermore, they were concerned about the availability and quality of these lines.  Scientists also worried about the impact the president’s policy could have on the American research community.   The United States, they argued, lags behind other countries where governments support stem cell research.   This, in turn, could cause American scientists to [[brain drain|move to these countries]].

Proposition 71 represents a response to the federal policy.  The idea for this proposition came about after the California legislature blocked a billion-dollar measure to fund stem cell research.  [[Robert N. Klein II]], a real-estate developer from Palo Alto, whose son suffers from diabetes and whose mother has Alzheimer's, became the leader of the campaign effort to pass Proposition 71, and spent three million dollars of his own money in the campaign.

==Campaign==

===Proponents===

The Coalition for Stem Cell Research and Cures comprised a broad group of people and organizations that included: 22 Nobel laureates; celebrities such as [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Sharyn Rossi]], [[Monica Siegenthaler]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Saba Motakef]], and [[Michael J. Fox]]; a number of elected officials such as State Treasurer [[Phil Angelides]], and State Controller [[Steve Westly]], and State Senator [[Deborah Ortiz]]; more than fifty patient and disease advocacy groups (e.g., Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Alzheimer's Association California Council, Sickle Cell Disease Foundation of California), medical groups and hospitals (e.g., California Medical Association, Children's Hospital-Los Angeles), groups representing Latinos and African Americans (e.g. National Coalition of Hispanic Organization, California NAACP), women's advocacy groups (e.g., Planned Parenthood, California NOW) and [[faith-based organizations]] (e.g. Catholics for a Free Choice).

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] opposed this initiative, but two key Republican figures endorsed it.  They were [[George P. Shultz]], the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] in the [[Reagan Administration]] and California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].  Although Schwarzenegger did not endorse it until October 18, 2004, his support may have helped to solidify the proposition's lead in the polls.

This campaign raised approximately $25 million.  The contributors included such prominent figures as Bill Gates, who donated $400,000; Pierre M. and Pamela Omidyar, the founders of [[eBay]] who together gave $1 million; Gordon Gund, the owner of the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] basketball team, who contributed $1 million; Herbert M. Sandler, chairman of the board of [[World Savings Bank]], who gave $500,000; [[John Doerr]], a Silicon Valley [[venture capitalist]], who donated $2 million; and William Bowes Jr., a founder of [[Amgen]] (a biotech company), who gave $600,000.

===Opposition===

Those who opposed Proposition 71 included the [[Roman Catholic Church]], Orange County Republicans, and the California Pro-Life Council, an affiliate of the [[National Right to Life Committee]].   Among the politicians in this group were State Senator [[Tom McClintock]] (R-Thousand Oaks) and Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector [[John Moorlach]]. The Hollywood actor [[Mel Gibson]] also joined the efforts to defeat this initiative.  Conservative groups, however, were not the only ones opposing Prop. 71; organizations such as the California Nurses Association (CNA), the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]], the Center for Genetics and Society, Our Bodies Ourselves, among others, were also against the initiative.
	
Two prominent groups campaigning to defeat the initiative were the Pro-Choice Alliance Against Proposition 71 and Doctors, Patients, and Taxpayers for Fiscal Responsibility.  These two groups lacked the wide range of endorsements that the proponents had (however, the Pro-Choice Alliance Against Proposition 71 was endorsed by seven organizations and a number of university professors).  On the Doctors, Patients, and Taxpayers for Fiscal Responsibility website (which no longer exists) there were only fourteen members listed.  Among these members were Dr. Vincent Fortanasce, a physician; Diane Beeson, a medical sociologists; Carol Hogan, a spokesperson for the California Catholic Bishops; and Dr. H Rex Greene, an oncologist and hospital administrator.
	
The four organizations  campaigning against the initiative raised almost $400,000.  The main contributors were the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], which donated $50,000 and Howard Ahmanson Jr., founder and president of Fieldstead &amp; Company, who gave $95,000.

===Analysis===

Initial analysis and discussion of need for analysis was done in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nbt0507-513|pmid=17483831|title=Proposition 71 and CIRM—assessing the return on investment|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=25|issue=5|pages=513|year=2007|last1=Longaker|first1=Michael T|last2=Baker|first2=Laurence C|last3=Greely|first3=Henry T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Ruha Benjamin]] offers the first in-depth analysis of Proposition 71 in [http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=20585 People's Science: Bodies and Rights on the Stem Cell Frontier] (Stanford University Press 2013). Too frequently the debate over stem cell research devolves in to simple judgments—good or bad, life-saving medicine or bioethical nightmare, symbol of human ingenuity or our fall from grace—ignoring the people affected. Benjamin moves the terms of debate to focus on the shifting relationship between science and society, on the people who benefit—or don't—from Proposition 71 and what this says about democratic commitments to an equitable society. Benjamin discusses issues of race, disability, gender, and socio-economic class that serve to define certain groups as more or less deserving in their political aims and biomedical hopes.

&lt;!--FAIR USE of Croninaj.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Croninaj.jpg for rationale--&gt;
'''Archibald Joseph Cronin''' (19 July 1896 – 6 January 1981) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[novelist]] and [[physician]].&lt;ref name=university&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH3031&amp;type=P|title=University of Glasgow :: Story :: Biography of AJ Cronin|website=www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His best-known novel is ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'' (1937), the story of a Scottish doctor in a Welsh [[coal mining|mining]] village, who quickly moves up the career ladder in London. Cronin had observed the venues closely as a medical inspector of mines and later as a doctor in [[Harley Street]]. The book promoted what were then controversial new ideas about medical ethics and helped to inspire the launch of the [[National Health Service]]. Another popular mining novel of Cronin's, set in the [[North East England|North East of England]], is ''[[The Stars Look Down]]''. Both these novels have been adapted as films, as have ''[[Hatter's Castle]]'', ''[[The Keys of the Kingdom]]'' and ''[[The Green Years]]''. Cronin's novel ''Country Doctor'' was adapted as a long-running [[BBC]] radio and TV series ''[[Dr. Finlay's Casebook (TV and radio)|Dr. Finlay's Casebook]]'', revived many years later.

==Early life==
[[File:RosebankCottageCardross.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Rosebank Cottage, Cronin's birthplace]]
Cronin was born in [[Cardross, Argyll|Cardross]], [[Dunbartonshire]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Scotland]], the only child of a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] mother, Jessie Cronin (née Montgomerie), and a [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Catholic]] father, Patrick Cronin. Cronin often wrote of young men from similarly mixed backgrounds. His paternal grandparents had emigrated from [[County Armagh]], Ireland, and become glass and china merchants in [[Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire|Alexandria]]. Owen Cronin, his grandfather, had had his surname changed from Cronague in 1870. His maternal grandfather, Archibald Montgomerie, was a [[hatter]] who owned a shop in [[Dumbarton]]. After their marriage Cronin's parents moved to [[Helensburgh]], where he attended Grant Street School. When he was seven years old, his father, an insurance agent and [[Vendor (supply chain)|commercial traveller]], died from [[tuberculosis]]. He and his mother moved to her parents' home in Dumbarton, and she soon became a public health inspector in [[Glasgow]].

Cronin was not only a precocious student at [[Dumbarton Academy]]&lt;ref name=kirjasto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/ajcronin.htm |title=A. J. Cronin |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000044/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/ajcronin.htm |archivedate=25 April 2011 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; who won many prizes in writing competitions, but also an excellent athlete and [[association football|football]]er. From an early age he was an avid [[golf]]er, and he enjoyed the sport throughout his life. He also loved [[salmon]] [[fishing]].

The family later moved to [[Yorkhill]], [[Glasgow]], where Cronin attended [[St Aloysius' College, Glasgow|St Aloysius' College]]&lt;ref name=kirjasto/&gt; in the [[Garnethill]] area of the city. He played football for the First XI there, an experience he included in one of his last novels, ''[[The Minstrel Boy (novel)|The Minstrel Boy]]''. A family decision that he should study either to join the church or to practise medicine was settled by Cronin himself when he chose "the lesser of two evils".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Haining, Peter (1994) ''On Call with Doctor Finlay''. London: Boxtree Limited. {{ISBN|1852834714}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He won a [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie]] scholarship to study [[medicine]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1914. He was absent in 1916–1917 for naval service. In 1919 he graduated, with highest honours, with the degree of MBChB. Later that year he made a trip to India as ship's surgeon on a liner. Cronin went on to earn additional qualifications, including a Diploma in Public Health (1923) and his [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|MRCP]] (1924). In 1925 he was awarded an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] by the University of Glasgow for his [[dissertation]], entitled "The History of [[Aneurysm]]".

==Medical career==
During the [[First World War]] Cronin served as a [[surgery|surgeon]] [[sub-lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] before graduating from medical school. After the war he trained at various hospitals, including [[Bellahouston]] and [[Lightburn, Glasgow|Lightburn]] Hospitals in Glasgow, and the Rotunda Hospital in [[Dublin]]. He undertook general practice in a small village on the [[Clyde River (Scotland)|Clyde]], [[Garelochhead]], as well as in [[Tredegar]], a [[mining]] town in [[South Wales]]. In 1924 he was appointed Medical Inspector of Mines for Great Britain, and his survey of medical regulations in [[colliery|collieries]], and his reports on the correlation between coal dust inhalation and [[pulmonology|pulmonary disease]], were published over the next few years. Cronin drew on his medical experience and his research on the occupational hazards of the mining industry for his later novels ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', set in Wales, and ''[[The Stars Look Down]]'', set in [[Northumberland]]. He subsequently moved to London, where he practised in Harley Street before opening his own thriving medical practice in [[Notting Hill]]. Cronin was also the medical officer for [[Whiteleys]] at this time and was becoming increasingly interested in [[ophthalmology]].

==Writing career==
In 1930 Cronin was diagnosed with a chronic [[duodenum|duodenal]] [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]] and was told that he must take six months' complete rest in the country on a milk diet. At Dalchenna Farm by [[Loch Fyne]] he was finally able to indulge his lifelong desire to write a novel, having previously "written nothing but prescriptions and scientific papers".&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, A. J. ''[[Adventures in Two Worlds]]''. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1952, pp. 261–2.&lt;/ref&gt; From Dalchenna Farm he travelled to Dumbarton to research the background of his first novel, using the files of Dumbarton Library, which still has the letter from Cronin requesting advice. He composed ''[[Hatter's Castle]]'' in the span of three months, and the manuscript was quickly accepted by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]], the only publishing house to which it had been submitted (it was apparently chosen when his wife randomly stuck a pin into a list of publishers).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This novel, which was an immediate and sensational success, launched Cronin's career as a prolific author, and he never returned to practising medicine.

Many of Cronin's books were bestsellers in their day and have been translated into many languages. Some of his stories draw on his medical career, dramatically mixing realism, romance and social criticism. Cronin's works examine moral conflicts between the individual and society, as his idealistic heroes pursue justice for the common man. One of his early novels, ''[[The Stars Look Down]]'' (1935), chronicles transgressions in a mining community in Northeast England and an ambitious miner's rise to be a [[Member of Parliament]].

A prodigiously fast writer, Cronin liked to average 5,000 words a day, meticulously planning the details of his plots in advance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He was known to be tough in business dealings, although in private life he was a person whose "pawky humour ... peppered his conversations," according to one of his editors, [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Cronin also contributed many stories and essays to various international publications. During the [[Second World War]] he worked for the British [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]], writing articles as well as participating in radio broadcasts to foreign countries.

==Influence of ''The Citadel''==
''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'' (1937), a tale of a mining company doctor's struggle to balance scientific integrity with social obligations, helped to incite the establishment of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the United Kingdom by exposing the inequity and incompetence of medical practice at the time. In the novel Cronin advocated a free public health service in order to defeat the wiles of those doctors who "raised [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]-snatching and the bamboozling of patients to an art form."&lt;ref name = "ReferenceA" /&gt;  Dr Cronin and [[Aneurin Bevan]] had both worked at the [[Tredegar General Hospital|Tredegar Cottage Hospital]] in Wales, which served as one of the bases for the NHS. The author quickly made enemies in the medical profession, and there was a concerted effort by one group of specialists to get ''The Citadel'' banned. Cronin's novel, which was the highest-selling book ever published by Victor Gollancz, informed the public about corruption within the medical system, planting a seed that eventually led to reform. Not only were the author's pioneering ideas instrumental in the creation of the NHS, but the historian [[Raphael Samuel]] asserted in 1995 that the popularity of Cronin's novels played a substantial role in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s landslide victory in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Samuel, R. |title=North and South: A Year in a Mining Village|journal=London Review of Books|volume=17|issue=12 |date=22 June 1995|pages=3–6|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v17/n12/raphael-samuel/north-and-south}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, according to one of Cronin's biographers, Alan Davies, the book's reception was mixed. A few of the more vociferous medical practitioners of the day took exception to one of its many messages: that a few well-heeled doctors in fashionable practices were ripping off their equally well-off patients. Some pointed to the lack of balance between criticism and praise for hard-working doctors. The majority accepted it for what it was, a topical novel. The press attempted to incite passions within the profession in an attempt to sell copy, while [[Victor Gollancz]] followed suit in an attempt to promote the book, all overlooking the fact that it was a work of fiction, not a scientific piece of research, and not autobiographical.

In the United States ''The Citadel'' won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]], Favorite Fiction of 1937, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].&lt;ref name=nyt1938&gt;"Booksellers Give Prize to 'Citadel': Cronin's Work About Doctors Their Favorite–'Mme.

ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll conducted in 1939, ''The Citadel'' was voted the most interesting book readers had ever read.&lt;ref&gt;Gallup Jr., Alec M. (2009). ''The Gallup Poll Cumulative Index: Public Opinion, 1935–1997'', p. 135, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. {{ISBN|0842025871}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Some of Cronin's novels also deal with religion, which he had grown away from during his medical training and career, but which he reacquainted himself with during the 1930s. At medical school, as he recounts in his autobiography, he had become an agnostic: "When I thought of God it was with a superior smile, indicative of biological scorn for such an outworn myth." During his practice in Wales, however, the deep religious faith of the people he worked among made him start to wonder whether "the compass of existence held more than my text-books had revealed, more than I had ever dreamed of. In short I lost my superiority, and this, though I was not then aware of it, is the first step towards finding God."

Cronin also came to feel that "If we consider the physical [[universe]],... we cannot escape the notion of a primary Creator.... Accept [[evolution]] with its [[fossils]] and elementary [[species]], its [[scientific]] [[doctrine]] of [[natural]] causes. And still you are confronted with the same mystery, primary and profound. ''[[Nothing comes from nothing|Ex nihilo nihil]]'', as the Latin tag of our schooldays has it: nothing can come of nothing." This was brought home to him in London, where in his spare time he had organised a working boys' club. One day he invited a distinguished [[zoologist]] to deliver a lecture to the members. The speaker, adopting "a frankly atheistic approach," described the sequence of events leading to the emergence, "though he did not say how," of the [[abiogenesis|first primitive life-form]] from lifeless [[matter]]. When he concluded, there was polite applause. Then, "a mild and very average youngster rose nervously to his feet," and with a slight stammer asked how there came to be anything in the first place. The naïve question took everyone by surprise. The lecturer "looked annoyed, hesitated, slowly turned red. Then, before he could answer, the whole club burst into a howl of laughter. The elaborate structure of logic offered by the test-tube realist had been crumpled by one word of challenge from a simple-minded boy."&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, A. J. ''Adventures in Two Worlds'', Chapter 40 ("Why I Believe in God," in ''The Road to Damascus. Volume IV: Roads to Rome'', edited by John O'Brien. London: Pinnacle Books, 1955, pp. 11–18)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:A. J. Cronin with family 1938.jpg|thumb|350px|Cronin with family in 1938]]
It was at university that Cronin met his future wife, Agnes Mary Gibson (May) (1898–1981), who was also a medical student. She was the daughter of Robert Gibson, a [[master craftsman|master]] [[baker]], and Agnes [[Thomson (surname)|Thomson]] Gibson ([[née]] Gilchrist) of [[Hamilton, Scotland|Hamilton]], Lanarkshire. The couple married on 31 August 1921. As a physician, May worked with her husband briefly in the [[dispensary]] while he was employed by the [[Tredegar Medical Aid Society]]; she also assisted him with his practice in London. When he became an author, she would [[proofread]] his [[manuscript]]s. Their first son, [[Vincent Cronin|Vincent]], was born in Tredegar in 1924. Their second son, [[R. F. Patrick Cronin|Patrick]], was born in [[London]] in 1926. Andrew, their youngest son, was born in London in 1937.

With his stories being adapted to [[Hollywood]] films, Cronin and his family moved to the United States in 1939, living in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel Air]], California; [[Nantucket]], Massachusetts; [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], Connecticut; and [[Blue Hill, Maine|Blue Hill]], Maine. In 1945, the Cronins sailed back to England aboard the [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']], where they stayed briefly in [[Hove]] and then in [[Raheny]], Ireland before returning to the U.S. the following year. They subsequently took up residence at the [[Carlyle Hotel]] in [[New York City]] and then in [[Deerfield, Massachusetts|Deerfield]], Massachusetts before settling in [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], Connecticut in 1947. Ever the nomad, Cronin also frequently travelled to his homes in [[Bermuda]] and [[Cap-d'Ail]], France, where he summered.

==Later years==
Ultimately Cronin returned to Europe, to reside in [[Lucerne]] and [[Montreux]], Switzerland, for the last 25 years of his life. He continued to write into his eighties. He included among his friends [[Laurence Olivier]],  [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]], to whose first son he was [[godparent|godfather]].

Although the latter part of his life was spent entirely abroad, Cronin retained a great affection for the district of his childhood, writing in 1972 to a local teacher: "Although I have travelled the world over I must say in all sincerity that my heart belongs to Dumbarton. ... In my study there is a beautiful 17th century coloured print of the [[Dumbarton Rock|Rock]]... I even follow with great fervour the fortunes of the Dumbarton football team."&lt;ref&gt;Letter quoted in obituary of Cronin in ''Lennox Herald''. There is a photocopy of this obituary (undated) at [http://jane-firthofclyde.blogspot.com/2009/01/cardross-and-j-cronin-part-3.html "Cardross and A. J. Cronin Part 3"]&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of Cronin's lifelong support of [[Dumbarton F.C.]] comes from a framed typewritten letter hanging in the foyer of the club's stadium. In the letter, written in 1972 and addressed to the club's then secretary, Cronin congratulates Dumbarton on their return to the top division after an absence of 50 years and recalls his childhood supporting the Sons (the club's nickname) and on occasion being "lifted over" the turnstiles (a common practice in times past so that children did not have to pay).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigrab.wordpress.com/2007/11/28/a-j-cronin/ A.J. Cronin]. The Ben Lomond Free Press (28 November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronin died on 6 January 1981 in Montreux, and is interred at [[La Tour-de-Peilz]]. Many of Cronin's writings, including published and unpublished literary manuscripts, drafts, letters, school exercise books and essays, [[laboratory]] books and his M.D. thesis, are held at the [[National Library of Scotland]] and at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas]].

'''Adam Monroe''', also known as {{nihongo|'''Takezo Kensei'''|剣聖 武蔵|Kensei Takezō}} in feudal Japan, is a [[fictional character]] portrayed by [[David Anders]] in the [[NBC]] [[science fiction]] [[drama]] ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randazzo |first=Sara |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20144393,00.html |title=David Anders: A chat with Hiro's Hero |publisher=EW.com |date=2007-10-06 |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character first appears in the second-season episode "[[Four Months Later...]]", although the legend of Kensei is referenced several times during the first season. His regenerative ability has halted his aging, making him centuries old in the present of the series. He is the primary [[antagonist]] during the second season.

== Character overview ==

=== Genesis ===

==== Takezo Kensei ====
The name "Kensei" means "master swordsman" and "Takezo" is the birthname of the historical swordmaster [[Miyamoto Musashi]] – Kensei is based upon various legends of Japanese swordsmen, including Musashi.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite web | work=CBR | title = Behind the Eclipse: "Heroes" Week Sixteen" | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=9712 | accessdate = 2007-10-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011010729/http://comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=9712| archivedate= 11 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the legend, Kensei was a Japanese hero, well known for saving Japan from {{nihongo|"White Beard"|白髭|Shirohige}} in the 17th century. However, he proves to be a Briton who came to Japan seeking his fortune.

[[Hiro Nakamura|Hiro]] mentions the legend of Takezo Kensei many times in season one, though little is actually related until he trains in kendo with [[Kaito Nakamura (Heroes)|his father]] in the episode "[[Landslide (Heroes)|Landslide]]". Previously, in "[[Godsend (Heroes)|Godsend]]" and "[[The Fix (Heroes)|The Fix]]", Hiro mentioned that the sword – which he was working to steal from [[Daniel Linderman|Mr. Linderman]] – helped Kensei focus his power. He also said that his father used to tell him stories of Kensei, presumably including the many that Hiro tells Kensei in season two. When training with his father for his part in "saving the world" before the showdown with [[Sylar]] in New York, Hiro relates the story of "Kensei and the Dragon" and realizes that, if he wants to win, he must be strong enough to sacrifice himself.

In the 17th century, [[civil war]] threatened Japan; behind it was the warlord "White Beard." Kensei found a sword frozen in the snow. He was not, however, a good enough fighter to wield it, so he went to see the [[dragon]] of [[Kiso Mountains|Kiso Mountain]], who could teach him the sword's secrets. The dragon agreed to do this in exchange for Kensei's love. Knowing that Japan would fall under the rule of "White Beard" unless he took action, he had to agree to the dragon's demands even though he loved a princess.

After saving Japan in a great battle, the dragon came to Kensei to claim his end of the bargain. The dragon demanded the life of the swordsmith's daughter, the princess Kensei loved. Instead, Kensei cut out his own heart and handed it to the dragon, saying, "My love is in here. Take it," and he died.

According to the [[mockumentary]] "Sword Saint", presented on the official [[Heroes 360]] website, the dragon was touched by how much the warrior was willing to offer for his people and love, and restored Kensei's heart to him. Kensei then ran away with the princess.&lt;ref name="Casting News"&gt;{{cite web | work=Yamagatofellowship.org | title = Takezo Kensei | url = http://yamagatofellowship.org/about/ | accessdate = 2007-09-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070918193222/http://yamagatofellowship.org/about/| archivedate= 18 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Out of Time (Heroes)|Out of Time]]", it is revealed that Hiro Nakamura is the Takezo Kensei portrayed in legends, or rather the source behind the tales, having used his own knowledge of the stories to inspire the real Kensei to create the legends. The real Kensei becomes a villain after Yaeko (the Swordsmith's daughter) falls for Hiro, and after Kensei's defeat she spreads Hiro's tale under Kensei's name.

=== Generations ===

==== Takezo Kensei ====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Takezo Kensei.jpg|thumb|left|David Anders as "Takezo Kensei" {{ifdc|Takezo Kensei.jpg|log=2009 March 3}}]] --&gt;
After Hiro time travels to 1671 in [[Ōtsu, Shiga|Ōtsu]], Japan, a swordsman rides alone against a larger unit of Japanese warriors before a solar eclipse occurs. Hiro stops time, and, believing the man to be Kensei, teleports the lone warrior and himself away. The man is startled, reveals that he's not really Kensei, and runs away. The real Kensei then emerges and confronts Hiro, explaining that he is actually from England. It appears that the real Kensei is far more interested in making money than being a hero to the people. Hiro tells Kensei that he is supposed to save the village of Ōtsu, just as it is made known that Ōtsu is on fire. At this point, a legendary sword smith's daughter from Ōtsu, Yaeko, takes Kensei's sword, which her father had made for him in return for the latter's promise to protect the village. She blames Kensei for betraying her father's trust and allowing the village to be robbed and burnt.

In the episode "[[Lizards (Heroes)|Lizards]]", Hiro, unable to convince Kensei to become a hero on his own, disguises himself as Kensei and creates one of the first stories himself by disarming twelve bandits. In doing so, he enamors Yaeko to Kensei, which in turn convinces Kensei that becoming the legend might be beneficial. When the bandits return for a sneak attack on Kensei, firing several arrows into his chest, it is revealed that Kensei possesses the power of cellular regeneration. Though he seems to die at first, his wounds heal and he revives as Hiro removes the arrows. Kensei is visibly surprised by the turn of events, suggesting that he had been unaware of it prior to his encounter with Hiro.

Initially, Kensei is horrified by the discovery of his ability, believing Hiro to have cursed him. Once Hiro convinces him that it is a natural gift, he is delighted. Since he is functionally immortal, he can take on any challenge without having to worry about dying; in particular, the prospect of wagered duels seems profitable. Still dismayed that Kensei is unwilling to accept his destiny, Hiro forces Kensei to live out another story: retrieving the fire scroll from the 90 angry [[ronin]] (also called the 90 Hungry Ronin in Japanese folklore). All the while, Hiro reassures Yaeko that Kensei will return, which he does, now willing to fulfill his destiny.

The three then set to work on freeing Ōtsu from White Beard, only to find that the conqueror's entire army has settled there. Having gathered a map of the camp, they are able to sneak in and rescue Yaeko's father, only to discover that, during his captivity, he taught them how to forge guns (illegal during this portion of Japan's history, and thus a significant advantage for White Beard) in order to overthrow the Emperor (then [[Emperor Go-Sai]]) and seize power. Hiro realizes that this is the thing he is here to fix, and convinces Kensei to destroy the cache of weapons.

As the three evacuate Yaeko's father, Hiro is forced to teleport himself and Yaeko out of the path of a bullet. This reveals to her that it was Hiro, not Kensei, that saved her life earlier and she kisses him.  Kensei finds them kissing and feels betrayed.  Despite Hiro's insistence that it's a one-time occurrence, Kensei apparently returns to his previous ways and allies himself with White Beard, knocking Hiro out and delivering him to the conqueror in exchange for whatever he wants — he demands half the country and Yaeko as his princess. When Hiro claims that Kensei was supposed to be a hero, Kensei counters by saying that he will be once he conquers Japan, confidently stating that he will "change history."

After Yaeko helps to free Hiro, Kensei anticipates Hiro's first move to destroy White Beard's guns. Takezo confronts Hiro as he is spreading gunpowder over the area and attacks him, despite Hiro's pleas that they should work together. Hiro refuses to use his powers to win the duel, and they have a brief battle, during which Kensei knocks over a lamp and starts a fire. As the fire spreads, Hiro knocks Kensei's sword out of his hands, and offers the defeated Kensei a chance to escape. Kensei, driven mad by Yaeko's love for Hiro, claims that he will destroy everything Hiro holds dear (starting with Yaeko) and so Hiro leaves him to die. He finds Kensei's helmet and mask amidst the debris, and returns to Yaeko. She says that it is really he who is the legendary Takezo Kensei. However, Hiro knows that the legend isn't over yet: he must cut out his heart by leaving Yaeko behind. A tearful Yaeko promises to spread his tale. Hiro then leaves, thinking Kensei is dead and history restored.

==== Adam Monroe ====
Due to his regenerative ability, Kensei not only survives the explosion, but is made immortal by the constant regeneration of his cells. At some point between 1671 and the founding of the Company, Takezo Kensei renames himself Adam Monroe, and becomes a British mercenary during the American Revolutionary War. It was not out of loyalty to the British, but simply to "escape boredom." He appears to think of himself as a [[god]]. At one point, Adam comes across a town in which the British regiment had been single-handedly slaughtered by a man named Evan, according to a survivor. Intrigued, Adam arrived at the scene to confront the man, and killed him.&lt;ref name="Heroes graphic novel 60"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 60: Revolutionary War - Part One. |url=http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/novels/ |accessdate=2007-11-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128022233/http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/novels/ |archivedate=28 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after killing him, an entire army of clones rushes at the regiment and caused them to retreat, leaving Adam behind. He realizes that Evan is a human replicator and pursues him across a number of years, trying to kill the original Evan. Eventually, a number of Evan clones confront and taunt Adam, saying that in numbers there is strength and he is alone and cannot possibly defeat them, and pushes Adam over a cliff into a river. It is at this point, defeated, Adam realized the need for followers.&lt;ref name="Heroes graphic novel 61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 61: Revolutionary War - Part Two. |url=http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/novels/ |accessdate=2007-11-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128022233/http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/novels/ |archivedate=28 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monroe creates the Company about three hundred years after his first encounter with Hiro Nakamura. As shown in "[[Truth &amp; Consequences]]", when the Company began research into the Shanti virus, he attempted to release a highly virulent strain, claiming that something needs to be done about the endless cycle of destruction humanity seems to go through. Adam is locked away by [[Kaito Nakamura (Heroes)|Kaito Nakamura]], never to be released again. Victoria Pratt mentions that in order to know as much as he did, he would have needed the help of some of the other founders; [[Bob Bishop (Heroes)|Robert Bishop]], another founder, mentions that [[Maury Parkman]] and [[Daniel Linderman]] were among those who believed in his theories of their superiority over humanity.

As revealed in "[[Four Months Ago...]]", Adam escapes Company custody with the help of [[Peter Petrelli]], a willing prisoner, by convincing him that the Company has no intention of helping him. Once free, Adam begins assassinating the Company's other founding members, using Maury Parkman as his agent.

In "[[Four Months Later...]]", Kaito Nakamura stays on the rooftop of the Deveaux Building expecting that one of the remaining members of the group of twelve, of which he was a part, will try to kill him. A mysterious hooded figure appears. Kaito appears to recognize the individual as a member of that team, saying "Of all of them, I never expected that it would be you". Just as Ando, whom Kaito had sent to get him a sword, returns, the figure tackles Kaito and pushes him off the building. When Ando looks down, the figure has disappeared.

In "[[The Line (Heroes)|The Line]]", Mohinder observes Adam's name written on a folder Bob was carrying. Later, when Bob says that he has big problems and an individual to worry about who could be a real danger, Mohinder brings up Adam's name. Later, Peter and Caitlin find a note (signed "Adam") in Montreal addressed to Peter, warning him about the Company.

In "[[Out of Time (Heroes)|Out of Time]]", Bob tells Nathan that Adam was the one who suggested the group of twelve come together, and suggested holocausts and plagues to help save the world, claiming that Adam felt he was a god. Nathan notes that Adam's plans sound like Linderman, and Bob tells Nathan that Linderman was his disciple. Later, Peter returns to Montreal and hears a noise. He sends a bolt towards the intruder, but the bolt is blocked by a hand, and it regenerates. Adam walks towards Peter and asks why he fired at him, but Peter tells him he doesn't know who he is. At this, Adam reintroduces himself to Peter.

In "[[Four Months Ago...]]", Adam once again befriends a now amnesic [[Peter Petrelli]], helping him to restore his memory through his absorbed regenerative abilities. After gaining back his memory, Peter tells Adam about the effects of the virus in the future and the two set out to destroy it, though Adam's true intentions remain to be seen.

In "[[Truth &amp; Consequences]]", Adam leads Peter to Victoria Pratt, the creator of the immensely dangerous "Strain 138" that he attempted to release in 1977. Despite her lack of cooperation, Peter's telepathy allows him to retrieve the location of the virus. Adam unties Victoria, but kills her when she aims a shotgun at Peter's head, claiming to have been protecting Peter's life. As Peter walks out of the house, Adam looks at Victoria's lifeless body and says, "If anyone survives... I'll tell them I couldn't have done it without you". He dabs some of the blood from his healed chest wound, puts the Helix symbol on a picture of Victoria's face, and drops it on her corpse. The two then travel to Primatech Paper in Texas, where the virus is kept. Hiro intercepts them, freezing time and intending to kill Adam, but Peter remains unfrozen and refuses to let Hiro harm Adam.

In the final episode of Volume 2, "[[Powerless (Heroes)|Powerless]]", Adam and Peter make it to the vault where the virus is kept. While Adam goes to retrieve the virus, Peter is confronted by Nathan and Matt Parkman, who tell him that Adam is using him. Hiro teleports to the vault and confronts Adam. He claims that he "should have killed him long ago" before teleporting both of them away.  When Ando asks Hiro if he killed Adam, Hiro responds that Adam can never harm anyone again. It is then shown that Adam has been buried alive in a Japanese cemetery near [[Kaito Nakamura (Heroes)|Kaito Nakamura]] screaming for "[[Hiro Nakamura|Carp]]" to let him out.

Series creator Tim Kring gave no indication that Adam could escape from his makeshift prison, saying "the fact that he can live forever makes this the most gruesome of internments."&lt;ref name="TVGuideKring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/heroes-generations-finale/071204-01 |title=Exclusive: Tim Kring Explains Heroes' "Generations" Finale |accessdate=2007-12-04 |publisher=TV Guide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906221929/http://www.tvguide.com/news/heroes-generations-finale/071204-01 |archivedate=2008-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, David Anders suggested that his character would be returning in future episodes.&lt;ref name="BuddyTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/heroes/exclusive-interview-heroes-sta-13999.aspx|title=Exclusive Interview: 'Heroes' Star David Anders|accessdate=2007-12-04|publisher=BuddyTV| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071202064905/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/heroes/exclusive-interview-heroes-sta-13999.aspx| archivedate= 2 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the graphic novel ''The Ten Brides of Takezo Kensei'', Monroe thinks that his new wife will find and rescue him from being buried alive.

=== Villains ===

==== Adam Monroe ====
In the third volume, [[Angela Petrelli]] has a precognitive dream in which Adam Monroe is seen alongside Maury Parkman, Tracy Strauss, Knox, and Sylar killing the Heroes.

In the final moments of "[[I Am Become Death]]", Hiro and Ando dig Adam up in hopes of gaining information on the formula. In [[Angels and Monsters|the following episode]], he is released from his casket prison under the pretense that he will assist Hiro and Ando in retrieving the formula. After arriving at a bar that he claims specializes in hiring superpowered individuals to commit crimes, he goads the bartender into attacking him, and lets Hiro take the blow instead. While Hiro lies unconscious and Ando goes to his aid, he escapes, only to be knocked unconscious himself by Knox in a back alley and taken away in a van on the orders of [[Arthur Petrelli]].

Upon arriving with Knox, Adam discovers that Arthur is still alive, yet paralyzed. Realizing what Arthur wants, a panicked Adam tries to escape but is forced to touch Arthur's hand. Arthur then steals Adam's power of regeneration and heals himself. After having his power drained by Arthur, Adam seems to rapidly age, then crumbles to dust.&lt;!-- if a reliable source confirms that it is rapid aging, please cite that source, otherwise, any claims that it was rapid aging will be presumed to be speculation and reverted --&gt;

===Redemption===

==== Adam Monroe ====
When [[List of characters in Heroes#Arnold|Arnold]], the time traveller seen at the "Sullivan Bros. Carnival" travels back in time on [[List of characters in Heroes#Joseph Sullivan|Joseph]]'s command in the graphic novel "[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 4|Bloodlines, Part 1]]", he comes to ''Coyote Sands''. Seeing it is under construction he realizes he is too early, at which point Adam Monroe, in military attire, knocks him out with shovel. He notes he hasn't seen [[Hiro Nakamura|a time traveler]] in a long while. In "[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 4|Bloodlines, Part 2]]", he seems to have befriended an amnesic Arnold, who goes by the name '''Ernie Crum'''. Adam says goodbye to him before going; it's hinted that Adam was present during the murder of Coyote Sands' posthumans, as Adam shows up to Arnold with a ruined uniform just after the heavy storm (''caused by [[List of characters in Heroes#Alice Shaw|Alice Shaw]]'') in May, 1961 (''[[1961 (Heroes)|1961]]'').

In the episode "[[Pass/Fail]]", as Hiro falls into a coma, he experiences a mental trial in which Adam acts as the prosecutor, accusing him of selfishly altering time. Finally, Hiro battles Adam in a sword-fight for his honor, kills Adam and ends up receiving the healing kiss of [[List of characters in Heroes#Ishi Nakamura|his mother]].

== Powers and abilities ==
Adam Monroe has the power of rapid cellular regeneration, allowing him to heal almost instantly from most injuries. He first displays it in "[[Lizards (Heroes)|Lizards]]", where he is shot by three arrows. After the arrows are removed, his wounds heal and he revives. In "[[Kindred (Heroes)|Kindred]]", he proceeds to repeatedly injure himself just to make sure it wasn't a trick played on him by Hiro. In the episode "[[Out of Time (Heroes)|Out of Time]]", he survives a massive gunpowder explosion. When his blood is injected into others, they are also healed.

In addition to allowing him to heal from any injury, Adam's power has effectively made him immortal.&lt;ref name="TVGuideKring"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work = E!

However, it is also revealed that his power was the only thing keeping him alive; when Arthur Petrelli steals his ability, he crumbles to dust.

In addition to his regeneration ability and the [[immortality]] gained as a result, Adam was quite knowledgeable of and skilled in the use of a sword, and also highly intelligent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2852">{{hatnote|This article is about the Gaulish god. For other uses, see [[Alaunus (disambiguation)]].}}

'''Alaunus''' or '''Alaunius''' was a [[Gallo-Roman religion|Gaulish god]] of healing and prophecy. His name is known from inscriptions found in [[Lurs, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]] in southern [[France]]&lt;ref&gt;Where it appears in Greek in the dative case: {{lang|grc|Αλανειουι}}, ''Alaneioui''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Mannheim]] in western [[Germany]]. In the latter inscription, Alaunus is [[interpretatio graeca|used as an epithet]] of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;''L'Arbre Celtique''. "[http://www.arbre-celtique.com/approfondissements/divinites/inventaire-div/div_liste.php?nomdiv=Alaunus Alaunus]" and "[http://www.arbre-celtique.com/approfondissements/divinites/inventaire-div/div_liste.php?nomdiv=Alaunius Alaunius]".&lt;/ref&gt; The name of this deity is also found as a [[Celtic placenames|placename]] both of [[toponym|sites]] and [[hydronym|rivers]]. Its feminine form '''Alauna''' appears in the Roman-era names of [[Valognes]] in [[Normandy]], [[Alauna Carvetiorum|Maryport]] and [[Alavana|Watercrook]] in [[Cumbria]], [[Alcester]] in [[Warwickshire]], [[Ardoch fort|Ardoch]] in [[Perthshire]], and [[Learchild]] and the [[River Aln]] in [[Northumberland]].

The etymology of the name remains uncertain. Some connect it with the [[Proto-Celtic]] root [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] as {{nowrap|*''alo-''}} ("feed, raise, nurture"), but [[Ranko Matasović|Matasović]] discounts it.&lt;ref&gt;Matasović, Ranko. ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'', {{nowrap|p. 30.}} Kloninklijke Brill (Leiden), 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. F. H. Nicolaisen|Nicolaisen]] connected the various hydronyms to the unrelated [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root reconstructed as *''el-'' or *''ol-'' meaning "to flow or stream".&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaisen, W.F.H.

The concept of '''backward masking''' originated in [[psychoacoustics]], referring to [[temporal masking]] of quiet sounds that occur moments before a louder sound.

In [[cognitive psychology]], it is a technique that involves presenting one visual [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] (a "mask" or "masking stimulus") immediately after another brief (usually 30 ms) "target" visual stimulus resulting in a failure to consciously perceive the first stimulus.&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;Breitmeyer, B.G. and Ogmen, H. (2007) [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Visual_masking ''Visual masking''], Scholarpedia, 2(7):3330.&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely used in [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] studies on [[fear]] and [[phobia]]s that investigate the preattentive nonconscious reactions to fear-relevant stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Öhman, A. (2002). Automaticity and the Amygdala: Nonconscious Responses to Emotional Faces. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 11(2), 62-66&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown how a later stimulus is able to block an earlier one. However, one theory for this phenomenon, known as the ''dual channel interaction'' theory, proposes that a fast signal created by the second stimulus is able to catch up to and overcome a slower signal sent from the first impulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skottun|first=Bernt Christian|author2=Skoyles, John R.|title=Backward Masking as a Test of Magnocellular Sensitivity|journal=Neuro-Ophthalmology|date=1 December 2010|volume=34|issue=5–6|pages=342–346|doi=10.3109/01658107.2010.499582}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar phenomenon can occur when a masking stimulus precedes a target stimulus rather than follows it: this is known as [[forward masking]].&lt;ref name="scholarpedia" /&gt; While not consciously perceived, the masked stimulus can nevertheless still have an effect on [[cognitive]] processes such as [[Context (language use)|context]] interpretation. It has been shown that visually masked stimuli can elicit motor responses in simple reaction-time tasks (e.g. [[Response Priming]]) independent of their conscious visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Vorberg, D., Mattler, U., Heinecke, A., Schmidt, T., &amp; Schwarzbach, J.: ''Different time courses for visual perception and action priming.'' In: ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA'', Nr. 100, 2003, p. 6275-6280.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a widespread belief that masked stimuli can be used for [[psychological manipulation]] (see [[subliminal messages]], [[psychorama]]). However, the empirical evidence for [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal persuasion]] is limited.

The '''Broselow Tape''', also called the '''Broselow pediatric emergency tape''', is a color-coded length-based tape measure that is used throughout the world for pediatric emergencies. The Broselow Tape relates a child’s [[Body weight|height as measured by the tape to his/her weight]] to provide medical instructions including medication [[Dose (biochemistry)|dosages]], the size of the [[Medical equipment|equipment]] that should be used, and the level of shock [[voltage]] when using a [[Defibrillation|defibrillator]]. Particular to children is the need to calculate all these therapies for each child individually. In an emergency the time required to do this detracts from valuable time needed to evaluate, initiate, and monitor patient treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Luten R, Wears RL, Broselow J, Croskerry P, Joseph MM, Frush K |title=Managing the unique size-related issues of pediatric resuscitation: reducing cognitive load with resuscitation aids |journal=Academic Emergency Medicine |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=840–7 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12153892 |doi=10.1197/aemj.9.8.840}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broselow Tape is designed for children up to approximately 12 years of age who have a maximum weight of roughly 36&amp;nbsp;kg (80 pounds). The Broselow Tape is recognized in most medical textbooks and publications as a standard for the emergency treatment of children.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=broselow+tape&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1  Google Book Search for Broselow Tape references]{{MEDRS|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To use the Broselow Tape effectively the child must be lying down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Frush |first=Karen |title=Study Packet for the Correct Use of the Broselow™ Pediatric Emergency Tape |publisher=Duke University Medical Center |url=http://www.ncdhhs.gov/dhsr/EMS/pdf/kids/DEPS_Broselow_Study.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use one hand to hold the red end of the tape so it is even with the child’s head. (Remember: “red to head”). While maintaining one hand on the red portion at the top of the child’s head, use your free hand to run the tape down the length of the child’s body until it is even with his/her heels (not toes). The tape that is level with the child’s heels will provide his/her approximate weight in kilograms and his/her color zone.

As the tape is not completely accurate, care is required with its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=M|last2=Goldstein|first2=LN|last3=Bentley|first3=A|last4=Basnett|first4=S|last5=Monteith|first5=I|title=The accuracy of the Broselow tape as a weight estimation tool and a drug-dosing guide - A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Resuscitation|date=25 September 2017|volume=121|pages=9-33|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.09.026|pmid=28958796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accuracy===
The Broselow Tape is based on the relationship between weight and length across all ages; each color zone estimates the 50th [[percentile]] weight for length, which for practical purposes estimates the [[Body weight#Ideal body weight|ideal body weight (IBW)]] for emergency dosing. Because of the recent [[obesity epidemic]], concerns have been raised as to the accuracy of the tape to determine acceptable weights and subsequently acceptable doses of emergency medications.

The most recent version of the Broselow Tape incorporates updated length/weight zones based on the most current [[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]] data set.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Utilizing this data set to examine Broselow Tape predictions of actual body weight with the revised zones reveals that approximately 65% of the time the patient’s measured length places them in the correct zone for actual weight. Of the remaining 35%, ~20% fall into the heavier Broselow-Luten zone above and 13% fall into the lighter zone below, with &lt; 1% [[outlier]]s falling greater than 1 zone from predicted. If the healthcare provider incorporates a visual estimate of [[Habitus (sociology)#Body habitus|body habitus]] into the prediction, the accuracy of the estimate of actual patient weight is improved as confirmed in multiple studies. Specifically, for drug dosing the patient’s length-based dosing zone can be adjusted up one color zone if the child appears [[overweight]]. Thus incorporating a visual estimate of whether the child is over-weight provides a simple method to predict actual patient weight that appears to be clinically relevant given the rise in [[Obesity in the United States|obesity in the U.S.]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Although some medications are best dosed by actual body weight (e.g., [[Suxamethonium chloride|succinylcholine)]], most [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|resuscitation]] medications are distributed in [[Body composition|lean body mass]] (e.g., [[epinephrine]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], etc.) so that IBW as accurately predicted by length, not the actual body weight, would appear preferable for dosing. For most resuscitation medications, the optimal dose is not known and doses based on IBW or actual weight are likely equally effective.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The PALS guidelines comment on this issue: "There are no data regarding the safety or efficacy of adjusting the doses of resuscitation medications in obese patients. Therefore, regardless of the patient’s habitus, use the actual body weight for calculating initial resuscitationdrug doses or use a body length tape with pre-calculated doses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kleinman ME, Chameides L, Schexnayder SM, etal |title=Part 14: pediatric advanced life support: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care |journal=Circulation |volume=122 |issue=18 Suppl 3 |pages=S876–908 | date=November  2010 |pmid=20956230 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on the accuracy of predicting [[Tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]] sizes consistently demonstrate the superiority of length predictions over other methods. Unlike medication dosing, body habitus therefore does not affect the accuracy of the prediction.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Multiple studies have been conducted regarding the effectiveness of the Broselow Tape. Recently, in 2012, a study with 572 enrolled subjects published that paramedic Broselow measurements correlated well with both scale and ED measurements, underscoring its utility in the prehospital setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyming|first1=Theodore|last2=Bosson|first2=Nichole|last3=Kurobe|first3=Aileen|last4=Kaji|first4=Amy H.|last5=Gausche-Hill|first5=Marianne|title=Accuracy of Paramedic Broselow Tape Use in the Prehospital Setting|journal=Prehospital Emergency Care|date=6 June 2012|volume=16|issue=3|pages=374–380|doi=10.3109/10903127.2012.664247}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In spite of the debates about accuracy in actual weight estimation and its relevance as noted above, the tape still remains the best tool for predicting actual body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meguerdichian MJ, Clapper TC |title=The Broselow tape as an effective medication dosing instrument: a review of the literature |journal=Journal of Pediatric Nursing |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=416–20 | date=August  2012 |pmid=22579781 |doi=10.1016/j.pedn.2012.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The original Broselow tape was divided into 25&amp;nbsp;kg zones for medication doses and eight color zones for equipment selection. Subsequent versions of the tape combined dosing and equipment zones such that the eight color zones contained both dosing and equipment information, thus creating a simple visual system for medication and equipment which is used in most hospitals and ambulances.

==History==
Emergency physicians [[James Broselow]] and Robert Luten struggled with solving these issues related to the emergency treatment of children in the early 1980s. The result was the invention by Dr. Broselow of a home-made prototype version of the tape in 1985.  Dr. Broselow joined with Dr. Luten, an academic physician from the [[University of Florida]] and member of the newly formed [[Pediatric advanced life support|Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS)]] subcommittee, to do the foundational studies upon which the tape was based and to develop and update the tape over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Luten RC, Wears RL, Broselow J, etal |title=Length-based endotracheal tube and emergency equipment in pediatrics |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=900–4 | date=August  1992 |pmid=1497153 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(05)82924-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lubitz DS, Seidel JS, Chameides L, Luten RC, Zaritsky AL, Campbell FW |title=A rapid method for estimating weight and resuscitation drug dosages from length in the pediatric age group |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=576–81 |date=June 1988 |pmid=3377285 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(88)80396-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tape provides pre-calculated medication doses effectively eliminating the potential errors associated with pediatric emergent dosing preparation and administration. This benefit has had major implications in recent years given the prevalence and magnitude of medication errors. [[Medical error]]s are a greater threat to children than adults because their organs are smaller and still developing.  An estimated 35% of pediatric patients&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Jost|last2=Laschat|first2=Michael|last3=Wappler|first3=Frank|date=2016-10-27|title=Medication Errors in Pediatric Emergencies|journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt International|volume=109|issue=38|pages=609–616|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2012.0609|issn=1866-0452|pmc=3471264|pmid=23093991}}&lt;/ref&gt; are incorrectly dosed by EMS providers. Tenfold mathematical errors due to incorrect calculations are a much greater threat to children than adults.  Due to the high level of incorrect calculation errors, alternative [https://www.dosebygrowth.com pediatric emergency tapes] that can be customized have gained popularity. A tenfold adult overdose of a standard adult medication would require multiple [[syringe]]s and tends, therefore, to be obvious to a caregiver, effectively warning of the error.  In contrast, for a small child both a 1x correct dose and a 10x [[Drug overdose|overdose of a drug]] can be administered in the same syringe thus providing no clue as to a potential error. Furthermore, pediatric emergency care is especially prone to error due to the chaotic nature and stress associated with the emergency setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Park |first1=Kyung S. |chapter=Human error |editor1-last=Salvendy |editor1-first=Gavriel |title=Handbook of human factors and ergonomics |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |year=1997 |pages=150–73 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-471-11690-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carroll William Dodge was born in [[Danby, Vermont]]. He started his early education from [[Burr and Burton Academy|Burr and Burton]] Seminaries in [[Manchester, Vermont]]. He went to [[Middlebury College]] at Vermont to study classical language and there he received his [[Artium Baccalaureus]] in 1915 and completed his master's in 1916. During his stay at Middlebury, he came in contact with [[Edward Angus Burt]] (1859-1939) who was another mycologist, today known as an authority of terrestrial fungi, [[Thelephoraceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/libr/finding_guide/burtwb3.asp.html|title=EDWARD ANGUS BURT PAPERS|last=|first=|date=|website=sciweb.nybg.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll was inspired by Angus Burt and his interest grew in biology and followed Burt to Washington University at St. Louis, Missouri as Lachland Fellow. He was so interested in botany that he left Rhodes scholarship to [[Oxford University]], withdrew his nomination and went to [[Washington University]] to complete his doctorate.  He did his PhD in plant physiology and biochemistry under [[Benjamin Minge Duggar|Benjamin M. Duggar]] in 1918.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After his PhD, he served in [[United States Army|US Army]] as a specialist in Office of Nutrition, Camp Pevon, Massachusetts during 1918-1919. After one year of service in the US Army, he worked as an associated chemist in Dairy Division of [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He again joined back to academia in 1919 as an instructor in botany at [[Brown University]] in [[Rhode Island]] and took a class in [[phycology]]. There he became Onley Assistant Professor of Botany and finally he entered [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1921 as an instructor in botany and became assistant professor and Curator of Farlow Library of Herbarium in 1924. He doubled the [[herbarium]] collection during his stay in the library by purchasing adding from his own collection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today, he is considered as one of the important collector of [[lichen]] in Farlow Library of Herbarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://huh.harvard.edu/pages/farlow-herbarium-fh|title=Farlow Herbarium (FH)|last=|first=|date=|website=Hardvard University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his stay in Harvard, from the mid-1920s he started studying [[fungal diseases]] in human and collected a lot of information such that he offered the first course in medical mycology in America.  In 1931, he became professor of botany at Washington University. He finally retired in 1963. During his stay in Washington University at St. Louis he visited Latin American Countries; [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]] and taught several courses in medical [[mycology]] and [[lichenology]] in those countries. His interest in human pathogenic fungi lead to the publication of a very popular book “Medical mycology” in 1935.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another area of Dodge’s study is lichenology. He is regarded as American authority of tropical and Antarctic lichens. He mainly focused in taxonomic and floristics of lichen. He developed the keys for lichen identification. His peak period of lichen study was from 1950 to 1960s. He had traveled extensively to study lichen and produced a lot of papers related to lichens of different locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He has published articles describing the lichens of tropical Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodge|first=Carroll William|date=1953|title=Some Lichens of Tropical Africa|jstor=2394552|journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden|volume=40|issue=4|pages=271–401|doi=10.2307/2394552}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodge|first=Carroll William|date=1956|title=Some Lichens of Tropical Africa.

He studied lichens for several years in [[Antarctica]] and published a book ‘Lichen Flora of the Antarctic Continent and Adjacent Islands in 1973.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dodge also studied about subterranean sporophores. Research articles related to [[Rhizopogonaceae]],&lt;ref&gt;Zeller and Dodge, 1918, ''Rhizopogon'' in North America, Ann. Mo. Bot. Grad. 5: 1-36&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gautieria|Gauiteria]],''&lt;ref&gt;Zeller and Dodge, 1918, ''Gauiteria'' in North America, Ann. Mo. Bot.

==Hobbies and interests==

Besides mycology and biology, Carroll William Dodge was interested in Latin American history and literature. This can be known by his appointment as Harvard University Librarian to purchase literary and historical volumes in many countries he visited. He could read and write in both classical and modern languages. Further, he could give lectures in fluent Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1925, Dodge married Bertha Sanford Weiner, who was a daughter of his Russian Professor at Harvard. His wife was also an author of several books in economic botany, popular science and exploration. They had two daughters Anne Caroline Dodge Hooper and Mary Lavina Dodge Cobb, both of whom were musically talented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1515">'''Colour anomaly''', sometimes referred to as '''partial colour blindness''', is an inherited condition in which people have full [[trichromacy|trichromatic colour vision]], but do not make the same colour matches as the majority of the human population.  It is much more common than [[dichromacy]] or other forms of [[colour blindness]], affecting about 6% of human males in Northern European populations&lt;ref&gt; Deeb, S. S. (2006).  Genetics of variation in human color vision and the retinal cone mosaic.  Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development, 16, 301-307.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Two forms are common, known as protanomaly and deuteranomaly. In order to match a given spectral yellow light, protanomalous observers need more red light in a red/green mixture than the majority of observers, and deuteranomalous observers need more green.  Tritanomaly, affecting mixtures involving blue, is much less common.  Colour anomalies can be measured by an instrument called an [[anomaloscope]], in which coloured lights are mixed in a controlled way; typical demonstration anomaloscopes are set up for measuring the red/green anomalies, but with appropriate choices of colours to mix, tritanomaly can also be measured&lt;ref&gt;Moreland, J. D., &amp; Kerr, J. (1979).  Optimization of a rayleigh-type equation for the detection of tritanomaly.  Vision Research, 19, 1369-1375. doi:10.1016/0042-6989(79)90209-8&lt;/ref&gt;.

The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of [[contraception]], can be assessed two ways.

Condoms are widely recommended for the prevention of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). They have been shown to be effective in reducing infection rates in both men and women. While not perfect, the condom is effective at reducing the transmission of organisms that cause [[AIDS]], [[genital herpes]], [[cervical cancer]], [[genital wart]]s, [[syphilis]], [[chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and other diseases.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood"&gt;{{cite web |title=Condom |publisher=Planned Parenthood | year=2008 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/condom-10187.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods (such as [[IUD]]) in situations where STD protection is also desired.&lt;ref name=DualProtection&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cates, W.|author2=Steiner, M.

According to a 2000 report by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), consistent use of latex condoms reduces the risk of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] transmission by approximately 85% relative to risk when unprotected, putting the seroconversion rate (infection rate) at 0.9 per 100 person-years with condom, down from 6.7 per 100 person-years.&lt;ref name="workshop"&gt;{{cite conference|last=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |authorlink=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |title=Workshop Summary: Scientific Evidence on Condom Effectiveness for Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention |pages=13–15 |date=2001-07-20 |location=Hyatt Dulles Airport, Herndon, Virginia |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/documents/condomreport.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009022150/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/documents/condomreport.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis published in 2007 from the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003255|author1=Cayley, W.E. |author2=Davis-Beaty, K.|year=2007|title=Effectiveness of Condoms in Reducing Heterosexual Transmission of HIV (Review)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. |editor1-last=Weller|editor1-first=Susan C|journal=Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=World Health Organization Department of Reproductive Health and Research (WHO/RHR) &amp; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Communication Programs (CCP), INFO Project|year=2007|title=Family Planning: A Global Handbook for Providers|publisher=INFO Project at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|url=http://www.infoforhealth.org/globalhandbook/index.shtml|page=200|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827081805/http://www.infoforhealth.org/globalhandbook/index.shtml|archivedate=2009-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found similar risk reductions of 80–95%.

Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom. Infectious areas of the genitals, especially when symptoms are present, may not be covered by a condom, and as a result, some diseases like HPV and herpes may be transmitted by direct contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Villhauer |first=Tanya |title=Condoms Preventing HPV? |publisher=University of Iowa Student Health Service/Health Iowa |date=2005-05-20 |url=http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314084306/http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |archivedate=2010-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary effectiveness issue with using condoms to prevent STDs, however, is inconsistent use.&lt;ref name="badnews" /&gt;

Condoms may also be useful in treating potentially [[cervical cancer|precancerous cervical changes]].

Different modes of condom failure result in different levels of semen exposure.

Among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom. The person may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to "take a chance". This type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure (as opposed to method or perfect use failure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Steiner, M |author2=Cates, W |author3=Warner, L |title=The real problem with male condoms is nonuse | journal = Sex Transm Dis | volume = 26 | issue = 8 |pages=459–62 |year=1999 | pmid = 10494937 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-199909000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
[[File:CondomUse2 alternative.jpg|thumb|Illustrations showing how to put on a condom]]
Male condoms are usually packaged inside a foil or plastic wrapper, in a rolled-up form, and are designed to be applied to the tip of the penis and then unrolled over the [[erection|erect]] penis. It is important that some space be left in the tip of the condom so that semen has a place to collect; otherwise it may be forced out of the base of the device. Most condoms have a teat end for this purpose. After use, it is recommended the condom be wrapped in tissue or tied in a knot, then disposed of in a trash receptacle.&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal" /&gt; Condoms are used to reduce the likelihood of pregnancy during intercourse and to reduce the likelihood of contracting sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are also used during fellatio to reduce the likelihood of contracting STIs.

Some couples find that putting on a condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay. Some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation; disadvantages might include a loss of some sexual excitement.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood" /&gt; Advocates of condom use also cite their advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, and having few side effects.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fwhc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Condom |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121011004/http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex education ===
Condoms are often used in [[sex education]] programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) press release supported the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education, saying "''comprehensive sexuality education programs... discuss the appropriate use of condoms''", and "''promote condom use for those who are sexually active''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Based on the research, comprehensive sex education is more effective at stopping the spread of HIV infection, says APA committee |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=February 23, 2005 |url=http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html |accessdate=2006-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811000127/http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html |archivedate=August 11, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infertility treatment {{anchor|Infertility treatment}} ===
&lt;!-- [[Conception device]] links to anchor Infertility treatment --&gt;
Common procedures in [[infertility]] treatment such as [[semen analysis]] and [[Artificial insemination|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) require collection of semen samples. These are most commonly obtained through [[masturbation]], but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special ''collection condom'' to collect semen during sexual intercourse.

Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation,{{cn|date=November 2018}} and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine [[Artificial insemination|insemination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sofikitis NV, Miyagawa I |title=Endocrinological, biophysical, and biochemical parameters of semen collected via masturbation versus sexual intercourse |journal=J.

For fertility treatments, a collection condom may be used to collect semen during [[sexual intercourse]] where the semen is provided by the woman's partner. Private [[sperm donors]] may also use a collection condom to obtain samples through masturbation or by sexual intercourse with a partner and will transfer the ejaculate from the collection condom to a specially designed container. The sperm is transported in such containers, in the case of a donor, to a recipient woman to be used for insemination, and in the case of a woman's partner, to a fertility clinic for processing and use. However, transportation may reduce the fecundity of the sperm. Collection condoms may also be used where semen is produced at a sperm bank or fertility clinic.

''Condom therapy'' is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of [[antisperm antibodies]]. The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued. However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0272.1979.tb02229.x |vauthors=Franken D, Slabber C |title=Experimental findings with spermantibodies: condom therapy (a case report) | journal = Andrologia | volume = 11 | issue = 6 |pages=413–6 |year=1979 | pmid = 532982}}&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;!--

IMPORTANT: When adding a new listing, please include a reliable source that discusses the use. Many condom uses belong to larger categories of use (e.g., smuggling drugs vs. specifically smuggling alcohol; storing water in emergency situations vs. storage in general); consider referring to general use instead of specific use.

--&gt;
Condoms excel as multipurpose containers and barriers because they are waterproof, elastic, durable, and (for military and espionage uses) will not arouse suspicion if found.

Ongoing military utilization began during World War II, and includes covering the muzzles of rifle barrels to prevent fouling,&lt;ref name="dday"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ambrose, Stephen E |title=D-Day, June 6, 1944: the climactic battle of World War II |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-671-71359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the waterproofing of firing assemblies in underwater demolitions,&lt;ref&gt;Couch, D (2001).

Condoms have also been used to [[drug smuggling|smuggle]] [[alcohol]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and other drugs across borders and into prisons by filling the condom with drugs, tying it in a knot and then either swallowing it or inserting it into the [[rectum]]. These methods are very dangerous and potentially lethal; if the condom breaks, the drugs inside become absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause an overdose.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;A 41-year-old man has been remanded in custody after being stopped on Saturday by customs officials at the Norwegian border at Svinesund.

While the advantages of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks.

==== Synthetic ====
The most common non-latex condoms are made from [[polyurethane]]. Condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials, such as [[AT-10 resin]], and most recently [[polyisoprene]].&lt;ref name="isoprenepr"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Lifestyles Condoms Introduces Polyisoprene Non-latex |publisher=HealthNewsDigest.com |date=2008-07-31 |url=http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml |accessdate=2008-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823054656/http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml |archivedate=2008-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms, with most polyurethane condoms between 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Condoms |work=Condom Statistics and Sizes |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://blog.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |accessdate=2012-05-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525205018/http://blog.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |archivedate=2013-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane can be considered better than latex in several ways: it conducts heat better than latex, is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light (and so has less rigid storage requirements and a longer shelf life), can be used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], is less allergenic than latex, and does not have an odor.&lt;ref name="nonlatex"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nonlatex vs Latex Condoms: An Update | journal = The Contraception Report | volume = 14 | issue = 2 |publisher=Contraception Online|date=September 2003|url=http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243|accessdate=2006-08-14 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060926035226/http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243 |archivedate = September 26, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyurethane condoms have gained [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for sale in the United States as an effective method of contraception and HIV prevention, and under laboratory conditions have been shown to be just as effective as latex for these purposes.&lt;ref name="AlicePolyLatex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are polyurethane condoms as effective as latex ones? |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=February 22, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530000038/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |archivedate=May 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyisoprene is a synthetic version of natural rubber latex.

Unlike polyurethane condoms, they cannot be used with an oil-based lubricant.&lt;ref name="PPAA" /&gt;

==== Lambskin ====
Condoms made from [[sheep]] [[intestine]]s, labeled "lambskin", are also available. Although they are generally effective as a contraceptive by blocking sperm, it is presumed that they are likely less effective than latex in preventing the transmission of agents that cause [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], because of pores in the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York, NY |year=2005 |isbn=0-7432-5611-5 |page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the idea that intestines, by their nature, are porous, permeable membranes, and while sperm are too large to pass through the pores, viruses—such as [[HIV]], [[herpes]], and [[genital warts]]—are small enough to pass through.&lt;ref name="PPAA" /&gt; However, there are to date no clinical data confirming or denying this theory. Some believe that lambskin condoms provide a more "natural" sensation, and they lack the allergens that are inherent to latex, but because of their lesser protection against infection, other hypoallergenic materials such as [[polyurethane]] are recommended for latex-allergic users and/or partners. Lambskin condoms are also significantly more expensive than other types and as slaughter by-products they are also not [[vegetarian]].

=== Spermicide ===
Some latex condoms are lubricated at the manufacturer with a small amount of a [[nonoxynol-9]], a [[spermicide|spermicidal chemical]]. According to [[Consumer Reports]], condoms lubricated with spermicide have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy, have a shorter shelf life, and may cause [[urinary tract infection|urinary-tract infections]] in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condoms: Extra protection |work=ConsumerReports.org |date=February 2005 |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2005/02/eng0502tcv.htm?resultPageIndex=1&amp;resultIndex=1&amp;searchTerm=condom |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110317120248/http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2005/02/eng0502tcv.htm?resultPageIndex=1&amp;resultIndex=1&amp;searchTerm=condom |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, application of separately packaged spermicide ''is'' believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms.&lt;ref name="simultaneous" /&gt;

Nonoxynol-9 was once believed to offer additional protection against STDs (including HIV) but recent studies have shown that, with frequent use, nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonoxynol-9 and the Risk of HIV Transmission |work=HIV/AIDS Epi Update |publisher=Health Canada, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control |date=April 2003 |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |accessdate=2006-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929172125/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |archivedate=2009-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted.

=== Ribbed and studded ===
[[File:Kondom - abgerollt - hängend.jpg|thumb|75px|A ribbed condom]]
Textured condoms include studded and ribbed condoms which can provide extra sensations to both partners. The studs or ribs can be located on the inside, outside, or both; alternatively, they are located in specific sections to provide directed stimulation to either the [[g-spot]] or [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]]. Many textured condoms which advertise "mutual pleasure" also are bulb-shaped at the top, to provide extra stimulation to the penis.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=Condom Types: A look at different condom styles|url=http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm|last=Stacey|first=Dawn|accessdate=2008-12-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219035952/http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm|archivedate=2008-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women experience irritation during vaginal intercourse with studded condoms.

=== Other ===
The [[anti-rape condom]] is another variation designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape-aXe: Questions and answers |publisher=Rape-aXe |year=2006 |url=http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |accessdate=2009-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503104839/http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[collection condom]] is used to collect semen for fertility treatments or sperm analysis. These condoms are designed to maximize sperm life.

Some condom-like devices are intended for entertainment only, such as glow-in-the dark condoms. These [[novelties|novelty]] condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and STDs.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood" /&gt;

== Prevalence ==
The prevalence of condom use varies greatly between countries. Most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women, or women in informal unions. Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in that country, condoms account for almost 80% of contraceptive use by married women. On average, in developed countries, condoms are the most popular method of birth control: 28% of married contraceptive users rely on condoms. In the average less-developed country, condoms are less common: only 6–8% of married contraceptive users choose condoms.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Family Planning Worldwide: 2008 Data Sheet |publisher=Population Reference Bureau |year=2008 |url=http://www.prb.org/pdf08/fpds08.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-06-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911033118/http://www.prb.org/pdf08/fpds08.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }} Data from surveys 1997–2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

{{Main|History of condoms}}
[[File:De Morbo Gallico.jpg|thumb|A page from ''De Morbo Gallico'' (On the French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes what is possibly the first use of condoms.]]

=== Before the 19th century ===
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians.&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{cite book | first=Aine | last=Collier | year=2007 |title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | publisher=Prometheus Books | location=Amherst, NY | isbn=978-1-59102-556-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|11}} In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a woman's responsibility, and the only well documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|17,23}} In Asia before the 15th century, some use of [[glans]] condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded. Condoms seem to have been used for contraception, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|60–1}}

In 16th-century Italy, anatomist and physician [[Gabriele Falloppio]] wrote a treatise on [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}} The earliest documented strain of syphilis, first appearing in Europe in a 1490s outbreak, caused severe symptoms and often death within a few months of contracting the disease.&lt;ref name=Scars_of_Venus&gt;{{cite book | author=Oriel, JD |title=The Scars of Venus: A History of Venereology | location=London | publisher= Springer-Verlag | year=1994 |isbn=0-387-19844-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diamond1&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York |publisher=W.W.

The cloths he described were sized to cover the [[Glans penis|glans of the penis]], and were held on with a ribbon.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}}&lt;ref name=pai&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Topic: History of Condom Use |publisher=Population Action International |year=2002 |url=http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714101959/http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |archivedate=14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Falloppio claimed that an experimental trial of the linen sheath demonstrated protection against syphilis.&lt;ref name="youssef"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Youssef |first=H |date=1 April 1993|title=The history of the condom | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 86|pages=226–228 | pmid = 7802734|issue=4|pmc=1293956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, the use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication that these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]], who condemned them as immoral.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|56}} In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of "condons", the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|66–8}} (Other early spellings include "condam" and "quondam", from which the Italian derivation "guantone" has been suggested, from "guanto", "a glove."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=condom |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118222011/http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=condom |archivedate=2017-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Condom 1900.jpg|left|thumb|A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900]]
In addition to linen, condoms during the [[Renaissance]] were made out of intestines and bladder. In the late 16th century, Dutch traders introduced condoms made from "fine leather" to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|61}}

[[File:Condoomgebruik in de 19e eeuw.png|right|thumb|170px|[[Giacomo Casanova]] tests his condom for holes by inflating it]]
[[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] in the 18th century was one of the first reported using "assurance caps" to prevent impregnating his mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer P.

(2000) 'Condoms', BMJ books&lt;/ref&gt;

From at least the 18th century, condom use was opposed in some legal, religious, and medical circles for essentially the same reasons that are given today: condoms reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, which some thought immoral or undesirable for the nation; they do not provide full protection against sexually transmitted infections, while belief in their protective powers was thought to encourage sexual promiscuity; and, they are not used consistently due to inconvenience, expense, or loss of sensation.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|73,86–8,92}}

Despite some opposition, the condom market grew rapidly. In the 18th century, condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or "skin" (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with [[sulfur]] and [[lye]]).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|94–5}} They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|90–2,97,104}} They later spread to America, although in every place there were generally used only by the middle and upper classes, due to both expense and lack of sex education.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|116–21}}

=== 1800 through 1920s ===
[[File:El Paral·lel 1894-1939- exhibit at CCCB in Barcelona (78).JPG|thumb|An old-fashioned condom package]]
The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control to the condom. By the late 19th century many feminists expressed distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|152–3}} Other writers cited both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|88,90,125,129–30}}

Many countries passed laws impeding the manufacture and promotion of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|144,163–4,168–71,193}} In spite of these restrictions, condoms were promoted by traveling lecturers and in newspaper advertisements, using euphemisms in places where such ads were illegal.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|127,130–2,138,146–7}} Instructions on how to make condoms at home were distributed in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|126,136}} Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|173–4}}

[[File:Surgeon Sage Says.jpg|left|thumb|200px|During World War I, the U.S. military was the only one that did not promote condom use. Posters such as these were intended to promote abstinence.]]
Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed. Causes cited by historians include effects of the [[American Civil War]], and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|137–8,159}} To fight the growing epidemic, sex education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time, teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted. They generally taught that abstinence was the only way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|179–80}} Condoms were not promoted for disease prevention because the medical community and moral watchdogs considered STDs to be punishment for sexual misbehavior. The stigma against victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|176}}

[[File:Condom with manual from 1813.jpg|thumb|400px|Condom (and manual) from 1813]]
The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the later 19th century.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|169,181}} Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|180–3}} During [[World War I]], the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|187–90}}

In the decades after World War I, there remained social and legal obstacles to condom use throughout the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|208–10}} Founder of psychoanalysis [[Sigmund Freud]] opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because he thought it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. In 1920 the Church of England's [[Lambeth Conferences#Sixth Conference (1920)|Lambeth Conference]] condemned all "unnatural means of conception avoidance". London's Bishop [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] complained of the huge number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|211–2}}

However, European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|213–4}} Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|197}} Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|204,206,221–2}} Worldwide, condom sales doubled in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|210}}

=== Rubber and manufacturing advances ===
In 1839, [[Charles Goodyear]] discovered a way of processing natural [[rubber]], which is too stiff when cold and too soft when warm, in such a way as to make it elastic.

Besides this type, small rubber condoms covering only the [[glans]] were often used in England and the United States. There was more risk of losing them and if the rubber ring was too tight, it would constrict the penis. This type of condom was the original "capote" (French for condom), perhaps because of its resemblance to a woman's bonnet worn at that time, also called a [[Bonnet (headgear)|capote]].

For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|148}} In 1912, Polish inventor [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.&lt;ref name="billy" /&gt; Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|200}} [[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of [[gasoline]] and [[benzene]] eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|199–200}}

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semi-skilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in the automation of the condom assembly line were made. The first fully automated line was patented in 1930. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|201–3}} The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|220}}

=== 1930 to present ===
In 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] in the U.S. issued a similar statement.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|227}} The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|228–9}} In the 1930s, legal restrictions on condoms began to be relaxed.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|216,226,234}}&lt;ref name="note"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biographical Note |work=The Margaret Sanger Papers |publisher=Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. |year=1995 |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |accessdate=2006-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912180741/http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |archivedate=2006-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But during this period [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] increased restrictions on condoms (limited sales as disease preventatives were still allowed).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|252,254–5}} During the Depression, condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity. Schmid still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture which had two advantages over the latex variety. Firstly, cement-dipped condoms could be safely used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]]. Secondly, while less comfortable, these older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|217–9}} More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] began to regulate the quality of condoms sold in the United States.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|223–5}}

Throughout [[World War II]], condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but also heavily promoted with films, posters, and lectures.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|236–8,259}} European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|252–4,257–8}} In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of [[#Other uses|non-sexual uses]] for the devices, many of which continue to this day. After the war, condom sales continued to grow. From 1955–1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950–1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 début, but condoms remained a strong second. The U.S. [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the "world population crises": by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}}(This number has grown in recent decades: in 2004, the government of India purchased 1.9 billion condoms for distribution at family planning clinics.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=AP |last=Sharma |title=Annual Report of the Tariff Commission |page=9 |publisher=India government |year=2006 |url=http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619062117/http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology and other terms ===
The term ''condom'' first appears in the early 18th century. Its etymology is unknown.
In popular tradition, the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of England's [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], one "Dr. Condom" or "Earl of Condom". There is however no evidence of the existence of such a person, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|54,68}}

Other terms are also commonly used to describe condoms. In North America condoms are also commonly known as ''[[prophylactics]]'', or ''rubbers''.

== Society and culture ==

Some [[moral]] and [[scientific]] criticism of condoms exists despite the many benefits of condoms agreed on by [[scientific consensus]] and sexual health experts.

Condom usage is typically recommended for new couples who have yet to develop full trust in their partner with regard to STDs. Established couples on the other hand have few concerns about STDs, and can use other methods of birth control such as [[birth control pill|the pill]], which does not act as a barrier to intimate sexual contact. Note that the polar debate with regard to condom usage is attenuated by the target group the argument is directed. Notably the age category and stable partner question are factors, as well as the distinction between heterosexual and homosexuals, who have different kinds of sex and have different risk consequences and factors.

Among the prime objections to condom usage is the blocking of erotic sensation, or the intimacy that barrier-free sex provides. As the condom is held tightly to the skin of the penis, it diminishes the delivery of stimulation through rubbing and friction. Condom proponents claim this has the benefit of making sex last longer, by diminishing sensation and delaying male ejaculation. Those who promote condom-free heterosexual sex (slang: "[[Bareback (sex)|bareback]]") claim that the condom puts a prophylactic barrier between partners, diminishing what is normally a highly sensual, intimate, and spiritual connection between partners.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by [[direct and intentional]] acts (for example, [[Human sterilization|surgery to prevent conception]]) or foreign objects (for example, condoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanæ Vitæ |author=[[Pope Paul VI]] |date=1968-07-25 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xI2Wz6n5?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of condoms to prevent [[Sexually Transmitted Infections|STI]] transmission is not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among theologians and high-ranking Catholic authorities. A few, such as Belgian Cardinal [[Godfried Danneels]], believe the Catholic Church should actively support condoms used to prevent disease, especially serious diseases such as [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hooper |first1=John |last2=Osborn |first2=Andrew |title=Cardinal backs use of condoms |work=The Guardian |date=2004-01-13 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/13/religion.catholicism |accessdate=2009-08-26 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827223205/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/13/religion.catholicism |archivedate=2013-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority view—including all statements from the Vatican—is that condom-promotion programs encourage promiscuity, thereby actually increasing STI transmission.&lt;ref name="catholicafrica"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alsan |first=Marcella |title=The Church &amp; AIDS in Africa: Condoms &amp; the Culture of Life |journal=Commonweal: a Review of Religion, Politics, and Culture |volume=133 |issue=8 |date=April 2006 |url=http://www.aids.net.au/us-catholic-20060421.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821143901/http://www.aids.net.au/us-catholic-20060421.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-08-21 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vatican"&gt;{{cite web | last = Trujillo | first = Alfonso Cardinal López | title = Family Values Versus Safe Sex | publisher = Pontifical Council for the Family | date = 2003-12-01 | url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_20031201_family-values-safe-sex-trujillo_en.html#Pregnancy | accessdate = 2009-07-18 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090728003316/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_20031201_family-values-safe-sex-trujillo_en.html#Pregnancy | archivedate = 2009-07-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was most recently reiterated in 2009 by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Condoms 'not the answer to AIDS': Pope | work = World News Australia | publisher = SBS | date = 2009-03-17 | url = http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1012144/Condoms-'not-the-answer-to-AIDS':-Pope | accessdate = 2009-07-26 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130618074844/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1012144/Condoms-%27not-the-answer-to-AIDS%27%3A-Pope | archivedate = 2013-06-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific and environmental ===
More generally, some scientific researchers have expressed objective concern over certain ingredients sometimes added to condoms, notably [[talc]] and [[nitrosamine]]s. Dry dusting powders are applied to latex condoms before packaging to prevent the condom from sticking to itself when rolled up.

In addition, the large-scale use of disposable condoms has resulted in concerns over their environmental impact via [[littering]] and in [[landfills]], where they can eventually wind up in [[wildlife]] environments if not [[incinerated]] or otherwise permanently disposed of first. Polyurethane condoms in particular, given they are a form of [[plastic]], are not [[biodegradable]], and latex condoms take a very long time to break down. Experts, such as [[AVERT]], recommend condoms be disposed of in a garbage receptacle, as flushing them down the toilet (which some people do) may cause plumbing blockages and other problems.&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentally-friendly condom disposal |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=December 20, 2002 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020050953/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |archivedate=October 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |title=Using Condoms, Condom Types &amp; Condom Sizes |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621222629/http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the plastic and foil wrappers condoms are packaged in are also not biodegradable. However, the benefits condoms offer are widely considered to offset their small landfill mass.&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal" /&gt; Frequent condom or wrapper disposal in public areas such as a parks have been seen as a persistent litter problem.&lt;ref name="power"&gt;{{cite web|last=Power |first=Robert |title=The black plastic bag of qualitative research |work=BMJ.com |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48#1918 |accessdate=2007-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030729223328/http://bmj.com/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48 |archivedate=July 29, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While biodegradable,&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal" /&gt; latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly. According to the Ocean Conservancy, condoms, along with [[marine debris|certain other types of trash]], cover the [[coral reef]]s and smother [[sea grass]] and other bottom dwellers. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also has expressed concerns that many animals might mistake the litter for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hightower |first1=Eve |last2=Hall |first2=Phoebe |title=Clean sex, wasteful computers and dangerous mascara&amp;nbsp;– Ask E |journal=[[E–The Environmental Magazine]] |date=March–April 2003 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227050429/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |archivedate=2007-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural barriers to use ===
In much of the [[Western world]], the introduction of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}} In [[Japan]], oral contraceptives were not approved for use until September 1999, and even then access was more restricted than in other industrialized nations.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hayashi, Aiko |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |title=Japanese Women Shun The Pill |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2006-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629074107/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |archivedate=2006-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps because of this restricted access to hormonal contraception, Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in 2008, 80% of contraceptive users relied on condoms.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt;

Cultural attitudes toward [[gender roles]], [[contraception]], and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] vary greatly around the world, and range from extremely conservative to extremely liberal. But in places where condoms are misunderstood, mischaracterised, demonised, or looked upon with overall cultural disapproval, the prevalence of condom use is directly affected. In less-developed countries and among less-educated populations, misperceptions about how disease transmission and conception work negatively affect the use of condoms; additionally, in cultures with more traditional gender roles, women may feel uncomfortable demanding that their partners use condoms.

As an example, [[Latino]] immigrants in the United States often face cultural barriers to condom use. A study on female HIV prevention published in the ''Journal of Sex Health Research'' asserts that Latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender-role norms in the Latino community, and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners. Women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general [[machismo]] subtly encouraged in Latino culture, their male partners would be angry or possibly [[domestic violence|violent]] at the woman's suggestion that they use condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gomez |first=Cynthia A |year=1996 |title=Gender, Culture, and Power: Barriers to HIV-Prevention Strategies for Women |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=355–362 |author2=Marín |doi=10.1080/00224499609551853 |jstor=3813287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low-income [[African-American|American black]] women; the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kalichman |first1=Seth C. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Ernestine A. | last3 = Cherry | first3 = Charsey | last4 = Belcher | first4 = Lisa | last5 = Nachimson | first5 = Dena | title = Sexual coercion, domestic violence, and negotiating condom use among low-income African American women | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–378 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.371 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A telephone survey conducted by [[Rand Corporation]] and [[Oregon State University]], and published in the ''[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]]'' showed that belief in [[AIDS conspiracy theories]] among United States black men is linked to rates of condom use. As conspiracy beliefs about AIDS grow in a given sector of these black men, consistent condom use drops in that same sector. Female use of condoms was not similarly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&amp;id=523594 |title=AIDS Conspiracy Theory Belief Linked to Less Condom Use |last=Dotinga |first=Randy |publisher=SexualHealth.com |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702133205/http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&amp;id=523594 |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the African continent, condom promotion in some areas has been impeded by anti-condom campaigns by some Muslim&lt;ref name="northeast kenya" /&gt; and Catholic clerics.&lt;ref name="catholicafrica" /&gt; Among the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in [[Tanzania]], condom use is hampered by an aversion to "wasting" sperm, which is given sociocultural importance beyond reproduction. Sperm is believed to be an "elixir" to women and to have beneficial health effects. Maasai women believe that, after conceiving a child, they must have sexual intercourse repeatedly so that the additional sperm aids the child's development. Frequent condom use is also considered by some Maasai to cause impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coast |first=Ernestina |year=2007 |title=Wasting semen: context and condom use among the Maasai |journal=Culture, Health, and Sexuality |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai(LSERO).pdf |accessdate=2009-07-26 |doi=10.1080/13691050701208474 |pmid=17612958 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=387–401 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524091500/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai(LSERO).pdf |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women in Africa believe that condoms are "for prostitutes" and that respectable women should not use them.&lt;ref name="northeast kenya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336 |title=Muslim opposition to condoms limits distribution |date=Sep 17, 2007 |publisher=PlusNews |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003165407/http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336 |archivedate=2007-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few clerics even promote the idea that condoms are deliberately laced with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |title=Islam, Condoms and AIDS |last=Kamau |first=Pius |date=August 24, 2008 |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115211414/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |archivedate=November 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, possession of many condoms has been used by police to accuse women of engaging in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guza |first1=Megan |title=Condoms criminalized in Allegheny County prostitution cases |url=http://triblive.com/local/allegheny/13690556-74/condoms-criminalized-in-allegheny-county-prostitution-cases |accessdate=6 June 2018 |publisher=Trib Live |date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Big2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-bill-would-bar-condoms-proof-prostitution |title=NY bill would bar condoms as proof of prostitution |last1=KLEPPER |first1=DAVID |date=27 April 2014 |work=Associated Press |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427210304/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-bill-would-bar-condoms-proof-prostitution |archivedate=27 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]] has condemned this practice and there are efforts to end it.&lt;ref name=Big2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wurth|first=MH|author2=Schleifer, R |author3=McLemore, M |author4=Todrys, KW |author5= Amon, JJ |title=Condoms as evidence of prostitution in the United States and the criminalization of sex work.|journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society|date=May 24, 2013|volume=16|page=18626|pmid=23706178 |pmc=3664300 |doi=10.7448/ias.16.1.18626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/10/07/city-cease-using-condoms-evidence-prostitution-cases |title=City to cease using condoms as evidence in prostitution cases |last1=Chanoff |first1=Yael |date=7 October 2014 |website=www.sfbg.com |publisher=San Francisco Bay Guardian |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428022226/http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/10/07/city-cease-using-condoms-evidence-prostitution-cases |archivedate=28 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, technology mogul [[Bill Gates]] offered a US$100,000 grant through his foundation for a condom design that "significantly preserves or enhances pleasure" to encourage more males to adopt the use of condoms for safer sex. The grant information states: "The primary drawback from the male perspective is that condoms decrease pleasure as compared to no condom, creating a trade-off that many men find unacceptable, particularly given that the decisions about use must be made just prior to intercourse. Is it possible to develop a product without this stigma, or better, one that is felt to enhance pleasure?". The project has been named the "Next Generation Condom" and anyone who can provide a "testable hypothesis" is eligible to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Gates offers $100,000 grant for improved condoms|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=24 March 2013|author=Jessica Chasmar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504144403/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/|archivedate=4 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle-Eastern couples who have not had children, because of the strong desire and social pressure to establish fertility as soon as possible within marriage, rarely use condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 3649633|title= The Sociocultural Context of Condom Use Within Marriage in Rural Lebanon|last1= Kulczycki|first1= Andrzej|date= 4 December 2004 |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=246–260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, India restricted TV advertisements for condoms to between the hours of 10PM to 6AM. Family planning advocates were against this, saying it was liable to "undo decades of progress on sexual and reproductive health".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/india-bans-condom-adverts-during-primetime-tv India bans condom adverts during primetime TV ] The Guardian, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that "boggles the mind". Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|322,328}} Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations. Most large manufacturers have ties to the business that reach back to the end of the 19th century.

The Invisible Condom, developed at [[Université Laval]] in Quebec, Canada, is a gel that hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum. In the lab, it has been shown to effectively block HIV and herpes simplex virus. The barrier breaks down and liquefies after several hours. {{as of|2005}}, the invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase, and has not yet been approved for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safety, Tolerance and Acceptability Trial of the Invisible Condom in Healthy Women |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |accessdate=2006-08-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829080802/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15728">'''Economic epidemiology''' is a field at the intersection of [[epidemiology]] and [[economics]]. Its premise is to incorporate incentives for healthy behavior and their attendant behavioral responses into an epidemiological context to better understand how diseases are transmitted. This framework should help improve policy responses to [[epidemic]] diseases by giving policymakers and health-care providers clear tools for thinking about how certain actions can influence the spread of [[Transmission (medicine)|disease transmission]].

The main context through which this field emerged was the idea of prevalence-dependence, or [[disinhibition]], which suggests that individuals change their behavior as the prevalence of a disease changes. However, economic epidemiology also encompasses other ideas, including the role of externalities, global disease commons and how individuals’ incentives can influence the outcome and cost of health interventions.

'''Strategic epidemiology''' is a branch of economic epidemiology that adopts an explicitly [[Game theory|game theoretic]] approach to analyzing the interplay between individual behavior and population wide disease dynamics.

==Prevalence-dependence ==
The spread of an [[infectious disease]] is a population-level phenomenon, but decisions to prevent or treat a disease are typically made by individuals who may change their behavior over the course of an epidemic, especially if their [[Risk perception|perception of risk]] changes depending on the available information on the epidemics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=d'Onofrio A, Manfredi P | title=Information-related changes in contact patterns may trigger oscillations in the endemic prevalence of infectious diseases | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=2010 | volume=256 | pages=473–478 | pmid=18992258 | issue=3 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.10.005| arxiv=1309.3327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  – their decisions will then have population-level consequences. For example, an individual may choose to have [[Safe sex|unsafe sex]] or a doctor may prescribe antibiotics to someone without a confirmed [[Infection|bacterial infection]]. In both cases, the choice may be rational from the individual’s point of view but undesirable from a societal perspective.

Limiting the spread of a disease at the population level requires changing individual behavior, which in turn depends on what information individuals have about the level of risk. When risk is low, people will tend to ignore it. However, if the risk of infection is higher, individuals are more likely to take preventive action. Moreover, the more transmissible the [[pathogen]], the greater the incentive is to make personal investments for control.&lt;ref name="Peltzman S 1975 677–726"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/260352 |author=Peltzman S |title=The effects of automobile safety regulation |journal=Political Economy |volume=83 |pages=677–726 |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The converse is also true: if there is a lowered risk of disease, either through vaccination or because of lowered prevalence, individuals may increase their risk-taking behavior. This effect is analogous to the introduction of safety regulations, such as seatbelts in cars, which because they reduce the cost of an accident in terms of expected injury and death, could lead people to drive with less caution and the resulting injuries to nonoccupants and increased nonfatal crashes may offset some of the gains from the use of seatbelts.&lt;ref name="Peltzman S 1975 677–726"/&gt;

Prevalence-dependent behavior introduces a crucial difference with respect to the way individuals respond when the prevalence of a disease increases. If behavior is exogenous or if behavioral responses are assumed to be inelastic with respect to [[Prevalence|disease prevalence]], the per capita risk of infection in the susceptible population increases as prevalence increases. In contrast, when behavior is endogenous and elastic, hosts can act to reduce their risks. If their responses are strong enough, they can reduce the average per capita risk and offset the increases in the risk of transmission associated with higher prevalence.&lt;ref name="BM1994"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.8073289 |vauthors=Blower SM, McLean AR | title=Prophylactic vaccines, risk behavior change, and the probability of eradicating HIV in San Francisco | journal=Science | year=1994 | volume=265 | pages=1451–1454 | pmid=8073289 | issue=5177| bibcode=1994Sci...265.1451B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blythe SP, Cooke KL, Castillo-Chavez C | title=Autonomous risk-behavior change, and non-linear incidence rate, in models of sexually transmitted diseases | journal=Biometrics Unit Technical Report B-1048-M | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PP1993"&gt;{{cite book | last = Philipson | first = TJ  |author2=Posner, RA  | year = 1993 | title = Private Choices and Public Health: The AIDS Epidemic in an Economic Perspective | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="klein2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klein E, Laxminarayan R, Smith DL, Gilligan CA | title=Economic incentives and mathematical models of disease | journal=Environment and Development Economics | year=2007 | volume=12 | pages=707–732 | doi=10.1017/s1355770x0700383x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the waning of perceived risk, either through the diminution of prevalence or the introduction of a vaccine, may lead to increases in risky behavior. For example, models suggested that the introduction of [[Antiretroviral drug|highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)]], which significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with [[HIV]]/AIDS, may lead to increases in the incidence of HIV as the perceived risk of HIV/AIDS decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.650 |vauthors=Blower SM, Gershengorn HB, Grant RM | title=A tale of two futures: HIV and antiretroviral therapy in San Francisco | journal=Science | year=2000 | volume=287 | pages=650–654 | pmid=10649998 | issue=5453| bibcode=2000Sci...287..650B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent analysis suggests that an individual’s likelihood of engaging in [[unprotected sex]] is related to their personal analysis of risk, with those who believed that receiving HAART or having an undetectable [[viral load]] protects against transmitting HIV or who had reduced concerns about engaging in unsafe sex given the availability of HAART were more likely to engage in unprotected sex regardless of HIV status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Crepaz N |author2=Hart T |author3=Marks, G | title=Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy and Sexual Risk Behavior: A Meta-analytic Review | journal=JAMA | year=2004 | volume=292 | issue=2 | pages=224–236 | pmid= 15249572 | doi= 10.1001/jama.292.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This behavioral response can have important implications for the timing of public interventions, because prevalence and public subsidies may compete to induce protective behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2527443 |vauthors=Geoffard PY, Philipson T | title=Rational epidemics and their public control | journal=International Economic Review | year=1996 | volume=37 | issue=3 | pages=603–624 | jstor=2527443}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if prevalence induces the same sort of protective behavior as public subsidies, the subsidies become irrelevant because people will choose to protect themselves when prevalence is high, regardless of the subsidy, and subsidies may not be helpful at the times when they are typically applied.

Although [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]] are logical targets for examining the role of [[human behavior]] in a modeling framework, personal actions are important for other infectious diseases as well. The rapidity with which individuals reduce their contact rate with others during an outbreak of a highly transmissible disease can significantly affect the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Del Valle S, Hethcote H, Hyman JM, Castillo-Chavez C | title=Effects of behavioral changes in a smallpox attack model | journal=Mathematical Biosciences | year=2005 | volume=195 | pages=228–251 | pmid=15913667 | issue=2 | doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2005.03.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small reductions in the contact rate can be important, especially for diseases like [[influenza]] or [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome| severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)]]. However, this may also affect policy planning for a biological attack with a disease such as [[smallpox]].

Individual behavioral responses to interventions for non-sexually transmitted diseases are also important. For example, mass spraying to reduce [[malaria]] transmission can reduce the irritating effects of biting by nuisance mosquitoes and so lead to reduced personal use of bednets.&lt;ref name="klein2007" /&gt; Economic epidemiology strives to incorporate these types of behavior responses into epidemiological models to enhance a model’s utility in evaluating control measures.

==Vaccination==
Immunization represents a classic case of a social dilemma: a [[conflict of interest]] between the private gains of individuals and the collective gains of a society, and prevalence-dependent behavior may have significant effects on [[vaccine]] policy formation. For instance, it was found in an analysis of the hypothetical introduction of a vaccine that would reduce (though not eliminate) the risk of contracting HIV, that individual levels of risk behavior were a significant barrier to eliminating HIV, as small changes in behavior could actually increase the incidence/prevalence of HIV, even if the vaccine were highly efficacious.&lt;ref name="BM1994" /&gt; These results, as well as others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson R, Hanson M | title=Potential public health impact of imperfect HIV type 1 vaccines | journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases | year=2005 | volume=191 | pages=S85–S96 | pmid=15627235 | doi=10.1086/425267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2174/1568005033480999 |vauthors=Blower SM, Ma L, Farmer P, Koenig S | title=Predicting the impact of antiretrovirals in resource-poor settings: preventing HIV infections whilst controlling drug resistance | journal=Current Drug Targets.

An individual's self-interest and choice often leads to a vaccination uptake rate less than the social optimum as individuals do not take into account the benefit to others. In addition, prevalence dependent behavior suggests how the introduction of a vaccine may affect the spread of a disease. As the prevalence of a disease increases, people will demand to be vaccinated. As prevalence decreases, however, the incentive, and thus demand, will slacken and allow the susceptible population to increase until the disease can reinvade. As long as a vaccine is not free, either monetarily or through true or even perceived [[side effect]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bauch CT, Earn DJ | title=Vaccination and the theory of games | journal=PNAS | year=2004 | volume=101 | pages=13391–13394 | pmid=15329411 | issue=36 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0403823101 | pmc=516577| bibcode=2004PNAS..10113391B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=d'Onofrio A, Manfredi P | title=Vaccine demand driven by vaccine side effects: Dynamic implications for SIR diseases | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | year=2010 | volume=264 | pages=237–252 | pmid=20149801 | issue=2 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; demand will be insufficient to pay for the vaccine at some point, leaving some people unvaccinated. If the disease is contagious, it could then begin spreading again among non-vaccinated individuals. Thus, it is impossible to eradicate a vaccine-preventable disease through voluntary vaccination if people act in their own self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Geoffard PY, Philipson T | title=Disease eradication: private versus public vaccination | journal=American Economic Review | year= 1997| volume=87 | issue= | pages=222–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.601 | author=May SR | title=Simple rules with complex dynamics’ | journal=Science | year=2000 | volume=287 | issue= 5453| pages=601–602 | pmid=10691541}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bauch CT, Galvani AP, Earn DJ | title=Group interest versus self-interest in smallpox vaccination policy | journal=PNAS | year=2004 | volume=100 | pages=10564–10567 | pmid=12920181 | issue=18 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1731324100 | pmc=193525| bibcode=2003PNAS..10010564B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foundation for Active Rahabilitation''' ({{lang-pl|Fundacja Aktywnej Rehabilitacji}}) (FAR) is a [[non-profit]] [[Poland|Polish]] organization of social and professional rehabilitation of disabled people after [[spinal cord]] injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uczą dzieci samodzielności |url=http://szukaj.wyborcza.pl/archiwum/1,0,4881765.html |work=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=2009-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In existence since 1988, the Foundation organizes the biggest Polish sporting event for disabled athletes, called Active Rehabilitation Games. The event is fashioned after similar games in Great Britain called Stocke Mandeville Word Wheelchair Games. The first event was held a decade ago in 1998 and was attended by 300 athletes from Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Sweden. The Games were held for the eight times in 2008. 

Active rehabilitation program offered by the Foundation is a Swedish concept from the late 1970s. It was introduced in Poland by Polish-Swedish [[diaspora]] with the help from Swedish instructors who attended the first rehabilitation camp in Poland. The unique aspect of the program is that both, the sporting coaches and the caretakers are also disabled.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{pl icon}} Anna Ćwiek, [http://wiadomosci.ngo.pl/wiadomosci/411909.html  Fundacja Aktywnej Rehabilitacji ma 20 lat!] Source: www.niepelnosprawni.pl &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydroxycut''' is a brand of [[dietary supplement]]s that is marketed as a [[weight loss]] aid. Hydroxycut was originally developed and manufactured by [[MuscleTech]] Research and Development; MuscleTech was sold to Iovate Health Sciences in 2003–2004 and declared bankruptcy in 2005; Iovate continues to use MuscleTech as a brand to market Hydroxycut.

Since 2013, the primary ingredients in the product line include [[caffeine]], lady's mantle extract (''[[Alchemilla vulgaris]]''), wild olive extract (''[[Olea europaea]]''), cumin extract (''[[Cuminum cyminum]]''), wild mint extract (''[[Mentha longifolia]]''), and, in some products, green coffee bean extract (''[[Coffea canephora]]'').

Before the 2004 reformulation, formulations contained [[ephedra]], a supplement banned by the FDA in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Issues Regulation Prohibiting Sale of Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2004/ucm108242.htm|publisher=FDA|date=6 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 2009 reformulation, formulations contained several substances with potential to harm the liver. After a series of reports in the medical literature of serious liver problems, including one death, the FDA warned consumers to stop using Hydroxycut, and Iovate agreed to voluntarily recall the products.&lt;ref name='FDA warning' /&gt;

The harm caused by Hydroxycut products has led to calls for stricter regulation of the dietary supplement industry and to calls within the industry for more rigorous safety testing.&lt;ref name='Lobb2' /&gt;&lt;ref name=NBJ /&gt;

== Marketing and sales ==
Hydroxycut is sold at conventional retailers, [[online retailers]], and through direct television marketing. Like many [[dietary supplements]], published studies demonstrating scientific evidence of its effectiveness and safety is lacking.&lt;ref name=NYT_2003 /&gt;

In March 2013, [[The Bachelor (season 17)#Sean Lowe|Sean Lowe]] became the brand ambassador for Hydroxycut Hardcore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank|first=Hoffman|title=Sean Lowe is Hydroxycut Hardcore’s New Dancing Star|url=http://www.musclemag.com/blog/sean-lowe-is-hydroxycut-hardcores-new-dancing-star/|publisher=Muscle Maf|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, [[IndyCar]] racer [[Tony Kanaan]] announced he will pilot the No. 11 Hydroxycut IndyCar at the [[Indianapolis 500]] along with 8 other events at the [[2013 IndyCar Series season|2013 IndyCar Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroxycut supports Tony Kanaan|url=http://www.nationalspeedsportnews.com/indy/izod-indycar/hydroxycut-supports-tony-kanaan/|publisher=Nationalspeed Sports News|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KV Racing signs sponsor in time for season opener |url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2013-03-21/kv-racing-signs-sponsor-in-time-for-season-opener |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630085328/http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2013-03-21/kv-racing-signs-sponsor-in-time-for-season-opener |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 June 2013 |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=14 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydroxycut has been promoted as being created and endorsed by doctors. Television advertisements for Hydroxycut featured a medical resident, although reporters were unable to locate him after Hydroxycut was removed from the market in 2009.&lt;ref name="not-a-doctor"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=ABC News |title=I'm Not a Doctor, but... |first=Peggy |last=Peck |date=May 9, 2009 |accessdate= March 11, 2013 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/WellnessNews/story?id=7542510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate background ==
MuscleTech Research and Development Inc was a Canadian company based in Toronto that operated with a group of closely related companies, and developed the Hydroxycut product line.&lt;ref name=Carhart&gt;Jeffrey Carhart [http://www.millerthomson.com/assets/files/article_attachments/Reflections_on_the_Muscletech_Case.PDF "Reflections on the MuscleTech Case"] ''Annual Review of Insolvency Law''.

Prior to 2004, some formulations of Hydroxycut contained [[ephedra]].&lt;ref name=NYT_2003&gt;{{cite news |title=Studies of Dietary Supplements Come Under Growing Scrutiny |work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/23/us/studies-of-dietary-supplements-come-under-growing-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |date=June 23, 2003 |accessdate=2009-05-02 |first=Ford |last=Fessenden}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports of seizures in people who had ingested Hydroxycut, which were attributed to the ephedra and caffeine in the product. As a result, there were around 80 pending ephedra lawsuits against MuscleTech.&lt;ref name="kockler"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kockler DR, McCarthy MW, Lawson CL |title=Seizure activity and unresponsiveness after hydroxycut ingestion. |year=2001 |journal=Pharmacotherapy |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=647–51 |pmid=11349754 |doi=10.1592/phco.21.6.647.34542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Missouri Attorney General]] [[Jay Nixon]] filed a lawsuit in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] against Hydroxycut's manufacturer, MuscleTech, stating that its marketing claims that Hydroxycut was "clinically proven" to be a "fat-burner" were false. Nixon also alleged that "MuscleTech's own consultants had serious concerns about the safety of Hydroxycut, but the company continued to market the product."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[St. Louis Business Journal]] |title=Nixon sues maker of Hydroxycut |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2003/03/24/daily68.html |date=March 27, 2003 |accessdate= April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]] |publisher=ABC News |title='20/20' Investigates Diet Pill Ads |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=124290 |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MuscleTech paid $100,000 to [[Settlement (litigation)|settle the case]] and agreed to cease marketing ephedra-containing products in Missouri and to refund customers' money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[St. Louis Business Journal]] |title=Hydroxycut distributor to pay Missouri $100K to settle suit |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2004/05/03/daily33.html |date=May 4, 2004 |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in 2003 that internal documents from MuscleTech indicated that the company had buried studies showing that Hydroxycut was ineffective, covered up evidence of cardiac side effects, and even tampered with the documents it submitted as evidence in a lawsuit in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=NYT_2003 /&gt;

In 2004, the FDA banned ephedra after 155 deaths from [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]] were attributed to ephedra, including the death of [[Baltimore Orioles]] [[pitcher]] [[Steve Bechler]]. It was the first banning of a dietary supplement by the FDA.&lt;ref name='howstuffworks'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/diet-fitness/diets/hydroxycut.htm |title=Hydroxycut: What You Need to Know |work=Sarah Siddons |publisher=How Stuff Work |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5C9t6NlWEbYC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=%22Steve+Bechler%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Steve%20Bechler%22&amp;f=false Death at the ballpark: a comprehensive study of game-related fatalities of …] By Robert M. Gorman, David Weeks. McFarland Press. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-2009 formulations ==
By 2009, about 15% of Americans had tried taking dietary supplements for weight loss, and Hydroxycut was the biggest seller, with about a million units sold each year.&lt;ref name="Lobb"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ano Lobb |pmc=2668789 |title=Hepatoxicity associated with weight-loss supplements: A case for better post-marketing surveillance|pmid=19360927 |journal=World J Gastroenterol |date=2009-04-14|volume=15|issue=14|pages=1786–7 |doi=10.3748/wjg.15.1786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Hydroxycut formulations contained several substances with potential to harm the liver such as [[hydroxycitric acid]].&lt;ref name="Lobb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dara"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dara L, Hewett J, Lim JK |year=2008 |title=Hydroxycut hepatotoxicity: a case series and review of liver toxicity from herbal weight loss supplements |journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=14 |issue=45 |pages=6999–7004 |pmid=19058338 |pmc=2773866 |doi=10.3748/wjg.14.6999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific evidence of serious side effects from Hydroxycut products accumulated, including liver failure (requiring [[liver transplantation]] in some cases), [[rhabdomyolysis]], and at least one death, of a 19-year-old man who used the product.&lt;ref name="Lobb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dara" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hydroxycut-death"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Reuters]] |title=Hydroxycut products recalled after one death |accessdate=March 11, 2013 |date=May 1, 2009 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/01/us-supplements-hydroxycut-idUSTRE5404NW20090501 |first=Lias |last=Richwine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dehoney S, Wellein M |title =Rhabdomyolysis associated with the nutritional supplement Hydroxycut. |year=2009 |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=142–8 |doi=10.2146/ajhp070640 |pmid=19139478}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fong2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong|first1=TL|last2=Klontz|first2=KC|last3=Canas-Coto|first3=A|last4=Casper|first4=SJ|last5=Durazo|first5=FA|last6=Davern Tj|first6=2nd|last7=Hayashi|first7=P|last8=Lee|first8=WM|last9=Seeff|first9=LB|title=Hepatotoxicity due to hydroxycut: a case series|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|volume=105|issue=7|pages=1561–6|year=2010|pmid=20104221|doi=10.1038/ajg.2010.5|pmc=3825455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP-on-Fong&gt;{{cite news |last=Norton |first=Amy |title=Hydroxycut linked to other cases of liver damage |newspaper=Reuters Health |location=New York |publisher=Reuters |date=February 12, 2010 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61B4P720100212 |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rashid NN, Grant J |title =Hydroxycut hepatotoxicity. |year=2010 |journal=Med.

On May 1, 2009, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued a warning to consumers to stop using Hydroxycut products, due to 23 reports of serious health problems associated with the use of Hydroxycut, and at least one death, and to destroy any product that they may possess.&lt;ref name='FDA warning'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm152152.htm |title=FDA Warns Consumers to Stop Using Hydroxycut Products |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news |author=Associated Press |title=FDA warns dieters: Stop Hydroxycut use now |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30518843 |publisher=MSNBC |date=May 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warning stated ''"Although the liver damage appears to be relatively rare, FDA believes consumers should not be exposed to unnecessary risk. Consumers who have these products are urged to stop using them."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Safety Recall|url=http://www.fda.gov/Safety/recalls/ucm145164.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the FDA warning, the manufacturer then agreed to voluntarily recall the products.&lt;ref name=AP-on-Fong /&gt;

== Post-2009 formulations ==
After the 2009 recall, Hydroxycut was reformulated and placed back on sale, and the FDA confirmed that the only ingredient left from prior formulations was caffeine.&lt;ref name=AP-on-Fong /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs-how"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[CBS News]] |title=How Hydroxycut Stays in Business Despite Deaths, Recalls and a Class-Action Suit |first=Jim |last=Edwards |accessdate=March 11, 2013 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-42848593/how-hydroxycut-stays-in-business-despite-deaths-recalls-and-a-class-action-suit/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorraine Heller for NutraIngredients-USA.com, September 8, 2009. [http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Industry/Reformulated-Hydroxycut-back-on-shelves Reformulated Hydroxycut back on shelves]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, its primary ingredients include caffeine anhydrous,&lt;ref&gt;http://pharmacistanswers.com/hydroxycut-advice-question.html&lt;/ref&gt; Lady's mantle extract (''[[Alchemilla]] vulgaris''), Wild olive extract (''[[Olea europaea]]''), Cumin extract (''[[Cuminum cyminum]]''), Wild mint extract (''[[Mentha longifolia]]'') and, in some Hydroxycut products, Green coffee bean extract (''[[Coffea canephora (robusta)|Coffea canephora robusta]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.webmd.com/diet/hydroxycitric-acid-hydroxycut |title=Hydroxycut: Uses, Side Effects, and Risks |author=Smith, Michael W. |publisher=WebMD |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the reformulation, [[case report]]s in the medical literature have continued to link Hydroxycut to serious side effects. An article published in 2010 reported on a case of [[atrial fibrillation]] that the author suspected was due to [[epigallocatechin gallate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karth A, Holoshitz N, Kavinsky CJ, Trohman R, McBride BF |year=2010 |title=A case report of atrial fibrillation potentially induced by hydroxycut: a multicomponent dietary weight loss supplement devoid of sympathomimetic amines |journal=J Pharm Pract |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=245–9 |doi=10.1177/0897190010362104 |pmid=21507821}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Hydroxycut Green Tea, a product that as of 2012 is no longer marketed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diethealthmag.com/hydroxycut/ DietHealthMag Hydroxycut Pro Clinical Review]. Accessed March 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another case published in 2013 reported on a patient who developed [[ulcerative colitis]] due to Hydroxycut Hardcore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sivarajah V, Abdul Q, Pardoe H, Lunniss P |year=2013 |title=Ulcerative colitis associated with the herbal weight loss supplement Hydroxycut |journal=BMJ Case Rep |volume=2013 |pages=bcr2012007509 |doi=10.1136/bcr-2012-007509 |pmid=23291814 |pmc=3603930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
The Hydroxycut case has been cited as emblematic of the weak regulation of dietary supplements in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Lobb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dara" /&gt;&lt;ref name="medpage"&gt;{{cite web |work=MedPage Today |title=Groups Call for Review of DSHEA in Light of Hydroxycut |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/DietNutrition/14074 |first=Kristina |last=Fiore |date=May 7, 2009 |accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs-why"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[CBS News]] |title=Why Hydroxycut Had to Kill Someone Before the FDA Could Act |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-42841370/why-hydroxycut-had-to-kill-someone-before-the-fda-could-act/ |date=May 4, 2009 |first=Jim |last=Edwards |accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of the nutritional supplements industry said that the recall demonstrated that the FDA has the power to protect consumers from toxic products, while critics cited it as evidence that the FDA's powers over dietary supplements need to be expanded.&lt;ref name=Healy&gt;{{cite news|last=Healy|first=Melissa|title=Sizing up safety; If a bestselling weight-loss aid is recalled, does that mean oversight of the supplement industry is working? For consumers with few options, that's a tough call to make|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some diet supplement executives defended the safety of Hydroxycut and believed the media "over-hyped" the FDA withdrawal, others questioned why Iovate had not published long-term safety or efficacy studies on the final Hydroxycut products, and used weak trial duration and sample sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroxycut and PhenqAvis Phentermine|url=http://phenq-avis.com/en/about-us/|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite having the money to perform such studies and their self-definition as a "research-oriented" company. The editors of the nutrition [[trade journal]] ''Nutrition Business Journal'' noted that this recall "will ultimately be a good thing for the dietary supplement industry if it encourages weight-loss supplement manufacturers to care as much about their products' safety and efficacy as they do about expanding and protecting their bottom lines."&lt;ref name=NBJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newhope360.com/supplements/weight-loss-supplement-sales-plummet-following-iovates-hydroxycut-recall|title=Weight-Loss Supplement Sales Plummet Following Iovate's Hydroxycut Recall |work=Nutrition Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper published in the ''[[World Journal of Gastroenterology]]'' in October 2010, Hydroxycut was cited as an example of "current and former weight loss products backed by potentially conflicted or low quality research." It noted that "Marketing materials for Hydroxycut cited two published studies asserting product effectiveness that were small, of short duration, reported no serious side effects, and did not disclose relationships between authors and the product manufacturer or that funding was received from the product manufacturer."&lt;ref name='Lobb2'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lobb|first=Anno|title=Science of weight loss supplements: Compromised by conflicts of interest?|journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology|date=14 October 2010|volume=16|issue=38|pages=4880–4882|doi=10.3748/wjg.v16.i38.4880|pmid=20939120|pmc=2955261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper noted that at least three studies supported the safety and effectiveness for weight loss of [[Cissus quadrangularis]] (CQ), which is an ingredient used in one of the reformulated Hydroxycut products, but "lack financial disclosures or funding sources, beyond mentioning that the CQ being tested was provided by" General Health Alliances, an herbal products manufacturer. The studies did not disclose that one of its authors was a chief scientific officer for GHA that holds a patent on a CQ product.&lt;ref name='Lobb2' /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4280">'''James Hunt''' (1833 – 29 August 1869) was a speech therapist in [[London]], England who had among his clients [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Leo Tennyson]] (son of the poet laureate [[Alfred Tennyson]]) and [[Lewis Carroll]] (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) author of ''Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland''.

Lewis Carroll was a children’s author, mathematician, and clergyman but had a severe stammer that affected his job.  The 1861 census shows that Charles Lutwidge Dodgson was staying at Ore House in 1861 and being treated by Dr Hunt a [[psellismolligist]].  Since his book was published in 1865 it is quite possible that some of it was written during his stay.{{Or|date=January 2015}}

His other main interest was in anthropology and in 1863 he established the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which after his death merged with the more established [[Ethnological Society of London]] to become the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]].

==Career==
James Hunt was born in Swanage, Dorset, the son of the speech therapist [[Thomas Hunt (speech therapist)|Thomas Hunt]] (1802–1851) and his wife Mary. He was trained by his father in the art of curing stuttering by means of breath exercises, muscle control and building the patient's confidence. He bought a doctorate from the [[University of Giessen]] in [[Germany]] and set up a practice in 1856 in [[Regent Street]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|title=Hunt, James|last=Brock|first=W. H. |id=14194}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated his first ''Manual'' on the subject to [[Charles Kingsley]] who spent three weeks with him in 1859. He moved to [[Hastings]] where ran residential courses during the summer season with his sister Elizabeth's husband, Rev. Henry F. Rivers.

==Anthropology==
In 1854 he joined the [[Ethnological Society of London]] because of his interest in racial differences and from 1859 to 1862 was the honorary secretary.  However many members of this society  disliked his attacks on humanitarian and missionary societies and the anti-slavery movement. &lt;ref&gt;George W. Stocking, Jr., ''Victorian Anthropology'', New York, The Free Press, 1991 (1987), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; So in 1863 with the help of the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] he set up the [[Anthropological Society of London]], becoming its first president.  His paper ''The Negro's place in nature'' was greeted with boos and hisses when given at the [[British Association]] meeting in 1863 because of its defence of slavery in the [[Confederate States of America]] and belief in the [[plurality of the human species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the Negro's place in Nature|author=James Hunt, President|year=1865|series=The Anthropological Review|volume=3|pages=53–4| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He established the ''Anthropological Review'' as the organ of the society and by 1867 the membership of the Society had reached 500. However, by 1867 allegations by one of the members [[Hyde Clarke]] of financial irregularities in his running of the society caused his temporary resignation as president, though he returned in 1868 when Clarke was expelled. This took a toll on his health and in 1869 he died of an inflammation of the brain. The society shortly afterwards started discussions to merge with the Ethnological Society.

He left a widow, Henrietta, and five children and left his books to his nephew [[W.H.R. Rivers]] who refused them, though, through unconnected means, he  later became an anthropologist himself.

Captain '''John Henry Ebersole''', [[M.D.]], [[Medical Corps (United States Navy)|MC USN]] (26 January 1925 – 23 September 1993) a pioneer in submarine medicine and radiation oncology, selected by Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]] to serve as [[medical officer]] aboard the [[US Navy]]'s first two nuclear powered [[submarine]]s, the {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}} and the {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|6}}. He was the [[radiologist]] for [[NASA]] that screened the [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts for [[Project Mercury]]. Ebersole was the radiologist responsible for the [[x-rays]] taken during the [[John F. Kennedy autopsy|autopsy of John F. Kennedy]] on 22 November 1963 at [[Bethesda Naval Medical Center]].

==Biography==
Ebersole was born in 1925 at [[Sterling, IL|Sterling]], [[Illinois]]. He grew up in northwestern Illinois.
On 21 October 1948, John H. Ebersole, [[physician]] applied for a [[marriage license]] to wed Marion E. Sherwood, [[nurse]]. The couple were married on 30 October 1948 at St. Vincent de Paul church by Reverend M.J. Rouck in [[Bedford, Indiana]]. Ebersole was the son of Noah Ebersole, auto mechanic and Geraldine Kathryn McCormick, housewife. Marion was the daughter of Samuel J. Sherwood, estimator and Maybelle Elizabeth Lehay.&lt;ref&gt;Indiana Marriages, 1811-2007. Database with images. FamilySearch. John H Ebersole and Marian E Sherwood. 30 Oct 1948.

Ebersole served for 24 years in the [[U.S. Navy Medical Corps]]. He was the first officer to serve aboard two nuclear submarines, the {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}} and the {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|6}}, being selected by Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]] as the medical officer for the crew. He worked with [[NASA]] on [[Project Mercury]]. Ebersole was assigned to [[Bethesda Naval Medical Center]] and was the radiologist for the autopsy of [[President John F. Kennedy]]. He was chief of radiation therapy, training director for nuclear medicine, and director of the Radiation Exposure Evaluation Laboratory. He became chief of diagnostic radiology and chief of radiology. After retirement from the Navy, Ebersole settled in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] where he established and directed the John Hale Steinman Cancer Center at [[Lancaster General Hospital]]. Upon retirement from medical practice, Ebersole pursue a lifelong passion in mystery novels and [[crime fiction]]. He traveled to England and attended conferences at [[Oxford University]]. He became adjunct faculty at [[Franklin and Marshall College]] and taught a [[detective fiction]] course in the EtCetera program. He was a founding member of the Orange Street Improbables, a group of mystery enthusiasts.&lt;ref name=Herman&gt;Herman, Jan Kenneth. Editor. (January–February 1994). Capt. J.H.

==U.S. Navy career==
Ebersole entered the U.S. Navy in July 1948 and trained in undersea medicine. As a future submarine doctor, Ebersole received extensive nuclear training. From 1949 to 1959, Ebersole was associated with [[nuclear submarines]] and had special training in [[nuclear physics]] at [[Duke University]] and at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. Ebersole was commissioned in the [[U.S. Navy]] and served on the USS ''Nautilus'' and the USS ''Seawolf'', the first two nuclear submarines. Ebersole was selected by Admiral Hyman G. Rickover as the [[medical officer]] for the USS ''Nautilus'', the first nuclear-powered submarine and served under [[commanding officer]] Commander [[Eugene Parks Wilkinson]]. Ebersole was a member of the launching crew for the USS ''Nautilus''.&lt;ref&gt;Charette, Al (NAAI Historian). (21 January 1954). Members of the Launching Crew. ''The Day''. New London, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ussnautilus.us/files/launching_crew.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to serve as [[medical officer]] aboard the USS ''Seawolf'', the second nuclear submarine for the U.S. Navy. Ebersole was the first person to serve on more than one nuclear powered vessel.

On 26 September 1957, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] boarded the USS ''Seawolf'' at [[Narragansett Bay]] and was greeted by [[skipper (boating)|skipper]] Commander Richard B. Lanning and Rear Admiral Frederick B. Warder, [[COMSUBLANT|Atlantic Fleet submarine force commander]].&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (2016). 26 September 1957. President boarded the Seawolf. Dwight D. Eisenhower Daily Appointment Schedule. Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library. Miller Center. University of Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; The President was briefed by Ebersole regarding radiation exposure aboard the ''Seawolf''. 
According to the ''New York Times'' report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The President was briefed about controlled radiation exposure aboard nuclear-powered submarines.  He received a [[film badge|film patch]] to wear and a tiny [[dosimeter]] to read. The [[medical officer]], Lieut. Comdr. John E. Ebersole of Sterling, Ill., explained to the President that submariners in the new type craft get an average radiation dosage of about 200 [[Roentgen (unit)|milliroentgens]] a year, compared with an allowable industrial dose of about 300 a week.  As he left the boat, the President jokingly told Admiral Warder to check on his film patch and "let me know if I had too much radiation."  "I assure you, you won't have," the Admiral said."&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (27 September 1957). Eisenhower Takes First Dive in an Atomic Submarine. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Ebersole-Seawolf.jpg|thumb|Ebersole aboard the ''Seawolf''.]]
During his tour, the ''Seawolf'' set a new record of submergence for 60 days under the command of Captain Richard Boyer Laning.  Captain Laning and the ''Seawolf'' crew were greeted upon return to port at [[New London, Connecticut]] by Rear Admiral Hyman G. Rickover.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Keith R. (7 October 1958). Seawolf Sets 60-Day Mark. ''The Cornell Daily Sun''. LXXV(12): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the USS ''Seawolf'' was [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioned]], he started a [[residency (medicine)|residency]] in [[radiology]] at [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]]. In July 1963, he completed residency. He then became Chief of Radiation Therapy in the Medicine Section at Bethesda Naval Hospital.

===Nuke School===
Eventually, the Navy established a routine training program for what would be called Nuke School. The coursework for officers to be assigned to nuclear submarines and ships began at [[Reed College]] in Oregon with 24 weeks of training. Then they received 6 weeks of field training at the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]'s [[Hanford site|Hanford plutonium production facilities]] in Washington. Next the candidates spent 5 weeks at the [[Nevada Test Site]] and the [[Sandia Base|Sandia nuclear weapons laboratory]] in New Mexico. They finished up with 6 weeks of additional training at the Walter Reed Laboratory in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rockwell|first1=Theodore|title=The Rickover Effect: How One Man Made a Difference|date=2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=0595252702|pages=411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karun-4 Dam''' is an [[arch dam]] on the [[Karun|Karun River]] located at 180&amp;nbsp;km southwest of Shahr-e-Kord in the province of [[Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province|Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="Basic information"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpco.com/doc-html-FA/karun4.htm/|title=Basic information|accessdate=2008-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080628103819/http://www.iwpco.com/doc-html-FA/karun4.htm/ |archivedate = 2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karun has the highest discharge of all the Iranian rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karun3.com/history/?item=1|title=Dam history|accessdate=2008-06-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706005450/http://www.karun3.com/history/?item=1|archivedate=2008-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its construction is aimed at electric power supply of 2107 million kWh annually and controlling floods in the upper Karun.

The dam is a concrete double curvature arch-type and {{convert|230|m}} high from the foundation.&lt;ref name="Basic information"/&gt;  The arch dam design is an ideal one for a dam built in a narrow, rocky gorge to hold back water in a reservoir. The dam is curved. Because of the arch shape, the force of the backed up water presses downward against the dam and has the effect of strengthening the dam foundation. The dam withholds a [[reservoir]] with a surface area of {{convert|29|km2|sqmi}} and capacity of {{convert|2.19|km3|acre.ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/buildingbig/dam/basics.html|title=Dam basics|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The dam's first study was conducted in 1995 and river diversion began in 1997. Concrete pouring began in 2006 and the power plant began producing electricity in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.irib.ir/index.php/news/political/32317-karoun-4-dam-launched-into-operation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015134/http://english.irib.ir/index.php/news/political/32317-karoun-4-dam-launched-into-operation |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.iwpco.ir/Lists/News/DispForm.aspx?ID=33&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2010, the second generator for the dam became operational and was connected to the grid. The dam will eventually have an installed capacity of 1,020&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News: Second Unit of Karun 4 Joins Iran’s National Network|url=http://en.iwpco.ir/Lists/News/DispForm.aspx?ID=94|publisher=IPWCO|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam was inaugurated on 6 July 2011 by Iranian President [[Mahmood Ahmadinejad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News: Self-sufficiency in Dam construction; Karun4 Dam Inaugurated|url=http://en.iwpco.ir/Lists/News/DispForm.aspx?ID=117|publisher=Iran Water and Power Resources Development Co.|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
It was built to fulfill the followings: 
*To produce an average annual hydropower energy as much as 2100 GW-h.
*To join the cascade dams on the Karun River, hence  regulate the flow in order to supply the water required by the  industry and agriculture downstream.
*To control the destructive floods of the Karun River.&lt;ref name="Basic information"/&gt;

==Cost==
The dam construction was costed 8600 billion Rials financed by public resources including national and local budget, domestic banks facilities, bonds, as well as foreign facilities (finance, loan, etc.).Initial estimate of annual income from the electricity production amounted to 1353 billion Rials (642 Rials per kilo watt hour).

[[File:Stuart Pierson, hazing casualty (1905).jpg|right|thumb|In 1905, Stuart Pierson was being initiated into [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, at [[Kenyon College]]. The other students sent him to a railroad bridge, which they believed was not in use; however, an unscheduled train arrived, and Pierson was killed.]]

This is a '''list of hazing deaths in the United States'''. This is not an exhaustive list. An exact list is not available because there is no central system for tracking hazing deaths, and the role of [[hazing]] in some deaths is subject to disagreement. Inclusion in this list requires that the incident was described by the media as a hazing-related death. Incidents involving criminal or civil proceedings that did not find a definite link with hazing may still be included if they meet this criterion.

According to the National Collaborative for Hazing Research and Prevention at the [[University of Maine]], hazing is defined as "any activity expected of someone joining or participating in a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers them, regardless of a person's willingness to participate".&lt;ref name=umaine&gt;{{cite web|title=Hazing Research and Prevention|url=http://umaine.edu/hazingresearch/|website=[[Umaine.edu]]|accessdate=15 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084932/http://umaine.edu/hazingresearch/|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although hazing is often associated with the activities that take place as a prerequisite for joining a group, it can also include activities that take place as an established member, such as the 2011 death of fraternity brother [[List of hazing deaths in the United States#2010s|George Desdunes]].

There has been at least one university hazing death each year from 1969 to 2017.&lt;ref name="Nuwer.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hanknuwer.com/articles/hazing-deaths/ | title=Hazing Deaths | publisher=Hank Nuwer | date=2017 | accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Franklin College (Indiana)|Franklin College]] journalism professor Hank Nuwer, over 200 university hazing deaths have occurred since 1838, with 40 deaths between 2007 and 2017 alone.&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Hazing deaths on American college campuses remain far too common|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/10/daily-chart-8|work=[[The Economist]]|date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol poisoning is the biggest cause of death.&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt;

During his long struggle with the illness, he blamed the illness on hazing he received at West Point in 1898, claiming he had hot sauce poured down his throat on three occasions as well as a number of other grueling hazing practices, such as brutal beatings and having hot wax poured on him in the night. His family claimed that scarring from the hot sauce made him more susceptible to the infection, causing his death. Among other things, Booz had claimed that his devotion to Christianity made him a target and that he was tormented for reading his Bible.&lt;ref name="San Francisco"&gt;{{cite news|title=Father of the victim testifies that his wrote it was hard to be a Christian at West Point|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SFC19001218.2.12#|work=San Francisco Call|date=December 18, 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Oscar Booz Is Dead", ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', December 4, 1900, p2&lt;/ref&gt;

|Two Alfred University fraternity members, Bradley Calkins and Thomas Lam, pleaded guilty to assault and hazing charges, respectively, following the suicide of Klein. The men admitted to assaulting Klein on February 9 to prevent him from speaking out against the fraternity's hazing practices. "We were all afraid that if he left, he would get our fraternity in trouble because he was drinking and telling others about hazing practices in our fraternity," one of the men said. Calkins admitted he hit Klein in the head with a boot after binding his hands and feet with duct tape in a hotel room during a regional fraternity meeting. Lam admitted to encouraging the practice and not taking any steps to halt it. While he was still tied up, he was placed in the bathtub with the shower turned on and not released until he promised he would not leave the hotel room. Klein was found deceased three days later in a creek behind the fraternity house of an apparent suicide by drug overdose. He was found with cuts and bruises on his body from the assault.

|Alcohol intoxication
|As part of Delta Chi fraternity's 21st birthday hazing ritual Steven consumed at least 15 shots of hard liquor in a 2-hour period at a local bar. Police reports state that Steven had on at least two separate occasions asked the bartenders not to serve him anymore alcohol and was also served a drink in order to cause him to vomit which was unsuccessful. After returning to his fraternity house he fell down several times hitting his head and was put to bed where he was found unconscious the following morning. He ultimately was taken off life support just 24 hours after turning 21. At the time of his death Steven was a junior Crimson Scholar at New Mexico State University majoring in Computer Science. The university refused to accept any responsibility or  make significant changes in their campus policies. Repeated attempt to get the New Mexico legislature to pass a "Cinderella Law" which would have postponed the legal age, for drinking purposes, 12 hours was consistently met with opposition from the liquor lobby and failed each and every time in committee.  A memorial scholarship, funded by his parents and friends, has been awarded each year for the student that "has made the greatest contribution toward alcohol prevention and the reduction of high risk drinking at NMSU."

|A drilling rig employee received 18-year prison sentence in the hazing death of 23-year-old Shawn Davis, a new employee of Republic Energy Drilling Company. Veteran employees were attempting to initiate Davis by hoisting him upwards via a cable used to pick up pipe and place it on the rig floor. Davis resisted, but the employees succeeded in putting the belt on Davis and hooking him to the cat line. Another employee noted that the kelly, the device located on the rig floor that is used to drill into the ground and spins at seventy rotations per minute, was turning and, based on his experience, he knew that any slack in the cat line could get caught on the kelly as it turned. Unbeknownst to other employees, this is what happened shortly before he was hooked to the cat line. They hastily attempted to unhook the cat line as it pulled Davis out of the door of the top doghouse. Davis was dragged, face first, out of the building. Davis hit the bottom half of the doghouse door, taking it off the hinges. He was then dragged to the kelly bushing where he was spun around approximately ten to twenty times as his body hit several different pieces of equipment and surfaces. They immediately shut down the equipment and called 911, but he died of blunt force trauma.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite news|title=Louis Earl GOODMAN, Appellant, v.

The suit contends the school was aware of "outrageous conduct" by the fraternity and misrepresented "information about the frequency or incidence of hazing, violence, injuries, substance abuse, and/or other dangerous and/or illegal activities at HPU or within Delta Sigma Phi."&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=Robert|title=Family of dead HPU student refiles lawsuit alleging hazing|url=http://www.news-record.com/news/local_news/family-of-dead-hpu-student-refiles-lawsuit-alleging-hazing/article_d68394f4-d407-11e4-aa9d-27644e53ab33.html|agency=News &amp; Record|date=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Drowning
|Edmondson and Holmes drowned during an initiation rite for the underground fraternity known as Men of Honor. Seven students locked arms and attempted to cross the [[Appomattox River]] together. Fraternity members told police they completed the same rite several months earlier without issue and the water was shallow enough to make it across without swimming. On April 20, however, the river had swelled considerably due to a recent storm and was moving more swiftly. The students quickly became submerged and were swept downstream. The other five men were rescued by members of the fraternity. Four fraternity members pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and hazing charges.&lt;ref name=Bowes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowes|first1=Mark|title=Four men convicted of manslaughter, hazing in VSU drowning deaths|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/local/chesterfield/article_4bed243f-aa5b-505e-9033-44e36e62ce3d.html|agency=Richmond Times Dispatch|date=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Head injuries after fall
|Sigma Phi Epsilon pledge Tucker Hipps was participating in a group run with his fraternity around 5:30am when he fell from a bridge into shallow waters of Lake Hartwell. He died of head injuries from the fall. The fraternity members reported that he got separated from the group and didn't return from the run. He was reported missing and his body was found later on that day. The police investigating his death released a statement that they were unable to find any link between hazing and his death, but it was widely speculated, particularly on social media, that the death resulted from hazing. Because of the widespread rumors, the president's Interfraternity Council at Clemson voted to suspend pledge activities.

'''Major trauma''' is any [[injury]] that has the potential to cause prolonged [[disability]] or [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/ems/emstraumasystem03/glossary.htm|work=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many causes of major trauma, [[blunt trauma|blunt]] and [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], including [[Falling (accident)|falls]], [[motor vehicle collision]]s, [[stab wound|stabbing wounds]], and [[gunshot wound]]s. Depending on the severity of injury, quickness of management and transportation to an appropriate medical facility (called a [[trauma center]]) may be necessary to prevent loss of life or limb. The initial assessment is critical, and involves a physical evaluation and also may include the use of imaging tools to determine the types of injuries accurately and to formulate a course of treatment.

In 2002, unintentional and intentional injuries were the fifth and seventh leading causes of deaths worldwide, accounting for 6.23% and 2.84% of all deaths. For research purposes the definition often is based on an [[injury severity score]] (ISS) of greater than 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmer|first=C|title=Major trauma and the injury severity score—where should we set the bar?|journal=Annual Proceedings of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine |year=2007|volume=51|pages=13–29|pmid=18184482|pmc=3217501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Injuries generally are classified by either severity, the location of damage, or a combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2013, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--percentages of total incidence--&gt;Trauma also may be classified by [[Demographics|demographic group]], such as age or gender.&lt;ref name="Rosen2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice|edition= 7th |last=Marx|first=J|year=2010|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0323054720|pages=243–842}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also may be classified by the type of force applied to the body, such as [[blunt trauma]] or [[penetrating trauma]]. For research purposes injury may be classified using the [[Barell matrix]], which is based on [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems#ICD-9-CM|ICD-9-CM]]. The purpose of the matrix is for international standardization of the classification of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/injury/ice/barell_matrix.htm|title = The Barell Injury Diagnosis Matrix, Classification by Body Region and Nature of the Injury|accessdate = 19 June 2013|publisher = Center for Disease Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major trauma sometimes is classified by body area; injuries affecting 40% are [[polytrauma]], 30% [[head injury|head injuries]], 20% [[chest trauma]], 10%, [[abdominal trauma]], and 2%, [[Limb (anatomy)|extremity]] trauma.&lt;ref name="Rosen2010"/&gt;&lt;!--percentages of total incidence--&gt;&lt;ref name="ER2008" /&gt;

Various scales exist to provide a quantifiable metric to measure the severity of injuries. The value may be used for [[triage|triaging]] a patient or for statistical analysis. Injury scales measure damage to anatomical parts, physiological values (blood pressure etc.), [[comorbidity|comorbidities]], or a combination of those. The [[abbreviated injury scale]] and the [[Glasgow coma scale]] are used commonly to quantify injuries for the purpose of triaging and allow a system to monitor or "trend" a patient's condition in a clinical setting.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2013, pp. 77–98&lt;/ref&gt; The data also may be used in epidemiological investigations and for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/injury/DicussionDocu.pdf | title=Discussion document on injury severity measurement in administrative datasets | publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | accessdate=2013-05-24 |date=September 2004 | pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 2% of those who have experienced significant trauma have a spinal cord injury.&lt;ref name="Ahn 1341–61"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=H|author2=Singh, J |author3=Nathens, A |author4=MacDonald, RD |author5=Travers, A |author6=Tallon, J |author7=Fehlings, MG |author8= Yee, A |title=Pre-hospital care management of a potential spinal cord injured patient: a systematic review of the literature and evidence-based guidelines|journal=Journal of Neurotrauma|date=Aug 2011|volume=28|issue=8|pages=1341–61|pmid=20175667 |doi=10.1089/neu.2009.1168 |pmc=3143405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Injuries may be caused by any combination of external forces that act physically against the body.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2013, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The leading causes of traumatic death are [[blunt trauma]], [[Traffic collision|motor vehicle collisions]], and [[Falling (accident)|falls]], followed by [[penetrating trauma]] such as [[stab wound]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or impaled objects.&lt;ref name="EMT-BMcGraw"&gt;{{cite book|title=EMT-Basic|last=DiPrima Jr.|first=PA|pages=227–33|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0071496797}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsets of blunt trauma are both the number one and two causes of traumatic death.&lt;ref name="ec11"&gt;{{cite book|title=Emergency Care|vauthors=Dickenson ET, Limmer D, O'Keefe MF |isbn=978-0135005231|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For statistical purposes, injuries are classified as either intentional such as suicide, or unintentional, such as a motor vehicle collision. Intentional injury is a common cause of traumas.&lt;ref name="isbn0-340-92826-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeff Garner |author2=Greaves, Ian |author3=Ryan, James R. |author4=Porter, Keith R. |title=Trauma care manual |publisher=Hodder Arnold |location=London |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=978-0340928264 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penetrating trauma is caused when a [[foreign body]] such as a bullet or a knife enters the [[tissue (biology)|body tissue]], creating an open wound.

==Pathophysiology==
The body responds to traumatic injury both systemically and at the injury site.&lt;ref name="trauma care"&gt;{{cite book | title=Manual of Definitive Surgical Trauma Care | publisher=Hodder Arnold Publishers | author=Boffard, Kenneth | year=2007 | location=London, England | isbn=978-0340947647}}&lt;/ref&gt; This response attempts to protect vital organs such as the liver, to allow further cell duplication and to heal the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Winterborn | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Cook | first2 = T. A. | doi = 10.1383/surg.21.9.240.16923 | title = The Pathophysiology of Severe Trauma | journal = Surgery | volume = 21 | issue = 9 | page = 240a | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The healing time of an injury depends on various factors including sex, age, and the severity of injury.&lt;ref name="ICU Book" /&gt;

The symptoms of injury may manifest in many different ways, including:&lt;ref&gt;Pietzman 2002, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Altered mental status]]
* Fever
* [[Tachycardia|Increased heart rate]]
* Generalized [[edema]]
* Increased [[cardiac output]]
* Increased rate of metabolism

Various organ systems respond to injury to restore [[homeostasis]] by maintaining perfusion to the heart and brain.&lt;ref&gt;Pietzman 2002, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inflammation]] after injury occurs to protect against further damage and starts the healing process. Prolonged inflammation may cause [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]] or [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Pietzman 2002, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after injury, the body increases production of glucose through [[gluconeogenesis]] and its consumption of fat via [[lipolysis]]. Next, the body tries to replenish its energy stores of glucose and protein via [[anabolism]]. In this state the body will temporarily increase its maximum expenditure for the purpose of healing injured cells.&lt;ref name="ICU Book"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sutin, Kenneth M |author2=Marino, Paul L. |title=The ICU book |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0781748025 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15910820"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keel M, Trentz O |title=Pathophysiology of polytrauma |journal=[[Injury (journal)|Injury]] |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=691–709 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15910820 |doi=10.1016/j.injury.2004.12.037 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020-1383(04)00552-2 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

Birdshot pellets are visible within and around the shattered patella, distal femur and proximal tibia.|Radiograph of a close-range [[shotgun]] [[blast injury]] to the [[knee]]. [[Birdshot|Birdshot pellets]] are visible within and around the shattered [[patella]], distal [[femur]], and proximal [[tibia]]]]

The initial assessment is critical in determining the extent of injuries and what will be needed to manage an injury, and for treating immediate life threats.

===Physical examination===
Primary [[physical examination]] is undertaken to identify any life-threatening problems, after which the secondary examination is carried out. This may occur during transportation or upon arrival at the hospital. The secondary examination consists of a systematic assessment of the [[Abdomen|abdominal]], [[Human pelvis|pelvic]], and [[Chest|thoracic]] areas, a complete inspection of the body surface to find all injuries, and a [[neurological examination]]. Injuries that may manifest themselves later, may be missed during the initial assessment, such as when a patient is brought into a hospital's emergency department.&lt;ref name="ATLS2008" /&gt; Generally, the physical examination is performed in a systematic way that first checks for any immediate life threats (primary survey), and then taking a more in depth examination (secondary survey).&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2013, p&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imaging===
[[File:Whole body radiograph in trauma.jpg|thumb|left|Whole body radiograph of traumatic injuries]]
Persons with major trauma commonly have chest and pelvic [[Radiography|x-rays]] taken,&lt;ref name="ER2008" /&gt; and, depending on the mechanism of injury and presentation, a [[focused assessment with sonography for trauma]] (FAST) exam to check for internal bleeding. For those with relatively stable blood pressure, heart rate, and sufficient [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]] are useful.&lt;ref name="ER2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trauma2010" /&gt; [[Full-body CT scan]]s, known as pan-scans, improve the survival rate of those who have suffered major trauma.&lt;ref name="Huber2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huber-Wagner S, Lefering R, Qvick LM, etal |title=Effect of whole-body CT during trauma resuscitation on survival: a retrospective, multicentre study|journal=Lancet|volume=373|issue=9673|pages=1455–61|year=2009|pmid=19321199|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60232-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=L|last2=Ma|first2=Y|last3=Jiang|first3=S|last4=Ye|first4=L|last5=Zheng|first5=Z|last6=Xu|first6=Y|last7=Zhang|first7=M|title=Comparison of whole-body computed tomography vs selective radiological imaging on outcomes in major trauma patients: a meta-analysis|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine|date=September 2, 2014|volume=22|issue=1|page=54|pmid=25178942|doi=10.1186/s13049-014-0054-2|pmc=4347587}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scans use intravenous injections for the [[radiocontrast]] agent, but not oral administration.&lt;ref name="Allen2004"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Allen TL, Mueller MT, Bonk RT, Harker CP, Duffy OH, Stevens MH |title=Computed tomographic scanning without oral contrast solution for blunt bowel and mesenteric injuries in abdominal trauma|journal=J Trauma|volume=56|issue=2|pages=314–22|year=2004|pmid=14960973|doi=10.1097/01.TA.0000058118.86614.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are concerns that intravenous contrast administration in trauma situations without confirming adequate renal function may cause damage to kidneys, but this does not appear to be significant.&lt;ref name="Trauma2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGillicuddy EA, Schuster KM, Kaplan LJ, et al |title=Contrast-induced nephropathy in elderly trauma patients|journal=J Trauma|volume=68|issue=2|pages=294–97|year=2010|pmid=20154540|doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e3181cf7e40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical techniques===
Surgical techniques, using a tube or catheter to [[Diagnostic peritoneal lavage|drain fluid from the peritoneum]], [[chest tube|chest]], or the [[pericardiocentesis|pericardium around the heart]], often are used in cases of severe blunt trauma to the chest or abdomen, especially when a person is experiencing early signs of [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]. In those with [[hypotension|low blood-pressure]], likely because of bleeding in the abdominal cavity, [[laparotomy|cutting through the abdominal wall surgically]] is indicated.&lt;ref name="ER2008" /&gt;

The care of acutely injured people in a public health system requires the involvement of bystanders, community members, health care professionals, and health care systems. It encompasses [[pre-hospital trauma assessment]] and care by [[emergency medical services]] personnel, emergency department assessment, treatment, stabilization, and in-hospital care among all age groups.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/injuryresponse/acute_injury.html|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Injury Prevention and Control: Injury Response: Acute Injury Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; An established trauma system network is also an important component of community disaster preparedness, facilitating the care of people who have been involved in disasters that cause large numbers of casualties, such as earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Hoyt2007" /&gt;

===Pre-hospital===
The pre-hospital use of [[Stabilization (medicine)|stabilization]] techniques improves the chances of a person surviving the journey to the nearest trauma-equipped hospital. Emergency medicine services determines which people need treatment at a [[trauma center]] as well as provide primary stabilization by checking and treating [[ABC (medicine)|airway, breathing, and circulation]] as well as assessing for disability and gaining exposure to check for other injuries.&lt;ref name="ATLS2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=American College of Surgeons|last=Committee on Trauma|authorlink=American College of Surgeons|title=ATLS: Advanced Trauma Life Support Program for Doctors|publisher=American College of Surgeons|location=Chicago|edition=8th|year=2008|isbn=978-1880696316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[spinal immobilization|Spinal motion restriction]] by securing the neck with a [[cervical collar]] and placing the person on a [[long spine board]] was of high importance in the pre-hospital setting, but due to lack of evidence to support its use, the practice is losing favor.

===In-hospital===
Management of those with trauma often requires the help of many healthcare specialists including physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and social workers. Cooperation allows many actions to be completed at once. Generally the first step of managing trauma is to perform a primary survey that evaluates a person's airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2013, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; After immediate life threats are controlled, a person is either moved into an operating room for immediate surgical correction of the injuries, or a secondary survey is performed that is a more detailed head-to-toe assessment of the person.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2013, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Indications for intubation include airway obstruction, inability to protect the airway, and respiratory failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nemeth|first=J|author2=Maghraby, N |author3=Kazim, S |title=Emergency airway management: the difficult airway.|journal=Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America|date=May 2012|volume=30|issue=2|pages=401–20, ix|pmid=22487112|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2011.12.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these indications include penetrating neck trauma, expanding neck hematoma, and being unconscious, among other indications. In general, the method of intubation used is [[rapid sequence intubation]] followed by ventilation. Assessment of circulation in those with trauma includes control of active bleeding. When a person is first brought in, vital signs are checked, an [[ECG]] is performed, and, if needed, vascular access is obtained. Other tests should be performed to get a baseline measurement of their current blood chemistry, such as a [[arterial blood gas]] or [[thromboelastography]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2013, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; In those with [[cardiac arrest]] due to trauma chest compressions are considered futile, but still recommended.&lt;ref name=AHAPart12&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanden Hoek TL, Morrison LJ, Shuster M, Donnino M, Sinz E, Lavonas EJ, Jeejeebhoy FM, Gabrielli A |title=Part 12: cardiac arrest in special situations: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care|journal=Circulation|date=2010-11-02|volume=122|issue=18 Suppl 3|pages=S829–61|pmid=20956228|doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.971069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correcting the underlying cause such as a [[pneumothorax]] or [[pericardial tamponade]], if present, may help.&lt;ref name=AHAPart12/&gt;

===Surgery===
The decision whether to perform surgery is determined by the extent of the damage and the anatomical location of the injury.

==Prognosis==
Trauma deaths occur in immediate, early, or late stages. Immediate deaths usually are due to [[apnea]], severe brain or high spinal cord injury, or rupture of the heart or of large blood vessels. Early deaths occur within minutes to hours and often are due to [[subdural hematoma|hemorrhages in the outer meningeal layer of the brain]], [[epidural hematoma|torn arteries]], [[hemothorax|blood around the lungs]], [[pneumothorax|air around the lungs]], [[ruptured spleen]], [[Abdominal trauma#Liver|liver laceration]], or [[pelvic fracture]]. Immediate access to care may be crucial to prevent death in persons experiencing major trauma. Late deaths occurs days or weeks after the injury&lt;ref name="ATLS2008" /&gt; and often are related to infection.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2013, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Prognosis is better in countries with a dedicated trauma system where injured persons are provided quick and effective access to proper treatment facilities.&lt;ref name="ER2008" /&gt;

Long-term prognosis frequently is complicated by pain; more than half of trauma patients have moderate to severe pain one year after injury.&lt;ref name="Rivara2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rivara FP, Mackenzie EJ, Jurkovich GJ, Nathens AB, Wang J, Scharfstein DO |title=Prevalence of pain in patients 1 year after major trauma|journal=Arch Surg|volume=143|issue=3|pages=282–87; discussion 288|year=2008|pmid=18347276|doi=10.1001/archsurg.2007.61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many also experience a reduced [[quality of life]] years after an injury,&lt;ref name="Ulvik2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ulvik A, Kvåle R, Wentzel-Larsen T, Flaatten H |title=Quality of life 2–7 years after major trauma|journal=Acta Anaesthesiol Scand|volume=52|issue=2|pages=195–201|year=2008|pmid=18005377|doi=10.1111/j.1399-6576.2007.01533.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 20% of victims sustaining some form of disability.&lt;ref name="Peitzman2008"&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Peitzman AB, Rhodes M, Schwab CW, Yealy DM, Fabian TC |title=The Trauma Manual|edition=3rd|year=2008|chapter=Pediatric Trauma|pages=499–514|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0781762755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The human remains discovered at the site of [[Nataruk]] in [[Turkana County|Turkana]], Kenya, are claimed to show major trauma, blunt and penetrating trauma, caused by violent trauma to the head, neck, ribs, knees, and hands that has been interpreted by some researchers as establishing the existence of warfare between two groups of hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inter-group violence among early Holocene hunter-gatherers of West Turkana, Kenya|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature16477|journal = Nature|pages = 394–98|volume = 529|issue = 7586|doi = 10.1038/nature16477|pmid = 26791728|first = M.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===
The financial cost of trauma includes both the amount of money spent on treatment and the loss of potential economic gain through absence from work. The average financial cost for the treatment of traumatic injury in the United States is approximately {{USD|334,000}} per person, making it costlier than the treatment of cancer and [[cardiovascular disease]]s.&lt;ref name="PHTLS"&gt;{{cite book |title=PHTLS: Prehospital Trauma Life Support |publisher=Mosby/JEMS |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0323065023}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the high cost of the treatment for trauma is the increased possibility of complications, which leads to the need for more interventions.&lt;ref name="pmid18656640"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hemmila MR, Jakubus JL, Maggio PM, etal |title=Real money: complications and hospital costs in trauma patients |journal=[[Surgery]] |volume=144 |issue=2 |pages=307–16 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18656640 |pmc=2583342 |doi=10.1016/j.surg.2008.05.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039-6060(08)00289-4 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a trauma center is costly because they are open continuously and maintain a state of readiness to receive patients, even if there are none.&lt;ref name="pmid14706578"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Taheri PA, Butz DA, Lottenberg L, Clawson A, Flint LM |title=The cost of trauma center readiness |journal=[[American Journal of Surgery]] |volume=187 |issue=1 |pages=7–13 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14706578 |doi= 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2003.06.002|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002961003004379 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the direct costs of the treatment, there also is a burden on the economy due to lost wages and productivity, which in 2009, accounted for approximately {{USD|693.5 billion}} in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nsc.org/Documents/Injury_Facts/Injury_Facts_2011_w.pdf | title=Injury Facts | publisher=National Safety Council | accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low- and middle-income countries===

Citizens of [[Developing country|low-]] and [[middle income country|middle-income]] countries (LMICs) often have higher mortality rates from injury. These countries accounted for 89% of all deaths from injury worldwide.&lt;ref name="2013nejm"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norton R, Kobusingye O |title=Injuries |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=368 |issue=18 |pages=1723–30 |date=May 2013 |pmid=23635052 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1109343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these countries do not have access to sufficient surgical care and many do not have a trauma system in place. In addition, most LMICs do not have a pre-hospital care system that treats injured persons initially and transports them to hospital quickly, resulting in most casualty patients being transported by private vehicles. Also, their hospitals lack the appropriate equipment, organizational resources, or trained staff.&lt;ref name="care"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sakran JV, Greer SE, Werline EC, McCunn M |title=Care of the injured worldwide: trauma still the neglected disease of modern society |journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=64 |date=September 2012 |pmid=22980446 |doi=10.1186/1757-7241-20-64 |url= |pmc=3518175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strength"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mock C, Quansah R, Krishnan R, Arreola-Risa C, Rivara F |title=Strengthening the prevention and care of injuries worldwide |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=363 |issue=9427 |pages=2172–79 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15220042 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16510-0 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2020, the amount of trauma-related deaths is expected to decline in [[high income country|high-income countries]], while in low- to middle-income countries it is expected to increase.{{sfn|Greaves, Porter, Ryan, Garner|2008|p = 2}}

A '''medical college''' or '''medical association''' is a [[trade association]] that brings together [[medical practitioner|practitioner]]s of a particular geographical area (a country, region, province). In common-law countries, they are often grouped by [[medical specialties]] ([[cardiologists]], [[family doctor]]s, etc.).

Medical associations act as a safeguard of the fundamental values of the [[medical]] [[profession]]: the [[deontological ethics]] and code of [[ethics]]. In addition to providing exclusive representation in national and international medical practitioners, a medical college is responsible for management and protection of the medical profession.

In most countries, licensing is usually required. A professional or college official is a public corporation of an industry association composed of persons exercising liberal professions and calls are usually covered by the state. Associate members are known as [[colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicosypacientes.com/colegios/2010/04/10_04_19_colegiacion La sociedad no puede recibir los mismos beneficios de la profesión médica sin los Colegios de Médicos.

== History ==
In ancient [[Rome]], the college was understood by the name of ''Colegium'' the company public law with legal personality, formed by a plurality of persons with the same trade. For its formation is needed at least three people, but to continue their activity sufficient one. It is believed that ''Opificum'' o ''Societate'' colleges, from which the current Official Colleges, were derived from the associations of commoners to achieve benefits similar to those enjoyed by the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]s, needed a special authorization from the [[Emperor]] or the [[Senate]] to take legal personality. The government and the administration were chosen at a meeting of all participants. From [[Alexander Severus]], these associations are transformed to free compulsory, children should follow the profession of his father.

These first colleges were characterized by common purpose to prevail over private interests. In [[Europe]], and specifically in [[Spain]], colleges and professional associations have a long tradition through the centuries, interrupted only by the [[French Revolution]], which in its ideology advocating that there should be one between the [[citizen]] and the [[sovereign state]]. This suppression of the early nineteenth century was changing throughout the century, returning to the end of her rebirth.

Currently, a [[professional association]] is a public corporation of an industry association composed of persons exercising professions calls, and are usually covered by the state. Associate members are known as [[colleges]]. When dedication is directed to manual or craft activities used the traditional name of [[guild]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicosypacientes.com/files/prensa/adjuntos/Discurso.pdf Garrote Díaz JM.

A recent review noted that "It was first published in 1983 as a book named "The Catalog of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer", containing 3,844 cases. In 2000, it became an online database on open access hosted by the NCI.
 
The information is organized into sub-databases: The "Cases Quick Searcher" lists cytogenetic aberrations in individual cancer cases. The "Molecular Biology Associations Searcher" compile gene rearrangements in cancer. The "Clinical Associations Searcher" is based on tumor type.
This database shows raw data. It is very reliable as each case is manually collected by prominent experts: [[Felix Mitelman]], Bertil Johansson, and Fredrik Mertens.

Taking in consideration all the progress made in cancer cytogenetics, it would have been much slower without the Mitelman database." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Deep/Cancer_CytogenomicsID20145.html|title=&lt;Cancer Cytogenomics resources&gt;|website=http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board''''' [2015] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/11.html UKSC 11] is a Scottish [[delict]], [[medical negligence]] and [[English tort law]] case on doctors and pharmacists that outlines the rule on the disclosure of risks to satisfy the criteria of an [[informed consent]]. The Supreme Court departed and overruled the earlier House of Lord's case in ''[[Sidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital]]'', in reconsidering the duty of care of a doctor towards a patient on medical treatment. The case changed the ''[[Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee|Bolam test]]'' to a greater test in medical negligence by introducing the general duty to attempt the disclosure of risks.&lt;ref&gt;[1957] 1 WLR 582&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==

The claimant was a woman of small stature and a diabetic under the care of a doctor during her pregnancy and labour. The doctor did not inform her of the 9-10% risk of [[shoulder dystocia]], where the baby's shoulders are unable to pass through the pelvis among diabetic women as she viewed the problem being very slight and a caesarean section was not in the claimant's interest. 

The baby suffered from severe disabilities after birth due to shoulder dystocia. The claimant sought damages from the health board for negligence on the part of the doctor for failing to advise her on the risk of shoulder dystocia. The Court of Session ruled that there was no negligence based on the Bolam principle and that there was no causation since the claimant would not have submitted to a caesarean birth even if informed of the pregnancy risk.

==Judgment==
The Supreme Court affirmed the requirement of 'informed choice' or 'informed consent' by patients in medical treatment that rests fundamentally on the duty of disclosure by medical practitioners. 

Lords  [[Brian Kerr, Baron Kerr of Tonaghmore|Kerr]] and [[Robert Reed, Lord Reed|Reed]] said: 

{{Cquote|84. Furthermore, because the extent to which a doctor may be inclined to discuss risks with a patient is not determined by medical learning or experience, the application of the ''Bolam'' test to this question is liable to result in the sanctioning of differences in practice which are attributable not to divergent schools of thought in medical science, but merely to divergent attitudes among doctors as to the degree of respect owed to their patients.

85. A person can of course decide that she does not wish to be informed of risks of injury (just as a person may choose to ignore the information leaflet enclosed with her medicine); and a doctor is not obliged to discuss the risks inherent in treatment with a person who makes it clear that she would prefer not to discuss the matter. Deciding whether a person is so disinclined may involve the doctor making a judgment; but it is not a judgment which is dependent on medical expertise. It is also true that the doctor must necessarily make a judgment as to how best to explain the risks to the patient, and that providing an effective explanation may require skill. But the skill and judgment required are not of the kind with which the ''Bolam'' test is concerned; and the need for that kind of skill and judgment does not entail that the question whether to explain the risks at all is normally a matter for the judgment of the doctor. That is not to say that the doctor is required to make disclosures to her patient if, in the reasonable exercise of medical judgment, she considers that it would be detrimental to the health of her patient to do so; but the "therapeutic exception", as it has been called, cannot provide the basis of the general rule.

86. It follows that the analysis of the law by the majority in ''[[Sidaway]]'' is unsatisfactory, in so far as it treated the doctor's duty to advise her patient of the risks of proposed treatment as falling within the scope of the ''Bolam'' test, subject to two qualifications of that general principle, neither of which is fundamentally consistent with that test. It is unsurprising that courts have found difficulty in the subsequent application of ''[[Sidaway]]'', and that the courts in England and Wales have in reality departed from it; a position which was effectively endorsed, particularly by Lord Steyn, in ''[[Chester v Afshar]]''. There is no reason to perpetuate the application of the ''Bolam'' test in this context any longer.

87. The correct position, in relation to the risks of injury involved in treatment, can now be seen to be substantially that adopted in Sidaway by Lord Scarman, and by Lord Woolf MR in Pearce, subject to the refinement made by the High Court of Australia in ''[[Rogers v Whitaker]]'', which we have discussed at paras 77-73. An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken. The doctor is therefore under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments. The test of materiality is whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient’s position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it.}}

Lords Neuberger, Clarke, Wilson and Hodge agreed.

Lady Hale gave a concurring opinion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1679">In psychology and [[neuroscience]], '''motor planning''' is a set of processes related to the preparation of a movement that occurs during the [[reaction time]] (the time between the presentation of a stimulus to a person and that person's initiation of a motor response). Colloquially, the term applies to any process involved in the preparation of a movement during the reaction time, including perception-related and action-related processes. For example, the identification of a task-relevant stimulus is captured by the usual meaning of the term, “motor planning”, but this identification process is not strictly motor-related. Wong and colleagues (2015) have proposed a narrower definition to include only movement-related processes: "Specification of the movement trajectory for the desired action, a description of how the [[Wikt:end-effector|end-effector]] will produce such an action, and finally a description of the full set of the joint trajectories or muscle activations required to execute the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Aaron L.|last2=Haith|first2=Adrian M.|last3=Krakauer|first3=John W.|date=August 2015|title=Motor Planning|journal=The Neuroscientist: A Review Journal Bringing Neurobiology, Neurology and Psychiatry|volume=21|issue=4|pages=385–398|doi=10.1177/1073858414541484|issn=1089-4098|pmid=24981338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''No Smoking Day'' was on [[Ash Wednesday]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National No Smoking Day - National Awareness Days Calendar &amp; Download 2017|url=https://www.awarenessdays.co.uk/awareness-days-calendar/no-smoking-day-2017-03-09/|website=National Awareness Days Calendar &amp; Download 2017|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Smoking Day|url=https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/no-smoking-day/|website=Days Of The Year|accessdate=14 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it now takes place on the second Wednesday in March. 

Each year, the campaign is promoted with a theme in the form of a short phrase.  In 2010, this theme was "Break free", encouraging smokers to break free from the chains of cigarettes and quit on ''No Smoking Day''. The 2011 theme was "Time to quit?".  Research conducted by GfK NOP following the 2009 campaign found that 1 in 10 smokers quit on No Smoking Day.

The campaign was run by a [[Charitable organization|charity]] of the same name, based in [[London]] with four full-time staff, until this was merged with the British Heart Foundation in 2011. It is funded by a coalition of governmental and [[voluntary sector]] organisations with an interest in health.  No Smoking Day's most recent President was entrepreneur, TV personality, and anti-tobacco campaigner [[Duncan Bannatyne]] OBE. Bannatyne is an ex-smoker who publicly took on British American Tobacco at its AGM in April 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10785">'''Overcrowding''' or '''crowding''' refers to the condition where more people are located within a given space than is considered tolerable from a safety and health perspective which will depend on current environment and [[Norm (social)|local cultural norms]]. Overcrowding may arise temporarily and/or regularly, in the [[home]], [[public space]]s or on [[public transport]]. The former is of particular concern since it is an individual's [[Shelter (building)|place of shelter]].

Effects on [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] due to crowding may be due to increased physical contact, lack of sleep, lack of privacy and poor hygiene practices.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/archive/2001-definitionsofcrowding.pdf|title=Definitions of crowding and the effect of crowding on health|last=Gray|first=Allison | name-list-format = vanc |date=2001|website=|publisher=Ministry of Social Policy, New Zealand|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[population density]] is an objective measure of number of people living per unit area, overcrowding refers to people's psychological response to density. But, definitions of crowding used in statistical reporting and for administrative purposes are based on density measures and do not usually incorporate people’s perceptions of crowding.

==Measures of overcrowding==

=== United States ===
The American Housing Survey is conducted by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs.html | title = American Housing Survey | date = | website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 literature review conducted for HUD's Office of Policy Development and Research found that the most commonly used measures of overcrowding are persons-per-room or persons-per-bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.huduser.gov/publications/pdf/Measuring_Overcrowding_in_Hsg.pdf | title = Measuring Overcrowding in Housing| author = US Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research | date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States uses persons per room, and considers a household crowded if there is more than one person per room, and severely crowded if more than 1.5 persons share a room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = ftp://ftp.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/chic-ccdh/Research_Reports-Rapports_de_recherche/eng_bilingual/Research_Report_International_Housing_Indicators_w.pdf | title = International Housing Indicators Research Report |author= Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation | date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Health Organization===

The World Health Organization is concerned with overcrowding of sleeping accommodation primarily as a risk for the spread of [[tuberculosis]] and has attempted to develop measurement indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cdrwww.who.int/ceh/indicators/overcrowding.pdf | title = Overcrowding | author = World Health Organization | date = 2003 | access-date = 19 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The Housing Act 1985 states:

"The room standard is contravened when the number of persons sleeping in a dwelling and the number of rooms available as sleeping accommodation is such that two persons of opposite sex who are not living together as husband and wife must sleep in the same room. For this purpose, children under the age of ten shall be left out of account, and a room is available as sleeping accommodation if it is of a type normally used in the locality either as a bedroom or as a living room."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/68/part/X/crossheading/definition-of-overcrowding|title=Housing Act 1985. 1985 c. 68, part X.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Housing Act describes how many persons are permitted per room, as well as amount of floor space per room as outlined in the table below. Children under 1 year are not counted, and children between 1 and 10 years are counted as half a unit. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Area (in sq. ft) !! No. of persons
|-
| 110 or more || 2 persons
|-
| 90 to 110 || 1.5 persons
|-
| 70 to 90 || 1 person
|-
| 50 to 70 || 0.5 persons
|}

===European Union===
[[Eurostat]] uses a stricter definition of overcrowding, known as 'the Bedroom Standard'. An overcrowded household is defined as one which has fewer rooms than the sum of:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Glossary:Overcrowding_rate|title=Statistics Explained|website=epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* one room for the household; 
* one room per couple in the household; 
* one room for each single person aged 18 or more; 
* one room per pair of single people of the same gender between 12 and 17 years of age; 
* one room for each single person between 12 and 17 years of age and not included in the previous category; 
* one room per pair of children under 12 years of age.
For example, a household of a single person living alone is considered overcrowded unless he or she has a living room which is separate from the bedroom (points 1 and 3 apply). However while the Bedroom Standard is generally advocated by policy advocates, statutory space and occupancy standards are usually either less generous, partial (for instance they apply to social housing only) or non-existent.&lt;ref name="envplan.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soaita AM | year = 2014 | title = Overcrowding and ‘under-occupancy’ in Romania: a case study of housing inequality. | journal = Environment and Planning A | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 203–221 | url = http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a45718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eurostat, in 2011, 17.1% of EU population lived in overcrowded households by the above definition, with the number varying strongly between countries: the overcrowding rate stood at 43.1% in 12 newest member states compared to only 10.1% in 15 oldest members.&lt;ref name="Eurostat" /&gt; Within the EU post-communist states, the extent to which the [[commodification]] of housing has improved occupancy standards appeared to be modest. For instance, during 2005-2010 the percentage of overcrowded population in Romania and Latvia remained the highest in the EU (55%). Conversely, the Czech Republic showed the best performance in 2010, with overcrowding falling from 33% to 22% over the period, becoming lower than in Italy and Greece. In the remaining EU post-communist states, overcrowding fell moderately over the period, accounting for 35-49% in 2010.&lt;ref name="Eurostat"&gt;{{cite web | work = Eurostat | year = 2012 | title = Overcrowding rate by age, gender and poverty status - Total population | url =  http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=ilc_lvho05a&amp;lang=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifecycle has remained a powerful determinant of overcrowding. Eastern Europeans aged under 18 are on average 2.5 times more likely to experience overcrowding than those aged over 65. Affordability problems of young adults, who had to delay home leaving, contributed to unrelenting overcrowding, but so did the legacy of a housing stock composed of many small dwellings.&lt;ref name="envplan.com"/&gt; In the EU post-communist states, between 51-87% of dwellings had no more than three rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Eurostat | year = 2012 | title = Occupied conventional dwellings by number of rooms and occupants | url = http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=cens_01ndnbown&amp;lang=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
[[Sweden|Swedish]] statistics and politics have used three different definitions over the years:&lt;ref name="bov"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boverket.se/globalassets/publikationer/dokument/2004/trangboddhet_skillnaderna_kvarstar.pdf | title = Trångboddhet – skillnaderna kvarstår | trans-title = Overcrowding - the differences remain | language = Swedish | work = Många mål - få medel. Boverkets utvärdering av statliga stöd till bostadsbyggandet 1993-2004 | publisher = Boverket (Government housing agency) | date = December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class=wikitable style="text-align:center"
|-
! rowspan=2 | Definition
! rowspan=2 | Defined when
! rowspan=2 | Exempt from calculation
! rowspan=2 | Inhabitants&lt;br&gt;per bedroom
! colspan=5 | Percentage of households that are overcrowded
|-
! 1945 !! 1960 !! 1975 !! 1985 !! 2002
|-
| Norm 1 || 1940s || Kitchen, bathroom || 2 || 30% || 13% || 1% || - || -
|-
| Norm 2 || mid 1960s || Kitchen, bathroom, one living room || 2 || - || 43% || 7% || 4% || -
|-
| Norm 3 || 1974 || Kitchen, bathroom, one living room || 1 individual&lt;br&gt;or a couple || - || - || - || 15% || 15% 
|}

The most dramatic change took place according to "norm 2" between 1960 and 1975 because of the [[Million Programme]]. Of the households that are regarded as overcrowded according to "norm 3", two thirds are single persons living in 1-room apartments without a separate living room.

==Risks due to overcrowding==

==Education==
Wells was educated at [[Aston University|Birmingham College of Advanced Technology]]&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;{{Who's Who | surname = WELLS | othernames = Prof. Peter Neil Temple | id = U4000364 | volume = 2004 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Bristol]] where he was awarded his [[PhD]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

==Career and research==
Wells has made a number of notable contributions to the application of engineering and physics in medicine. He is the originator and developer of instruments for ultrasonic surgery and ultrasonic power measurement, as well as the two-dimensional, articulated-arm ultrasonic general purpose scanner and the water-immersion [[Mammography|ultrasonic breast scanner]].&lt;ref name=frs/&gt;

He demonstrated ultrasonic-pulsed Doppler range gating, and was the discoverer of the ultrasonic Doppler signal characteristic of malignant tumour [[neovascularisation]]. He investigated ultrasonic bioeffects and formulated ultrasonic safety guidelines and conditions for prudent use of ultrasonic diagnosis.&lt;ref name=frs/&gt;

Wells has led multidisciplinary studies of ultrasonic diagnosis and made major contributions to the advancement of light transmission, electrical impedance and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, as well as to interventional telepresence. He also proposed a novel philosophy of medical imaging. More recently, he has been developing ultrasonic [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] and phase-insensitive [[tomography]].&lt;ref name=frs/&gt;

A '''pharmacological chaperone''' (or '''pharmacoperone''', from "[[chaperone (protein)|protein chaperone]]") is a small [[molecule]] that enters cells and serves as a molecular scaffolding in order to cause otherwise-[[protein folding|misfolded]] mutant [[protein]]s to fold and route correctly within the cell.&lt;ref name=giz1312&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/pharmacoperones-drug-protein-misfolding/30074/ |title=Drugs to fix "misfolded" proteins could cure a range of diseases |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutation of proteins often causes molecular misfolding, which results in protein misrouting within the cell. Accordingly, mutant molecules may retain proper function but end up in parts of the cell where the function is inappropriate, or even deleterious, to cell function. Misfolded proteins are usually recognized by the quality-control system of the cell and retained (and often destroyed or recycled)in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name=giz1312/&gt;

Pharmacoperones correct the folding of misfolded proteins, allowing them to pass through the cell's quality-control system and become correctly routed.  Since mutations often cause disease by causing misfolding and misrouting, pharmacoperones are potentially therapeutic agents, since they are able to correct this defect.&lt;ref name=giz1312/&gt;

Diseases that may be susceptible to such treatments include [[diabetes]], inherited [[cataract]]s and [[cystic fibrosis]].&lt;ref name=giz1312/&gt;

==Examples==
* [[Migalastat]] is a pharmacological chaperone for the treatment of [[Fabry disease]].
* In 2013,  mice with a disease that makes the males unable to father offspring were cured by use of pharmacoperones.&lt;ref name=giz1312/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Janovick | first1 = J.

The '''Student Global AIDS Campaign (SGAC)''' is an advocacy group with more than 85 chapters at high schools, colleges, and universities across the United States. The group is committed to bringing an end to [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] in the U.S. and around the world, and uses a wide variety of tactics to achieve its goals, including education on campuses, letter-writing and calling campaigns to decision-makers, public demonstrations, media work, and other activist tactics.

The organization often describes its mission in the shorthand 'Fund the Fight, Treat the People, Drop the Debt, Stop the Spread'.  The fuller vision statement is: "We envision a world in which AIDS is no longer a death sentence, in which economics and geography do not determine access to life-saving drugs, and where every woman, man, and child has the knowledge, means, and rights to protect her- or himself from infection." The campaign has therefore pushed for access to [[antiretroviral drugs]], the elimination of [[third world debt]], reform of global trade rules, and access to [[condoms]].

==Major events &amp; recent successes==
*'''"Kick Coke Off Campus":''' SGAC joined with other AIDS activists to pressure [[Coca-Cola]] to treat its HIV+ workers in its African bottling plants
*'''Bake Sale for the [[Global Fund]]:''' where SGACers sold brownies for $1 billion in front of representatives' and senators' offices to try to raise the money Congress wasn’t giving to the Global Fund
*'''04.Stop.AIDS:''' a loose network of HIV and AIDS activists, many of them SGACers, who went to presidential candidates' events and asked pointed questions until every [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate adopted a progressive platform on global AIDS (President [[George W. Bush]] refused to talk with the activists or allow them into events)
*'''Student March Against AIDS:''' on February 26, 2005, SGAC held the second largest HIV and AIDS mobilization in U.S. history. More than 4,000 students and young people from around the country ralied together in DC for the Student March Against AIDS.
*'''Gilead Sciences Corporate Campaign:''' in spring 2006, SGAC took on its second corporate campaign, this time targeting the marketers of second-line AIDS drugs who had failed to make those medicines accessible to lower and middle income countries. The company [[Gilead Sciences]] eventually made major concessions to make its drug [[Tenofovir]] more available and allow generic competition.
*In the fall of 2006, SGAC began an expanded campaign focused on pushing for Universal Access to AIDS Treatment by the year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fightglobalaids.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==History &amp; founding==
In February 2001, the Student Global AIDS Campaign and its parent organization, [[Global Justice (organization)|Global Justice]], were founded simultaneously by students at [[Harvard]] and the [[Kennedy School of Government]] who saw the untapped potential of students to advocate political and social change on global HIV and AIDS and other issues of [[global justice]]. Global Justice became officially incorporated as a 501 (c)(3) organization, with the Student Global AIDS Campaign as its first campaign.

The first conference was a New England regional conference hosted by Harvard in the fall of 2001. That spring and the next fall regional conferences were also held at [[Indiana University]], the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and [[Williams College]]. In the spring of 2003, SGAC organized its first national conference (hosted by [[George Washington University]]), which was attended by more than 500 students from around the country.

As SGAC’s chapter base has grown so has its capacity for effective advocacy. SGAC’s first large rally was held in Boston in the spring of 2002 to demand that Senator [[John Kerry]] (who had declared himself the Senate AIDS leader) significantly increase the amount of funding for the Global Fund in the bill he was then writing.

==Structure==
SGAC is a youth- and student-led organization organized into chapters based at high schools or universities. There is a national Steering Committee (SC) of students from across the country. Elected by SGAC members for one-year terms, SC members deal with the day-to-day operation of the campaign and fill roles ranging from media coordination to outreach work.  Decisions are made by consensus.

==Global Justice==
The Student Global AIDS Campaign's parent organization, Global Justice, is also home to other student-led campaigns on global trade and child survival.  Global Justice also employs the staff that work on the Student Global AIDS Campaign, including a full-time national organizer, a shared executive director, and support/communications staff. Global Justice is governed by a board of directors which has included such activists and intellectuals as [[Jeffrey Sachs]], [[Paul Farmer]], and [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]] co-founder Eric Sawyer, as well as students from each of the group's campaigns.  There is also an emerging alumni group of previous leaders who have now graduated.

At the time, they used what was called the [[Plain old telephone system|plain-old-telephone-system]] (POTS). 

In the early nineteen nineties, videoconferencing, e-mail, [[fax]], and telephone calls were used but more recently , video conferencing and high-quality image transfer have become easily accessible. These, and the considerable improvements in digital camera technology, have provide radical new opportunities.  

Nearly a third of all Americans don’t visit a dentist regularly enough, according to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/oral-health-isnt-much-americans-concern-poll-finds-one-third-didnt-see-dentist-last-year-279468|title=Oral Health Isn't Much Of Americans' Concern, Poll Finds: One-Third Didn’t See The Dentist Last Year|date=2014-04-29|work=Medical Daily|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many reasons for this, most notably; affordability, access and fear.

[[File:Kallikaks deborah2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Goddard's book traced the genealogy of "Deborah Kallikak", a woman in his institution.]]

'''''The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness''''' was a 1912 book by the American [[psychology|psychologist]] and [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Henry H. Goddard]]. The work was an extended case study of Goddard's for the [[inheritance]] of "[[feeble-minded]]ness," a general category referring to a variety of mental disabilities including [[intellectual disability]], [[learning disabilities]], and [[mental illness]]. Goddard concluded that a variety of mental traits were hereditary and that society should limit reproduction by people possessing these traits.

The name Kallikak is a pseudonym used as a family name throughout the book. Goddard coined the name from the Greek words καλός (''kallos'') meaning good and κακός (''kakos'') meaning bad.&lt;ref&gt;Deutschmann, Linda B. ''Deviance &amp; Social Control'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Kallikaks chart1.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Goddard's Kallikak pedigree]]

== Summary ==

The book begins by discussing the case of "Deborah Kallikak" (real name Emma Wolverton, 1889–1978),&lt;ref name="Smith and Wehmeyer"&gt;J. David Smith and Michael L. Wehmeyer, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3987907/ Who Was Deborah Kallikak?] ''Intellectual and developmental disabilities'' '''50'''(2):169–178, 2012 | doi:10.1352/1934-9556-50.2.169.&lt;/ref&gt; a woman in Goddard's institution, the New Jersey Home for the Education and Care of Feebleminded Children (now [[Vineland Training School]]). In the course of investigating her [[genealogy]], Goddard claims to have discovered that her family tree bore a curious and surprising moral tale.

The book follows the genealogy of Martin Kallikak, Deborah's great-great-great grandfather, a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero married to a [[Quaker]] woman. On his way back from battle the normally morally upright Martin dallied one time with a "feeble-minded" barmaid. He impregnated her and then abandoned her. The young Martin soon reformed and went on with his upright life, becoming a respected New England citizen and father of a large family of prosperous individuals. All of the children that came from this relationship were "wholesome" and had no signs of developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, H. H. (1912). The Kallikak family: A study in the heredity of feeble mindedness.New York: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

But according to Goddard, a child was born by the dalliance with "the nameless feeble-minded girl". This single child, a male, called Martin Kallikak Jr. in the book (real name John Wolverton, 1776–1861&lt;ref name="Smith and Wehmeyer" /&gt;), went on to father more children, who fathered their own children, and on and on down the generations. And so with the Kallikaks, Goddard claims to have discovered, one has as close as one could imagine an experiment in the hereditability of intelligence, moral ability, and criminality.

On the "feeble-minded" side of the Kallikak family, descended from the abandoned single-parent barmaid, the children wound up poor, mentally ill, delinquent, and intellectually disabled.  Deborah was, in Goddard's assessment, "feeble-minded": a catch-all early 20th century term to describe various forms of intellectual or learning disabilities. Goddard was interested in the heritability of "feeble-mindedness"—and often wrote of the invisible threat of recessive "feeble-minded" genes carried by otherwise healthy and intelligent looking members of the population ([[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's laws]] had only been rediscovered a decade before; Goddard's genetic shorthand was, in its day, considered to be on par with cutting-edge science). It was in tracing the family history of Deborah that Goddard and his assistants discovered that Deborah's family of drunks and criminals was related—through Martin Kallikak—to another family tree of economy and prosperity.

[[File:Kallikaks sal.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A set of Kallikak children on the "feeble-minded" side of the family]]

On the "normal" side of the Kallikak family tree, the children Martin had with his wife and their descendants all ended up prosperous, intelligent, and morally upstanding. They were lawyers, ministers, and doctors. None were "feeble-minded". Goddard concluded from this that intelligence, sanity, and morality were [[hereditary]], and every effort should be undertaken to keep the 'feeble-minded' from procreating, with the overall goal of potentially ending 'feeble-mindedness' and its accompanying traits. The damage from even one dalliance between a young man and a "feeble-minded" woman could create generations and generations worth of crime and poverty, with its members eventually living off the generosity of the state (and consequently taxpayers), Goddard argued. His work contains intricately constructed family trees, showing near-perfect Mendelian ratios in the inheritance of negative and positive traits.

Goddard recommended segregating them in institutions, where they would be taught how to work various forms of menial labor.

== Present-day evaluation ==

[[File:Kallikaks ggrandson.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Two Kallikaks. It is possible that the boy was born with [[Down Syndrome]], a former name of the syndrome being mongolism.]]

In its day, ''The Kallikak Family'' was a tremendous success and went through multiple printings. It helped propel Goddard to the status of one of the nation's top experts in using [[psychology]] in policy, and along with the work of [[Charles B. Davenport]] and [[Madison Grant]] is considered one of the canonical works of early 20th-century American [[eugenics]].

Research published in 2001 by David MacDonald and Nancy McAdams revealed that Goddard's account of the division of the Kallikak family into a "good" lineage—descended from Martin Kallikak Sr. and his wife—and a "bad" lineage—descended from Martin Kallikak Sr. and an unnamed feeble-minded barmaid—was fictitious.&lt;ref name="Smith and Wehmeyer"/&gt; Martin Kallikak Jr., the supposedly illegitimate offspring of Martin Kallikak Sr. and the barmaid, was in fact the son of Gabriel Wolverton and his wife Catherine Murray.&lt;ref name="Smith and Wehmeyer"/&gt; His real name was John Wolverton (1776–1861), and he was a landowner prosperous enough to buy two tracts of land for cash in 1809. Census records of 1850 show that all the adults in his household (which included Wolverton, one daughter, and several grandchildren) were able to read. The "bad" side of the Kallikak family included poor farmers but also school teachers, an Army Air Corps pilot, and a bank treasurer.&lt;ref name="Smith and Wehmeyer"/&gt;

It has been argued that the effects of [[malnutrition]] were overlooked in the Kallikak family. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Goddard's peer, Davenport, even identified various forms of diseases now known to be caused by diet deficiencies as being hereditary.

[[File:Kallikaks sal-big.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A detail of faces from the book—[[Stephen Jay Gould]] alleged that Goddard had doctored them to make them look more sinister.]]

Another perspective has been offered that the Kallikaks almost certainly had undiagnosed [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Karp, R.J. (1993). Introduction: A history and overview of malnourished children in the United States. In R.J. Karp (Ed.), ''Malnourished Children in the United States: Caught in the Cycle of Poverty''. New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karp, R.J., Quazi, Q.H., Moller, K.A., Angelo, W.A., &amp; Davis, J.M. (1995). Fetal alcohol syndrome at the turn of the century: An unexpected explanation of the Kallikak family. ''Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine'', ''149(1)'', 45–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to poverty and malnourishment, prenatal alcohol exposure can create [[craniofacial]] and other physical anomalies that could account for their peculiar facial features.&lt;ref name="Streissguth"&gt;Streissguth, A.P. (1997). ''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: A Guide for Families and Communities''. Baltimore, MD: Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, prenatal alcohol exposure may also damage the [[central nervous system]], which can result in impaired [[cognitive]] and behavioral functioning similar to that described by Goddard.

=== Alteration of photographs ===
The paleontologist and science writer [[Stephen Jay Gould]] advanced the view that Goddard—or someone working with him—had retouched the photographs used in his book in order to make the "bad" Kallikaks appear more menacing. In older editions of the books, Gould said, it has become clearly evident that someone has drawn in darker, crazier looking eyes and menacing faces on the children and adults in the pictures. Gould argues that photographic reproduction in books was still then a very new art, and that audiences would not have been as keenly aware of photographic retouching, even on such a crude level. The 14 photos were subsequently studied further to show the nature of the retouching and subsequent use to help make Goddard's points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Elks |first=Martin A.|date=August 2005 |title=Visual indictment: a contextual analysis of the Kallikak family photographs |journal=Mental Retardation |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=268–280 |doi=10.1352/0047-6765(2005)43[268:VIACAO]2.0.CO;2 |pmid=16000027 |issn=0047-6765 |editor1-last=O'Brien |editor1-first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist R. E. Fancher, however, has claimed that retouching of faces of the sort which is apparent in Goddard's work was a common procedure at the time, in order to avoid a "washed out" look which was common to early photographic printing methods (poor halftones). Furthermore, Fancher argued, malicious editing on Goddard's part would take away from one of his primary claims: that only a trained eye can spot the moron in the crowd.

The overall effect of ''The Kallikak Family'' was to temporarily increase funding to institutions such as Goddard's, but these were not seen to be worthwhile solutions of the problem of "feeble-mindedness" (much less "rogue" "feeble-mindedness"—the threat of idiocy as a recessive trait), and more stringent methods, such as [[compulsory sterilization]] of people with intellectual disabilities, were undertaken.

The term "Kallikak" became, along with "[[Jukes family|Jukes]]" and "[[Nams]]" (other case studies of similar natures), a cultural shorthand for the rural poor in the South and Northeast United States.

In August 1977, [[NBC]] premiered a situation comedy called ''The Kallikaks'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075521/|title=The Kallikaks|publisher=|access-date=December 1, 2017|via=www.IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depicted the comic misadventures of an Appalachian family that moved to California and feuded with another family named the Jukes; the series lasted only five episodes. A June 8, 1987, cartoon in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' provided a further update to the concept, depicting "The Jukes and Kallikaks Today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://condenaststore.com/featured/the-jukes-and-the-kallikaks-today-roz-chast.html|title=The Jukes And The Kallikaks Today by Roz Chast|website=Conde Nast|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Radiology - Integrated Training Initiative ==
*[http://www.riti.org.uk RITI web site]

The Radiology – Integrated Training Initiative is a public-sector UK programme to provide an increased number of high-quality [[radiologists]] by 2008. 

R-ITI is a collaboration between the [[Royal College of Radiologists]], the UK [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and the [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]]. It is tasked with providing three new [[radiology]] academies, a national archive of peer-validated cases (Validated Case Archive), and over 1,000 [[e-learning]] sessions for self-paced learning &amp; knowledge acquisition.

==The reasoning==
The UK is currently not producing enough UK trained radiologists to meet clinical need. Calculations show that traditional training will not produce the necessary increase in numbers. Training schemes are becoming saturated and [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] training time is pressurised by heavy service workloads. 

The Radiology Integrated Training Initiative (R-ITI) has been created to respond to this need and develop a new approach to training radiologists, increasing capacity to meet demand without putting additional strain on current resources. 

Three academies have been established, one in [[Leeds]], one in [[Norwich]] at the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]] and one in [[Plymouth]]. A fourth academy has been announced in South Wales, to begin intake in August 2017. Each academy offers trainees access to: 
*computer linked e-learning sessions 
*the Validated Case Archive (VCA) where they can study images and films of actual cases alongside their pathologies and diagnoses 
*skills labs to practice practical techniques before going into clinics 
*library and tutorial/lecture room facilities 
*[http://www.nnuh.nhs.uk/page.asp?id=110 Norwich Radiology Academy Website]

==About Integrated Training Initiatives==
The Integrated Training Initiative (ITI) creates a stimulating learning environment by combining different teaching methods. These methods include: 
*[[e-learning]] 
*[[self-assessment]] using an archive of validated images (VCA) 
*formal assessments 
*skills labs 
*tutorials/lectures 
*clinical placements

==Key principles of an ITI==
*To use small groups and peer learning to enhance the learning experience 
*To use technology to extend and enhance the clinical learning environment 
*To reach larger numbers of trainees within the existing training structure 
*To extend the clinical environment by involving trainees in [[local service delivery]] 
*To provide more consistent training and effective resources

The '''Worth Four Light Test''', also known as the '''Worth's Four Dot test''' or '''W4LT''', is a clinical test  mainly used for assessing a patient's degree of [[binocular vision]] and binocular single vision. Binocular vision involves an image being projected by each eye simultaneously into an area in space and being fused into a single image. The Worth Four Light Test is also used in detection of [[Suppression (eye)|suppression]] of either the right or left eye. Suppression occurs during binocular vision when the brain does not process the information received from either of the eyes. This is a common adaptation to [[strabismus]], [[amblyopia]] and [[aniseikonia]].

The W4LT can be performed by the examiner at two distances, at near (at 33&amp;nbsp;cm from the patient) and at far (at 6m from the patient). At both testing distances the patient is required to wear red-green goggles (with one red lens over one eye, usually the right, and one green lens over the left) When performing the test at far (distance) the W4LT instrument is composed of a silver box (mounted on the wall in front of the patient), which has 4 lights inside it. The 4 lights are arranged in a diamond formation, with a red light at the top, two green lights at either side (left and right) and a white light at the bottom. When performing the test at near (at 33&amp;nbsp;cm ) the 4 lights are arranged in exactly the same manner (diamond formation), with the difference being that at near, the 4 lights are located in a hand held instrument which is similar to a light torch.

Because the red filter blocks the green light and the green filter blocks the red light, it is possible to determine if the patient is using both eyes simultaneously and in a coordinated manner. With both eyes open, a patient with normal binocular vision will appreciate four lights. If the patient either closes or suppresses an eye they will see either two or three lights. If the patient does not fuse the images of the two eyes, they will see five lights ([[diplopia]]).

==Indications for use==
[[File:Worth's Four Lights Test at distance.png|thumb|The Worth Four Light Test at a distance of 6 meters]]
The Worth Four Light Test is indicated for use when assessing the binocular functions, the ability of eyes to work in coordination, of an individual. It can be used to develop a diagnosis or to support or confirm an initial diagnosis. It can be used when wanting to assess whether the individual has a normal or abnormal [[Binocular vision|binocular single vision]] response (BSV). It can be used to establish whether a patient has the ability for the eyes to fuse the light that is received from each eye into 4 lights. The test is indicated with the use of a presence of a [[prism]] in individuals with a [[strabismus]] and fusion is considered present if 4 lights are maintained, with or without the use of a prism. The W4LT can also be indicated when aiding a person to develop and strengthen their fusional capacities.

If the images are unable to be fused the W4LT is still indicated to help to determine if an individual appreciates [[diplopia]] (double vision) or are [[Suppression (eye)|suppressing]] an image from one eye. In cases of manifest strabismus the test can help in determining the nature and type of the diplopia or which eye is suppressing.  Therefore, is indicated in cases of a suspected central suppression [[scotoma]] as it can be used to detect where the lights may not be appreciated from the eye with the scotoma though in some cases of minimal deviation in the eye as demonstrated in a [[Monofixation syndrome|microtropic deviation]] a normal response of 4 lights may be reported. Though it can be used in these patients to prove the presence of peripheral fusion and that they have bi-foveal fixation.

Other indications for the test include establishing an individual's dominant eye [[Ocular dominance|dominant eye]] compared to the other and when evaluating reduced monocular [[visual acuity]] which shows no improve on pinhole testing.
 
Whilst there are no contraindications of the W4LT there needs to be caution in interpreting the results of individuals with BSV in natural conditions as they may show a diplopic response under the dissociation of the test. Also in individuals who have [[abnormal retinal correspondence]] (ARC) they may provide an unexpected response, and those who have misaligned visual axis whom in natural conditions suppress may actually provide a diplopic response upon testing.

==Method of assessment==

The Worth Four Light Test is relatively simple to undertake. First you must place the red/green goggles over the patients eyes, with the red goggle traditionally placed over the right eye.
[[File:Red Green Goggles.png|thumb|Red Green Goggles used in the Worth Four Light Test]]
Next you must dim the room lighting. This allows the patient to see the lights better.

For a distance measurement, you should have the patient set up six metres away from the light source. For a near measurement, the test should be performed at approximately one third of a metre, or thirty three centimetres, with a handheld Worth’s Four Lights torch.
[[File:Worth's Four Light Test box in the dark.png|thumb|The Worth Four Light Test in dimmed lighting conditions]]
Then, ask the patient what they see. They should respond with “I see … number of lights” provided they have understood what you have asked them.
Ask them to describe the lights to you. You must ask about the colour of the lights. If they see five lights, ask whether the green dots are higher or lower than the red dots. Ask about the positioning of the dots, for example are the red dots to the left or the right of the green dots. Also ask if the dots are flashing on and off or switching between red and green.

This series of questions is essential in order to ensure you correctly record exactly what the patient is seeing, so that the clinician can interpret the patient’s results and then make an accurate diagnosis.

==Recording and interpreting outcomes==
When recording results for the W4LT it is important to ask the patient a series of questions in order to ensure you correctly record exactly what they are seeing. This is essential in order to interpret the patient’s results and then make an accurate diagnosis.

The questions are:
# How many lights are you seeing?
# What colour are they? Where are they located?
# Are all the lights in line? Or are some higher than the others?
# Do all the lights show up at one time, or are they flashing on and off?

When recording results it is important to indicate the test used, a description of the lights seen and an indication of what the result means. It is also important to note the distance at which the test was conducted and whether or not the patient wore their own refractive correction.

Where communication is difficult between clinician and patient, such as in the presence of a language barrier, or when working with a child, it may be a good idea to get the patient to draw what they are seeing. The clinician can then interpret the results from the image.

===Results===
There are a number of possible results demonstrated by a W4LT

====Normal retinal correspondence====
In the absence of a deviation, the patient will see the lights exactly as they appear. When questioned they will report that:
*	They see 4 lights, 1 red, 2 green and one mixed colour
*	The two green lights will be to either side with the red light slightly above them and the mixed coloured light below the red

This is recorded as :
W4LT (D): 4 lights (BSV)

====Abnormal retinal correspondence====
It will be demonstrated on cover test that the patient has a manifest deviation. When questioned about the lights the patient will give a normal response and will see the lights exactly as they appear.
They will report that:
*	They see 4 lights, 1 red, 2 green and one mixed colour
*	The two green lights will be to either side with the red light slightly above them and the mixed coloured light below the red

This is recorded as :
W4LT (D): 4 lights (ARC)

NB: [[Retinal correspondence|ARC]] can only be confirmed in conjunction with additional clinical tests for retinal correspondence. The patient must demonstrate a manifest deviation on cover test. Despite their apparent deviation, when tested with the W4LT they will produce a normal BSV result, indicating the presence of Abnormal Retinal Correspondence.

====Esotropia====
In an [[Esotropic]] (ET)  deviation, the patient will experience uncrossed diplopia. When questioned about the position of the lights, they will report that:
*	They see 5 lights, 2 red and 3 green
*	The lights are horizontally displaced, seen side by side
*	The 2 red lights from the right eye are seen on the right side
*	The 3 green lights from the left eye are seen on the left side

This is recorded as: W4LT (D): 5 lights (Uncrossed Diplopia) ET

NB: The clinician will be unable to indicate which eye is the deviating eye based on these results alone. The results should be interpreted with other clinical findings in order to produce a final diagnosis.

====Exotropia====
In an [[Exotropia|Exotropic]] (XT)  deviation, the patient will experience crossed diplopia.

When questioned about the position of the lights, they will report that:
* They see 5 lights, 2 Red and 3 Green
* The lights are horizontally displaced, and are seen side by side
* The 2 Red Lights from the Right eye are on the left side
* The  3 Green lights from the Left eye  are on the right side

This is recorded as:
W4LT (D): 5 lights (Crossed Diplopia) XT

NB: The clinician will be unable to indicate which eye is the deviating eye based on these results alone. The results should be interpreted with other clinical findings in order to produce a final diagnosis.

====Hypotropia/Hypertropia====
In cases of [[Hypertropia|vertical deviations]], patients will report that:
* They see 5 Lights, 2 Red and 3 Green
* The lights are vertically displaced in relation to one another
* The Green lights (Left eye) are on top of the Red lights (Right eye)
Which is interpreted as : R HT or LHypoT
* The Red lights (Right eye) are on top of the Green lights (Left eye)
Which is interpreted as:  RHypoT or L H T

This is recorded as: W4LT (D): 5 lights (Vertical Diplopia)

The clinician can relate the position of the lights directly back to the deviation and height of the eye (i.e.) the higher lights belong to the higher eye, and the lower lights belong to the lower eye

NB: If the lights are not situated directly above one another, but are also separated horizontally, it is normally indicative of a mixed deviation where there is a horizontal, as well as vertical strabismus present

====Suppression====
In cases of manifest strabismus, it is not always expected that the patient will experience diplopia.

[[Suppression (eye)|Suppression]] is indicated when the patient reports that:
* They see only the 3 Green lights from the Left eye
Which is interpreted as R Suppression
* They see only the 2 Red lights from the Right eye
Which is interpreted as L Suppression
* They see 2 Red lights OR 3 Green lights
All 5 lights are never present at the same time, but the patient is switching between the two responses.
This result is interpreted as Alternating Suppression

This can be recorded as:

W4LT (D): 3 Lights (R Supp.)

W4LT (D): 2 Lights (L Supp.)

W4LT (D): 2 or 3 Lights (Alt. Supp.)

==Advantages and disadvantages==
'''Advantages '''
* Can be quick and simple to perform in the clinic as the test is easy to orientate and the red green goggles are simply put over the eyes. There is no turning of lenses, as in [[Bagolini Striated Glasses Test]] which is another test measuring binocular functions, making the interpretation of the results less complicated
* There are no large glasses frames such as in the Bagolini striated glasses test so the goggles are minimally obstructive to the patient's vision&lt;ref name="RG2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roper-Hall |first1=Gill |title=The 'Worth' of the Worth Four Dot Test |journal=American Orthoptic Journal |date=2004 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=112–119 |doi=10.3368/aoj.54.1.112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Glasses|Refractive correction]] can be worn under the goggles &lt;ref&gt;Volume 1, Chapter 9. Sensory Tests and Treatment of Binocular Vision. (n.d.). Duane's Ophthalmology on CD-ROM, 2006 edition. Retrieved October 23, 2014, from http://www.eyecalcs.com/DWAN/pages/v1/v1c009.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Good starting point when investigating the nature of [[diplopia]] i.e. to find manifest, intermittent, crossed or uncrossed diplopia
* It is less dissociative than a [[cover test]]&lt;ref name="RG2004" /&gt;
* Can be used to determine if a patient will demonstrate [[Binocular vision|binocular single vision]] with corrective [[prism]] or head posture&lt;ref name="RG2004" /&gt;
* Relatively easy to record and interpret the results

'''Disadvantages'''
* Subjective in nature and relies on patient responses
* The patient must have fusion and [[stereopsis]] to get accurate results
* It is a highly dissociative test resulting in responses being less relevant to what the patient sees in their normal daily environment, as the environment would normally be different &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arthur|first1= B. W.|last2= Marshall|first2= A.|last3=McGillivray|first3= D. |date=1993|title= Worth vs Polarise Four-Dot Test|journal= Journal of Paediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|volume= 30|issue=1|pages= 53-55}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
# A. Lights need to be off or dimmed in order to see the dots / lights

# B. There is no common colour to fuse

# C. Dark filters in the goggles are used and are less like natural conditions and therefore less relevant to what the patient sees in their normal daily environment
* People with Red/green [[Color blindness|colour blindness]] cannot accurately perform the test as the colours used on the test are red and green 
* The test results are only useful in combination with other testing and results and not on their own
* If performing the test twice, for example at near and at distance, the patient (especially children) may remember their previous answer and simply give the same answer from the last test, providing inaccurate results&lt;ref name="RG2004" /&gt;
