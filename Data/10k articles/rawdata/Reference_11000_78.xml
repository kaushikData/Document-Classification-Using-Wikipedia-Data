'''''A Linguistic Atlas of Early Middle English''''' ('''LAEME''') is a digital, [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]]-driven, historical [[dialect]] resource for [[Early Middle English]] (1150–1325).  LAEME combines a searchable Corpus of Tagged Texts (CTT), an Index of Sources, and [[Dot distribution map|dot maps]] showing the distribution of textual dialect features.  LAEME is headed by the University of Edinburgh's Margaret Laing, and includes contributions from Roger Lass (University of Cape Town), and web-scripts by Keith Williamson, Vasilis Karaiskos (University of Edinburgh) and Sherrylyn Branchaw (University of California, LA).

Dating from 1987, a year after the publication of ''A Linguistic Atlas of Late Medieval English'' (LALME),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ihd/elalme/elalme.html|title=A Linguistic Late Mediaeval English, v. 1.0|website=www.lel.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; LAEME's parent project, LAEME builds on medieval dialect methodologies developed for LALME, but parts ways with the latter by employing [[corpus linguistics]] methods.  In its present form, such methods include the [[Part-of-speech tagging|lexico-grammatical tagging]] of a select but comprehensive Early Middle English corpus, to which an ongoing project will add [[Parsing|syntactic parsing]] (see Parsed Linguistic Atlas of Early Middle English P-LAEME).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amc.lel.ed.ac.uk/?page_id=1357|title=P-LAEME: A Parsed Linguistic Atlas of Early Middle English – Angus McIntosh Centre for Historical Linguistics|website=www.amc.lel.ed.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public access to a fully tagged, syntactically annotated corpus should provide unprecedented scope for phonological, lexico-grammatical, semantic, pragmatic as well as dialectal inquiry into a period marked by rapid linguistic change but also by a paucity of surviving texts.  At the lexical level, further scope is added by ''A Corpus of Narrative Etymologies'' (CoNE, Version 1.1, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ihd/CoNE/CoNE.html|title=Corpus of Narrative Etymologies|last=Williamson|first=Roger Lass, Margaret Laing, Rhona Alcorn, Keith|website=www.lel.ed.ac.uk|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CoNE derives a Corpus of Changes (CC) from LAEME's Corpus of Tagged Texts (CTT), giving relative chronologies of lexical forms annotated by Special Codes.  CoNE's narrative etymologies are not based on semantic backtracking through cognates, but on the processual narrative of word forms through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lass|first=Robert|date=|title=A Corpus of Narrative Etymologies from Proto-Old English to Early Middle English (CoNE) and accompanying Corpus of Changes (CC)|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ihd/CoNE/DOCS/CoNEIntroduction.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Prior to the advent of modern linguistics, medieval philologists had sought to describe patterns of linguistic variation on the basis of literary language.  This approach posed significant problems, as literary language was and is more likely to be imitative, archaizing, or syncretic than everyday documentary language.  Texts composed in a literary tradition or copied from literary exemplars, then, are not ideal for use in reconstructing the distribution of dialect features for a given period.  Nevertheless, to take the most famous Middle English instance, J.R.R. Tolkien was able to conjecture the [[AB language|AB literary dialect]] by comparing manuscripts of the [[Katherine Group]] ("B") and the [[Ancrene Wisse]] ("A").  Drawing on his personal knowledge of Old English and Old Norse, while counting and cataloging thousands of verbs by hand, Tolkien argued for a regional literary standard localized to north-west Herefordshire that preserved Old English elements into the 13th century.  His culminating philological essay, [[Ancrene Wisse and Hali Meiðhad]] (1929), has been called "one of the great triumphs of English philology" but also "philology's last gasp."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drout|first=Michael D.C.|date=2007|title=Tolkien’s medieval scholarship and its significance|url=https://doi.org/10.1353/tks.2007.0013|journal=Tolkien Studies|volume=4|pages=113–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decade after this pioneering work, Middle English dialect studies went on generational hiatus.  LALME, whose initial stages date to 1952, ushered in the next phase.  Motivated by strong arguments for scribal normalization, historical [[Dialectology|dialectologists]] were no longer constrained by the unevenness of scribal fidelity.  Medieval dialect studies would now rely on the relative consistency of scribal translation into a scribe's own language, while developing techniques for discriminating source from scribe.  Angus McIntosh, one of LALME's compilers, "observed that most copied Middle English texts were...in language that was dialectally homogeneous,",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; suggesting scribal conversion of exemplar language into local varieties.  Problematically, though, such varieties might not reflect the geographic areas of composition, since scribes often traveled to copying centers from far afield.  This and other problems arising from the diversity of scribal practices (e.g. literam, or literal, and [[Mixed language|mischsprache]], or mixed-language copying) placed a premium on texts of explicit local provenance to anchor dialectal domains.  Such anchor texts, often correspondence or legal documents, form the basis of LALME's fit-technique.  Larry Benskin, another LALME compiler, describes the fit-technique as a "mechanical means of discovering whereabouts in the continuum of accents [an] unfamiliar accent belongs."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benskin|first=Michael|date=1991|title=The 'fit'-technique explained|url=|journal=Regionalism in Late Medieval Manuscripts and Texts: Essays Celebrating the Publication of A Linguistic Atlas of Late Medieval English|volume=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is done by comparing word forms in texts of uncertain origin against like forms attested in the anchor matrix, a comparison which "depends on the progressive elimination of the areas to which the individual elements of the accent do ''not'' belong."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Only frequently attested items of particular dialectal salience are so compared.  In the case of LALME, these items were solicited through text questionnaires later converted into Linguistic Profiles (LPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ihd/elalme/intros/atlas_gen_intro.html|title=A Linguistic Atlas of Late Medieval English: General Introduction, 2.1|last=McIntosh|first=Angus|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Questionnaires were not deemed practicable in LAEME's case, since the amount of linguistic information desired from comparatively fewer, comparatively fragmentary texts would have made them unwieldy.  Instead, LAEME opted for corpus digitization.

==Corpus and tools==

The period covered by LAEME is of prime grammatical and phonological interest, as the language was undergoing widespread [[Old English grammar|inflectional loss from OE]] but at different rates in different regions.  Variation within phonological categories and inflectional paradigms possess dialectal and base-grammatical significance.  Emergent orthography of phonetically-variable characters [[yogh]], [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]] and [[Eth|edh]] index other changes in the language.  Scribes during this period show a proportionally higher preference for literam and mixed-language copying, resulting in a higher proportion of composite texts compared to later periods.  Relict usage, where older exemplar forms remain unmodified in a translated text, and constrained selection, where exemplar forms are maintained because of scribal familiarity, pose additional problems for dialectal discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ihd/laeme2/laeme_intro_ch1.html|title=LAEME Introduction Chapter 1, 1.4|last=Laing|first=Margaret|date=|website=www.lel.ed.ac.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students of the period must also take into account its pronounced text/speech [[diglossia]], with the majority of texts composed in Latin or French.  Because LAEME's anchor matrix is thin and patchy, its dialectal fits are informed approximations subject to revision.  LAEME's texts overall are geographically and temporally uneven, extremely sparse for its first half-century and for Northern varieties in general, much denser for Southern varieties and through its latter half-century, where it begins to overlap with LALME.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The above complexities and complications have obliged LAEME's architects to build the atlas around a digitized corpus of lexico-grammatically tagged texts that can be searched and compared according to the research needs of users.  Instead of creating Linguistic Profiles from questionnaire responses, text dictionaries - taxonomical inventories of each text language -  are derived from tagged texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ihd/laeme2/laeme_intro_ch1.html|title=A Linguistic Atlas of Early Middle English: Introduction, Chapter 1.5.5|last=Laing|first=Margaret|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Independent searchability multiplies LAEME's usages across disciplines, as scholars and researchers can generate their own Form and Tag Dictionaries, Feature Maps, and Concordances.  LAEME surpasses its remit as a dialect resource by offering a suite of multi-function linguistic tools for public use.  This versatility accords with Angus McIntosh's progressive vision for LALME, which he saw as "more likely to benefit those concerned with the literature and culture and social structure of medieval England than those primarily concerned with...linguistics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McIntosh|first=Angus|date=1991|title=Some thoughts on medieval dialectology|url=|journal=Regionalism in Late Medieval Manuscripts and Texts: Essays Celebrating the Publication of A Linguistic Atlas of Late Medieval English|volume=|pages=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a multi-function LAEME tool is the Concordance.  Users begin by selecting a tag type (suffixes, grammatical words, inflection, lexis), entering a search string, and then a position limiter (initial, medial, final).  This search is followed by a filter set allowing users to specify counties, number of words to precede and/or proceed the search string, and sorting parameters (form, tag, date, file).  Finally, users may select specific tagged forms generated by the search.  Entries in the resulting concordance link to manuscript descriptions and to corresponding text dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ihd/laeme2/laeme2_framesZ.html|title=LAEME|publisher=School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences |date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users are able to view contextualized instances of items indexed to coded sources available in several file types.  Similar processes can be used to create Tag and Form Dictionaries with frequency counts, and to generate Feature Maps.

'''Acculturation''' is the process of social, psychological, and [[cultural change]] that stems from blending between cultures. The effects of acculturation can be seen at multiple levels in both the original (native) and newly adopted (host) [[cultures]].

Historically speaking, acculturation is a direct change of one's culture through [[dominance hierarchy|dominance]] over another's culture through either military or political conquest.

At this group level, acculturation often results in changes to culture, customs, religious practices, diet, healthcare, and other social institutions. Some of the most noticeable group level effects of acculturation often include changes in [[food]], [[clothing]], and [[language]].

At the individual level, the process of acculturation refers to the socialisation process by which foreign-born individuals adopt the values, customs, norms, attitudes, and behaviours of the dominant host culture. This process has been linked to changes in daily [[behaviour]], as well as numerous changes in [[Psychology|psychological]] and physical well-being. As [[enculturation]] is used to describe the process of first-culture learning, acculturation can be thought of as second-culture [[learning]].

Scholars in different disciplines have developed more than 100 different theories of acculturation,&lt;ref name="Rudmin" /&gt; but the concept of acculturation has only been studied scientifically since 1918.&lt;ref name="Rudmin"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rudmin | first=Floyd W. | title=Critical history of the acculturation psychology of assimilation, separation, integration, and marginalization. | journal=Review of General Psychology | year=2003 | url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/1089-2680.7.1.3 | volume=7 | issue=1 | page=3 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.7.1.3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; As it has been approached at different times from the fields of [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]], numerous theories and definitions have emerged to describe elements of the acculturative process. Despite definitions and evidence that acculturation entails a two-way process of change, research and theory have primarily focused on the adjustments and adaptations made by minorities such as [[immigrants]], [[refugees]], and [[indigenous peoples]] in response to their contact with the dominant majority. Contemporary research has primarily focused on different strategies of acculturation, how variations in acculturation affect individuals, and interventions to make this process easier.

==Historical approaches==
Although the word "acculturation" was coined by [[J.W. Powell]] in 1880,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Powell | first=John Wesley | title=Introduction to the study of Indian languages, with words, phrases, and sentences to by collected | year=1877 | url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontost00powellj | location=Washington, DC | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | oclc=11484928 | edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest record of acculturation can be found in [[Sumer]]ian inscriptions from 2370 B.C. These inscriptions laid out rules for commerce and interaction with foreigners designed to limit acculturation and protect traditional cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author=Gadd, C. J. | year=1971 | title=Code of Hammurabi | editor-first=W. E. | editor-last=Preece | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | volume=11 |pages=41–43 | location=Chicago | publisher=William Benton}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] also discussed acculturation, arguing that it should be avoided, as he thought it would lead to social disorder. Accordingly, he proposed that no one should travel abroad until they are at least 40 years of age, and that travelers should be restricted to the ports of cities to minimize contact with native citizens.&lt;ref name="Rudmin"/&gt; Nevertheless, the history of [[Western civilization]], and in particular the histories of Europe and the United States, are largely defined by patterns of acculturation.

One of the most notable forms of acculturation is [[imperialism]], the most common predecessor of direct cultural change. Although these cultural changes may seem simple, the combined results are both robust and complex, impacting both groups and individuals from the original culture and the host culture.

The first psychological theory of acculturation was proposed in [[W.I. Thomas]] and [[Florian Znaniecki]]'s 1918 study, ''[[W.I. Thomas#The Polish Peasant in Europe and America|The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]]''. From studying Polish immigrants in Chicago, they illustrated three forms of acculturation corresponding to three personality types: Bohemian (adopting the host culture and abandoning their culture of origin), Philistine (failing to adopt the host culture but preserving their culture of origin), and creative-type (able to adapt to the host culture while preserving their culture of origin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thomas | first=William Isaac |author2=Znaniecki, Florian | title=The Polish peasant in Europe and America: monograph of an immigrant group | year=1919 | publisher=The University of Chicago Press | url=https://books.google.com/?id=akchAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=GBS.PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Redfield, Linton, and Herskovits provided the first widely used definition of acculturation as:
{{quote|Those phenomena which result when groups of individuals having different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact, with subsequent changes in the original cultural patterns of either or both groups...under this definition acculturation is to be distinguished from...[[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]], which is at times a phase of acculturation.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Redfield | first=Robert |author2=Linton, Ralph|author3= Herskovits, Melville J. | title=Memorandum for the Study of Acculturation | journal=American Anthropologist | year=1936 | volume=38 | issue=1 | pages=149–152 | doi=10.1525/aa.1936.38.1.02a00330 | jstor=662563}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Long before efforts toward racial and cultural integration in the United States arose, the main course of action was [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. In 1954, [[Milton Gordon]]'s book ''Assimilation in American Life'' outlined seven stages of the assimilative process, setting the stage for literature on this topic. Later, Young Yun Kim authored a reiteration of Gordon's work, but argued cross-cultural adaptation as a multi-staged process. Kim's theory focused on the unitary nature of psychological and social processes and the reciprocal functional personal environment interdependence.&lt;ref name="kim2005"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (2005). Adapting to a New Culture. In Gudykunst, W (Ed.), Theorizing about intercultural communication. [[Thousand Oaks, California]]: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this view was the earliest to fuse micro-psychological and macro-social factors into an integrated theory, it is clearly focused on assimilation rather than racial or ethnic integration. In Kim's approach, assimilation is unilinear and the sojourner must conform to the majority group culture in order to be "communicatively competent."  According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) &lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst, W. &amp; Kim, Y. Y.). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; the "cross-cultural adaptation process involves a continuous interplay of deculturation and acculturation that brings about change in strangers in the direction of assimilation, the highest degree of adaptation theoretically conceivable."  This view has been heavily criticized, since the biological science definition of [[adaptation]] refers to the random mutation of new forms of life, not the convergence of a monoculture (Kramer, 2003).

Thus, the term adaptation is used by Gudykunst and Kim to mean conformity to the coercive power (pp.&amp;nbsp;360, 371) or "mainstream culture". According to this definition, any attempt to maintain one's original values, beliefs, ways of thinking, feelings, or behaviors constitutes mental illness or "maladaptation" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  This is further emphasized by Gudykunst and Kim (2003), stating that the way of "upward-forward" evolution toward functional fitness and psychological health is for the newcomer to willfully "unlearn" and "deculturize" themselves (p.&amp;nbsp;380).  Gudykunst and Kim proposed both psychotherapy and abandonment of all ethnic relations and associations with ethnic ties to help immigrants achieve "integrative" conformity (2003).  Again, this is not integration but rather dissolution of the newcomer's original identity. According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003), increased disintegration is preferred, even if it leads to extreme [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] for the [[immigrant]]. Ironically, Gudykunst and Kim seemed to identify the concept of acculturative stress stating "even extreme mental illness [caused by "conformity pressure" p.&amp;nbsp;371] can be viewed as a process of a potentially positive disintegration that will be reintegrated with new material at a higher level" (p.&amp;nbsp;381).

No matter how unjust or cruel, Gudykunst and Kim (2003) argue that the host's way of thinking, feeling, and behaving constitutes the "higher level" of psychic evolution and any resistance to conform indicates that the immigrant is communicatively incompetent, immature, mentally ill (pp.&amp;nbsp;365, 372-373, 376, 381), weak (p.&amp;nbsp;369), irrationally aggressive or hostile (pp.&amp;nbsp;371, 376), lacking in self-control (p.&amp;nbsp;369), cynical (p.&amp;nbsp;380), pessimistic (p.&amp;nbsp;369), closed-minded (p.&amp;nbsp;369), simple minded (pp.&amp;nbsp;382–383) and "ethnocentric" (pp.&amp;nbsp;376, 382).  Evolutionary progress for the individual requires the individual to "abandon identification with the cultural patterns that have constituted who one is and what one is" (p.&amp;nbsp;377).

In contradistinction from Gudykunst and Kim's version of adaptive evolution, Eric M. Kramer developed his theory of Cultural Fusion (2011,&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, E. M. (2011). Preface. In Croucher, S. M. &amp; Cronn-Mills, D., ''[http://erickramer.net/download/papers/Kramer2011-Praface%20for%20Religious%20Misperceptions.pdf Religious misperceptions: The case of Muslims and Christians in France and Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426062147/http://erickramer.net/download/papers/Kramer2011-Praface%20for%20Religious%20Misperceptions.pdf |date=2012-04-26 }}''.

According to Kramer, assimilation involves conformity to a pre-existing form. Kramer's (2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2003, 2009, 2011) theory of Cultural Fusion, which is based on systems theory and [[hermeneutics]], argues that it is impossible for a person to unlearn themselves and that by definition, "growth" is not a zero sum process that requires the disillusion of one form for another to come into being but rather a process of learning new languages and cultural repertoires (ways of thinking, cooking, playing, working worshiping, and so forth).  In other words, Kramer argues that one need not unlearn a language in order to learn a new one, nor does one have to unlearn who one is in order to learn new ways of dancing, cooking, talking and so forth.  Unlike Gudykunst and Kim (2003), Kramer argues that this blending of language and culture results in cognitive complexity, or the ability to switch between cultural repertoires. To put Kramer's ideas simply, learning is growth rather than unlearning.

==Conceptual models==
===Kramer===

Although numerous models of acculturation exist, the most complete models take into consideration the changes occurring at the group and individual levels of both interacting groups.&lt;ref name="Berry2003"&gt;{{cite book | author=Berry, J.W. | chapter=Conceptual approaches to acculturation | editor-last=Chun | editor-first=Kevin M. | editor2=Organista, Pamela Balls | editor3=Marín, Gerardo | title=Acculturation: Advances in Theory, Measurement, and Applied Research | date=January 2003 | publisher=AmericanPsychological Association | isbn=9781557989208 | pages=17–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; To understand acculturation at the group level, one must first look at the nature of both cultures before coming into contact with one another. A useful approach is Eric Kramer's{{Sfnm|Kramer|1998|Kramer|1992|Kramer|1997a|Kramer|2003|Kramer|2011|Kramer|2012}} theory of Dimensional Accrual and Dissociation (DAD). Two fundamental premises in Kramer's DAD theory are the concepts of [[hermeneutics]] and semiotics, which infer that identity, meaning, communication, and learning all depend on differences or variance. According to this view, total assimilation would result in a monoculture void of personal identity, meaning, and communication.{{Sfnm|Kramer|1992|Kramer|1997a|Kramer|2003}} Kramer's DAD theory also utilizes concepts from several scholars, most notably [[Jean Gebser]] and [[Lewis Mumford]], to synthesize explanations of widely observed cultural expressions and differences.

Kramer's theory identifies three communication styles (''idolic'', ''symbolic'', or ''signalic'' ) in order to explain [[cultural differences]]. It is important to note that in this theory, no single mode of communication is inherently superior, and no final solution to intercultural conflict is suggested. Instead, Kramer puts forth three integrated theories: the theory Dimensional Accrual and Dissociation, the Cultural Fusion Theory{{Sfnm|Kramer|1997a|Kramer|2010|Kramer|2000a|Kramer|2003|Kramer|2011|Kramer|2012}} and the Cultural Churning Theory.{{Sfnm|Kramer|1997a|Kramer|2003|Kramer|2011|Kramer|2012}}

For instance, according to Kramer's DAD theory, a statue of a god in an ''idolic'' community literally is god, and stealing it is a highly punishable offense.{{Sfnm|Kramer|1992|Kramer|1997a|Kramer|2003|Kramer|2011|Kramer|2012}} For example, many people in India believe that statues of the god [[Ganesh]] – to take such a statue/god from its temple is more than theft, it is blasphemy. ''Idolic'' reality involves strong emotional identification, where a holy relic does not simply symbolize the sacred, ''it is'' sacred. By contrast, a [[crucifix|Christian crucifix]] follows a ''symbolic'' nature, where it represents a symbol of God. Lastly, the ''signalic'' modality is far less emotional and increasingly dissociated.

Kramer refers to changes in each culture due to acculturation as ''co-evolution''.{{sfn|Kramer|2009}} Kramer also addresses what he calls the ''qualities of out vectors'' which address the nature in which the former and new cultures make contact.{{sfn|Kramer|2010}} Kramer uses the phrase "interaction potential" to refer to differences in individual or group acculturative processes. For example, the process of acculturation is markedly different if one is entering the host as an immigrant or as a refugee. Moreover, this idea encapsulates the importance of how receptive a host culture is to the newcomer, how easy is it for the newcomer to interact with and get to know the host, and how this interaction affects both the newcomer ''and'' the host.

===Fourfold models===
The fourfold model is a bilinear model that categorizes acculturation strategies along two dimensions. The first dimension concerns the retention or rejection of an individual's minority or native culture (i.e. "Is it considered to be of value to maintain one's identity and characteristics?"), whereas the second dimension concerns the adoption or rejection of the dominant group or host culture. ("Is it considered to be of value to maintain relationships with the larger society?") From this, four acculturation strategies emerge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Berry | first=John W. | title=Immigration, Acculturation, and Adaptation | journal=[[Applied Psychology (journal)|Applied Psychology]] | publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] | year=1997 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-0597.1997.tb01087.x/pdf | volume=46 | issue=1 | page=10 | doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.1997.tb01087.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Cultural assimilation|Assimilation]]''' occurs when individuals adopt the cultural norms of a dominant or host culture, over their original culture.
*'''[[Racial separation|Separation]]''' occurs when individuals reject the dominant or host culture in favor of preserving their culture of origin. Separation is often facilitated by immigration to [[ethnic enclaves]].
*'''[[Racial integration|Integration]]''' occurs when individuals are able to adopt the cultural norms of the dominant or host culture while maintaining their culture of origin. Integration leads to, and is often synonymous with [[biculturalism]].
*'''[[Marginalization]]''' occurs when individuals reject both their culture of origin and the dominant host culture.

Studies suggest that individuals' respective acculturation strategy can differ between their private and public life spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Arends-Tóth | first=Judit |author2=van de Vijver, Fons J. R. | title=Domains and dimensions in acculturation: Implicit theories of Turkish–Dutch | journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations | date=February 2004 | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=19–35 | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2003.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, an individual may reject the values and norms of the dominant culture in his private life (separation), whereas he might adapt to the dominant culture in public parts of his life (i.e., integration or assimilation).

===Predictors of acculturation strategies===
The fourfold models used to describe individual attitudes of immigrants parallel models used to describe group expectations of the larger society and how groups should acculturate.&lt;ref name="SamBerry"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sam|first=David L.|author2=Berry, John W.|date=1 July 2010|title=Acculturation When Individuals and Groups of Different Cultural Backgrounds Meet|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=5|issue=4|page=472|doi=10.1177/1745691610373075}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[melting pot]] society, in which a harmonious and homogenous culture is promoted, assimilation is the endorsed acculturation strategy. In [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] society, in which humans are separated into racial groups in daily life, a separation acculturation strategy is endorsed. In a [[Multiculturalism|multiculturalist]] society, in which multiple cultures are accepted and appreciated, individuals are encouraged to adopt an integrationist approach to acculturation. In societies where cultural exclusion is promoted, individuals often adopt marginalization strategies of acculturation.

Attitudes towards acculturation, and thus the range of acculturation strategies available, have not been consistent over time. For example, for most of American history, policies and attitudes have been based around established ethnic hierarchies with an expectation of one-way assimilation for predominantly White [[European immigrants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Fredrickson, G.M. | year=1999 | url=http://www.uhd.edu/academic/colleges/humanities/english/documents/Frederickson.pdf | chapter=Models of American Ethnic Relations: A Historical Perspective | editor1-first=D. | editor1-last=Prentice | editor2-first=D. | editor2-last=Miller|title=Cultural divides: The social psychology of inter-group contact | pages=23–45 | location=New York | publisher=Russell Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the notion of [[cultural pluralism]] has existed since the early 20th century, the recognition and promotion of multiculturalism did not become prominent in America until the 1980s. Separatism can still be seen today in autonomous religious communities such as the [[Amish]] and the [[Hutterites]]. Immediate environment also impacts the availability, advantage, and selection of different acculturation strategies. As individuals immigrate to unequal segments of society, immigrants to areas lower on economic and ethnic hierarchies may encounter limited social mobility and membership to a disadvantaged community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zhou | first=Min | title=Segmented Assimilation: Issues, Controversies, and Recent Research on the New Second Generation | journal=International Migration Review | year=1997 | jstor=2547421 | volume=31 | issue=4 | pages=975–1008 | doi=10.2307/2547421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a broad scale study, involving immigrants in 13 immigration-receiving countries, the experience of discrimination was positively related to the maintenance of the immigrants' ethnic culture.&lt;ref name=berry2006&gt;{{cite journal | last=Berry | first=John W. |author2=Phinney, Jean S.|author3= Sam, David L.|author4= Vedder, Paul | title=Immigrant Youth: Acculturation, Identity, and Adaptation | journal=Applied Psychology | year=2006 | volume=55 | issue=3 | pages=303–332 | doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.2006.00256.x | url=http://www.pedocs.de/volltexte/2012/6943/pdf/Berry_Phinney_Sam_Vedder_Immigrant_youth.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, immigrants that maintain their cultural practices and values are more likely to be discriminated against than those whom abandon their culture.

It should also be noted that most individuals show variation in both their ideal and chosen acculturation strategies across different domains of their lives. For example, among immigrants, it is often easier and more desired to acculturate to their host society's attitudes towards politics and government, than it is to acculturate to new attitudes about religion, principles, and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Navas | first=Marisol |author2=García, María C.|author3= Sánchez, Juan|author4= Rojas, Antonio J.|author5= Pumares, Pablo|author6= Fernández, Juan S. | title=Relative Acculturation Extended Model (RAEM): New contributions with regard to the study of acculturation | journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations | date=January 2005  | volume=29 | issue=1 | pages=28–29 | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2005.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acculturative stress==
The large flux of migrants around the world has sparked scholarly interest in acculturation, and how it can specifically affect health by altering levels of stress, access to health resources, and attitudes towards health.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The effects of acculturation on physical health is thought to be a major factor in the [[immigrant paradox]], which argues that first generation immigrants tend to have better health outcomes than non-immigrants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although this term has been popularized, most of the academic literature supports the opposite conclusion, or that immigrants have poorer health outcomes than their host culture counterparts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

One prominent explanation for the negative health behaviors and outcomes (e.g. [[substance abuse|substance use]], [[low birth weight]]) associated with the acculturation process is the ''acculturative stress theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ausubel | first=David P. | title=Acculturative Stress in Modern Maori Adolescence | journal=Child Development | date=December 1960 | jstor=1126010 | volume=31 | issue=4 | pages=617–631 | doi=10.2307/1126010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Acculturative stress]] refers to the stress response of immigrants in response to their experiences of acculturation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berry2006" /&gt; Stressors can include but are not limited to the pressures of learning a new language, maintaining one's native language, balancing differing cultural values, and brokering between native and host differences in acceptable social behaviors. Acculturative stress can manifest in many ways, including but not limited to anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and other forms of mental and physical maladaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Berry, J.W. | chapter=Stress perspectives on acculturation | editor-first=D.L. | editor-last=Sam | editor2-first=J.W. | editor2-last=Berry | title=The Cambridge Handbook of Acculturation Psychology | location=Cambridge | year=2006 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=9780521849241 | pages=43–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis, Carlo, Schwartz, Unger, Zamboanga, Lorenzo-Blanco &amp; Martinez|first=|date=2016|title=The longitudinal associations between discrimination, depressive symptoms, and prosocial behaviors in US Latino/a recent immigrant adolescents.|url=|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=45 |issue=3|pages=457–470|via=|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0394-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress caused by acculturation has been heavily documented in phenomenological research on the acculturation of a large variety of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Skuza | first=Jennifer A. | title=Humanizing the Understanding of the Acculturation Experience with Phenomenology | journal=Human Studies | date=1 December 2007 | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=451–463 | doi=10.1007/s10746-007-9073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research has shown that acculturation is a "fatiguing experience requiring a constant stream of bodily energy," and is both an "individual and familial endeavor" involving "enduring loneliness caused by seemingly insurmountable language barriers".

One important distinction when it comes to risk for acculturative stress is degree of willingness, or migration status, which can differ greatly if one enters a country as a voluntary immigrant, refugee, asylum seeker, or sojourner. According to several studies,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berry2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SamBerry" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; voluntary migrants experience roughly 50% less acculturative stress than refugees, making this an important distinction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Schwartz (2010), there are four main categories of migrants: 
# ''Voluntary immigrants:'' those that leave their country of origin to find employment, economic opportunity, advanced education, marriage, or to reunite with family members that have already immigrated.
# ''Refugees:'' those who have been involuntarily displaced by persecution, war, or natural disasters. 
# ''Asylum seekers:'' those who willingly leave their native country to flea persecution or violence.
# ''Sojourners:'' those who relocate to a new country on a time-limited bases and for a specific purpose. It is important to note that this group fully intends to return to their native country. 
This type of entry distinction is important, but acculturative stress can also vary significantly within and between ethnic groups. Much of the scholarly work on this topic has focused on Asian and Latino/a immigrants, however more research is needed on the effects of acculturative stress on other ethnic immigrant groups. Among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|U.S. Latinos]], higher levels of adoption of the American host culture has been associated with negative effects on health behaviors and outcomes, such as increased risk for depression and discrimination, and increased risk for low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lara|first=Marielena|author2=Gamboa, Cristina|author3=Kahramanian, M. Iya|author4=Morales, Leo S.|author5=Hayes Bautista, David E.|date=21 April 2005|title=Acculturation and Latino Health in the United States: A Review of the Literature and its Sociopolitical Context|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=26|issue=1|pages=367–97|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.26.021304.144615|pmid=15760294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lueck &amp; Wilson|first=|date=2011|title=Acculturative stress in Latino immigrants: The impact of social, socio-psychological and migration-related factors.|url=|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|volume=35|pages=186–195|via=|doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2010.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some individuals also report "finding relief and protection in relationships" and "feeling worse and then feeling better about oneself with increased competencies" during the acculturative process. Again, these differences can be attributed to the age of the immigrant, the manner in which an immigrant exited their home country, and how the immigrant is received by the both the original and host cultures. Recent research has compared the acculturative processes of documented Mexican-American immigrants and undocumented Mexican-American immigrants and found significant differences in their experiences and levels of acculturative stress.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb, Xie, Meca &amp; Schwartz|first=|date=2016|title=Acculturation, Discrimination &amp; Depression Among Undocumented Latino/as in the United States|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/cdp0000118|journal=American Psychological Association|volume=23 |issue=2|pages=258–268|via=|doi=10.1037/cdp0000118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both groups of Mexican-American immigrants faced similar risks for depression and discrimination from the host (Americans), but the undocumented group of Mexican-American immigrants also faced discrimination, hostility, and exclusion by their own ethnic group (Mexicans) because of their unauthorized legal status. These studies highlight the complexities of acculturative stress, the degree of variability in health outcomes, and the need for specificity over generalizations when discussing potential or actual health outcomes.

Researchers recently uncovered another layer of complications in this field, where survey data has either combined several ethnic groups together or has labeled an ethnic group incorrectly. When these generalizations occur, nuances and subtleties about a person or group's experience of acculturation or acculturative stress can be diluted or lost. For example, much of the scholarly literature on this topic uses [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] data, however the Census mistakenly categorizes [[Arab Americans|Arab-Americans]] as "White".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By doing so, this data set omits many factors about the Arab-American migrant experience, including but not limited to acculturation and acculturative stress. This is of particular importance after the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], since Arab-Americans have faced increased prejudice and discrimination, leaving this community with an increased risk of acculturative stress.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research focusing on the adolescent Arab American experience of acculturation has also found that youth who experience acculturative stress during the identity formation process are at a higher risk for low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goforth, Pham, Chun, Castro-Olivo, &amp; Yosai|first=|date=2016|title=Association of acculturative stress, Islamic practices, and internalizing symptoms among Arab American adolescents.|url=|journal=School Psychology Quarterly|volume=31 |issue=2|pages=198|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers argue that education, social support, hopefulness about employment opportunities, financial resources, family cohesion, maintenance of traditional cultural values, and high [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) serve as protections or mediators against acculturative stress. Previous work shows that limited education, low SES, and underemployment all increase acculturative stress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudmin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SamBerry" /&gt; Since this field of research is rapidly growing, more research is needed to better understand how certain subgroups are differentially impacted, how stereotypes and biases have influenced former research questions about acculturative stress, and the ways in which acculturative stress can be effectively mediated.

== Other outcomes ==

===Culture===
In situations of continuous contact, cultures have exchanged and blended foods, music, dances, clothing, tools, and technologies. Cultural exchange can either occur naturally through extended contact, or more quickly though [[cultural appropriation]] or [[cultural imperialism]].

Cultural appropriation is the adoption of some specific elements of one culture by members a different cultural group. It can include the introduction of forms of dress or personal adornment, music and art, religion, language, or behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schneider | first=Arnd | title=On 'appropriation': A critical reappraisal of the concept and its application in global art practices | journal=Social Anthropology | year=2003 | volume=11 | issue=2 | pages=215–229 | doi=10.1017/S0964028203000156}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elements are typically imported into the existing culture, and may have wildly different meanings or lack the subtleties of their original cultural context. Because of this, cultural appropriation for monetary gain is typically viewed negatively, and has sometimes been called "cultural theft".

Cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting the culture or language of one nation in another, usually occurring in situations in which assimilation is the dominant strategy of acculturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Alexander | first=Victoria | title=Sociology of the Arts: Exploring Fine and Popular Forms | date=31 January 2003 | publisher=Wiley | isbn=9780631230403 | chapter=The Cultural Diamond – The Production of Culture | page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural imperialism can take the form of an active, formal policy or a general attitude regarding cultural superiority.

===Language===
In some instances, acculturation results in the adoption of another country's language, which is then modified over time to become a new, distinct, language. For example, [[Hanzi#Reform|Hanzi]], the written language of Chinese language, has been adapted and modified by other nearby cultures, including: [[Japan]] (as [[kanji]]), [[Korea]] (as [[hanja]]), and [[Vietnam]] (as [[hán tự]]). Another common effect of acculturation on language is the formation of pidgin languages. [[Pidgin]] is a mixed language that has developed to help communication between members of different cultures in contact, usually occurring in situations of trade or colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Todd | first=Loreto | title=Pidgins and Creoles | year=1990 | publisher=Routledge | location=London | isbn=9780415053112}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Pidgin English]] is a simplified form of English mixed with some of the language of another culture.

===Food===
Food habits and food consumption are affected by acculturation on different levels. Research indicated that food habits are discreet and practiced privately, and change occurs slowly. Consumption of new food items is affected by the availability of native ingredients, convenience and cost; therefore, an immediate change is likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kittler, Sucher|first=Pamela, Kathryn P.|title=Food and Culture|year=2008|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|isbn=978-0-495-11541-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and debate==
===Definitions===
Some anthropologists make a semantic distinction between group and individual levels of acculturation. In these instances, the term ''[[transculturation]]'' is used to define individual foreign-origin acculturation, and occurs on a smaller scale with less visible impact. Scholars making this distinction use the term "acculturation" only to address large-scale cultural transactions. Acculturation, then, is the process by which migrants gain new information and insight about the normals and values of the culture and adapt their behaviors to the host culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sorrells | first=Kathryn | title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice | location=Thousand Oaks, California | year=2013 | publisher=Sage | isbn=9781412927444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recommended models===
Most research seems to indicate that the integrationist model of acculturation will lead to the most favorable psychological outcomes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=R | first=E. J. |author2=Okazaki, Sumie|author3= Saw, Anne | title=Bicultural self-efficacy among college students: Initial scale development and mental health correlates | journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology | year=2009 | volume=56 | issue=2 | pages=211–226 | doi=10.1037/a0015419}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marginalization to the least favorable.&lt;ref name=berry2006 /&gt; An initial [[meta-analysis]] of the acculturation literature found these results to be unclear.&lt;ref name="Rudmin"/&gt; However, a more thorough meta-analysis of 40 studies showed that integration was indeed found to have a "significant, weak, and positive relationship with psychological and sociocultural adjustment".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last=Nguyen | first=Angela-MinhTu D. |author2=Benet-Martínez, Verónica | title=Biculturalism Unpacked: Components, Measurement, Individual Differences, and Outcomes | journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass | year=2007 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=101–114 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00029.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many factors that can explain the differences in these findings, including how different the two interacting cultures are, and degree of integration difficulty ([[bicultural identity integration]]). These types of factors partially explain why general statements about approaches to acculturation are not sufficient in predicting successful adaptation. As research in this area has expanded, one study has identified marginalization as being a maladaptive acculturation strategy.&lt;ref name="Kunst 2013 225–241"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kunst | first=Jonas R. |author2=Sam, David L. | title=Expanding the margins of identity: A critique of marginalization in a globalized world. | journal=International Perspectives in Psychology: Research, Practice, Consultation | year=2013 | url=https://www.academia.edu/3992738/Expanding_the_Margins_of_Identity_A_Critique_of_Marginalization_in_a_Globalized_World | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=225–241 | doi=10.1037/ipp0000008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theorists have stated that the fourfold models of acculturation are too simplistic to have predictive validity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ward | first=Colleen | title=Thinking outside the Berry boxes: New perspectives on identity, acculturation and intercultural relations | journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations | date=March 2008 | volume=32 | issue=2 | pages=105–114 | doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2007.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common criticisms of such models include the fact that individuals don't often fall neatly into any of the four categories, and that there is very little evidence for the applied existence of the marginalization acculturation strategy.&lt;ref name="Kunst 2013 225–241"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schwartz | first=Seth J. |author2=Unger, Jennifer B.|author3= Zamboanga, Byron L.|author4= Szapocznik, José | title=Rethinking the concept of acculturation: Implications for theory and research | journal=American Psychologist | year=2010 | volume=65 | issue=4 | page=239 | doi=10.1037/a0019330| pmc=3700543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the bi-directionality of acculturation means that whenever two groups are engaged in cultural exchange, there are 16 permutations of acculturation strategies possible (e.g. an integrationist individual within an assimilationist host culture).&lt;ref name="Rudmin"/&gt; The [[Interactive acculturation|interactive acculturation model]] represents one proposed alternative to the typological approach by attempting to explain the acculturation process within a framework of state policies and the dynamic interplay of host community and immigrant acculturation orientations.

[[File:Vasil Levski's Affidavit.jpg|thumb|[[Vasil Levski]]'s affidavit, 16 June 1872, Bucharest, Romania]]

An '''affidavit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|f|ɪ|ˈ|d|eɪ|v|ɪ|t}} {{Respell|AF|i|DAY|vit}}) is a written [[Oath|sworn statement of fact]] voluntarily made by an ''affiant'' or ''deponent'' under an oath or affirmation administered by a person authorized to do so by law. Such statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiant's [[signature]] by a taker of oaths, such as a [[notary public]] or commissioner of oaths. The name is [[Medieval Latin]] for ''he/she has declared upon oath''. An affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing, or in other words, it contains a verification, meaning it is under oath or penalty of [[perjury]], and this serves as evidence to its veracity and is required for court proceedings.

Affidavits may be written in the first or third person, depending on who drafted the document. If in the first person, the document's component parts are typically as follows:
* A ''commencement'' which identifies the "affiant of truth",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/Affiant.aspx Legal Dictionary] retrieved on 11 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; generally stating that everything in it is true, under penalty of perjury, fine, or imprisonment
* An ''attestation'' clause, usually a [[jurat (clause)|jurat]], at the end certifying the affiant made oath and the date
* Signatures of the author and witness

If an affidavit is notarized or authenticated, it will also include a caption with a venue and title in reference to judicial proceedings. In some cases, an introductory clause, called a ''preamble'', is added attesting that the affiant personally appeared before the authenticating authority.

==Australia==
On 2 March 2016, the High Court of Australia held that the ACT Uniform Evidence Legislation is neutral in the way sworn evidence and unsworn evidence is treated as being of equal weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Queen v GW [2016] HCA 6|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2016/6.html|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In Indian law, although an affidavit may be taken as proof of the facts stated therein, the Courts have no jurisdiction to admit evidence by way of affidavit. Affidavit is treated as "evidence" within the meaning of Section 3 of the Evidence Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/70092/ |title=Smt. Sudha Devi vs M s Narayana &amp; Ors on 26 April, 1988 |publisher=Indiankanoon.org |date= |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was held by the Supreme Court that an affidavit can be used as evidence only if the Court so orders for sufficient reasons, namely, the right of the opposite party to have the deponent produced for cross-examination (Khandesh Spg &amp; Wvg Mills CO. Ltd. Vs Rashtriya Girni Kamgar Sangh, citation 1960 AIR571, 1960 SCR(2) 841).  Therefore, an affidavit cannot ordinarily be used as evidence in absence of a specific order of the Court.

==Sri Lanka==
In Sri Lanka, under the Oaths Ordinance, with the exception of [[court marshal]]s, a person may submit an affidavit signed in the presence of a [[Commissioner for Oaths]] or a [[Justice_of_the_peace#Sri_Lanka|justice of the peace]].

==Ireland==
Affidavits are made in a similar way as to England and Wales, although "make oath" is sometimes omitted. A declaration may be substituted for an affidavit in most cases for those opposed to swearing oaths. The person making the affidavit is known as the deponent but does not sign the affidavit. The affidavit concludes in the standard format "sworn (declared) before me, [name of commissioner for oaths/solicitor], a commissioner for oaths (solicitor), on the [date] at [location] in the county/city of [county/city], and I know the deponent (declarant)", and it is signed and stamped by the commissioner for oaths.

==United States==
In American [[jurisprudence]], under the rules for [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]], admission of an unsupported affidavit as evidence is unusual (especially if the affiant is not available for [[cross-examination]]) with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar. Affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated, or who cannot be located or made to appear, may be accepted by the court, but usually only in the presence of [[corroborating evidence]]. An affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witness's recollection. Materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence. If the affiant is a party in the case, the affiant's opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence, as statements by a party-opponent are admissible through an exception to the hearsay rule.

Affidavits are typically included in the response to [[interrogatories]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_33 Rule 33. Interrogatories to Parties]. Cornell Legal Information Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidjreed.com/litigation/discovery/interrogatories.htm Interrogatories].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Requests for admissions]] under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36, however, are not required to be sworn.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_36 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36].Cornell Legal Information Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Naar | first=Alan S. | year=2001 | url=http://greenbaumlaw.com/Rsc_FilesView.asp?fileCode=593P37E22I44 | title=Requests for Admission: an underutilized litigation tool | work=New Jersey Lawyer, the Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of motions will not be accepted by the court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence, in support of the need for the motion. In such a case, a court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion, as certain assumptions are made, to wit: The affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes [[judicial economy]]. The lawyer is an [[officer of the court]] and knows that a false swearing by him, if found out, could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including [[disbarment]]. The lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit.  

The acceptance of an affidavit by one society does not confirm its acceptance as a legal document in other jurisdictions. Equally, the acceptance that a lawyer is an officer of the court (for swearing the affidavit) is not a given. This matter is addressed by the use of the apostille, a means of certifying the legalization of a document for international use under the terms of the [[Apostille Convention|1961 Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public Documents]]. Documents which have been notarized by a notary public, and certain other documents, and then certified with a conformant apostille, are accepted for legal use in all the nations that have signed the Hague Convention. Thus most affidavits now require to be apostilled if used for cross border issues.

''Aligned Assets''' are a UK-based company from [[Surrey]] that develops address management, [[gazetteer]] [[software]] and Augmented Reality solutions for local authorities, the [[emergency services]] and the commercial sector.  They almost exclusively work with the AddressBase products from the [[Ordnance Survey]].

==History==

Aligned Assets were formed in 1996 by Carl Nunn, later joined by Phil Gee in 1997 and Mike Saunt in 1998, who all met whilst working together for [[MapInfo Corporation]] (now Pitney Bowes MapInfo).  Originally working as MapInfo resellers and Geographical Information System ([[GIS]]) developers, the company saw early success by securing contracts with companies such as the [[BBC]], [[Experian]] and [[Orange (brand)]].

Aligned Assets moved into address management with the development in 1997 of the [[BS7666]] Toolbox that was built on behalf of MapInfo to assist UK Local Authorities in the development of the [[National Land and Property Gazetteer]] (NLPG).

They currently specialize in the gazetteer and address management market working both in the local government sector and with the emergency services.   They are the chosen supplier to the [[British Transport Police]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bapcojournal.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1137/Aligned_Assets_are_helping_British_Transport_Police_with_their_Enquiries.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transport for London]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agi.org.uk/POOLED/articles/bf_newsart/view.asp?Q=bf_newsart_165487&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birmingham City Council]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.agi.org.uk/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_302370&lt;/ref&gt; and were involved in the [[FiReControl]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=2765&amp;trv=1&lt;/ref&gt; project.

After the introduction of BS7666:2006, they were the first company to achieve accreditation to the new standard &lt;ref&gt;http://www.agi.org.uk/POOLED/articles/bf_newsart/view.asp?Q=bf_newsart_296712&lt;/ref&gt; and the first company to have one of their customers fully migrated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agi.org.uk/POOLED/articles/bf_newsart/view.asp?Q=bf_newsart_288874&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of 2010 saw the company move into the commercial sector after they became the UK's first reseller of NLPG data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geoconnexion.com/geouk_news_article/The-first-NLPG-reseller-unveiled-as-Aligned-Assets/7234 |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 January 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731203326/http://www.geoconnexion.com/geouk_news_article/The-first-NLPG-reseller-unveiled-as-Aligned-Assets/7234 |archive-date=31 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, they were announced as the first UK company to be able to provide products compatible with the NLPG's replacement - [[AddressBase]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agi.org.uk/member-news/2011/9/27/aligned-assets-to-be-ready-with-addressbase-products.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2017 Andy Hird and Dinesh Thanigasalam were announced as the new majority shareholders of Aligned Assets following a successful Management Buyout.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aligned-assets.co.uk/aligned-assets-announce-new-owners/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.geoconnexion.com/news/aligned-assets-announce-new-owners/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Annales ianuenses''''' ([[Latin]]: "Genoese annals") or '''''Annali Genovesi''''' form the [[official history]] of the [[Republic of Genoa]] during the [[High Middle Ages]].{{sfn|McCormick|1991}} It is the earliest medieval civic chronicle and the earliest set of annals composed by a layman.{{sfn|Bellomo|2013}} The ''Annales'' form a chronological account of the [[Timeline of Genoese history|history of Genoa]] from 1099 until 1294. The first annals were composed by [[Caffarus]], a private citizen, on his own initiative. In 1152, he petitioned the republic to keep a copy in the public archives (''comuni cartularium'') and thenceforth the annals were continued at public expense.{{sfn|Wickham|1992|p=173}} Caffarus, who probably began the work around 1100, continued it himself down to 1163. A series of officials of the chancery continued the ''Annales'' between 1169 and 1197, when work was taken over by the scribe and diplomat Ogerius.{{sfn|McCormick|1991}} He worked down to 1216; thereafter, the annalists were anonymous, and at times a committee, until the last entry was added in 1294.{{sfn|McCormick|1991}} The public manuscript of the ''Annales ianuenses'' is now kept in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], lat. 10136.{{sfn|McCormick|1991}}

The content of the annals is confined to the names of the consuls, the changes to the constitution (the ''compagniae'' or sworn association), changes to the coinage and the victories of Genoa over her enemies, particularly [[Saracens]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisans]].{{sfn|Wickham|1992|p=173}} In Caffarus' own words to the republic in 1152, the purpose of the chronicle was "that henceforth for all time the victories of the city of Genoa be known to future men."{{sfn|Wickham|1992|p=173}}

'''archive.is''' (formerly '''archive.today''') is an [[archive site]] which stores snapshots of web pages.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ghacks.net/2015/04/22/create-publicly-available-web-page-archives-with-archive-is/ | title=Create publicly available web page archives with Archive.is | publisher=[[Ghacks]] | author = Martin Brinkmann | date=22 April 2015 | accessdate=13 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It retrieves one page at a time similar to [[WebCite]], smaller than 50&amp;nbsp;MB each, but with [[Web 2.0]] sites (such as [[Google Maps]] and [[Twitter]]) included.

Archive.is uses [[headless browsing]] to record what embedded resources need to be captured to provide a high-quality [[Memento Project|memento]], and creates a [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image to provide a static and non-interactive visualization of the representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Unlike [[Web crawler|crawlers]] such as [[Wayback Machine]], archive.is only captures individual pages in response to explicit user requests, and so does not obey the [[robots exclusion standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Dascalescu |authorlink=Dan Dascalescu |url=https://wiki.dandascalescu.com/reviews/online_services/web_page_archiving |title=Web page archiving – Dan Dascalescu's Wiki (review) |publisher=Wiki.dandascalescu.com |date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, website owners cannot unilaterally remove snapshots at will, making it a "permanent" archive.&lt;ref name = "vice stealing"&gt;{{cite web |last=Koebler |first=Jason |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/dear-gamergate-please-stop-stealing-our-shit |title=Dear GamerGate: Please Stop Stealing Our Shit |date=29 October 2014 |work=Motherboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2017}} &lt;!--For example, [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_9_65/ai_77811474 this] [[Archive.org]] link doesn't work; the error message "Page cannot be displayed due to robots.txt." is displayed, but [https://archive.is/20120717223848/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_9_65/ai_77811474 this] Archive.is archive of the same URL does still work.  -- Why commented out:  Better example would be where the same error came up at archive.org, and the original content was gone, as in this example but archive.is had *directly* archived the content, rather than indirectly, as in this case. Good enough?--&gt;

Since July 2013, archive.is supports the [[Memento Project]] [[application programming interface]] (API).&lt;ref name=WSRG&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ws-dl.blogspot.nl/2013/07/2013-07-09-archiveis-supports-memento.html |title=Archive.is Supports Memento |publisher=Web Science and Digital Libraries Research Group at [[Old Dominion University]] |work=Research and Teaching Updates |date=9 July 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727194715/https://ws-dl.blogspot.de/2013/07/2013-07-09-archiveis-supports-memento.html |archivedate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 September 2013 |first=Michael L. |last=Nelson |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mementoweb.org/depot/native/archiveis/|title=archive.is|website=Memento Protocol Information|publisher=Memento Development Group|accessdate=17 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915191950/https://mementoweb.org/depot/native/archiveis/|archivedate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2015, the operators blocked access to the service from all [[Finland|Finnish]] [[IP address]]es, stating on [[Twitter]] that they did this in order to avoid escalating a dispute they allegedly had with the Finnish government.&lt;ref name="ilta_Suom"&gt;{{cite web | title = Suomalaisilta estettiin haktivistien suosimalla verkkosivulla käynti | trans-title = Finns' access to website used by hacktivists blocked | last = Lapintie | first = Lassi | work = Iltalehti | date = 22 July 2015 | accessdate = 4 March 2016 | url = https://www.iltalehti.fi/digi/2015072220070969_du.shtml | language = fi  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Archive.is records only text and images, excluding video and other [[static web page|non-static]] content. It keeps track of the history of snapshots saved, returning to the user a request for confirmation before adding a new snapshot of an already saved Internet address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://archive.is/https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?hl=en | title = Example snapshot history on archive.is}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At November 2018, Archive.is codifies snapshots with an [[alphanumeric]] [[case-sensitive]] code of five elements. Hence, any element may have one of 42 possible values, between: 
# ten [[Numerical digit|digits]], from 0 to 9.
# 32 letters, 16 of the [[English alphabet]], whose number is doubled by 16 capital letter.
The global amount of possible combinations is given by  the [[conditional probability#statistical independence|conditional probability]] theorem, as follows: &lt;math&gt;42^5 = 130.691&lt;/math&gt; milions of identifiers. The number of available [[URL#syntax|URI]]s can be additionally extended with the use of [[plus and minus signs|plus and minus]], [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], [[underscore]] or [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] signs.

Web pages cannot be [[Redundancy (engineering)|duplicated]] from ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://archive.is&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.archive.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' as [[Remote backup service|second-level backup]]. The reverse - from ''&lt;nowiki&gt;www.archive.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;archive.is&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' - is possible,&lt;ref name="Wayback Mach to archive.is"&gt;{{cite web | url = Http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130517180220/Http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-05-17 | title = Example: Page saved from Web Archive to Archive.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the copy usually takes more time than a direct capture. Some web sites can't be saved by either [[Internet Archive]] or archive.is due to their [[robots.txt]] file.

The research toolbar enables advanced keywords operators, using  
{{code|*}} as the [[Wildcard character#Computing|wildcard character]]. 
A couple of [[quotation mark]]s address the search to an exact sequence of keywords present in the title or in the body of the webpage, whereas the ''insite'' operator restricts it to a specific Internet domain&lt;ref&gt;For example, the string &lt;nowiki&gt;insite: https://en.wikipedia.org "World Cup"&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns the [http://archive.fo/search/?q=insite%3A+http%3Aen.wikipedia.org+"World+Cup"/ related snapshots]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Once a web page is archived, it cannot be deleted directly by any Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.google. com/amp/s/blog.archive.is/post/41395737942/how-can-i-delete-an-archived-page/amp | title = Some Frequently Asked Question | website = archive.is blog | language = en | access-date = Nov 12, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130926093655/https://blog.archive.is/post/41395737942/how-can-i-delete-an-archived-page | archive-date = Sep 26, 2013 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:bibliotheca selecta 1593.png|thumb|right|''Bibliotheca selecta'' cover.]]
'''''Bibliotheca selecta''''' (full title '''''Bibliotheca selecta de ratione studiorum in Historia, In Disciplinis, in salute omnium procuranda''''')  is a bibliographical [[encyclopedia]] by the [[Jesuit]] [[Antonio Possevino]], printed in two [[Folio (printing)|folio]] volumes at the Typographia Apostolica Vaticana by Domenico Basa in 1593. It represents an authoritative and up-to-date Jesuit compendium of [[Counter-Reformation]] knowledge.

==Part I==

Part I (Books 1-11) is dedicated to pope [[Clement VIII]] with the imprimatur of [[Jesuit]] general [[Claudio Acquaviva]]. It begins with an introduction that traces the ''Idea et causae operis'' to the 1560s in France when as a Jesuit superior Possevino started fighting the anti-heretical battle of the books. From Lyons and Avignon he had seen the challenge to the orthodoxy of Rome and the [[Council of Trent]] represented by [[Konrad Gesner]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca universalis]]'', the ground-breaking encyclopedia expressing the Erasmian culture of Swiss and German Reformers, a work immediately banned by church censors. To begin, Possevino discourses on the principles of Jesuit humanist [[pedagogy]] enunciated in the ''[[Ratio studiorum]]'' in a preliminary section, ''Cultura ingeniorum''. This part, as several others, went through several separate editions&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=njBCAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=antonio+possevino+cultura+ingeniorum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ffguV0TbC8&amp;sig=sqOe4saqqqpET0x-FshmmNpr-pk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1oGCTbryBY_ogQeMjrjbCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  (Cologne, 1610)]&lt;/ref&gt; and an Italian translation by Possevino.&lt;ref&gt;''Coltura de gl'ingegni, nella quale con molta dottrina, &amp; guiditio si mostrano i doni che ne gl'ingegni dell'huomo ha posto Iddio, La varieta et inclinatione loro e di dove nasce e come si conosca, li modo ed i mezzi d'essercitarli per le discipline, li remedi agl'impedimenti, li coleggi e l'universita, l'uso de' buoni libri e la correttione de' cattivi'' (Vicenza: Greco, 1598)[https://books.google.com/books?id=ry08AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=antonio+possevino+coltura+de+gl'ingegni&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SS6iOscPOm&amp;sig=J3ejiFvlC8OokKMuvrqPiU89ZNE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y4yDTdPnKs31gAe_6dTJCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Among these was an edition dedicated to the Russian [[False Dmitriy I]].&lt;ref&gt;(Treviso, 1606) Luigi Balsamo, ''Bibliography: History of a Tradition'' Trans. W, Pettas, (Berkeley, 1990)IV: The Bibliographic Canons of the Sixteenth Century: From ''Bibliotheca Universalis'' to ''Bibliotheca selecta'' p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The theological presentation of the several books outlines a comprehensive bibliography on theology, scholastic, catechetical and controversial, and incorporates works by such contemporary Jesuit missionaries as [[Alessandro Valignano]] and [[Edmund Campion]].

==Part II==

Part II is dedicated to king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] of Poland, one of the contemporary rulers under Possevino's Counter Reformation tutelage. From Books 12 through 18 he summarizes the literature and bibliography for law {12}, philosophy {13} and medicine (14). Possevino is creating an authorized bibliography of the traditional arts and sciences elaborating the humanistic educational precepts of the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]''. The [[liberal arts]] are dealt with in the final books on architecture and geography {15}, history {16} poetry &amp; painting {17} and rhetoric {18}. The major thrust of Possevino's orthodox compendium is the creation of a bibliography of the humanist culture of the Late Renaissance that is both confidently encyclopedic and outspokenly anti-heretical. The criterion of orthodoxy is underscored in his previous ''Iudicium de Nuae, Iohannis Bodini, Philippe-Mornaei et Machiavelli scriptis'', 1592, which placed the works of leading writers such as [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Jean Bodin]] on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]. In addition to two revised folio editions of the ''Bibliotheca selecta'' printed in Venice, 1603 and Cologne, 1607, several books were reprinted in separate editions, notably Book 16, as [[Apparatus ad omnium gentium historiam]],&lt;ref&gt;(Venice: Ciotti, 1597) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YsM5AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=antonio+possevino+apparatus+ad+historiam&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=u3iCTeSBJMrEgQeImfHBCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false,] and in Italian  as ''Apparato all'historia di tutte le nationi'' (Venice: Ciotti, 1598) and as ''De Apparatu ad omnium gentium historiam'' (Venice: Ciotti, 1602), the revised edition integrated in the Venetian ''Bibliotheca selecta'' of 1603,&lt;/ref&gt; a thorough bibliography of the ancient and contemporary literature of world history reworking, expurgating  and updating [[Bodin]]'s ''Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem''(1566). Book 18 was published separately as a rhetorical treatise, ''Cicero collatus cum Etnicis et sacris scriptoribus''.&lt;ref&gt;(Padua: apud Paulum Meietum, 1593)[https://books.google.com/books?id=YEA8AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=antonio+possevino+cicero&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=V6mvTfCsNYvegQf5lZCDDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Also, (Cologne: Birkmann, 1593)&lt;/ref&gt;

The book introduces [[systems dynamics]] modeling for the analysis of policy and strategy, with an emphasis on business and public policy applications. System dynamics is both a conceptual tool and a powerful modeling method.  This allows the building of computer simulations of complex systems.  These simulations can then be used to test the effectiveness of different policies on business outcomes.

In describing the customs of the Mayas inhabiting the Verapaz province (including the [[Alta Verapaz]] and [[Baja Verapaz]]) of 16th-century Guatemala, Bishop [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]&lt;ref&gt;Las Casas 1967: 515, 522&lt;/ref&gt; mentions sexual relationships, regulated by customary law, between unmarried young men and boys, as well as similar relations prevailing among adolescents receiving instruction in the temples. '''Chin,''' together with Cu, Cavil ('idol'), and Maran, is mentioned as the name of the male deity said to have demonstrated  sexual intercourse with another 'demon', and thereby to have introduced such relationships: "From that time on some fathers gave their sons a little boy to be used as a woman; and if someone else took the boy, they demanded pay as is done when someone violates another's wife."&lt;ref&gt;Miles 1957: 763&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionalized pederastic prostitution, including transvestism, is recorded in 17th-century Spanish reports of the [[Itzá]] Mayas living in the Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998: 334-335, 499&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Classic Period scenes found in a cave of [[Naj Tunich]] is a depiction of a naked, [[sexually excited]] male creature embracing a nude Maya nobleman,&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2006: 211 and fig. 6.8b; cf. Stone 1995: 196, fig. 8-18&lt;/ref&gt; possibly by way of initiation.

[[Image:Gandhi Salt March.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] and supporters [[Salt Satyagraha|Salt March]] on March 12, 1930. This was an act of [[nonviolent]] direct action.]]
[[Image:Bardouxha Mont 1893-mw-c.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of the [[Belgian general strike of 1893]]. A [[general strike]] is an example of confrontational direct action.]]

'''Direct action ''' originated as a political activist term for economic and political acts in which the actors use their (e. g. economic or physical) power to directly reach certain goals of interest, in contrast to those actions that appeal to others (e. g. authorities) by, for instance, revealing an existing problem, highlighting an alternative, or demonstrating a possible solution. Both direct action and actions appealing to others can include nonviolent and violent activities which target persons, groups, or property deemed offensive to the action participants. Examples of '''nonviolent direct action''' (also known as [[nonviolence]], [[nonviolent resistance]], or [[civil resistance]]) can include (obstructing) [[sit-in]]s, [[strike action|strikes]], [[workplace occupation]]s, street [[blockade]]s or [[hacktivism]], while '''violent direct action''' may include [[political violence]] or [[assault]]s. Tactics such as [[sabotage]] and [[property destruction]] are sometimes considered violent. By contrast, [[election|electoral]] [[politics]], [[diplomacy]], [[negotiation]], protests and [[arbitration]] are not usually described as direct action, as they are politically mediated. Non-violent actions are sometimes a form of [[civil disobedience]], and may involve a degree of intentional law-breaking where persons place themselves in arrestable situations in order to make a political statement but other actions (such as strikes) may not violate [[criminal law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gonzotimes.com/2011/09/strategies-for-the-struggle-strategy-2-direct-action/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003230943/http://www.gonzotimes.com/2011/09/strategies-for-the-struggle-strategy-2-direct-action/ |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of direct action is to either obstruct another political agent or political organization from performing some practice to which the activists object, or to solve perceived problems which traditional societal institutions ([[government]]s, [[religious organizations]] or established [[trade union]]s) are not addressing to the satisfaction of the direct action participants.

Non-violent direct action has historically been an assertive regular feature of the tactics employed by [[social movement]]s, including [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[Indian Independence Movement]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

==History==
Direct action tactics have been around for as long as conflicts have existed but it is not known when the term first appeared. The radical union the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] first mentioned the term "direct action" in a publication in reference to a Chicago strike conducted in 1910.&lt;ref name="autogenerated46"&gt;The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other noted historical practitioners of direct action include the American Civil Rights Movement, the [[Global Justice Movement]],  the [[Women's Suffrage|Suffragettes]], revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], and certain [[Environmentalist|environmental]] [[advocacy group]]s.

American anarchist [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] wrote an essay called "Direct Action" in 1912 which is widely cited today. In this essay, de Cleyre points to historical examples such as the [[Boston Tea Party]] and the American [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery movement]], noting that "direct action has always been used, and has the historical sanction of the very people now reprobating it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|De Cleyre|2004|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1920 book, ''[[Direct Action (Mellor book)|Direct Action]]'', [[William Mellor]] placed direct action firmly in the [[Class conflict|struggle]] between worker and employer for control "over the economic life of society."  Mellor defined direct action "as the use of some form of economic [[power (sociology)|power]] for securing of ends desired by those who possess that power." Mellor considered direct action a tool of both owners and workers and for this reason, he included within his definition [[Lockout (industry)|lockouts]] and [[cartel]]s, as well as strikes and [[sabotage]].  However, by this time the US [[anarchist]] and [[feminist]] [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] had already given a strong defense of direct action, linking it with struggles for [[civil rights]]:

{{quote|...the [[Salvation Army]], which was started by a gentleman named [[William Booth]] was vigorously practising direct action in the maintenance of the freedom of its members to speak, assemble, and pray.  Over and over they were arrested, fined, and imprisoned ... till they finally compelled their persecutors to let them alone.|de Cleyre, undated}}

[[File:West Germans Demonstrating - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|right|A protest against the newly built [[Berlin Wall]] during the [[Cold War]] in 1961. It would be torn down in [[Revolutions of 1989|1989]].]]

[[Martin Luther King]] felt that non-violent direct action's goal was to "create such a crisis and foster such a tension" as to demand a response.&lt;ref name="mlk jail"&gt;{{cite web
 | title  = Letter from Birmingham Jail
 | last  = King | first = Martin Luther, Jr.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The rhetoric of [[Martin Luther King]], [[James Bevel]], and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] promoted [[nonviolence|non-violent]] [[revolutionary]] direct action as a means to social change. Gandhi and Bevel had been strongly influenced by [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', which is considered a classic text that ideologically promotes [[passive resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Christoyannopoulos, Alexandre (2010). Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel. Exeter: Imprint Academic. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 20th century, the sphere of direct action had undoubtedly expanded, though the meaning of the term had perhaps contracted.  Many campaigns for social change—such as those seeking [[suffrage]], improved working conditions, [[civil rights]], [[abortion]] rights or an end to abortion, an end to [[gentrification]], and environmental protection—claim to employ at least some types of violent or nonviolent direct action.

Some sections of the [[Nuclear disarmament|anti-nuclear movement]] used direct action, particularly during the 1980s. Groups opposing the introduction of [[cruise missile]]s into the United Kingdom employed tactics such as breaking into and occupying United States air bases, and blocking roads to prevent the movement of military convoys and disrupt military projects. In the US, mass protests opposed nuclear energy, weapons, and military intervention throughout the decade, resulting in thousands of arrests. Many groups also set up semi-permanent "[[peace camp]]s" outside air bases such as [[Molesworth peace camp|Molesworth]] and [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|Greenham Common]], and at the [[Nevada Test Site]].

[[Environmental movement]] organizations such as [[Greenpeace]] have used direct action to pressure governments and companies to change environmental policies for years. On April 28, 2009, Greenpeace activists, including [[Phil Radford]], scaled a crane across the street from the Department of State, calling on world leaders to address climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://grist.org/article/2009-04-27-greenpeace-radford/ |title=First Day on the Job!|publisher=Grist.org|date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, Greenpeace activists dropped a banner off of Mt. Rushmore, placing President Obama's face next to other historic presidents, which read "History Honors Leaders; Stop Global Warming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2009/0708/greenpeace-scales-mt-rushmore-issues-challenge-to-obama|title=Greenpeace Scales Mt Rushmore – issues challenge to Obama|publisher=Grist.org|date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, more than 2,600 people were arrested while protesting energy policy and associated health issues under the [[Barack Obama]] Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTgJEheQTlE&amp;feature=share | title=More activists arrested under Obama | publisher=RT.com (''The Alyona Show'') | date=24 May 2011 | people=Alyona Minkovsky, Kevin Zeese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, hundreds blocked the gates of the coal fired power plant that powers the US Congress building, following the [[Power Shift]] conference in Washington, D.C. In attendance at the [http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=capitol+climate+action&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=2322&amp;bih=1200 Capitol Climate Action] were [[Bill McKibben]], Terry Tempest Williams, [[Phil Radford]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Robert kennedy jr|Robert Kennedy Junior]], Judy Bonds and many more prominent figures of the climate justice movement were in attendance.

[[Anti-abortion groups]] in the United States, particularly [[History of Operation Rescue|Operation Rescue]], often used non-violent sit-ins at the entrances of abortion clinics as a form of direct action in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

[[File:AdamKokesh04-26-07.JPG|thumb|right|[[Voluntaryism|Voluntarist]] activist [[Adam Kokesh]] being arrested after a nonviolent protest against the Iraq war in 2007]]
[[Anti-globalization]] activists made headlines around the world in 1999, when they forced the [[Seattle]] [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999]] to end early with direct action tactics.  The goal that they had, shutting down the meetings, was directly accomplished by placing their bodies and other debris between the WTO delegates and the building they were meant to meet in.  Activists also engaged in [[property destruction]] as a direct way of stating their opposition to [[corporate culture]]—this can be viewed as a direct action if the goal was to shut down those stores for a period of time, or an indirect action if the goal was influencing corporate policy.

One of the largest direct actions in recent years took place in San Francisco the day after the [[Iraq War]] began in 2003. Twenty-thousand people occupied the streets and over 2,000 people were arrested in [[affinity group]] actions throughout downtown San Francisco, home to [[military-related corporation]]s such as [[Bechtel]]. (See [[March 20, 2003 anti-war protest]]).

Direct action has also been used on a smaller scale. [[Refugee]] [[Salim Rambo]] was saved from being [[deported]] from the UK back to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] when one person stood up on his flight and refused to sit down.  After a two-hour delay the man was arrested, but the pilot refused to fly with Rambo on board. Salim Rambo was ultimately released from state custody and remains free today.

[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|right|"[[Boston Tea Party|The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor]]"]]
Non-violent direct action (NVDA) is any form of direct action that does not rely on violent tactics, as opposed to ''principled nonviolence'', which is a positive force in its own right and involves active concern for the well being of the opponent even while resisting the latter's actions. [[Mohandas Gandhi]]'s teachings of [[Satyagraha]] (or ''truth force'') have inspired many practitioners of [[nonviolent]] direct action, although the use of nonviolence does not always imply an ideological commitment to pacifism.  In 1963, civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] described the goal of NVDA in his ''[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks to so dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.&lt;ref name="mlk jail" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States, the term has largely come to signify civil disobedience, and protest in general. In the 1980s, a California direct action protest group called [[Livermore Action Group]] called its newspaper ''Direct Action''. The paper ran for 25 issues, and covered hundreds of nonviolent actions around the world. The book ''Direct Action: An Historical Novel'' took its name from this paper, and records dozens of actions in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Human rights activists have used direct action in the ongoing campaign to close the [[School of the Americas]], renamed in 2001 the [[Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation]]. As a result, 245 [[SOA Watch]] human rights defenders have collectively spent almost 100 years in prison. More than 50 people have served probation sentences.

"Direct Action" has also served as the moniker of at least two groups: the French ''[[Action Directe (gang)|Action Directe]]'' as well as the Canadian group more popularly known as the [[Squamish Five]]. ''Direct Action'' is also the name of the magazine of the Australian [[Wobblies]]. The [[United Kingdom|UK's]] [[Solidarity Federation]] currently publishes a magazine called ''Direct Action''.

Until 1990, Australia's Socialist Workers Party published a party paper also named "Direct Action", in honour of the Wobblies' history. One of the group's descendants, the Revolutionary Socialist Party, has again started a publication of this name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Food Not Bombs]] is often described as direct action because individuals involved directly act to solve a social problem; people are hungry and yet there is food available. Food Not Bombs is inherently dedicated to non-violence.

A museum that chronicles the history of direct action and [[grassroots]] activism in the Lower East Side of New York City, the [[Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space]], opened in 2012.

== Violent ==
{{See also|Propaganda of the deed}}
Violent direct action is any direct action which utilizes physical injurious force against persons or, controversially (see [[#Controversy over destruction of property|below]]), property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource | first=Voltairine | last=de Cleyre | authorlink=Voltairine de Cleyre | year=1912 | title=Direct Action }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of violent direct action include: rioting, [[lynching]], [[terrorism]], [[political assassination]], freeing political prisoners, interfering with police actions, armed [[insurgency|insurrection]], and arguably property destruction.

[[Ann Hansen]], one of the ''[[Squamish Five|Squamish 5]]'', also known as ''Vancouver 5'', a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[anarchism|anarchist]] and self-professed urban [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter, wrote in her book ''[[Direct Action: Memoirs of an Urban Guerrilla|Direct Action]]'' that,

{{quote|The essence of direct action ... is people fighting for themselves, rejecting those who claim to represent their true interests, whether they be revolutionaries or government officials. It is a far more subversive idea than civil disobedience because it is not meant to reform or influence state power but is meant to undermine it by showing it to be unnecessary and harmful. When people, themselves, resort to violence to protect their community from racist attacks or to protect their environment from ecological destruction, they are taking direct action.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Ann. ''Direct Action: Memoirs of an Urban Guerrilla''. Toronto: Between the Lines, 2001. {{ISBN|978-1902593487}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|335}}}}

== Controversy over destruction of property ==
{{See also|Diversity of tactics}}
One major debate is whether destruction of property should be included within the realm of violence or nonviolence. This debate can be illustrated by the response to groups like the [[Earth Liberation Front]] and [[Animal Liberation Front]], which use property destruction and sabotage as direct action tactics. Although these types of actions are often prosecuted as violence, those groups justify their actions by claiming that violence is harm directed towards living things and not property. The issue of whether sabotage is a form of violence is difficult to resolve in purely philosophical terms, but the use of sabotage as a methodology can be contrasted with minor property damage that is a small but necessary part of a non-violent campaign methodology such as breaking locks and fences to gain entry to a site.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Rucht. Violence and New Social Movements. In: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A4mqsik_VDcC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;dq=definition+of+violence+property&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=04NpU8zxBYuryAScMw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20violence%20property&amp;f=false International Handbook of Violence Research],'' Volume I. Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2003, p. 369-382.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some theorists and activists believe that a doctrine of [[diversity of tactics]] can resolve the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/free/pga/hallm.htm "Hallmarks of People’s Global Action (amended at the 3rd PGA conference at Cochamamba, 2001)".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=James K.|last2=Carroll|first2=Myles|date=2014-04-03|title=Reform or Radicalism: Left Social Movements from the Battle of Seattle to Occupy Wall Street|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/07393148.2014.894683|journal=New Political Science|volume=36|issue=2|pages=149–171|doi=10.1080/07393148.2014.894683|issn=0739-3148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US and international law include acts against property in the definition of violence and state that even in a time of war, "Destruction [of property] as an end in itself is a violation of international law".&lt;ref&gt;Orakhelashvili, Alexander.

==United Kingdom==
{{Main|Environmental direct action in the United Kingdom}}
The [[Environmentalism|environmental]] direct action movement in the United Kingdom started in 1990 with the forming of the first UK [[Earth First!]] group. The movement rapidly grew from the 1992 [[Twyford Down]] protests, culminating in 1997.

There are now several organisations in the United Kingdom campaigning for action on climate change that use non-violent direct action, including [[Camp for Climate Action]], [[Plane Stupid]] and [[Greenpeace]]. This has resulted in environmental campaigners being labelled as extremists by the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/26/ministry-justice-environmental-campaigners-terrorism | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | title=Ministry of Justice lists eco-activists alongside terrorists | first=Matthew | last=Taylor | date=26 January 2010 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Farm''' is an historic [[Estate (land)|estate]] located in [[Rosehill, New South Wales|Rosehill]], a [[suburb]] of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. Elizabeth Farm was the family home of wool pioneer, [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Macarthur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/elizabeth-farm |title=Elizabeth Farm |work=Sydney Living Museums |publisher=[[Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)|Office of Environment and Heritage]], [[Government of New South Wales]] |date= |accessdate=6 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate was commenced in 1793 on a slight hill overlooking the upper reaches of [[Parramatta River]], {{convert|23|km}} west of [[Sydney Cove]]. This area belonged to the Burramattagal clan of the Dharug people, whose presence is recalled in the name [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]].

The small, solid three-roomed brick cottage in the [[Australian residential architectural styles#Old Colonial Period 1788 – c. 1840|Australian Old Colonial]] style was transformed, by the late 1820s, into a smart country house, surrounded by 'pleasure grounds', orchards and almost {{convert|1000|acre|ha|order=flip}} of semi-cleared land. Enveloped within later extensions, the early cottage remains intact, making it Australia's oldest surviving European dwelling. The estate is managed by [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales|Sydney Living Museums]] as a [[museum]] that is open to the public for a modest fee.

On 2 April 1999 the estate was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]], the first property entered on the register.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5051394|Elizabeth Farm|hr=00001|fn=EF13/20410; S90/3624|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Joseph Lycett - Residence of John Macarthur Esq near Parramatta N.S.W. - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Romanticised painting of Elizabeth Farm viewed from the northern riverbank of Parramatta River. Joseph Lycett based this on sketches and his memories and painted it on his return to England.]]

[[Elizabeth Macarthur|Elizabeth]] and [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] arrived in 1790 with the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second Fleet]]. They brought with them contemporary ideas which formed the basis of their house and garden. In 1793 [[Francis Grose (British Army officer)|Governor Grose]] granted Macarthur 100 acres near [[Parramatta]] on the west side of "Tipperary Farm". This area would increase to 925 acres through grants and purchases by 1818 and proved to be almost 1100 acres when surveyed in 1881.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The building of Elizabeth Farm commenced in 1793. It was a brick single-storey building with four rooms, a hall, closets, and cellar with an adjoining kitchen, servants apartments and other necessary offices. It remained the Macarthur family residence and Elizabeth's home until her death in 1850. The Macarthurs occupied and continually extended the house grant as their family increased to nine children and their financial position grew. Around 1805 a bedroom behind the drawing room and verandahs was added. The third kitchen was built in 1820.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

From 1794 Macarthur became interested in raising sheep and began to selectively crossbreed his flock at Elizabeth Farm. The house was the scene of political and social activity including visits from many governors and their wives. Elizabeth managed the farm and their other properties during the years John was in England.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

In his last twelve years Macarthur consulted pattern books and various architects and builders such as Henry Cooper and James Smith to prepare building plans.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-1&gt;Bravery 1997:5-8, 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

John Macarthur brought [[olive]] trees (Olea europaea cv.) to [[Sydney]] in 1805 and again in 1817. Although [[George Suttor]] had introduced olives to Australia earlier, in 1800 among a collection of plants from [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], these appear not to have survived. Macarthur's olives did. John, in exile in London over his involvement with the overthrow of [[William Bligh|Governor William Bligh]], sensed the mood of the British administration - who were encouraged by Suttor's reports that New South Wales had potential for horticulture due to the local climate. Macarthur set off in 1815 on a tour of [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] to study "the whole practice of the culture of the vine and the olive, and the making of the wine and the oil." By May 1816 he was back in [[London]] with a collection of vines and olives for shipment to Australia. He was certain that these would impress [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]], secretary of state for the colonies, and assist his return to Australia, but it took a year to get the go-ahead. He arrived in September 1817 with a cargo of "useful plants" including two olives from [[Provence]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

Five years later Macarthur made an equally favourable impression on Commissioner [[John Bigge]] who was in NSW to investigate all aspects of colonial administration, including the development of agriculture and trade. Bigge observed that Macarthur's olive trees had assimilated well to the climate and that olive oil from NSW could prove a successful export product. The settlement's British cultural background and lack of experience growing olives (commercially) and competition from the wool production industry kept olive production in the shade. Two olive trees remain at Elizabeth Farm on the front (northern) lawn. It is unclear whether these date from 1805 or 1817 introductions. However they appear to be the earliest olive trees surviving in Australia and thus, despite Suttor's introduction in 1800, Macarthur could be credited with introducing or at least successfully establishing olives in Australia, leading (at least in the late 20th century) to a growing agricultural industry.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-2&gt;Crockett &amp; Martin, 2009, abridged by Stuart Read, 18/8/09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

In the 1820s Macarthur added a separate two storey section to the rear, and built stables. The house additions used open planning with French doors leading to the verandahs and gardens. A few years later the verandahs may have been remodelled. A Doric columned north verandah in contrast to the treillage of the eastern verandah was added during 1826. Further extensions were made during 1826 and 1827, designed by Henry Cooper. Refacing of the servants quarters, possibly by [[John Verge]], took place sometime around 1833. In this year John Macarthur moved to their property at [[Camden, New South Wales|Camden]] and died there in 1834.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

In 1872 Edward Macarthur died leaving Elizabeth Farm to his niece Elizabeth Onslow, the daughter of his brother James, but allowing his wife Sarah a lifetime interest in it.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The Macarthur family sold Elizabeth Farm Estate in 1881. From 1852 Elizabeth Farm was occupied by various tenants and agents, including William Billyard, Crown Solicitor of NSW from 1875 until 1883.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The new owner, [[Septimus Stephen]], subdivided the land and put the house block up for auction. There were further subdivisions in 1884. The house was leased variously as a boarding house and glue factory. It was purchased as a house and six acres by William and Elizabeth Swann and family in 1904 for the land value only. The house was in a state of dilapidation. They immediately proceeded to have it cleansed, disinfected and repaired. The family became an institution in Parramatta, their house based activities including music, education, a secretarial school and dental surgery. The Swann family owned and occupied the house until 1968 when it was purchased by the Elizabeth Farm Management Trust.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

A Friends of Elizabeth Farm group formed well before the formation of the [[Sydney Living Museums|Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-3&gt;Watts, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

In 1973 the [[State Planning Authority]] assumed control of Elizabeth Farm. Between 1978 and 1983 the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] and the Heritage Council of NSW restored the buildings, which were considered important as a record of the oldest surviving examples of colonial construction techniques in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-4&gt;Bravery, 1997, 5-8, 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

Architectural documentation and conservation works on the buildings were supervised by project architect Ian Sansom, [[New South Wales Government Architect|Government Architect's Branch]]. Conservation policy and landscape proposals for the garden and grounds were developed by the Landscape Section, Government Architect's Branch, in consultation with the Historic Houses Trust (HHT) and Heritage and Conservation Branch.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

A. W. Edwards P/L was engaged to carry out restoration of lath and plaster work. A detailed property title search was carried out. Anne Bickford, archaeologist was engaged to continue research, particularly in regard to the carriage way and former outbuildings. Discussions continued with the HHT regarding its likely requirements for ancillary facilities on the site. Consultation continued with Parramatta City Council re future management of the [[Elizabeth Farm Reserve|reserve surrounding Elizabeth Farm]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

A draft conservation plan was prepared by the HHT in 1982. The HC SR Committee formed a sub-committee with representatives of the Heritage &amp; Conservation Branch, HHT and co-opted members to increase involvement of the HHT in works being carried out with a view to eventual transfer of the property to the Trust for management as a house museum.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-5&gt;HC, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The site was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust of NSW in 1983 and opened to the public as a house museum in 1984.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-1/&gt; Since then the Friends of the Historic Houses Trust has raised funds to allow entry display refurbishment, lighting and [[iPad]] interpretation ($38,000), soft-furnishings ($33,000) and reproduction of [[Elizabeth Macarthur]]'s ivory workbox ($8000) as well as organising and supporting the successful annual Festival of the Olive event, which attracts a wide range of visitors to the property.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-3/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

== Museum ==

The homestead, now a house museum, is creatively furnished with props and copies of objects known to belong to the Macarthurs of Elizabeth Farm. Impressive cedar joinery has been restored while carefully reproduced paint schemes, fabrics and floor coverings provide an authentic impression of this early 19th-century household. The Macarthurs' garden of native and exotic ornamentals, fruit trees and vegetables has been recreated around original plantings and archaeological features dating to the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.saatchigallery.com/museums/museum-profile.php/Elizabeth+Farm/1844.html | title=Elizabeth Farm | publisher=Saatchi Gallery | accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoiding the use of rope barriers and screens, an innovative 'hands on' approach encourages visitors to explore and interact with this evocative historical environment: sitting in chairs, leafing through letters, playing the piano or pulling up beside an open fire. Elizabeth Farm is open to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/stories/turbulent-past | title=A Turbulent Past | publisher=Sydney Living Museums | accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Elizabeth Farm is associated with major figures who were prominent in the 19th century development of the colony, including John and Elizabeth Macarthur, and the Swann family in the 20th century. There is a large surviving collection of documentary evidence connected to the house, which contains part of the oldest surviving European construction in Australia. The garden contains some of the earliest European plantings in Australia including a Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia), 1805-planted olive (Olea europaea), kurrajong ([[Brachychiton populneus]]), Bunya pine ([[Araucaria bidwillii]]) and hoop pine ([[Araucaria cunninghamii]]). It is an example of early colonial architecture and early agricultural experiments.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-11&gt;Bravery 1997:13-14, 24, modified Read, S., 11/2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The property forms the core of a major historic farm estate which was highly influential in the development of the wool industry in Australia, the introduction and acclimatisation of plants and economic crops such as olives and vines. By its size, location and history of subdivision the property was influential on the development of the town of Parramatta.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The property is also significant in the history of conservation in NSW, being the first to be preserved by direct acquisition by the [[Government of New South Wales|State Government]], and the second property to have a permanent conservation order placed over it under the Heritage Act 1977.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-12&gt;Read, S., pers. comm. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

Elizabeth Farm was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

Elizabeth Farm is significant because of its association with major figures, in particular Elizabeth and John Macarthur, who were prominent in the early 19th century agricultural, political, cultural and architectural development of the colony.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

It was the centre of an estate on which some of the first experiments in pastoral and agricultural land use in Australia took place, particularly in the early development of the wool industry.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

It is associated with the Swann family for over sixty years, including their preservation of the buildings.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The farm house is part of a group of early colonial buildings (including [[Old Government House, Parramatta|Old Government House]], [[Hambledon Cottage]] and [[Experiment Farm Cottage|Experiment Farm]]) which reflect Parramatta's importance as an early agricultural area and as the second most important settlement in the colony.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The house's range of building styles reflect the adaption of traditional European architecture to the prevailing Australian climate.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The house is a record of the architectural ideas and ambitions of the colony's first fifty years.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The house shows growth from a vernacular cottage to a comfortable family home with some sophisticated detailing, all reflecting the development of colonial life.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The house is representative of the work of architects Henry Cooper and John Verge.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-9/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

The house is one of the most evocative houses relating to the earliest period of Australian European history and is one of the most aesthetically pleasing of colonial bungalows.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-9/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The farm has strong links with the Parramatta community.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-13&gt;Bravery 1997: 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The garden contains remnants of some of the earliest European plantings in Australia, including the European Olive. Older indigenous species include kurrajong and bunya bunya and hoop pines.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The farm has a large surviving collection of original documentary evidence relating to the house and its occupants, and the existence of some of the earliest provenanced furniture.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

The house is an example of the development of Australian building methods in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-9/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The Elizabeth Farm house is part of the oldest surviving construction in Australia and a rare survival of the earliest period of colonial architecture.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1-9/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1/&gt;

'''''Exit Through the Gift Shop: A Banksy Film''''' is a 2010 British [[documentary film]], directed by [[street artist]] [[Banksy]]. It tells the story of [[Mr. Brainwash|Thierry Guetta]], a French immigrant in [[Los Angeles]], and his obsession with [[street art]]. The film charts Guetta's constant documenting of his every waking moment on film, from a chance encounter with his cousin, the artist [[Invader (artist)|Invader]], to his introduction to a host of street artists with a focus on [[Shepard Fairey]] and Banksy, whose anonymity is preserved by obscuring his face and altering his voice, to Guetta's eventual fame as a street artist himself. It is narrated by [[Rhys Ifans]]. The music is by [[Geoff Barrow]]. It includes [[Richard Hawley]]'s "Tonight The Streets Are Ours".&lt;ref&gt;Willmore, Alison, [http://www.ifc.com/blogs/indie-eye/2010/01/exit-through-the-gift-shop.php "Exit Through The Gift Shop: It's a madhouse, this modern life."], ''The Independent Eye'', [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]] reviews of the Sundance Film Festival, 27 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The film premiered at the [[2010 Sundance Film Festival]] on 24 January 2010, and it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].

Since its release, there has been extensive debate over whether the documentary is genuine or a [[mockumentary]], although Banksy answered "Yes" when asked if the film is real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions|url=http://www.banksy.co.uk/QA/qaa.html|accessdate=27 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103163406/http://www.banksy.co.uk/QA/qaa.html|archivedate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Long plot|date=November 2015}} 
[[Mr. Brainwash|Thierry Guetta]] is a French immigrant living in Los Angeles who runs a vintage clothing shop. He also has an obsession with carrying a camera everywhere and constantly filming his surroundings. On a holiday in France, he discovers his cousin is [[Invader (artist)|Invader]], an internationally known [[street art]]ist. Thierry finds this fascinating, and accompanies Invader and his friends, including the artists [[André (artist)|Monsieur André]] and [[Zevs (artist)|Zevs]] on their nocturnal adventures, documenting their activities. A few months later, Invader visits Thierry in LA, and arranges a meeting with [[Shepard Fairey]]. Thierry continues filming Fairey's activities even after Invader has returned home to France. While Fairey is confused by Thierry's enthusiasm, Thierry states that he wishes to make a complete documentary about street art, and the two cross the nation, filming other artists at work, including [[Poster Boy (street artist)|Poster Boy]], [[Seizer]], [[Neck Face]], [[Sweet Toof]], [[Cyclops (artist)|Cyclops]], [[Ron English (artist)|Ron English]], [[C6.org|Dotmasters]], [[Swoon (artist)|Swoon]], [[Azil]], [[Borf]] and [[Buff Monster]]. What Guetta fails to tell Fairey is that he has no plan to compile his footage into an actual film, and never looks at his footage.

Guetta continues to hear more about [[Banksy]]—a prominent and particularly secretive artist. His attempts to contact Banksy are unsuccessful, until one day Banksy visits LA without his usual accomplice, who is refused entry to the US. Stuck in LA without a guide, Banksy contacts Fairey, who calls Guetta. Guetta becomes Banksy's guide in LA, later following him back to England, winning the privilege to film Banksy on his home turf—a feat that confuses Banksy's crew. Banksy, however, sees the opportunity to document street art, which he recognizes as having a "short life span", and after Guetta aids him in recording both production, deployment and crowd reactions to his "Murdered Phone-box" piece, asks him to film the preparations for his "Barely Legal" show. The two become friends, as Guetta provides Banksy with some relief from his anonymity. Returning to LA, Guetta becomes bored, and eventually produces his own stickers and decals, putting them up in the city.

Banksy's show is being prepared in [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]], and while in LA, Banksy decides deploying a [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay detainee]] doll in [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad#Disneyland version|Disneyland]]. He visits the location and places the doll while Guetta films it. A short while later, however, the rides stop, and the park's security catch Guetta, who is taken to an interrogation room, while Banksy switches clothes and blends into the crowd. During interrogation, Guetta refuses to admit any wrongdoing, and when allowed a phone call, covertly alerts Banksy to his situation. When confronted by security personnel, he destroys the evidence in his stills camera, but stashes the videotape in his sock and is eventually let go, much to the amazement of Banksy who then says he trusts him implicitly because of the incident.

A few days later, "Barely Legal" opens, and becomes an overnight success. Street art prices begin to rocket in auction houses. Banksy is stunned by the sudden hype surrounding street art, and urges Guetta to finish his supposed documentary. Guetta begins to edit together the several thousand hours of footage, and produces a film titled ''Life Remote Control.'' The result is 90&amp;nbsp;minutes of distorted [[fast cutting]] about random themes. Banksy questions Guetta's ability as a filmmaker, deeming his product "unwatchable", but realizes the street art footage itself is valuable. Banksy decides to try producing a film himself. To ensure that Guetta remains occupied, Banksy suggests he makes his own art show.

Guetta accepts the assignment, adopting the name "[[Mr. Brainwash]]", putting up street art in the city and six months later, re-mortgaging his business to afford renting copious equipment and a complete production team to create pieces of art under his supervision. He rents a former CBS studio to prepare his first show, "Life Is Beautiful", and scales up his production to something much larger than Banksy suggested, but with little focus. When Guetta breaks his foot after falling off a ladder, Banksy realises that the show may become a trainwreck, and sends a few professionals to help Guetta out. While the producers take care of the practical side of the show, Guetta spends his time on more publicity, asking support from both Fairey and Banksy, eventually taping up huge billboards with their quotes, and ultimately ending up on the cover of ''[[LA Weekly]].'' Preparation is seriously behind schedule, and Guetta's production team insists that he must make decisions&amp;mdash;yet Guetta spends his time hyping up and marketing his work for tens of thousands of dollars. Eight hours before the opening, paintings are still missing from the walls, and since Guetta is busy giving interviews, the eventual layout of the show is decided by the crew itself.

Despite all this, however, the show becomes a raging success with the crowd, and after the first week of the show, Guetta sells almost a million dollars' worth of art, with his pieces showing in galleries all around the world, to the utter confusion of both Fairey and Banksy. In an ending montage, Guetta insists that time will tell whether he is a real artist or not.

==Production==
Banksy has said in interviews that editing the film together was an arduous process, noting that "I spent a year [...] watching footage of sweaty vandals falling off ladders"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/drawn-from-the-shadows-wanted-man-comes-out-to-play-20100528-wlcx.html|title=Drawn from the shadows, wanted man comes out to play|author=Kylie Northover | work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The film was made by a very small team. It would have been even smaller if the editors didn't keep having mental breakdowns. They went through over 10,000 hours of Thierry's tapes and got literally seconds of usable footage out of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2010-04-08/art-books/banksy-revealed|title=Banksy Revealed?|author=Shelley Leopold}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Jaimie D'Cruz]] wrote in his production diary that obtaining the original tapes from Thierry was particularly complicated.

==Release and reception==
Film industry veterans John Sloss and Bart Walker founded a new distribution company to release the film in the US, Producers Distribution Agency (PDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/exit_strategy_bringing_banksy_to_the_masses | title="Exit" Strategy: Bringing Banksy to the Masses | publisher=[[indiewire.com]] | date=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a unique grassroots campaign, PDA brought the film to a US theatrical gross of $3.29MM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=exitthroughthegiftshop.htm | title=Box Office Mojo box office results | publisher=[[boxofficemojo.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscilloscope (company)|Oscilloscope Laboratories]] released ''Exit Through the Gift Shop'' on DVD and Blu-ray in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118026051?refCatId=13 | title=Oscilloscope to Release Banksy DVD | work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 96%, based on 108 reviews, and an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "An amusing, engrossing look at underground art, ''Exit Through the Gift Shop'' entertains as it deflates the myths and hype surrounding its subjects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/exit_through_the_gift_shop |title=Exit Through the Gift Shop (2010) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/exit-through-the-gift-shop |title=Exit Through the Gift Shop Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary]] in the [[83rd Academy Awards|2011 Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/25/AR2011012501905.html |title= Oscar nominations 2011: Complete list of Academy Award nominees |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date= 25 January 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York Film Critics Online]] bestowed its Best Documentary Award on the film in 2010. French journalist Marjolaine Gout gave it 4 stars out of 5, linking Mr. Brainwash and [[Jeff Koons]] and criticizing Thierry Guetta's art as [[toilet papering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ecranlarge.com/movie_review-read-21266-111691.php | work=Ecranlarge | title=Review of ''Exit Through the Gift Shop''|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax speculation===
One consistent theme in the reviews was the authenticity of the film: Was the film just an elaborate ruse on Banksy's part, or did Guetta really evolve into [[Mr. Brainwash]] overnight? ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' movie reviewer [[Ty Burr]] found it to be quite entertaining and awarded it four stars. He dismissed the notion of the film being a "put on", saying that "I'm not buying it; for one thing, this story's too good, too weirdly rich, to be made up. For another, the movie's gently amused scorn lands on everyone."&lt;ref&gt;Burr, Ty, [http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/04/23/in_exit_documentary_street_art_scene_becomes_a_farce/ "Exit Through the Gift Shop: Writing’s on the wall: In ‘Exit,’ street art scene becomes a farce"], ''The Boston Globe'', 23 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave it 3.5 stars out of 4, writing: "The widespread speculation that 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' is a hoax only adds to its fascination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100428/REVIEWS/100429978/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Exit Through the Gift Shop}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[SuicideGirls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt; filmmakers Jaimie D'Cruz and Chris King denied that it was a hoax, and expressed their growing frustration with the speculation that it was: "For a while we all thought that was quite funny, but it went on for so long. It was a bit disappointing when it became basically accepted as fact, that it was all just a silly hoax ... I felt it was a shame that the whole thing was going to be dismissed like that really {{ndash}} because we knew it was true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Jaimie+D%27Cruz+and+Chris+King%3A+Exit+Through+the+Gift+Shop/ | title=Jaimie D'Cruz and Chris King: Exit Through the Gift Shop | publisher=[[SuicideGirls.com]] | date=14 December 2010 | accessdate=24 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' movie reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that the film could be a new subgenre, a "prankumentary".&lt;ref&gt;Catsoulis, Jeannette, [https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/movies/16exit.html "On the Street, at the Corner of Art and Trash"], ''The New York Times'', 16 April 2010."“Exit” could be a new subgenre: the prankumentary. Audiences, however, would be advised simply to enjoy the film on its face — even if that face is a carefully contrived mask."&lt;/ref&gt;

Guetta in an interview said: "This movie is 100% real. Banksy captured me becoming an artist. In the end, I became his biggest work of art."&lt;ref&gt;Felch, Jason, [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/22/entertainment/la-et-oscar-exit-20110222 "Getting at the truth of 'Exit Through the Gift Shop'"], ''The Los Angeles Times'', 22 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guetta faced copyright issues following the release of the film. Glen Friedman, an American photographer,&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Glen, [[Glen E. Friedman#Books and exhibitions with significant Friedman contributions (partial listing)4]]&lt;/ref&gt; successfully sued Guetta over the use of a photograph of the rap group [[Run-DMC]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/08/banksy-thierry-guetta-lawsuit Run DMC Photograph]&lt;/ref&gt; Guetta tried to claim that he had altered it enough to be considered an original piece of art. However, the presiding judge over the case, Judge Pregerson, ultimately ruled Friedman's photograph was protected under the transformative fair use law.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Guetta also faced copyright claims from [[Joachim Levy]], a Swiss filmmaker, who edited and produced Guetta's film ''Life Remote Control'',&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; clips of which were shown in the film. Levy was not credited for his work he did on the film; however, Guetta owned the footage which was then licensed to Banksy.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/movies/awardsseason/06bagger.html The New York Times, Life Remote Control footage lawsuit]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geelong Maritime Museum''' is a volunteer-run Community group or not-for-profit historical museum located at 'The Stables', Osborne House, Swinburn Street, North Geelong Victoria, Australia since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=3651 Australian Heritage Database Osborne House, Place ID 3651]&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum was founded in about 1989, with ex Royal Navy Ldg. Tel, Robert Henry (Bob) Appleton OAM as the foundation Honorary Curator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upperiscope.net.au/uploads/1/9/6/6/19663981/bob_appleton.doc ''Up Periscope'' Submarine Association of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum collects and displays historic artefacts and documents related to the Maritime History of geelong and Victoria, and the history of the Victorian and Australian Navy's.

The Geelong Maritime Museum is housed in the renovated stables of [[Osborne House (Geelong)|Osborne House]], which was built in 1858 for local squatter, Robert Muirhead. Following a number of private owners, the building was the purchased by the Victorian State Government in 1900 as country residence for the Governor of Victoria, but never used for this purpose. Instead, it was bought by the Geelong Harbour Trust in 1905, and subsequently became the first Australian Naval College from 1913 to 1915,&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Australian Naval College - Inspection and report on sites and suggested sites'', NAA: MP472/1 18/13/5650, National Archives of Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Site for Naval College, Jervis Bay'', NAA: A6273 L1925/952, National Archives of Australia&lt;/ref&gt; a military hospital during the World War One, and the first home for the J Class Submarine of the Royal Australian Navy’s submarine service between 1919 and 1924. The Geelong Harbour Trust resumed control in 1929, and the Shire of Corio moved in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in 1938. It was a training centre for the army during World War Two, followed by the Corio Shire Council from 1943 to 1995 when the shire merged with the City of Geelong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intown.com.au/locals/geelong/attractions/geelong-naval-and-maritime-museum.htm Intown Geelong 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Displays at the museum include scale models of ships that either visited Geelong or called the port home and relics of the trade and navigation, as well as uniforms, weaponry and other naval artefacts. Exhibitions also presents the [[HMVS Cerberus]]  Gun Turret and the helm of the [[HMVS Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mhhv.org.au/?p=2315 Military History &amp; Heritage Victoria 2012 Military History &amp; Heritage Victoria]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Coley''' (18 October 1633 – 30 April 1704) was an astrologer and mathematician, and amanuensis of [[William Lilly]].

==Early life and career==
Coley was born, as shown in an inscription round a portrait of him by Robert White, found in some of his works, on 18 October 1633 in [[Oxford]]. His father was a joiner. In 1648 he became a clerk in the [[Parliamentary army]]; in 1654 he moved to London and worked as a ladies' tailor in [[Gray's Inn Lane]].&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=5899|title=Coley, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1656 he married and they had one child; in 1660, after his wife's death, he married again; their son born in 1661 died soon after birth. He taught himself mathematics, astrology, Latin and French. From 1663 he lived in [[Baldwins Gardens]], where he taught astrology and mathematics, and received clients. By the 1670s he had a flourishing practice.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

In 1669 Coley published ''Clavis Astrologiæ Elimata; or a Key to the whole Art of Astrology, new filed and polished''. It was well received. A second and enlarged edition was published in 1676; it was dedicated to [[Elias Ashmole]], and included a tribute by [[William Lilly]]. In 1672, following the success of ''Clavis'', he published the first number of his [[almanac]], and it appeared annually until his death.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb00&gt;{{cite DNB|first=Edward|last=Heron-Allen|authorlink=Edward Heron-Allen|wstitle=Coley, Henry|volume=11|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Lilly's amanuensis==
Coley acted as William Lilly's [[amanuensis]] from 1677, when the latter was stricken with the illness of which he eventually died. The editor of Lilly's ''Autobiography'' tells us: "His judgments and observations for the succeeding years till his death were all composed by his directions, Mr. Coley coming to [[Hersham]] the beginning of every summer, and stayed there till by conference with him he had despatched them for the press; to whom at these opportunities he communicated his way of judgment and other 'Arcana.{{'"}}&lt;ref name=dnb00/&gt;

Lilly constantly makes reference in his works to Coley's merit as a man and as a professor of mathematics and occult science. On his death in 1681, Lilly bequeathed to him his almanac ''Merlini Anglici Ephemeris, or Astrological Judgment for the Year'', which had reached its thirty-sixth year of publication; from 1681 it was issued by Coley "according to the method of Mr. Lilly."&lt;ref name=dnb00/&gt;

After Lilly's death, Coley continued to publish his predictions, as for instance, ''The great and wonderful Predictions of that late famous Astrologer, William Lilly, Mr. Partridge, and Mr. Coley concerning this present year 1683''. Coley attained considerable distinction as a mathematician: we are told by his almanac that he taught "arithmetic, vulgar, decimal, and logarithmical, geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, navigation, the use of the celestial and terrestrial globes, dialling, surveying, gaging, measuring, and the art of astrology in all its branches," at Baldwins Gardens. He corrected and enlarged [[Joseph Moxon]]'s ''Mathematics made easy'' (London, 1692), and also [[William Forster (mathematician)|William Forster]]'s ''Arithmetic, or that useful art made easie'' (London, 1686).&lt;ref name=dnb00/&gt;

Coley died in London on 30 April 1704.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Leaders and members of Identity Evropa, such as former leader Eli Mosley, have praised [[Nazi Germany]] and have openly pushed for what they say is the "Nazification of America".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In an attempt to boost its numbers, Identity Evropa has allied itself with the broader white nationalist [[alt-right]] and [[identitarian movement]]s,&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts" /&gt; and the group particularly targets college campuses,&lt;ref name="Hauslohner2"/&gt; by distributing slogans on fliers, posters, and stickers.&lt;ref name="Tab"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Harry Shukman|url=http://thetab.com/us/2017/02/15/nathan-damigo-identity-evropa-60697|title=Meet the neo-Nazi coming to put up white pride posters on your campus|date=February 15, 2017|work=The Tab US|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe" /&gt; It is one of several groups which have contributed to the rapid growth of white nationalism in the U.S. since 2015.&lt;ref name="Hauslohner2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ganim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/15/politics/hate-groups-spiked-in-2016/index.html|title='A resurgence of white nationalism': Hate groups spiked in 2016|authors=Sara Ganim, Chris Welch &amp; Nathaniel Meyersohnl|date=February 15, 2017|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TerrazasMorris"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eltecolote.org/content/en/features/alternate-reality-growing-acceptance-of-white-nationalism-in-trumps-america/|title=Alternate Reality: Growing acceptance of white nationalism in Trump's America|author=Alexis Terrazas &amp; Atticus Morris|website=[[El Tecolote (newspaper)|El Tecolote]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, it was reported that the group was seeing steep declines in membership. The collapse has been seen in other alt-right groups, and has been attributed to widespread public backlash against neo-Nazism and white supremacy since the [[Unite the Right rally|2017 Charlottesville rally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/matthew-heimbach-neo-nazi-white-nationalism-arrest-domestic-violence|title=Prominent US neo-Nazi arrested on domestic violence charge|last=Walters|first=Joanna|date=March 14, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 15, 2018|quote=And the SPLC reported that its team monitoring far-right hate groups had seen recent signs on extremist chat boards that members of the racist US group Identity Evropa have been leaving in significant numbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's founder, Nathan Damigo ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|m|ɪ|ɡ|oʊ}}), is a self-described member of the [[identitarian movement]].&lt;ref name="TerrazasMorris"/&gt; Damigo grew up in [[San Jose, California]],&lt;ref name="TerrazasMorris"/&gt; and was a member of the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] from 2004 to 2007.&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; In November 2007, Damigo robbed a [[La Mesa, California]], taxicab driver at gunpoint, believing that the man was Iraqi.&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last1=Sepulveda | first1=John | last2=Johnson | first2=Bert | date=August 14, 2017 | title=Berkeley was training ground for some in Charlottesville protests &amp;mdash; Berkeleyside | url=http://www.berkeleyside.com/2017/08/14/berkeley-training-ground-charlottesville-protests/ | website=Berkeleyside.com | publisher=Berkeleyside | access-date=August 16, 2017 | quote=During a psychological evaluation conducted for the court as part of the criminal case, Damigo said he attacked the cab driver, Changiz Ezzatyar, because he mistook him for an Iraqi.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damigo was convicted of [[armed robbery]] and was incarcerated for a year in county jail and four years in state prison.&lt;ref name="TerrazasMorris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; He said of the event that "it's something that I'm certainly not proud of," attributing his behavior to "major issues" after returning from Iraq.&lt;ref name="TerrazasMorris"/&gt;

In prison, Damigo began to read works by far-right figures, including former [[Grand Wizard|Imperial Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] [[David Duke]].&lt;ref name="TerrazasMorris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; He was also influenced by [[J. Philippe Rushton]] and [[Nicholas Wade]].&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; After being released from prison in 2014,&lt;ref name="MacLean"&gt;Alex MacLean, [http://www.uniondemocrat.com/home/4904465-151/white-nationalist-leader-not-from-sonora White nationalist leader not from Sonora], ''Union Democrat'' (December 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Damigo led the National Youth Front,&lt;ref name="MacLean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; the youth wing of the [[American Freedom Party]].&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; The group was classified as a hate group by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) and [[Anti-Defamation League]],&lt;ref name="MacLean"/&gt; with the SPLC reporting that it was founded by "racist Southern California skinheads that aims to deport immigrants and return the United States to white rule."&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; The National Youth Front later disbanded.&lt;ref name="MacLean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; Damigo founded Identity Evropa in March 2016.&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt;  His activities with "racist organizations" has been disavowed by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Gaffey, Conor (August 16, 2017) [http://www.newsweek.com/unite-right-charlottesville-nathan-damigo-trump-651266 "Unite the Right Organizer Disavowed by Family After Charlottesville Violence"] ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Unite the Right rally]], the leadership position passed onto Elliot Kline, aka Eli Mosley.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The group participated in the planning for the [[Richard B. Spencer#Speech at University of Florida|October 19, 2017 speech by Richard B. Spencer]], a white supremacist, at the [[University of Florida]], where Mosley also spoke. In addition to Spencer and Mosley, the speakers included [[Mike Enoch]], a white nationalist blogger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wfla.com/2017/10/19/richard-spencer-drowned-out-by-boos-at-uf-speech-call-for-firing-of-white-professors/|title=WATCH:  Richard Spencer gets drowned out by boos at UF speech|date=19 October 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/10/19/richard-spencer-shouted-down-university-florida-speech/781966001/ "'Go home, racist!'

==Views==

Identity Evropa is a neo-Nazi and white supremacist group;&lt;ref name="Globe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Cecilia Saixue Watt, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/11/redneck-revolt-guns-anti-racism-fascism-far-left Redneck Revolt: the armed leftwing group that wants to stamp out fascism], ''The Guardian'' (July 11, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; the organization espouses [[white supremacist]]&lt;ref name="Branson-PottsMelee"/&gt; and [[white separatist]] views.&lt;ref name="MacLean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Mike Anderson, [http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/pro-white-group-puts-up-posters-at-mines-and-bhsu/article_493b0c1b-baf7-5fc4-8c8b-a2512285c3a9.html Pro-white group puts up posters at Mines and BHSU], ''Rapid City Journal'' (March 5, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The group endorses [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; It "bills itself as a 'generation of awakened Europeans' who 'oppose those who would defame our history and rich cultural heritage'".&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; Damigo describes it as "an identitarian organization"&lt;ref name="Tab"/&gt; and says that the group's aim is to "act as a [[fifth column]], over time shifting the edifice of our political establishment" in favor of what he describes as "pro-white" interests.&lt;ref name="Nestel"/&gt; Identity Evropa's spokesman and director of administration, Reinhard Wolff, states that Identity Evropa is engaged in a "[[culture war]]" in an effort to create a "90 percent white" America.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;

The white supremacist slogan "You will not replace us" originated from the group, according to the Anti-Defamation League, after Damigo and other members of Identity Evropa appeared on camera chanting the words during [[LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner]]'s ''[[HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US]]'' project at New York's [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/blog/white-supremacists-adopt-new-slogan-you-will-not-replace-us|title=White Supremacists Adopt New Slogan: "You Will Not Replace Us"|work=ADL Blog|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|date=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity Evropa excludes [[Jews]] from membership because Damigo regards Jews as non-white.&lt;ref name="Tab"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Gabriel Thompson, [http://www.newsweek.com/golden-state-hate-extremism-history-california-561843 Golden State of Hate: Extremism's Long History in California], ''Newsweek'' (February 28, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Only those "of European, non-Semitic heritage" may join the group.&lt;ref name="Branson-Potts"/&gt; Damigo claims that "Jewish power, Jewish influence" has "been extraordinarily negative for people of European heritage".&lt;ref name="Tab"/&gt; He has refused to say whether he [[Holocaust denial|acknowledges the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tab"/&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has labeled Identity Evropa a white supremacist group,&lt;ref name="Onward"/&gt; and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), which tracks extremist groups in the United States, has designated it as a hate group.&lt;ref name="APSouthDakota"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/white-nationalist|title=White Nationalist|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=April 17, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their campus-centric advertising posters depict photos of classical Greek sculptures of men overlaid with various short slogans which urge whites to embrace cultural elitism.  Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the SPLC, states, "Identity Evropa is merely the latest iteration of the white-supremacist movement. Although you might think, based on their propaganda, that they're all about Plato and Aristotle and Socrates, in fact they're merely a gussied-up version of the Klan."&lt;ref name="Nestel"/&gt; [[Anna North]], writing in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', states that the group promotes racism under the guise of white racial pride and cultural identity for those who are of European ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/opinion/lets-become-great-again-the-flyers-said.html|title='Let's Become Great Again,' the Flyers Said|last=North|first=Anna|date=February 16, 2017|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

In December 2016, the group had roughly 200 members.&lt;ref name="MacLean"/&gt; In a February 2017 interview, Damigo claimed a membership of 300.&lt;ref name="Tab"/&gt; The group has distributed fliers on dozens of colleges campuses, including the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[UCLA]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[Penn State University|Penn State]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], and the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="Globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APSouthDakota"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ksfy.com/content/news/White-supremacist-posters-appear-at-2-South-Dakota-colleges-415430093.html|title=White supremacist posters appear at 2 South Dakota colleges|agency=Associated Press|date=March 5, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an ADL count, Identity Evropa was by far the most active white supremacist group on college campuses in 2017, responsible for 158 of the 346 incidents nationwide of the posting of white supremacist propaganda fliers.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Frazin, [https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2018-02-21/identity-evropa-elicits-concern-on-campus Identity Evropa Elicits Concern on Campus], ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' (February 21, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; These fliers typically show photos of [[Classical sculpture|classical]] and [[Neoclassicism#Sculpture|neoclassical sculpture]]. According to art critic [[Ben Davis (art critic)|Ben Davis]], the random use of dissimilar photos demonstrates a poor understanding of European culture and art history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Davis |first1=Ben |authorlink1=Ben Davis (art critic) |title=White Nationalism's New Love of Art History, Decoded|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/identity-evropa-posters-art-symbolism-881747 |accessdate=25 June 2018 |work=artnet News |date=7 March 2017|quote=But when you look into the sources, the images themselves suggest an awareness of this culture that doesn't go much deeper than visual cliché.

At Ohio State, the group has considered seeking recognized student organization status.&lt;ref name="Onward"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onwardstate.com/2017/04/13/meet-the-white-identitarian-group-here-at-penn-state-thats-growing-in-numbers/|title=White 'Identitarian' Group Identity Evropa Considers Seeking Student Org Recognition|date=April 13, 2017|website=Onward State}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's "#ProjectSiege" aims to "siege" college campuses with literature&lt;ref name="Onward" /&gt; in order to combat what Damigo describes as a "false anti-white narrative" by teachers, whom Damigo calls "charlatans."&lt;ref name="Nestel"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/10/veteran-posts-signs-at-colleges-telling-whites-to-be-great-again.html|title=Veteran Posts Signs at Colleges Telling Whites to Be 'Great Again'|last=Nestel|first=M. L.|date=October 10, 2016|website=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2016, Damigo and Identity Evropa members traveled to Washington, D.C., for a post-election conference hosted by the white supremacist [[National Policy Institute]], at which keynote speaker [[Richard B. Spencer]] and several other attendees rendered a [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref name="MacLean"/&gt;

During the [[2017 Berkeley protests]], Damigo punched a young woman, captured on video that subsequently went [[Viral video|viral]].&lt;ref&gt;Christin Ayers, [http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/04/16/viral-video-shows-white-supremacist-sucker-punch-berkeley-anti-trump-protester/ Viral Video Shows Student White Supremacist Sucker-Punch Berkeley Anti-Trump Protester], CBS San Francisco ([[KPIX-TV]]/[[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]]) (April 16, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Footage showed Damigo punching the woman in the face, then running away into the crowd.&lt;ref name="Branson-PottsMelee"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-nathan-damigo-stanislaus-state-20170417-story.html|title=Cal State Stanislaus to investigate white supremacist student who punched woman in Berkeley melee|last=Branson-Potts|first=Hailey|date=2017-04-17|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack prompted calls for Damigo's arrest or expulsion from [[Cal State Stanislaus]], where he is a student; the university subsequently said that it was investigating Damigo.&lt;ref name="Branson-PottsMelee"/&gt;

Damigo has been identified as a leader in the August 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]].  A news source that has interviewed him states that "Damigo has made these rallies a key driver for recruiting new members of the group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Bert|title=Californian Who Helped Lead Charlottesville Protests Used Berkeley as a Test Run|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/08/14/californian-who-helped-organize-charlottesville-protests-used-berkeley-as-a-test-run/|website=KQED News|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Peter Cvjetanovic, one of the members of Identity Evropa, was dubbed as the "angry torch guy" in the [[Unite the Right rally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/charlotteville-photo-student-peter-cvjetanovic-not-angry-racist-white-nationalists-uva-university-of-a7891791.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=August 14, 2018|date=August 14, 2017|last1=Khan|first1=Shehab|title=Charlottesville photo: Man shouting angrily at white supremacist rally insists he is not an 'angry racist'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2018, around 45 members of Identity Evropa, some dressed as construction workers, demonstrated outside the Mexican consulate in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], holding large letters that spelled out "Build the Wall".  The government of Mexico said it had written a diplomatic note to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] protesting the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reuters|title=Mexico Condemns Anti-Immigrant Chants Outside New York Consulate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/07/31/world/americas/31reuters-mexico-usa-racism.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, a group of several dozen Identity Evropa members hung a banner in [[Fort Tryon Park]] in [[Upper Manhattan]]. The banner, which said "Stop the invasion, end immigration", overlooked the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]]. The response of the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] and [[Inwood,  Manhattan|Inwood]] communities was to hold a "vigil against hate" at the same site on July 31.&lt;ref&gt;Del Signore, John {July 31, 2018) [http://gothamist.com/2018/07/31/fort_tryon_park_hate_group.php "White Supremacists Unfurl Anti-Immigration Banner In Fort Tryon Park"] ''[[Gothamist]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramey|first1=Corinne|title=White Nationalists Rally in Liberal New York|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-nationalists-rally-in-liberal-new-york-1533073903|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=July 31, 2018|date=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Krsnik''' or '''Kresnik''' is a type of vampire hunter, a shaman whose spirit wanders from the body in the form of an animal.  The ''krsnik'' turns into an animal at night to fight off the ''kudlak'', his evil [[vampire]] antithesis, with the ''krsnik'' appearing as a white animal and the ''kudlak'' as a black one.&lt;ref name=Perkowski&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkowski|first=Jan L.|title=The Darkling: A Treatise on Slavic Vampirism|year=1989|publisher=Slavica Publishers|location=Columbus, Ohio|isbn=978-0-89357-200-6|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''krsnik'' 's soul leaves the body, either voluntarily or due to a higher power, to fight evil agents and ensure good harvest, health, and happiness.&lt;ref name="Shamanism on Slovenian Territory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Šmitek|first=Zmago|title=Shamanism on Slovenian Territory?

Similar beliefs circulated among the Italian [[Benandanti]] cult. Also see [[zduhać]].

== In fiction ==
* In the anime series ''[[Trinity Blood]]'', a "Crusnik" is a [[Vampire fiction|vampire]] that feeds on the blood of other vampires. ''Lilith Sahl, Cain, Seth, and Abel Nightroad'' are [[Crusnik (Trinity Blood)|Crusnik]] who are much more powerful than regular vampires. In the anime series, they all take different forms: Cain appears as an [[angel]] with white wings, even though he is the [[antagonist]], whereas Abel appears slightly [[demon]]ic with black wings and red eyes, while being the [[protagonist]]. Kudlak also appears in the series as a bacillus that is responsible of the creation of "normal" vampires.
* ''Kresnik'' and ''Kudlak'' are recurring characters in the [[Shin Megami Tensei]] series of video games.
* ''Kresnik'' is the name of a mythological hero in ''[[Tales of Xillia]]''. A superweapon bearing the name "Lance of Kresnik" is a plot device. The sequel features a descendant named Ludger Will Kresnik. A machine named ''Kudlak'' is also present, though unimportant to the story.

'''Leroy Michael McGuirk''' (December 13, 1910 - September 9, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[wrestler]] and [[professional wrestling]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promoter]]. He was involved in professional wrestling for more than fifty years. As one of the longest surviving members of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), he was affiliated with the promotion from 1949 to 1982.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Garvin, Oklahoma]]. He suffered the loss of his father before he was twelve and had to endure the loss of sight in one of his eyes due to a swimming mishap. McGuirk overcame many adversities to persevere in wrestling. He started wrestling at [[Central High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Tulsa Central High School]] and competed at [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater|Oklahoma A&amp;M]] from 1928 to 1932 under Edward Gallagher.&lt;ref name=p222&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 222, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite losing in the quarterfinals of the 1930 NCAA Tournament, McGuirk claimed the 155-pound title at the 1931 NCAA Tournament on March 28 in Providence.&lt;ref name=p222/&gt; A year later, McGuirk competed in the 1932 NCAA Tournament at 174 pounds.

==Professional career==
After graduation from college, McGuirk went to work for [[Sam Avey]]. On March 5, 1934, he beat Hugh Nichols in [[Tulsa]] for the [[World Light Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=p222/&gt; He was also endorsed by the [[National Wrestling Association]].

===Championship runs===
McGuirk enjoyed several runs as champion. On May 16, 1938, McGuirk beat [[Danny McShain]] to capture his second world light heavyweight title.&lt;ref name=p222/&gt; The [[National Wrestling Association]] had a 190-pound title (later raised to 200) that was known as the [[World Junior Heavyweight Championship (National Wrestling Association)|World Junior Heavyweight Championship]]. McGuirk won this title on June 19, 1939 from John Swenski.&lt;ref name=p222/&gt;

Between Tulsa and Hollywood, McGuirk dominated the Junior Heavyweight division, but at least three other Junior Heavyweight Champions were recognized at the time. On December 28, 1949, McGuirk unified the National Wrestling Association World Junior Heavyweight Championship with the [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship|National Wrestling Alliance’s version]] by defeating Billy Goelz in [[Des Moines]].&lt;ref name=p222/&gt;

Leroy McGuirk is credited as the longest male single's champion of all time.  He captured the National Wrestling Association World Junior Heavyweight Title on 6-19-1939 and had to vacate the title on 2-7-1950, for a title run of 3886 days (10yr-7m-19d).

===Automobile accident===
On February 7, 1950, McGuirk’s career came to an end. In [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], McGuirk was being driven to a restaurant by his wrestling pupil, Robert "Bob" Clay. In an attempt to prevent a collision, Clay locked the car’s brakes, and McGuirk was thrown against the front windshield.&lt;ref name=p223&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 223, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuirk’s tinted glasses were shattered and the side of the glasses covering his good eye were fractured, blinding McGuirk permanently. It was another Oklahoman, [[Danny Hodge]], who rose to prominence in the Junior Heavyweight field. By 1960, Hodge became the principal headliner for McGuirk.

===Booking and promoting===
After the accident, Avey kept McGuirk as a partner. McGuirk became second vice-president of the NWA from September 1950 to August 1956, and from August 1959 to August 1960.&lt;ref name=p223/&gt; Between 1957 and 1958, McGuirk was made an honorary vice-president. One of McGuirk’s first challenges as vice-president was to reconcile the promotional war that occurred between women’s wrestling promoters [[Billy Wolfe]] and his ex-wife [[Mildred Burke]]. McGuirk aligned himself with Burke and hoped to resolve the dispute at the September 1953 NWA meeting in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 291, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1953, McGuirk was the primary [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] for the junior heavyweight champion, while coordinating talent from southwestern Missouri to Little Rock, across Oklahoma, and into parts of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 280, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being the booker, McGuirk also took on the opportunity to train promising wrestlers. One of his most promising was eventual NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Dick Hutton]]. In the May 10, 1953 edition of the ''Tulsa Daily World'', McGuirk said ''"He has a fine chance to get into the big money brackets. He has a lot to learn, but has the natural qualifications, and I won’t be surprised at anything he may accomplish."''&lt;ref&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 205, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton did not disappoint, as he beat [[Lou Thesz]] on November 14, 1957 at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 206, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avey and McGuirk’s actual territory covered most of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Said territory also included [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]] and [[Springfield, Missouri]], [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], plus [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], and [[Tyler, Texas]]. On January 4, 1958, McGuirk took over the entire business after Avey retired.&lt;ref name="p233"/&gt; Avey left wrestling to concentrate on his role as senior vice president of the Farmers and Merchants State Bank.&lt;ref&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 281, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest issues McGuirk faced was the tension that occurred due to sporadic visits by world champion [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] in the early 1960s. Many felt that the bigger promoters were locked in for visits by Rogers while territories such as McGuirk’s, [[Jim Crockett]] in Charlotte, [[Karl Sarpolis]] in Amarillo, and  [[Cowboy Luttrall]] in Tampa, to name a few, were perceived as the non-essential territories.&lt;ref&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 184, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bill Watts====
{{Main|Bill Watts}}
McGuirk had many people who worked for him as matchmaker: Leo Voss, Sam Menacker, Rip Tyler, Wayne Martin, and [[George Scott (wrestler)|George Scott]]. Of all those people, Cowboy Bill Watts played a big part in McGuirk’s promotion, both positively and negatively. His first real connection to McGuirk was in 1968, when McGuirk submitted the only vote in favor of passing the NWA Championship to him.&lt;ref name=p351&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 351, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGuirk and Watts worked together to promote Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana in the late 1970s. On July 22, 1978, their joint promotion of a wrestling show at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] drew an estimated 31,000 fans and a gate of $140,000.&lt;ref name=p351/&gt; A dispute between the two in August 1979 strained their friendship. While Watts incorporated Mid-South Sports Inc. and had agreements [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]], [[Eddie Graham]], [[Fritz Von Erich]], and [[Vincent J. McMahon]] that made the promotion thrive.&lt;ref name=p351/&gt; McGuirk became desperate and hoped that George Scott would help keep the territory afloat.

On February 23, 1981, Watts filed documents to bring Mid-South to Tulsa. Matters worsened as seven wrestlers went on strike on August 21. Their grievance was that McGuirk had not paid them for the previous weeks work.&lt;ref name=p351/&gt; Despite turning to Amarillo for wrestling talent, McGuirk saw the writing on the wall.

In 1982, McGuirk ceased operations and left the city open for Bill Watts and [[Mid-South Wrestling]] to take over.&lt;ref name=p233&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 233, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of McGuirk’s daughters, Michael, better known in wrestling as [[Mike McGuirk]], married [[B. Brian Blair]], a wrestler for Mid-South. Both eventually worked for the World Wrestling Federation: Blair as one half of the tag team [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]], and Mike McGuirk as an in-ring announcer.

==Honors==
McGuirk was inducted into the Oklahoma Athletic Hall of Fame in 1977.&lt;ref name=p233/&gt; He is also a member of the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]]. Of his charitable work, McGuirk is best known for working with [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed Lewis]]. They were responsible for instituting the NWA "Leader Dogs for the Blind" annual charity function.

He died on September 9, 1988 in [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore]].

The '''Library Božidar Kantušer''', formerly known as International Library of Contemporary Music (in French: Bibliothèque Internationale de Musique Contemporaine, B.I.M.C.), is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit association]] chartered under the French 1901 Law on associations. It was created in 1968 to promote contemporary music by facilitating access to published and unpublished [[Sheet music|scores]] from around the world. For this purpose, the [[Music library|library]] centralizes (without aesthetic bias) and lists the scores, and then facilitates their discovery by [[Computer science|computerized]] means. At its inception the association was subsidized by the [[Fontainebleau|City of Fontainebleau]] and the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Ministry of Culture]], further by the [[Paris|City of Paris]] and the ''Ministry of Culture''. Since 2006, the collection of ''scores'' and [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] (more than 24,500 documents in 2012) is available in ''Paris'' at the Médiathèque Hector Berlioz and through its [[Online public access catalog|OPAC]].

== Goals ==
« The dispersion of scores of music of our time among [[Publishing|publishers]] throughout the world (and especially the fact that most of them remain in the form of [[Music manuscript|manuscripts]]) represents an almost insurmountable obstacle for anyone wishing to obtain an exact idea of contemporary music production. Only an association of the persons actually concerned, that is to say the [[composer]]s and ''music publishers'' themselves, supported by musicians and other music professionals could overcome this problem. » 
(Excerpt from a B.I.M.C. bulletin)

== Means ==

=== Centralization and computerization ===
To allow the consultation of the deposited works and to establish the database necessary for the distribution of information, the library proposes to centralize the published and unpublished works of contemporary music (from the twentieth century on) and their recordings. The deposit of scores and recordings is open to all composers, without aesthetic bias, to the exclusion of pieces solely dedicated to education. The library regularly stimulates composers and publishers in depositing their works, emphasizing the promotional importance of such a deposit. In an effort of multi-centralization, of creating various consultation sites, for a few years composers and publishers were asked to submit several copies of each score. Cooperation talks were underway with the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], and the effort was carried out in the form of a second center in [[Slovenia]] from 1975 to 1985 (the idea was revived in 1999, then abandoned). 
[[File:Exemple annoté d'une fiche de la B.I.M.C..jpg|thumb|Annotated example of a B.I.M.C. index card]]
For each submitted work, an [[index card]] was established and printed numerously. To allow multiple filing of each index card, the database for each deposited score contained the following information: name and surname of the composer, year and country of birth as well as nationality, title of the work, duration, year of composition, [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] ([[nomenclature]]), possibly the publisher and the year of publication. Subsequently the data appeared in printed directories, and was eventually entered on the site of the Médiathèque Hector Berlioz. In addition, a biographical file is opened for each composer and made accessible. All information often not being specified in the scores, one of the major tasks of the association is to obtain all the data needed to establish an entry.

=== Diffusion of information ===
The distribution of data permitting an objective and comprehensive information on contemporary works of music is done nowadays online through the ''OPAC'' of the Hector Berlioz Mediathèque. Previously, printed directories, presented in two volumes - one classified by instrumentation, the other in alphabetical order of composers, were regularly updated, reprinted and sent to subscribers around the world. They held and still hold an important place in music libraries (academic or public) in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]. Initially (starting 1968), the diffusion of information was done by sending [[Library catalog|card catalog]]s to subscribers, allowing multiple approaches and regular updates. The seven card catalogs offered to subscription were ordered alphabetically by composer name, by instrumentation, by nationality and alphabetically, by nationality and instrumentation, by the duration of the work, by year of composition, by publisher (unpublished works by instrumentation). One same ''index card'', printed numerously and corresponding to one score, appeared in seven different ''card catalogs'', allowing to discover each work by seven different accesses. Interested parties subscribed to one or more card catalog of their choice, updating their catalogs as and when new cards were shipped. Index cards were shipped to subscribers as new works were deposited in the library.

== History ==
At its inception in 1968, composers such as [[Henri Dutilleux]], [[André Jolivet]], [[Darius Milhaud]] and [[Henri Sauguet]] gave their written support to the library. It also received a favorable press release, particularly in [[Les Lettres Françaises]], or with [[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]] welcoming the fortunate initiative. Many musical institutions from around the world soon began to follow with interest the development of the association. The first headquarters of the B.I.M.C. was in ''Fontainebleau''. It was situated on the first floor of the Villa Lavaurs, the basement housing technical services such as a recording studio and a press. In the early 1970s the headquarters was transferred to ''Paris''. Until 2002, the library was situated along the [[Seine]], on two floors of an annex to the Cité Internationale des Arts, and then moved to the CNR conservatory, rue de Madrid. Since 2006 the library is part of the Mediathèque Hector Berlioz at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. It was renamed ''Library Božidar Kantušer'' in honor of the composer [[Božidar Kantušer]], one of its founding members and its director from 1968 to 1999. The other founding members of the association are [[Léon Barzin]], [[Louis-Noël Belaubre]], Jacques Phytilis, [[Jean-Jacques Werner]], [[Pierre Wissmer]], Didier Duclos.

'''Marshall Field''' (August 18, 1834{{spaced ndash}}January 16, 1906) was an American [[entrepreneur]] and the founder of [[Marshall Field's|Marshall Field and Company]], the [[Chicago]]-based [[department stores]].  His business was renowned for its then-exceptional level of quality and customer service.  Field is also known for some of his philanthropic donations, providing funding for the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] and donating land for the campus of the [[University of Chicago]].

==Early life==
Marshall Field was born on a [[farm]] in [[Conway, Massachusetts|Conway]], [[Franklin County, Massachusetts|Franklin County]], [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;[[Orison Swett Marden|Marden, Orison Swett]]. [https://mises.org/daily/5013/How-Marshall-Field-Succeeded How Marshall Field Succeeded], ''[[Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt; the son of John Field IV and wife Fidelia Nash. His family was descended from [[Puritans]] who had come to America as early as 1650.

At the age of 17, he moved to [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]], [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts|Berkshire County]], [[Massachusetts]], where he first worked in a [[dry goods]] store.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Marshall Field &amp; Company Store|url={{NHLS url|id=78001123}} |format=pdf|date=March 1977 |author=Ralph J. Christian |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=78001123|title=''Accompanying six photos, exterior and interior, from 1960 and undated''|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(32&amp;nbsp;KB)}} (A biography of Marshall Field is included)&lt;/ref&gt; He left [[Massachusetts]] at the age of 18 for new opportunities in the rapidly expanding West. In 1856, at age 21, he went to live with his brother in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and obtained employment at leading dry goods merchant [[Cooley, Wadsworth &amp; Co.]], which was to become Cooley, Farwell &amp; Co. in 1857.

==Career==
Field quickly rose through the ranks of Cooley, Farwell &amp; Co. In 1862 for financial reasons Cooley left the firm.  That same year Field purchased a partnership and the firm reorganized as Farwell, Field &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Gale, “The Gay Nineties in America: A Cultural Dictionary of the 1890s,” Westport, Conn.: Greenwood, 1992, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John V. Farwell]] appreciated Field’s keen business acumen; however, when it came to personality, the two were very different. Field’s stuffy efficiency rode on Farwell’s more relaxed and cheery demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;Twyman, “History of Marshall Field &amp; Co.,” Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1954, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when business collaboration entailed extensive personal interaction, this partnership wouldn’t last long.

In January 1865, Field and a partner, [[Levi Leiter]], accepted an offer to become senior partners at the dry goods establishment of [[Potter Palmer]].  The new firm became known as "Field, Palmer, Leiter &amp; Co."  In 1867, after Field and Leiter could afford to buy him out, Palmer withdrew from the firm, and it was renamed "Field, Leiter &amp; Company." In 1867 Field, Leiter &amp; Company reported revenues of $12 million.&lt;ref&gt;Schlup, Leonard. "Historical Dictionary of the Gilded Age." (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2003), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Like many Chicago businessman, Field's company was badly affected by the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, but reopened relatively quickly.  The company also survived the [[Panic of 1873]] because of their relatively low levels of debt. By 1881 Field had forced Leiter to sell his share of the business, and changed the store's name to "Marshall Field and Company".

Field took an early 19th-century consumer landscape that was centered around the principle of [[caveat emptor]], or "buyer beware", and transformed it into a plush shopping experience fit for the Gilded Age. Unconditional refunds, consistent pricing and international imports are among the Field innovations that became standards in quality retailing. Field's employees were also instructed not to push products on uninterested customers as was common practice in stores of the period. The quotes "Give the lady what she wants" and "[[The customer is always right]]" are attributed to Field.{{efn|The latter may have been invented by [[Harry Gordon Selfridge]] while we was working for Field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/106700.html The customer is always right&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The original saying was, "Assume that the customer is right until it is plain beyond all question he is not."&lt;ref&gt;Schlup and Ryan, “Historical Dictionary,” M.E. Sharpe, 2003, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though most famous today for his retail business, during his lifetime his wholesale business made far more money.  During the 1880s, Field's wholesale business generated 5 times more revenue than retail annually.&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, James F. "The Marshall Field Wholesale Store: Materials Towards a Monograph." ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'', Vol 37, No 3, October 1978. pp 175-194. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/989208 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The wholesale business even had its own landmark building, the [[Marshall Field's Wholesale Store]], erected in 1887.  Revenue from the Marshall Field's retail business did not surpass the company's wholesale business until after Field's death.

Field was highly suspicious of [[trade union|organized labor]] throughout his career, and prohibited unionization among his employees. During the time of the [[Haymarket Riot]], the wives of the defendants initiated an appeal, to which all of the local businessmen agreed except for Field. Journalist and reformer [[Henry Demarest Lloyd]] led a national campaign to grant clemency. Even bankers like [[Lyman J. Gage]] favored clemency, believing that moderation would lead to improved relations between capital and labor. Potter Palmer and Charles Hutchinson were inclined to agree, but Marshall Field was not. A number of other men confided to Gage that they were not willing to publicly disagree with Field, the wealthiest and most powerful businessman in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2003|title=People &amp; Events: Marshall Field (1834-1906) and Midwestern Commerce |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/peopleevents/p_field.html |work=Chicago: City of the Century |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] Online |accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field would also oppose organized labor during the Teamster's Strike in 1905.

==Personal life==
Field avoided political and social intrigue, instead focusing on his work and on supporting his family and his favorite philanthropies. Field was a very active member of The [[Commercial Club of Chicago]] and the [[Jekyll Island Club]] aka The Millionaires Club on [[Jekyll Island, Georgia]].

Field married twice. In 1863, he married Nannie Douglas Scott of [[Ironton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawrencecountyohio.com/families/q_z/Scott1.htm Lawrence County, Ohio Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons and a daughter, but one son, Louis, died in 1866 as an infant. The surviving children were Marshall Field Jr. and [[Ethel Beatty|Ethel Field]]. Their son, Marshall Jr. (1868–1905), married Albertine Huck, and they were the parents of Gwendolyn Mary Field, who married [[Edmonstone baronets|Sir Archibald Charles Edmonstone, 6th Baronet]]. Field's Ethel was married twice: first to Arthur Magie Tree, to whom she bore one son, [[Ronald Tree]], and then in 1901 to [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty]], to whom she bore two sons, [[David Beatty, 2nd Earl Beatty]] and [[Peter Beatty|Peter]].

After the death of his first wife Nannie in 1896, Field married longtime friend Delia Spencer, widow Caton. They had no children together.

==Death ==
Field died in [[New York City, New York]], on January 16, 1906 at age 71 from a case of [[pneumonia]] contracted after playing [[golf]] on [[New Year's Day]] with his nephew, his secretary and [[Abraham Lincoln]]’s oldest son [[Robert Todd Lincoln|Robert Todd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fortune Builders: Chicago's Famous Families|author=Edwin Darby|publisher=Garrett County Press|date=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field was buried on January 19.  He was interred in the [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago.

==Legacy==
After his death, Field's estate was to be held in trust for 40 years for his two grandsons, Henry Field and [[Marshall Field III]]. In 1905, Field's fortune was valued at $125 million.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Schlup and James Ryan, “Historical Dictionary of the Gilded Age,” M.E. Sharpe, 2003, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry Field died in 1917 and was thus unable to collect his inheritance, leaving the Field fortune in the hands of Marshall Field III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Henry Field Dies in Hospital Here|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 9, 1917|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/07/09/96253971.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Field Museum of Natural History]] was named after him in 1894 after he gave it an endowment of one million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1996),  p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Field was initially reluctant to do so, reportedly saying "I don't know anything about a museum and I don't care to know anything about a museum. I'm not going to give you a million dollars."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Alexander (1996), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; However he later relented after railroad supplies magnate [[Edward E. Ayer]], another early benefactor (and later first president) of the museum, convinced Field that his everlasting legacy would be achieved by financing the project.&lt;ref&gt;See Alexander (1996), pp. 55–56. Ayer reportedly convinced Field with the words, "You can sell dry goods until hell freezes over, but in 25 years, you will be absolutely forgotten." See Anderson (1921).&lt;/ref&gt; The year after his death the Field Museum received a further $8,000,000 in accordance with his [[Will (law)|will]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1996), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Chicago]] was founded by both Field and New York's [[John D. Rockefeller]], to rival nearby [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]'s [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/menofaffairsgall00chic#page/1/mode/1up Men of Affairs: a gallery of cartoon portraits], Chicago Evening Post, 1906; page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''McLaughlin Planetarium''' is a former working [[planetarium]] whose building occupies a space immediately to the south of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in [[Toronto]], at 100 Queen's Park. Founded by a grant from philanthropist Colonel [[R. Samuel McLaughlin]], the facility was opened to the public on October 26, 1968. It had, for its time, a state-of-the-art electro-mechanical [[zeiss projector|Zeiss]] planetarium projector that was used to project regular themed shows about the stars, planets, and cosmology for visitors. By the 1980s the planetarium's sound-system and domed ceiling were used to display dazzling music-themed laser-light shows. The lower levels of the planetarium contained a gallery called the "Astrocentre" that featured space-related exhibits, related artifacts on the history of [[astronomy]] and was also home of the world's first commercial [[Stellarium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stellarium.com/html/royal_ontario_museum.html Stellarium: Royal Ontario Museum, accessed August 6, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202174637/http://www.stellarium.com/html/royal_ontario_museum.html |date=December 2, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1978, there was a decline in attendance that lasted for four years while major construction was being undertaken at its sibling institution, the adjacent [[Royal Ontario Museum]]. This work also entailed the demolition of part of the planetarium's facilities. Though attendance picked up when the museum reopened in 1984, the planetarium was forced to close on November 5, 1995, due to provincial budget cuts to the museum. The planetarium's exhibits, artifacts and theatre facilities were subsequently dismantled and dispersed. For a brief period it housed the Children's Own Museum. It is now used solely for offices and as a storage facility for the museum.&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"&gt;Browne, Kelvin. &lt;cite&gt;Bold Visions: The Architecture of the Royal Ontario Museum&amp;mdash;Souvenir Edition&lt;/cite&gt;. p.21.

Early in 2009, the R.O.M. announced that it had sold the building and site to the University of Toronto, which plans to demolish the existing building to make way for additional facilities.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090127.BARBER27/TPStory/Comment | title=U of T gets room to grow, ROM gets out of a jam | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | accessdate=2009-02-20 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailycommercialnews1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://dailycommercialnews.com/article/id32730 | title=Royal Ontario Museum agrees to sell McLaughlin Planetarium site to University of Toronto | publisher=''Daily Commercial News and Construction Record'' | accessdate=2009-02-20 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220123817/http://dailycommercialnews.com/article/id32730 | archivedate=2012-02-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, the university announced preliminary plans for new facilities to be built on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/27/petition-launched-to-save-mclaughlin-planetarium-from-demolition.html|title=Petition launched to save McLaughlin Planetarium from demolition|last=Beeston|first=Laura|date=|website=Toronto Star|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
Proposals for building a planetarium in Toronto date back to 1944, but serious planning only started in 1962, thanks to a bequest made by a former member of the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]] (RASC). In May 1964 the Chairman and the President of the [[University of Toronto]] gave their support for the idea to the RASC, and suggested a site near the existing [[Royal Ontario Museum]], adding that significant financial support would have to come from outside the University to make it possible.

In November 1964 Canadian businessman Colonel [[Sam McLaughlin|R. Samuel McLaughlin]] announced plans for donating money directly towards establishing a planetarium in Toronto. He was inspired by the recent construction of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] in [[New York City]], named after [[Charles Hayden (banker)|Charles Hayden]], who had been a friend and associate on the board of [[CVRD Inco|International Nickel]]. McLaughlin donated $2 million for the building's construction, and gave an additional $1.15 million as an ongoing endowment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;''The McLaughlin Planetarium'', Henry C. King, 1969, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Toronto]], which owned and operated the Royal Ontario Museum prior to becoming a separate, provincially funded body, donated land adjacent to the museum. The building was constructed in an area that had formerly been a park belonging to the museum, and also required the demolition of a mansion at 86 Queens Park that had been the residence for the President of the University of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;MacRae, Donald A. &lt;cite&gt;The Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&lt;/cite&gt;. Vol. 59, No. 6, p.249, December 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designed by architects [[George Wallace Gouinlock|Allward and Gouinlock]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torarchcons.org/riv-press/gmnov26.html ''A modern tragedy: At long last, our mid-20th-century buildings are gaining popular respect. But is it too little, too late?'' by Alex Bozikovic, Globe &amp; Mail, Saturday, November 26, 2005, accessed July 8, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070724133221/http://www.torarchcons.org/riv-press/gmnov26.html |date=July 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the engineering firm Stone and Webster Canada, Ltd.&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"/&gt; in 1965. Colonel McLaughlin unveiled a model of the building at his 94th birthday celebration, which was held in his honour at the museum in September of that year. It was hoped that the building would be open by Canada's [[centennial]] in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = MacRae, Donald A. | journal = [[The Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]] | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | page = 252 | date = December 1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but construction delays forced the opening to October 26, 1968.&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"/&gt;

In addition to what was built, the original plans also called for a multi-story parking garage, a 550-seat conventional movie theatre, and a direct underground link to the [[Museum (TTC)|Museum]] subway stop. These features were deemed too costly and were never built.&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"&gt;''Stars in the Ceiling'', Thomas Clarke. Rotunda, Summer 1982, Volume 15, Number 2, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The building contained four floors: 
* a basement containing a lecture hall that hosted meetings of the Toronto branch of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, as well as some general storage rooms;
* a ground floor that featured a small store selling space-themed merchandise, a small library, coat-check room, a prominent bronze bust of Colonel McLaughlin, and the box office and staff lounge (not accessible to the public);
* a second floor, called the "Astrocentre", which featured various astronomical exhibits and a line to the adjacent R.O.M; and
* a third floor, called "The Theatre of the Stars", was devoted wholly to astronomical shows, and featured a Zeiss planetarium projector along with 85 slide and video projectors used to recreate starry skies, along with two back rooms that housed computers, cooling systems, and audio/visual controllers. The public theatre could seat 340 people at a time, and contained a sound system of approximately 25,000 watts.

==The Building==
The dominant feature of the building is the dome, which rises 25.3 meters (83&amp;nbsp;ft) from the ground, and has an outer diameter of 27.7 meters (91&amp;nbsp;ft). The dome structure is layered, with an outer waterproofed casing of [[reinforced concrete]] 4 centimeters (2.5&amp;nbsp;inches) thick, and an inner concrete dome that is insulated by a layer of urethane foam.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

The projection dome was separate from the outer dome, and was 23 meters (75.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter. Made of curved aluminum sheets, it was [[lap joint]]ed to create a continuous spherical surface. The sheets were painted white and perforated with 2.5-millimeter (0.1&amp;nbsp;inch) holes, which were designed to let sound through and reduced echoes in the cavernous space.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

[[Image:McLaughlin Planetarium 1973.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A quote from Dante's Divine Comedy within the entrance hall of the main floor of the McLaughlin Planetarium]]

The building had two main entrances: a main entrance at ground level that faced east onto Queen's Park Drive, and a connecting passageway from the Royal Ontario Museum from what used to be the Mineralogy Gallery. On the wall opposite from the ticket booth and coat check was an evocative quote from [[Dante's|Dante Alighieri]] [[Divine Comedy]]. Admission to either facility allowed visitors to see exhibits in both buildings, though a planetarium show cost extra.

==Zeiss-Jena planetarium projector==

8 - Planetary projectors (South)&lt;br /&gt;
9 - Star Globe (South)&lt;br /&gt;
10 - Compass point projector]]
The [[planetarium projector]] was the focal piece of equipment at the planetarium. It was a Universal Projection Planetarium type 23/6, made by Kombinat [[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] [[Carl Zeiss]] in [[Jena]], in what was then [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;''The McLaughlin Planetarium of the Royal Ontario Museum'', Jena Review. 1984: no. 3, p 144.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The East German-made projectors of the time cost less than their equivalents made by the [[Carl Zeiss]] firm located in [[West Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} can't find a reference for this; commenting out until I can find one --&gt;

The planetarium projector was a {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=on}}-long dumbbell-shaped object, with {{convert|29|in|mm|adj=on}}-diameter spheres attached at each end representing the night sky for the northern and southern hemispheres. Connecting the two spheres was a framework that held nearly 150 individual projectors, including those dedicated to the planets, the Sun, and specific stars.

Improvements were made to the original planetarium projector over the years, allowing for special effects that could show close-up displays of specific planets, and the Sun and Moon projectors could replicate the experience of a [[solar eclipse|solar]] or [[lunar eclipse]].&lt;ref&gt;''The McLaughlin Planetarium of the Royal Ontario Museum'', Jena Review. 1984: no. 3, p 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:McLaughlin Planetarium Star Theatre Side View,jpg.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Zeiss-Jena planetarium projector in action during a show.]]
The projector could be controlled by a console where an individual presenter would provide specific talks or lectures. By the mid-1970s, automation features were added, which led to the creation of prerecorded shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballantyne.com/rjb_resume/resume_rjb.html Resumé of Robert Ballantyne, Planetarium Producer-Curatorial from July 1968 to October 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; Most visitors to the facility would have seen an automated 40- to 45-minute audio/visual show on a particular space-related topic. Two types of shows were typically alternated on a daily basis: one aimed at families with young children and another aimed at older children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;Undated Media Release (likely early 1990s), issued on behalf of the Royal Ontario Museum Media Relations department&lt;/ref&gt; Typical shows aimed at both audience types were built around themes such as space travel, the mythical stories behind the [[constellation]]s, and around [[Christmas]]-time, a show that investigated theories on stellar explanations for the [[Star of Bethlehem]]. A listing from 1970 includes shows titled ''The Story of Eclipses'', which looked at how solar eclipses occur and their scientific importance, ''Man and the [[Zodiac]]'' which explored the history of [[mythology]] and [[astrology]] with regard to the night sky, and ''The Planet [[Venus]]'' which surveyed the history of the planet in mythology, the planet's motion across the sky and featured imagined views from its surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Creighton, Harlan | journal = Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | page = 323 | date = 1970 | bibcode = 1970JRASC..64..323C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovations in the late 1970s and early 1980s==
When plans were drawn up for a major expansion of the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum in the mid-1970s, it was initially assumed that the planetarium, then still a comparatively new facility, would be left untouched. As the scope of the expansion increased, it was realized that its north annex would need to be demolished in order to make way for the museum's need for a wing devoted to curatorial facilities. As a result, a theatre entrance, sound studio, workshop, passenger elevator and a third of the existing gallery area of the planetarium had to go. The remaining gallery area was removed in March 1978 to make space for temporary space to replace the workshop and studio.

Significant changes to the planetarium were made during this time, including the addition of a new spiral staircase that led straight to the Theatre of the Stars, an adjacent elevator for the elderly and disabled, and a larger gallery space on the second floor.

The planetarium remained at normal levels of service during this renovation period, but attendance dropped significantly, particularly when the adjacent museum was closed for a period of two years during the most intensive phase of its [[Royal Ontario Museum#Second expansion|second major expansion]]. In all, the construction phase lasted for four years, from 1978 to 1982. In particular, some school groups that could justify the expense of seeing the museum and a planetarium show in a single day's outing had difficulty justifying a visit solely to the planetarium.&lt;ref name="autogenerated17"/&gt;

==The 1980s and early 1990s==
Some of the automated "star shows" that appeared in this time interval include: "Planets, Stars, and Galaxies", a general show about our knowledge of astronomy at the time; "Mars, the Journey Begins", the story of the exploration of Mars (from prehistory to the then-present), and possible future plans for terraforming Mars; "Beyond the 4th Dimension", which explored, in layman's terms, the 4 dimensions of General Relativity, the Big Bang and inflation, and the new (at the time) theories of physics that postulated that space has up to 11 dimensions; some of these shows featured creative and novel sound tracks composed by composer-in-residence [[Mychael Danna]].

[[File:McLaughlin Planetarium Laser Show 1977.jpg|thumb|Typical Laser Show at the McLaughlin Planetarium (1977)]]

While the main attraction continued to be the astronomical shows put on during the day, in the early 1980s, regular laser light shows became a staple evening's entertainment in the city. Typical shows included "Laser [[Pink Floyd|Floyd]]: Dark Side of the Moon", "Laser [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]]", "Sgt. Peppers Laser Light Show" and later, such shows of more contemporary musical artists such as "Laser [[Depeche Mode]]", "Laser [[Nine Inch Nails|NIN]]" and "Laser [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]". These shows were held under the name "Laserarium" rather than that of the planetarium, though the laser-light and star shows were held in the same building. The laser shows were created by the [[Florida]]-based firm [[Audio Visual Imagineering]], whose shows are also seen at other planetaria.

Corporate events were promoted through The Planetcorp and included  such events as a CTV Fall season launch as well as corporate AGMs of Sun Microsystems and product launches from NEC and other companies.

[[Image:McLaughlin Planetarium Astrocentre.jpg|thumb|left|320px|A view of part of the McLaughlin Planetarium Astrocentre Gallery.]]

Other exhibits in the revamped Astrocentre included a new 50-seat mini-theatre, wall murals illustrating the phases of the moon, plus an increasing number of hands-on exhibits and interactive computer-driven displays. There were also displays of astronomical globes, an [[orrery]] and pictures of the planets, many taken by contemporary space probes. The Astrocentre also featured the world's first commercial [[Stellarium]], a slowly rotating display containing a 3D representation of almost a thousand stars in our immediate stellar neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stellarium.com/html/royal_ontario_museum.html Stellarium: Royal Ontario Museum, accessed December 30, 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202174637/http://www.stellarium.com/html/royal_ontario_museum.html |date=December 2, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
The McLaughlin Planetarium was closed on November 5, 1995. The president of the ROM stated that the closure of the planetarium was due to a combination of falling attendance and a declining interest in space, and that the closure was necessitated by provincial budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, John. ''Turning on the Stars'', The Bulletin, December 18, 1995. http://www.news.utoronto.ca/bin/bulletin/dec18_95/comment.htm. Retrieved August 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grey, Dennis. 'Toronto Centre's Former Home to be Demolished'', RASC Toronto Centre, http://toronto.rasc.ca/content/McLaughlinDemolition.shtml. Retrieved August 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision came as a surprise to many, as attendance had rebounded in recent years, and the planetarium was one of few in North America at the time that was turning a profit. The closure meant that 40 people lost their jobs.

Despite the ROM citing lowered attendance figures, proponents of the planetarium have alleged that the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] [[Ontario]] provincial government of the time, led by [[Mike Harris]], was looking for an instant and visible $600,000 cut to the ROM's operating budget. No succeeding provincial government has shown an interest in reversing this decision.&lt;ref name="astrobuffs"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the announcement, the exhibits, seating and wiring were dismantled or removed. Some of the signs and paintings were recovered by the RASC, which had a permanent workspace located within the facility, and are now on display at the [[E.C. Carr Astronomical Observatory]] in [[The Blue Mountains, Ontario]] and at [[David Dunlap Observatory]] in [[Richmond Hill, Ontario]]. The original Zeiss-Jena projector was bought as a museum piece by [[York University]] for the sum of $1, subsequently dismantled, and placed into storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toronto.rasc.ca/content/McLaughlinDemolition.shtml "Toronto Centre's Former Home to be Demolished", accessed December 22, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the University has offered the mothballed projector to other planetaria seeking parts to repair their existing electro-mechanical planetarium projectors.

==After the closure==
[[Image:McLaughlinPlanetarium-Sept2-07.jpg|thumb|300px|A picture of the McLaughlin Planetarium building, taken in 2007 shortly after construction on the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum was completed. Portable construction offices are located where the main entrance once was.]]

The planetarium has been reopened for other purposes since it closed its doors as a planetarium in 1995. On March 5, 1998, an initial three-year agreement was signed that brought the Children's Own Museum to the second floor of the planetarium, where the Astrocentre used to be. Due to impending construction at the adjacent Royal Ontario Museum, the contract was not renewed in late 2002, and the Children's Own Museum has been looking for a new location ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensownmuseum.org/ Children's Own Museum, accessed January 15, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; During its three-year tenure in that building, it hosted nearly a half-million visitors. The institution still exists, though it currently (as of 2009) has no physical home. It is currently seeking suitable space to use in future endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.childrensownmuseum.org/
|title=Children's Own Museum
|publisher=www.childrensownmuseum.org
|accessdate=2009-08-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime the organization has participated in various children's events around the city.

Later in 2002, a traveling exhibit of costumes, props and models used in the making of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]] trilogy ran for four weeks at the planetarium.&lt;ref name="eyeweekly"&gt;{{cite news|title=Save the planetarium for the real stars|last=Keenan|first=Edward|date=November 11, 2002|work=[[Eye Weekly]] |publisher=Eye Weekly Newspapers }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last public exhibition housed in the building. Up until 2007, the building has primarily served as office space and storage for exhibits that have been moved out of the R.O.M. while the [[Royal Ontario Museum#Third expansion|Lee-Chin Crystal wing]] was under construction.

Ever since the planetarium's closing, there have been groups that have lobbied for its reopening.&lt;ref name="eyeweekly"/&gt; At first, efforts concentrated on reopening the existing facility, but in more recent years, the focus has shifted to establishing a wholly new permanent planetarium facility elsewhere in downtown Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller educational planetaria still exist in the Toronto region. At some time after 1995, [[Seneca College]] closed their [[Roberta Bondar]] Earth and Space Centre planetarium.  The [[Ontario Science Centre]] on Don Mills Road operates a high-resolution digital planetarium with funding from [[CA, Inc.]], and the Royal Ontario Museum also offers a small, portable, inflatable planetarium for school groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rom.on.ca/schools/starlab.php Royal Ontario Museum - Starlab] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502102330/http://www.rom.on.ca/schools/starlab.php |date=2006-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the closing, the [[Ontario Science Centre]] has taken over the McLaughlin Planetarium's role as Toronto's public planetarium, though using a much smaller facility.

On April 14, 2004, the directors put out a call "for expressions of interest" to redevelop the space occupied by the planetarium.  Seeking additional funding to cover the costs of the second phase of the expansion and redevelopment of the museum, the directors of the museum had planned on erecting luxury [[condominium]]s on the space currently occupied by the planetarium. This proposal was dropped on November 7, 2005, due to extensive public opposition to the construction of a tall residential building in a district of low-rise public buildings.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20051108/ROM08/TPNational/?query=royal+ontario+museum | title=ROM condo-tower plan scrapped | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | accessdate=2005-11-10}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was reported that R.O.M. director [[William Thorsell]] was planning to revive the scheme to place a residential tower on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070524.re-mays0525/BNStory/RealEstate | title=Plans for a high-rise condo next to the Royal Ontario Museum were shelved in 2005, but the idea isn't dead yet | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=May 25, 2007 | accessdate=2007-07-08 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930060615/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070524.re-mays0525/BNStory/RealEstate | archivedate=September 30, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2009, the R.O.M. announced that it had sold the building and the site for $22 million to the University of Toronto, who originally planned to demolish the existing building and build additional facilities for its law and business faculties.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailycommercialnews1"/&gt;

On September 9, 2014, the University of Toronto announced a new museum and academic complex.  It was to include the [[Jewish Museum of Canada]], a Faculty of Music performance hall, research centres and History department academic space.  In its early stages of planning and approvals the project lacked complete funding at the time of the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/09/new_museum_to_replace_mclaughlin_planetarium | title=New museum to replace McLaughlin Planetarium | publisher=blogTO | date=September 9, 2014 | accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, the university announced it would proceed with construction of what is now to be called the Centre for Civilizations and Cultures, without the participation of the Jewish Museum of Canada because the UJA "needed to focus on more pressing funding priorities." The project is to be designed by [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]] of New York in collaboration with   [[architectsAlliance]] of Toronto.&lt;ref name=culture&gt;{{cite news|title=U of T plans to build new cultural, academic centre|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2016/01/21/u-of-t-plans-to-build-new-cultural-academic-centre.html|accessdate=January 21, 2016|work=Toronto Star|date=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre is to house the university's Department of History, its Department of Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations, the Institute of Islamic Studies and the research arm for the Tanenbaum Centre for Jewish Studies, and a new 250-seat performance hall for the university's Faculty of Music.&lt;ref name=culture/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7156">'''Metacinema''', also '''meta-cinema''', analogous to [[metafiction]] in literature, is a mode of filmmaking in which the film informs the audience that they are watching a work of fiction. Metacinema often references its own production, working against narrative conventions that aim to maintain the audience's [[suspension of disbelief]].&lt;ref&gt;Ames, Christopher. Movies About the Movies. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements of metacinema includes scenes where characters discuss the making of the film or where production equipment and facilities are shown.

==History==
Examples of metacinema date back to the early days of narrative filmmaking. In the 1940s, backstage musicals and comedies like ''[[Road to Singapore]]'' ([[Victor Schertzinger]], 1940) ''and [[Hellzapoppin' (film)|Hellzapoppin']]'' ([[H. C. Potter]], 1941) exhibited a vogue for exploration of the medium of film at the same time as the monopolistic grip of Hollywood studios was loosening allowed more space for  creative self-examination.&lt;ref&gt;Ames, Christopher. Movies About the Movies. p. 41, 56&lt;/ref&gt;  Metacinema can be identified in art cinema of the 1960s like ''[[8½]]'' ([[Federico Fellini]], 1963) or ''[[The Passion of Anna]]'' ([[Ingmar Bergman]], 1969), and it can often be found in  the self-reflexive filmmaking of the [[French New Wave|Nouvelle Vague]] in films like ''[[Contempt (film)|Le Mépris]]'' ([[Jean-Luc Godard]], 1963) and ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' ([[François Truffaut]], 1973).&lt;ref&gt;Stam, Robert. Reflexivity in Film and Literature.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metacinema continues to flourish in art films and comedies where experimentation with narrative conventions is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Steven. Comedian Comedy: A Tradition in Hollywood Film.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''multi-field dictionary''' is a [[specialized dictionary]] that has been designed and compiled to cover the terms within two or more subject fields. Multi-field dictionaries should be contrasted with [[single-field dictionary|single-field dictionaries]] and [[sub-field dictionary|sub-field dictionaries]].

The typology consisting of these three dictionaries is important for a number of reasons. First of all, a multi-field dictionary is an example of the ordinary technical dictionary, covering a large number of separate subject fields, e.g. banking, economics, finance, insurance and marketing. 

The main problem with multi-field dictionaries is that they tend to cover one or two subjects extensively, whereas the vast majority of subject are only represented by a very limited number of terms.

Secondly, the typical multi-field dictionary tends to be a [[minimizing dictionary]], i.e. it covers only a limited number of terms within the subjects covered.

Thirdly, if the [[lexicographer]]s intend to make a bilingual, maximizing multi-field dictionary they run into problems with the large amount of data that has to be included in the dictionary.

Consequently, the best coverage of linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within the subject field covered by a dictionary will be found in a [[single-field dictionary]].

{{History of Portugal}}
The '''National Union''' ({{lang-pt|União Nacional}}) was the [[One-party state|sole legal party]] of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo regime]] in [[Portugal]]. Ideologically the National Union was an authoritarian, [[clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] organisation. It was dominated by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] during most of its existence. Unlike in most single-party regimes, the National Union was more of a political arm of the government, rather than holding actual power over it.

==History==
The party was founded in 1930 during the period of the [[Ditadura Nacional]]. Officially it was not a political party, but an "organisation of unity of all the Portuguese".  For the next 43 years, it effectively held a monopoly of power in the Estado Novo.  The opposition [[Movement of Democratic Unity]] was legal between 1945 and 1948, but even then the political system was so heavily rigged that it had no realistic chance of winning.

The party won all seats in elections to the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|National Assembly of Portugal]] from 1934 to 1973.  Opposition candidates were nominally allowed after 1945, but prematurely withdrew in the 1945 and 1973 legislative elections.  In 1970, two years after Salazar had been replaced as leader and prime minister by [[Marcelo Caetano]] the name of the party was changed to '''Acção Nacional Popular''' ('''People's National Action'''), and subsequent to Salazar's retirement faced formal competition in the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1969|1969 legislative election]], nevertheless winning all [[Electoral district|constituencies]] in a landslide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portugal, 1969|url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/PORTUGAL_1969_E.PDF|work=PORTUGAL - Assembly of the Republic - Historical Archive Of Parliamentary Election Results|publisher=[[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (www.ipu.org)|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party had no real philosophy apart from support for the regime. As a result, it melted away after the [[Carnation Revolution|Portuguese Revolution of 1974]].  It has never been revived, and no party claiming to be its heir has won any seats in the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] in modern Portugal.

'''''New York''''' is a 1930 travel book by the French writer [[Paul Morand]]. Morand visited New York four times between 1925 and 1929 and shares his experiences from those trips, with a non-native reader in mind. An English translation by Hamish Miles was published in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-york/oclc/1816205|title=New York|work=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Morand's impressions of New York are both positive and negative. He disapproves of the upper class, the fashion, [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] and the area around [[Times Square]]. He is impressed by the [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] and the buildings around [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], which he regards as genuinely American and not false imitations of historical styles. He makes recurring references to the contemporary saying that "the Jews own New York, the Irish run it, and the Negroes enjoy it". In his conclusion, he writes: "I love New York because it is the greatest city of the universe and because its people are the toughest, the only people who, after the war, went on building, and who do not merely live on the capital of the past, the only ones, besides [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Italy]], who do not demolish but construct."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lukacs|first=John|authorlink=John Lukacs|year=1993|url=http://www.city-journal.org/story.php?id=1467|title=How Certain Foreigners Saw New York|journal=[[City Journal (New York City)|City Journal]]|location=New York City|publisher=[[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]]|volume=2|issue=4|issn=1060-8540|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327051500/http://city-journal.org/story.php?id=1467|archivedate=2015-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|The Saturday Review]]'s'' Theodore Purdy, Jr. wrote about the book: "There is a good deal in it that is inaccurate, and the spellings of American names are confused as only a French proofreader can confuse them, yet on the whole M. Morand has seen New York well and truly, as well as in the impeccable perspective of modernity which is so characteristic of all his work." Purdy wrote that the book, in 1930, already was out of date as a guide book, as the skyline, night clubs and fashions all had changed since the author's visits, but wrote: "Yet the talent for assimilation, which has always been M. Morand's chief charm, as well as the great obstacle to his chance of writing anything lasting, is in this book ideally employed. Both the native and the passenger on an incoming liner may find things in his book which will bring the life of the city nearer and render it more understandable. In any case, M. Morand's interest in America is liable to repay both himself and the casual reader of his deceptively facile but extremely clever book."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Purdy, Jr.|first=Theodore|date=1930-03-29|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1930mar29-00876a02|title=Mr. Morand's Manhattan|work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|The Saturday Review]]|accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen''''' (Prodromus of the Flora of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] and [[Van Diemen's Land]]) is a [[flora]] of Australia written by [[botanist]] [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] and published in 1810.&lt;ref name="Brown 1810"&gt;{{cite book | author = Brown, Robert | year = 1810 | title = Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen | publisher = Richard Taylor &amp; Son | location = London | authorlink = Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often referred to as '''''Prodromus Flora Novae Hollandiae''''', or by its standard botanical abbreviation '''''Prodr. Fl. Nov. Holland.''''',&lt;ref name="IPNI"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idPublicationSearch.do?id=3469-2 | title =  Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae van-Diemen | work = International Plant Names Index ([[IPNI]]) | accessdate = 2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the first attempt at a survey of the Australian flora. It described over 2040 species, over half of which were published for the first time.&lt;ref name="Orchard 1999"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia | author = Orchard, A.

Brown's ''Prodromus'' was originally published as Volume One, and following the ''Praemonenda'' (Preface), page numbering commences on page 145. Sales of the ''Prodromus'' were so poor, however, that Brown withdrew it from sale. Due to the commercial failure of the first volume, pages 1 to 144 were never issued, and Brown never produced the additional volumes that he had planned.

In 1813, a book of illustrations for the ''Prodromus'' was published separately by [[Ferdinand Bauer]] under the title ''Ferdinandi Bauer Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae sive icones generum quae in Prodromo florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen descripsit Robertus Brown'', usually referred to as ''[[Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae]]''. The ''Prodromus'' itself was eventually reprinted in 1819, and a slightly modified second edition released in 1821. In 1830, Brown published a short supplement to the ''Prodromus'', entitled ''[[Supplementum Primum Prodromi Florae Novae Hollandiae]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10530">A '''''prévôt''''' ({{IPA-fr|pʁeˈvoː}}) was a governmental position of varying importance in [[Ancien Régime]] [[France]], typically referring to a civil officer, magistrate, head of cathedral or church, often anglicised as ''[[Provost (religion)|provost]]''. A unit of justice or court overseen by a ''prévôt'' was known as a ''{{ill|prévôté|fr}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Abel|title=Boyer's French Dictionary: Comprising All the Additions and Improvements of the Latest Paris and London Editions|date=1815|publisher=Hilliard, Gray|page=414|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9MgUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA414&amp;dq=prévôt+provost|accessdate=20 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Wiktionary|prévôt}}
==Etymology==
''Prévôt'' is a [[Middle French]] term that comes from the [[classical Latin]] ''[[:wikt:praepositus|praepositus]]'', meaning "person placed in charge" (literally "positioned in the forefront").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=prévôt - definition of prévôt in English|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/prevot|website=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word ''prévôt'' (provost) applied to a number of different persons in pre-Revolutionary France. The term referred to a seignorial officer in charge of managing burgh affairs and rural estates and, on a local level, customarily administered justice. 

Therefore, in [[Paris, France|Paris]], for example, there existed both the "Lord Provost of Paris" who presided a lower royal court, as well as the very important and influential "Provost of the Merchants" (''prévôt des marchands''), i.e. the Dean of the City Guilds, who headed traditionally the City Council and the City's merchant companies, thus being de facto a kind of feudal mayor.

In addition to these two, there were "Provost [[Marshal of France|Marshal]]s" a.k.a. "Provosts of the Marshals of France" (''Prévôts des Maréchaux de France''), the "Provost of the Royal Residence" (''Prévôt de l'Hôtel du Roi''), later a.k.a. the "Lord High Provost of France" (''Grand Prévôt de France''), and the "Provost General" (''Prévôt général'') later a.k.a. the "Lord High Provost of the Mint" (''Grand Prévôt des Monnaies'' or ''de la Monnaie''). 

The role extended into [[New France]], with {{ill|Prévôté de Québec|fr}} and {{ill|Prévôt de Montréal|fr}} in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les structures judiciaires|url=http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/francais/ministere/histoire/structures.htm|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (Quebec)|Ministère de la Justice]]|accessdate=20 November 2016|language=fr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232947/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/Francais/ministere/histoire/structures.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal provosts===
The most important and best known provosts, as part of the King's personal aids administering the scattered parts of the royal domain, were the "Royal Provosts" (''Prévôts royaux''). The regional title of those provosts varied widely from province to province for traditional reasons: "[[castellan]]s" (''châtelains'') in [[Normandy]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and "vicars" (''viguiers'') in the South. These titles were retained from earlier times when formerly independent provinces were conquered and subsumed under the French Crown. Royal provosts were created by the [[House of Capet|Capetian monarchy]] around the 11th century. Provosts replaced [[viscount]]s wherever a viscounty had not been made a fief, making it likely that the domainal provost position was fashioned after the corresponding ecclesiastical provost of [[Chapter (religion)|cathedral chapters]], a charge which was strongly developed in the same era.

Royal provostships were double faceted. Provosts were initially entrusted with royal power and carried out the royal part of local administration, including the collection of the Crown's [[Crown lands of France|domainal]] revenues and all taxes and duties owed to the King within a provostship's jurisdiction. Also, they were responsible for military defense such as raising local contingents for royal armies. 

Also, the provosts administered justice with very limited judicial powers. For instance, they never had any jurisdiction over noblemen or feudal tenants (''hommes de fief'') who instead fell under the jurisdiction of either a regional royal court (parlement) or their respective lord's court where they were tried before a jury of their peers, that is, the lord's other [[vassal]]s. Provosts had no jurisdiction over purely rural areas, the ''pies pays'', which instead fell to local lordship jurisdiction or lower royal courts. Basically, Provost jurisdiction was restricted to minor and medium delinquency committed in towns under their control, but was often usurped by Burgh/City courts chaired by [[burgess (title)|burgess]]es.

Until the end of the Old Feudal Regime (''ancien régime''), a number of "Military Provost" positions (''Prévôts d'épée'', literally "Provosts of the Sword") survived until being replaced by other judging charges (e.g. lord lieutenants or military auditors) in administering military justice.

Since the 11th century, the provosts tended increasingly to make their positions hereditary and thus became more difficult to control. One of the King's great officers, the Great Seneschal, became their supervisor. In the 12th century, the office of provost was put up for bidding, and thereafter provosts were [[Tax farm|farmers]] of revenues. The provost thus received the speculative right to collect the King's seignorial revenues within his provostship. This remained his primary role. Short-term appointments also helped stem the heritability of offices. Very early, however, certain provostships were bestowed ''en garde'', i.e., on condition the provost regularly render accounts to the King for his collections. Farmed provostships (''prévôtes en ferme'') were naturally a source of abuse and oppression. Naturally, too, the people were discontent. [[Jean de Joinville|Joinville]] told of how under [[St Louis]] the provostship of Paris became an accountable provostship (''prévôté en garde''). With the death of [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], farmed provostships were still numerous and spurred a remonstrance from the [[French States-General|States General]] in 1484. [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] promised to abolish the office in 1493, but the office is mentioned in the Ordinance of 1498. They disappeared in the 16th century, by which time the provosts had become regular officials, their office, however, being purchasable.

Further oversight and weakening of provostships occurred when, to monitor their performance and curtail abuses, the Crown established itinerant justices known as [[bailies]] (''bailli'', plural ''baillis'', from which is derived the English word "Bailiff") to hear complaints against them. With the office of Great Seneschal vacant after 1191, the bailies became stationary and established themselves as powerful officials superior to provosts. A bailie's district is called a bailliary (''bailliage'') and included about half a dozen provostships (''prévôtés''). When previously impossible appeals of provost judgements were instituted by the Crown, that competence of appeal was given to the bailie. Moreover, in the 14th century, provosts no longer were in charge of collecting domainal revenues, except in farmed provostships, having instead yielded this responsibility to "royal receivers" (''receveurs royaux''). Raising local army contingents (''ban'', draft; and ''arrière-ban'', reserve) also passed to bailies. Provosts therefore retained the sole function of inferior judges over vassals with original jurisdiction concurrent with bailies over claims against noblemen and actions reserved for royal courts (''cas royaux'', royal cases). This followed a precedent established in the chief feudal courts in the 13th and 14th centuries in which summary provostship suits were distinct-guished from solemn bailliary sessions (''assises'').

The provost as judge sat a single bench with sole judicial authority over his Court. He was, however, required to seek the advice of legally-qualified experts (cousellors or attorneys) of his choosing, and, in so doing, was said to "summon his council" (''appelait à son conseil''). In 1578, official magistrates (''conseillers-magistrats'') were created, but were suppressed by the 1579 Ordinance of Blois. The office was restored in 1609 by simple decree of the King's Council, but it was opposed by the [[Parlement]] courts and seems to have been conferred in but few instances.

===Provost Marshals===
French Provost Marshals were non-judicial officers (''officiers de la robe courte'', literally "officers of the short gown") attached to the '''Marshalry (''Maréchaussée'')''' which under the ''[[ancien régime|Old Regime]]'' was vested with police authority. It would be replaced after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] of 1789 by the newly created ''[[Gendarmerie nationale]]''.

Originally, they were assigned to judge crimes committed by people in the army, but over the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, they gained the right to judge certain types of misdemeanors and felonies committed by the military and civilians alike. They became fixed with set areas of authority, and the offences falling within their jurisdiction came to be called provost crimes (''cas prévôtaux'', literally "provostal cases"). Provost crimes included high violent crimes and crimes committed by repeat offenders (''repris de justice''), who were familiarly known as the ''gibier des prévôts des maréchaux'' (Provost Marshal jailbirds; literally "Game of the Provosts of the Marshalls"). They had military jurisdiction in regiments without "Military Provost" (''Prévôt d'épée''; see above), and their rulings were not appealable. However, the provost was required to consult a certain number of ordinary judges or "masters of law". As Presidial judges had concurrent jurisdiction with Provost Marshals for non-military cases, the two vied openly to be vested.

The '''Rymour Club''' was founded at a meeting in Elder’s Hotel, Edinburgh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gentleman's Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-EIAAAAIAAJ|year=1906|publisher=Bradbury, Evans|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 8th May 1903. Over the next thirty years they would also meet at Mowbury House and the Outlook Tower, but their best known association is with John Knox’s House in the High Street (now the [[Scottish Storytelling Centre]]) and the Club‘s librarian, [[William J Hay]] – who was the curator for the House for over forty years – published several volumes of their Miscellanea and Transactions from there between 1906 and 1928.

The object of the Club was to collect, preserve and study traditional [[Scottish folk song]], rhymes and popular lore. They took their name from [[Thomas Rymour]], or Thomas the Rhymer, or Thomas of Erceldoune – the thirteenth-century Scottish seer who was reputed captured by the Queen of Elfland. This tale is related in the well-known Child ballad ''Thomas the Rhymer'' (Child 37).

A history of Thomas Rymour by [[John Geddie (journalist)|John Geddie]] – the journalist and ballad scholar – was written for and published by the Club and he also features in the frontespiece for the Club’s publications drawn by William Home, the first president of the Club and a noted artist, best known for his ''Old Houses in Edinburgh''.

The Club’s members included noted folk song scholars such as Robert Ford, John Fairlie and Alexander Keith and, most notably, Gavin Greig and the Reverend J B Duncan who, together, amassed the largest volume of folk songs ever collected in Scotland (from Aberdeenshire and the North-East). George Gardiner, born in Perthshire, but best known for his collection of songs from Hampshire was also a member, as were writers such as David Rorie, W S Crockett, and Lauchlan MacLean Watt, the bookseller James Hay Thin, and the popular entertainer Sir Harry Lauder, who became the first lifetime member, at the cost of five pounds.

== Format for RRID citations ==

The recommendation for citing research resources is shown below for key biological resources:
* Antibody: Millipore Cat# MAB377 (Lot) RRID:AB_2298772
* Model organism: NXR Cat# 1.0049, RRID:NXR_1.0049
* Cell line: Coriell Cat# GM03745, RRID:CVCL_1H60
* Tools: CellProfiler Image Analysis Software, (version or date) RRID:SCR_007358

The [[Resource Identification Portal]] lists existing RRIDs and instructions for creating a new one if an RRID matching the resource does not already exist.

== Institutions and publishers recommending use of RRIDs ==

A number of publishing houses, initiatives and [[research institution]]s encourage using SciCrunch‘s RRIDs:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">The '''Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce''' is a research center that specializes in [[Florida|Floridian]] marine ecosystems and lifeforms. The research is focused mostly on the [[Indian River Lagoon]] and also on the offshore waters of Florida's central and east coast.&lt;ref name ="sms"&gt;[http://www.sms.si.edu/ SMS]&lt;/ref&gt; The first director of the station was [[Mary E. Rice|Mary Rice]], who was also instrumental in its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://naturalhistory.si.edu/onehundredyears/profiles/Mary_Rice.html|title=Mary Rice: Celebrating 100 Years|website=naturalhistory.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station is a part of the [[National Museum of Natural History]], which is part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] of [[Washington, D.C.]] Its purpose is to be a field station which will draw scientists and students from the Smithsonian and other institutions from around the world, in which they will investigate [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[physical process]]es of [[ocean]]s and [[river]]s. The information obtained at the station will be published in forms and scientific journals.&lt;ref name ="sms"/&gt;

It also provides administrative and logistical management of the [[Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems Program]], that is based at the [[Carrie Bow Cay Field Station]]. Both stations are important to the [[Smithsonian Marine Science Network]].&lt;ref name ="sms"/&gt;

==Smithsonian Marine Ecosystems Exhibit==
One of the key features of the SMS is the [http://www.sms.si.edu/smee/ Smithsonian Marine Ecosystems Exhibit]. Their focus is on displaying ecosystems as complex communities of organisms interacting in their environment. At the Marine Ecosystems Exhibit, visitors can explore six different Florida marine habitats and learn about the complexity and importance of marine ecosystems. The largest aquarium is a model of a Caribbean coral reef. Other displays include living models of seagrass, mangrove, estuarine and nearshore habitats, as well as a deepwater Oculina coral reef. There are several smaller aquarium displays and a touch tank where you can meet some local sea creatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sms.si.edu/SMEE/Index.htm SMS Ecosystems Exhibit]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social breakdown thesis''' also known as the '''[[anomie]]–social breakdown thesis'''&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Fella, S. and Ruzza, C. (2009) ''Reinventing the Italian Right: Territorial politics, populism and post-fascism, Abingdon: Routledge, p 215&lt;/ref&gt; is a theory that posits that individuals that are socially isolated living in atomized  socially disintegrated societies are particularly likely to support [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] parties. According to social breakdown theory the fact that traditional social structures based on class and religion are breaking down individuals lack a sense of belonging and are attracted to ethnic nationalist parties because according to psychological research it leads to an increased sense of self-esteem and efficacy.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Merkel, P. and Weinberg, L. (2004) ''Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century'', Frank Cass Publishers: London, pp 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Some studies have shown that support for the French [[National Front (France)|Front National]] and the German [[The Republicans (Germany)|Die Republikaner]] correlates positively with a high urban level of social isolation and low religious and trade union ties.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; A Dutch study has linked social isolation and support for the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;M. Fennema and J. Tillie, 'Social Isolation: Theoretical Concept and Empirical Measurement' in M. Fennema et al (eds.) In Search of Structure: Essays in Social Science Methodology (Amsterdam: Het Spinhuis, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Social breakdown thesis was at one time a popular theory to explain the [[rise of Nazism]] during the interwar years in Weimar Germany but fell out of favour after greater empirical research. [[Jens Rydgren]] argues that social breakdown theory has little empirical support within the academic literature on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;Rydgren, J. (2007) The Sociology of the Radical Right, Annual Review of Sociology, p 247&lt;/ref&gt; The academics Fella and Ruzza argue that a blanket social breakdown thesis is an insufficient explanation for the rise of far-right parties given the different voting profiles of European far-right parties.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''''Storyville''''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] jazz magazine that ran from 1965 to 2003 featuring jazz history, [[discography]], and record trading.&lt;ref name="Clayton-Gammond" /&gt; It was published six times a year from October 1965 to December 1986 (issues 1 to 128), then quarterly from March 1987 to June 1995 (issues 129 to 162), then four {{linktext|biennial}} volumes were published until 2003.

== History ==
''Storyville'' was founded by Laurie Wright ''(né'' Lawrence D. Wright; 1929–2010).&lt;ref name="IAJRC Journal 2010 Jun 1" /&gt;  The publication has been acclaimed for containing a wealth of early historical material on jazz.&lt;ref name="Fontes 1984 Jan-Mar" /&gt;  And although ''Storyville'' was not officially a [[Academic journal|peer-reviewed journal]] — in part because, other than music librarians, few jazz scholars existed in academic research in 1965 — it was, nonetheless, peer-reviewed in reality by well-informed jazz enthusiasts, discographers, musicologists, and the like.&lt;ref name="IAJRC Journal 2010 Jun 1" /&gt;

Separately from the magazine, Storyville Publications published books about jazz, notably discographies. Included were Wright's own works, the standard discographies, two volumes of Eric Townley's ''Tell Your Story; A Dictionary of Jazz and Blues Recordings 1917–1950,'' [[Tom Lord]]'s bio-discography, ''[[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]'' (1976), and several biographical and autobiographical memoirs of historic musicians.  The last of these, published under Wright's name, was an autobiography, ''Trombone Man: Preston Jackson's Story'' (2005), after which ill-health forced Wright's retirement.&lt;ref name="IAJRC Journal 2010 Jun 1" /&gt;

'''''The Guerilla Filmmakers Handbook''''' is a bestselling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/082647988X/ |title=Amazon.com synopsis |accessdate=2006-12-20 |work=Amazon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[textbook]] on [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] and [[independent film]] production written by [[Chris Jones (filmmaker)|Chris Jones]] and Genevieve Jolliffe. Currently in its third edition, it consists primarily of interviews with filmmakers and case studies in [[filmmaking]].  The Handbook has become widely respected in the UK as a comprehensive filmmaking guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britfilms.com/resources/publications/ |title=Essential publications |accessdate=2006-12-20 |work=Britfilms.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/filmmakersguidereading |title=Recommended Reading |accessdate=2006-12-20 |work=BBC Film Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones and Jolliffe have also written three further books on film making. Chris Jones wrote The Guerilla Film Makers Movie Blueprint. Jones and Jolliffe also co-authored the US Guerilla Film Makers Handbook (aka Hollywood Handbook in the UK). Genevieve Jolliffe and Andrew Zinnes also wrote The Documentary Film Makers Handbook. Most recently the trio published the Guerilla Film Makers Pocketbook.

Jones and Jolliffe, the authors have made three low-budget movies: ''The Runner'' (1992), ''[[White Angel (1994 film)|White Angel]]'' (1993) and ''Urban Ghost Story'' (1998). They also run courses in filmmaking through their production company, Living Spirit Pictures. Jolliffe now resides in  Los Angeles, Jones now in Ealing, London, where their offices are based ([[Ealing Studios]]). Chris Jones recently directed an Oscars shortlisted short film, ''[[Gone Fishing (2008 film)|Gone Fishing]]'', which won awards at over 40 international film festivals.

Film makers who cite the Guerilla Film Makers Handbook and its follow up books as influential to them include Simon Cox, the Writer/Director of ''Kaleidoscope Man'' and [[Allin Kempthorne]], the Writer/Director of ''[[The Vampires of Bloody Island]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerillafilm.com/movie-blueprint/reader-feedback/ |title=Blueprint Book Feedback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5910">'''Turkmenization''' is the set of domestic policies the [[Government of Turkmenistan|Niyazov administration]] used in [[Turkmenistan]] from 1991 to December 2006 to force ethnic minorities to adopt [[Culture of Turkmenistan|Turkmen culture]]. Those who resisted the state-sponsored cultural transformation were often [[deported]].&lt;ref name=CRYING&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav102506a.shtml Central Asia: 'Fathers are crying in Turkmenistan, and children are crying here'] EurasiaNet&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoine Blua of ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'' defined Turkmenization as the "policy of the Turkmen government targeting the education, employment, and religion of all of the country's non-Turkmen ethnic groups."&lt;ref name=RELIG&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/03/299c15c0-be4c-4431-b9ad-630caecfd89e.html Turkmenistan: State Interfering In Religious Life Of Ethnic Uzbeks] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
Shukrat Babajanov and Khurmat Babadjanov of ''[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]'''s Uzbek Service say that since [[Turkmenistan]] gained independence, the [[Saparmurat Niyazov|Niyazov administration]] has fired most non-ethnic Turkmen civil servants. Officials must prove they have three generations of Turkmen heritage before they are hired. Informal [[social control]] is used to ensure citizens speak [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and wear traditional Turkmen clothing. Uzbek women who try to marry Turkmen men are exiled to [[Uzbekistan]] with their children. Babajanov and Babadjanov say these policies have led to the [[emigration]] of [[Russians]], [[Kazakhs]], and [[Uzbeks]].&lt;ref name=CRYING/&gt;

In a few instances Uzbek children in Turkmen schools have been instructed to wear Turkmen clothing or be expelled from school.&lt;ref name=CRYING/&gt;

==Marriage discrimination==
Ziyoda Ruzimova, an ethnic Uzbek woman who lived in Turkmenistan, married an ethnic Turkmen in 1994 and had four children. In order to attend public school in Turkmenistan parents must register their child's birth with the government. Ruzimova did not register her marriage or her children's births at the time. When she tried to get a marriage license in February 2006, she says the government of Turkmenistan brought her and her children to the Shovat border post and turned her family over to Uzbek border guards. Ruzimova says her family had no money but the border guards gave her 1,000 [[Uzbekistani som|soms]] ([[USD]] $0.85). "Then they called a taxi to take us [to my grandmother's home]." At the border the Uzbek guards kept her family on a grate where they slept. "For the children, they provided a piece of fabric; the children got a mattress, but I slept on the cement."&lt;ref name=CRYING/&gt;

Mahmud Tangriberganov, head of the Gozovot village council, expressed opposition to Turkmenistan's policies, saying, "These are our relatives; these are Uzbeks. And they say that because you are Uzbek, you must leave. Why didn't [the authorities] register their marriages, the births of their children? They could have asked them to pay fines and that way they could have kept the families together, but they didn't do that."&lt;ref name=CRYING/&gt;

==Dashoguz==
The region around the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan border is known as [[Khorezm]] to Uzbeks and Dashoguz to Turkmen. Copies of Niyazov's ''[[Ruhnama]]'' and the Turkmen flag are located at the entrance of every [[mosque]] and [[Russian Orthodox]] church. Believers must touch the ''Ruhnama'' prior to entering the building. In 2006 the government replaced ethnic Uzbek [[imam]]-hatybs with ethnic Turkmens in Dashoguz. Uzbeks comprise over 50% of the population of Dashoguz. [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[human rights]] activist Igor Rotar said, "Historically, [[Kazakh SSR|in the Soviet times]] for example, most imam-hatybs in this region were [Uzbeks]. But now most of [them] are Turkmen. This is a problem because local Uzbeks complained that Turkmen imams have no good education and prefer that [[imam]]-hatybs [are] Uzbeks." In the Kunya-Urgench district in Dashoguz Uzbek imam-hatybs were not allowed to work at Islamic cemeteries and holy sites. All sermons are required to begin with a praise of Niyazov.&lt;ref name=RELIG/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1084">In '''''UPUSA v Komming Knitting''''', an important case in [[South African labour law]], heard by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), the Commissioner extended the right to access the workplace, together with the right to deductions of union subscriptions, to a union which, at the time of the award, represented just seven employees out of 31. The Commissioner made this decision on the basis

* that the union was the only union organising and recruiting at the workplace;
* that it had been present in the workplace since shortly after the employer’s inception; and
* that its current low level of representation was due to high labour turnover.

The Commissioner held that the union seemed capable of recruiting a majority of the workers at the workplace.

'''Volkert Simon Maarten van der Willigen''' ([[Rockanje]], 9 May 1822 – [[Haarlem]], 19 February 1878), sometimes referred to as '''Volcardus Simon Martinus van der Willigen''', was a Dutch [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[physics|physicist]] and professor.&lt;ref name="BPN"&gt;[http://www.biografischportaal.nl/persoon/51304147 Biografisch Portaal van Nederland] on Van der Willigen (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NNBW"&gt;P.C. Molhuysen en P.J. Blok (red.), [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu10_01/molh003nieu10_01_1939.php Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek (NNBW)]. Deel 10. A.W. Sijthoff, Leiden 1937 – p.1219, F.J.Hoogeveen (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Volkert was son of the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] [[Johannes van der Willigen]] (1777–1857)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biografischportaal.nl/persoon/11660793 Biografisch Portaal Nederland] on Johannes van der Willigen (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Gerarde Maria Elsabé Bodde (1795–1865). He was the nephew of the Dutch patriot and writer [[Adriaan van der Willigen]].

He studied at the ''Hoogeschool Leiden'' (the current [[Leiden University]]) and promoted in 1847 with his dissertation ''De aberratione lucis'' (on the aberrations of the light).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Volkert van der Willigen |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/VanderWilligen_1847.pdf |title=De aberratione lucis  |year=1847}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating he became teacher at the [[Latin school]] in [[Amsterdam]]. In 1848 he was appointed to professor in the mathematics and physics and philosophy at [[Athenaeum Illustre of Deventer|Athenaeum Illustre]] in [[Deventer]]. He accepted his appointment with the lauratio ''Over natuur- en sterrekundig onderzoek'' (On physical and astronomical research). In 1857 he became a member of the [[Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen]] (Netherlands Royal Academy of Sciences).&lt;ref name="KNAW"&gt;[http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00003909 KNAW on Van der Willigen] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Athenaeum Illustre of Deventer was abolished in 1864, he was appointed conservator of the Physical Cabinet of the [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]] where [[Jacob Gijsbertus Samuël van Breda]] had resigned his post nine months earlier. Contrary to Van Breda however, Van der Willigen refused to accept the responsibility for the Paleontological-Mineralogical cabinet alongside his duties for the Physical cabinet, and that position was later filled by [[Tiberius Cornelis Winkler]].&lt;ref name="Teylers"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/index.php?item=116&amp;i_id=6366&amp;lang=nl Teylers Museum on Van der Willigen] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;Gerard L'E. Turner [http://instrumenten.teylersmuseum.nl/components/com_vr/pdf/Practice.pdf The Practice of Science in the Nineteenth Century: Teaching and Research apparatus in the Teyler Museum] p.14-17&lt;/ref&gt; Thus free to devote himself to the instrument collection and physics experiments, in the years that he spent at Teylers, Van der Willigen published 51 papers.&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;

As a scientist, Van der Willigen did significant work in the research on physical units – where he tried to use the wavelength of light to set a new and trustworthy standard for a unit of distance. In those days there was insufficient data on the reliability of measurement units because errors had been made in the standards based on the circumference of the earth. The Dutch Minister of the Interior had requested the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen in 1851 to come up with a new standard for both length and weight. Inspired by this discussion and a publication by the Swedish scientist [[Anders Ångström]] in 1855, Van der Willigen decided to dedicate himself first to the determination of the [[refractive index]] and the wavelength of light, in order to be able to more accurately define the unit of length. In the inner garden of the Museum, he had a small observatory built in 1866/1867, where he set up several precision instruments to determine the latitude ([[zenith telescope]]) and time ([[clock]]). There he also kept an [[astronomical regulator]], [[heliostat]], [[spectroscope]], [[diffraction grating]]s, [[microscope]] with [[micrometer]], [[Weighing scale|balance]], [[thermometer]]s and [[barometer]]s. He also ordered the standards of length (glass) and weight (copper).&lt;ref name="Teylers" /&gt; Combining these instruments he tried to determine a standard of length by use of a [[seconds pendulum]] (initially a [[Foucault pendulum]], later he ordered a [[Repsold reversible pendulum]] which arrived shortly after his death). Besides his work on measurements, he also purchased acoustics instruments, on which he gave a series of lectures in the museum.&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;

Van der Willigen became active in Haarlem society and was a member of the Haarlem city council from 1864 (the year of his arrival) to the year of his death.

'''Xmark93''' is a standardized [[benchmark (computing)|benchmarking]] tool for measuring the performance of computer systems running the X Window System.  It was developed by the [[SPEC XPC]] group in 1993.

Xmark93 allows systems evaluators and vendors to compare the performance of [[X Window System|X server]]/hardware systems for a broad set of X basic functions, covering a wide range of applications. The benchmark provides a standardized method for summarizing ''X11perf'' results, providing a single-number measure of overall X11 server/hardware performance.

==Specifications==
Xmark93 is derived by calculating the [[ratio]] between the geometrically weighted mean of the 447 individual ''X11perf'' tests for the server/hardware being evaluated and the corresponding results from a [[Sun Microsystems]] [[SPARCstation 1]]. Weightings for each of the ''X11perf'' tests were obtained by   a survey of X11 technical experts. The weightings reflect the experts' ratings of the relative importance of individual X11perf operations within a wide mix of applications.

'''''Yr Australydd''''' was an Australian monthly newspaper in the [[Welsh language]] published in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] between 1866 and 1872. Its name translates as ''The Australian''.

The newspaper was edited by [[The Reverend|Rev.]] William Meirion Evans and Theophilus Williams, and priced at 6[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] per issue. Its precise circulation is unknown, but estimated at several hundred.

''Yr Australydd''’s intended readership were, obviously, [[Welsh Australian]]s. It was more specifically linked to the Welsh [[Calvinistic Methodists|Calvinistic Methodist]] community, and devoted between a sixth and a quarter of its content to [[theology|theological]] writing. The newspaper's aim was also to encourage a sense of [[Welshness]] among its readers, by maintaining the language and promoting [[Welsh culture]] and [[Welsh-language literature|literature]]. In its inaugural edition, editors explained that their objective was to "''gwasanaethu ein cenedl mewn llenyddiaeth, moesoldeb a chrefydd''" ("serve our nation in literature, morality and religion"). They requested and printed literary contributions from readers: poetry and short stories, as well as a serialised novel, ''Cymro yn Awstralia'' (''A Welshman in Australia'', 1870).

The newspaper also printed news from Wales in small quantity, accounting for about 3% of its content overall.

Publication began in [[Ballarat]], was transferred to Melbourne in April 1871,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5845509/229674 (search for) Yr Australydd] ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', 4 April 1871, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ceased in 1872, for reasons which remain unclear. In 1874, it was replaced by ''Yr Ymwelydd'', a similar newspaper edited by Rev. Evans.
