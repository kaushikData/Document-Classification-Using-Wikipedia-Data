      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3640">In a [[storytelling|story]], we detect an '''''allotopy''''' when two basic meaning traits ([[Seme (semantics)|seme]]s) contradict each other, that is when they trace two incompatible interpretations. It was conceived as being the opposite of an [[Isotopy (semiotics)|isotopy]], which is the homogeneity resulting from repetition of the same seme.&lt;ref name="KlinkenbergAllodef"&gt;[[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] (1996) ''Précis de sémiotique générale'', De Boeck, p. 118 [http://www.info-metaphore.com/definition/isotopie.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been coined in the 1970s by the Belgian semioticians known as ''[[Groupe µ]]''.

==History==
In the 1970, the Belgian semioticians known under the name ''[[Groupe µ]]'', introduced the concept of Allotopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info-metaphore.com/definition/allotopie.html Définition de : l'allotopie]&lt;/ref&gt; They first discussed the concept in publications like ''Isotopie et allotopie'',&lt;ref&gt;DUBOIS J. ; EDELINE F. ; KLINKENBERG J.-M. ; MINGUET P. (1976) ''[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=12751413 Isotopie et allotopie: le fonctionnement rhétorique du texte]'', no14, pp. 41-65 (2 p.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Isotopie, allotopie et polytopie'' (1976),&lt;ref&gt;Groupe µ (1976) ''Isotopie, allotopie et polytopie : le texte rhétorique'', Versus, 14, 1 976&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Rhetoric of Poetry'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Groupe µ (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allotopy and humor==
''[[Groupe µ]]'' discussed the relation of allotopy to [[jokes]] and [[humor]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Salvatore Attardo]], despite not using the term allotopy, formulated a theory of humor based on the idea of the "incompatible interpretations", called the [[isotopy-disjunction model]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Salvatore Attardo]] (2001) ''Humorous texts: a semantic and pragmatic analysis'',  sect.5.3.2, p.83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Salvatore Attardo]] (1994) ''Linguistic theories of humor'', chap.2&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of the broader idea of defining humor as based on [[contradiction]]/[[wikt:incongruity|incongruity]].

[[File:Ann Griffiths walk memorial - geograph.org.uk - 1574268.jpg|thumb|Remembered in [[Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa]]]]
'''Ann Griffiths''' (née '''Thomas''', 1776–1805) was a [[Welsh poetry|Welsh poet]] and writer of [[Methodism|Methodist]] Christian hymns. Her poetry expresses a fervent evangelical Christian faith and reflects thorough scriptural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;James Wyn: Introduction to the life and work of Ann Griffiths [http://www.anngriffiths.cardiff.ac.uk/introduction.html Retrieved 29 January 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:A letter in the hand of Ann Griffiths (1776-1805) NLW3365236.jpg|thumb|A letter in the hand of Ann Griffiths]]
Ann was born in April 1776 near the village of [[Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa]], {{convert|6|mi|spell=in|0}} from the market town of [[Llanfyllin]] (in the former county of [[Montgomeryshire]]) in [[Powys]]. She was the daughter of John Evan Thomas, a tenant farmer and churchwarden, and his wife, Jane. She had two older sisters, an older brother, John, and a younger brother, Edward. Her parents' house, Dolwar Fechan, was an isolated farm-house some {{convert|2+1/2|mi|spell=in|0}} south of Llanfihangel and {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} north of Dolanog, set among hills and streams.

Not far away lay [[St Melangell's Church, Pennant Melangell|Pennant Melangell]], where Saint [[Melangell]] had lived as a hermit in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', Journal of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, Vol. III, 6th Series, London, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann was brought up in the Anglican church; but in 1794, when she was 18, her mother died, and about this time or perhaps earlier she followed her brothers John and Edward in becoming drawn to the Methodist movement. In 1796 she joined the [[Calvinistic Methodism|Calvinistic Methodist]] movement after hearing the preaching of Benjamin Jones of [[Pwllheli]].

After the deaths of both her parents she married Thomas Griffiths, a farmer from the parish of [[Meifod]] and an elder of the Calvinistic Methodist church.

In August 1805 she died following childbirth aged 29 and was buried on 12 August 1805 at Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa.

She left behind a handful of stanzas in the [[Welsh language]]. These were preserved and published by her mentor, the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] Methodist minister, John Hughes of [[Pontrobert]], and his wife, Ruth, who had been a maid at Ann Griffiths' farm and was a close confidante.

Together with [[Mary Jones and her Bible|Mary Jones]] (1784–1864), a poor Welsh girl who walked to Bala to buy a Bible, Ann Griffiths became a national icon by the end of the 19th century, and was a significant figure in Welsh [[nonconformism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=E. Wyn|title=Bala and the Bible: Thomas Charles, Ann Griffiths and Mary Jones|url=http://www.anngriffiths.cardiff.ac.uk/bible.html|publisher=Cardiff University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
Ann's poems are an expression of her fervent evangelical Christian faith, and reflect her incisive intellect and thorough scriptural knowledge. She is the most prominent female hymn-writer in Welsh. Her work is regarded as a highlight of [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|Welsh literature]], and her longest poem ''{{lang|cy|Rhyfedd, rhyfedd gan angylion...}}'' (Wondrous, wondrous to angels...)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=James|first1=E. Wyn|title=Introduction to the life and work of Ann Griffiths|url=http://www.anngriffiths.cardiff.ac.uk/introduction.html|website=gwefan Ann Griffiths website|publisher=Cardiff University|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was described by the dramatist and literary critic [[Saunders Lewis]] as "one of the majestic songs in the religious poetry of Europe".

Her hymn ''Wele'n sefyll rhwng y myrtwydd'' is commonly sung in Wales to the tune [[Cwm Rhondda]].

The service of enthronement of [[Rowan Williams]] as Archbishop of Canterbury in February 2003 included Rowan's own translation of one of her hymns: "Yr Arglwydd Iesu" ("The Lord Jesus").

==Musical==
[[File:Ann!, album cover.jpg|thumb|Album cover of the musical ''Ann!'']]
The television channel [[S4C]] commissioned ''Ann!'', a musical based on the life of Ann Griffiths, to be performed at the 2003 [[National Eisteddfod]] at Meifod. The performance was subsequently televised and a CD was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maldwyn Theatre Company - Ann!|url=http://www.sainwales.com/store/sain/sain-scd-2446|website=[[Sain]]|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Evidence of intensifying home-focused behavior became more pronounced in Popcorn's data from 1984 and by 1985 she forecast it would be a trend, not a fad.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She explained the concept involves building a "shell of safety" around oneself in a 1986 article in [[The New Yorker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1986/07/07/eager|title=Eager|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist [[George Will]] explained that "the harassments of daily life -- looming nuclear incineration, rude waiters -- have driven people to &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;cocooning&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. They have gone to ground in their dens with their VCRs and compact-disc players, snug in their Barcaloungers equipped with stereo headphones, the better to keep at bay the modern world, the discontinuities of which have produced a longing for tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1987/06/11/of-consuming-interest/299ed19c-b0f7-47d8-ba44-bd8c41b1a890/|title=Of Consuming Interest|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article in 1987 called "The Essence of Cocooning: It's a Desire for a Cozy, Perfect Environment Far From the Influences of a Madding World" tied the concept to fear of environment destruction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-07/news/vw-1202_1_cocooning|title=The Essence of Cocooning: It's a Desire for a Cozy, Perfect Environment Far From the Influences of a Madding World|last=Krier|first=Beth Ann|date=1987-08-07|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the article, Popcorn cited the increased use of gourmet frozen foods, soft furniture such as Barcaloungers, investment services, and "mom foods" that remind consumers of adolescence, as examples of cocooning behavior. She cited less involvement in social and political issues as a downside of cocooning, though she predicted a counter-trend to emerge.

The term was designated in 1987 by the editors of the [[American Heritage Dictionary]] of the English Language as a word being tracked for possible inclusion in the dictionary. The dictionary's editors later included it,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; as did Merriam Webster's Dictionary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 1989 ''[[New York Times]]'' article called "Lounge Wear for Cocooning" described a trend among many upscale designers, including [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Giorgio Armani]] and [[Valentino Garavani|Valentino]], to create clothing for use at home that was more dressy than sleepwear but less formal than sportswear.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/03/style/lounge-wear-for-cocooning.html|title=Lounge Wear for Cocooning|last=Hochswender|first=Woody|date=1989-01-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; "However, sleeping is not the point. Neither, necessarily, is seduction. Cocooning, a dream word for market researchers, is. Everybody is working. Everybody is tired. Everybody just wants to go home and watch 48-inch TV. Relax, slip into something comfortable, and join the ranks of homebody chic," the article says.

In its 1996 "Year in Review" article, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cited cocooning as a major social trend and linked it to ''[[Bowling Alone]]'', a 1995 essay by Harvard Professor Robert Putnam, describing a decrease in in-person social intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985773,00.html|title=To Be Or Not To Be...Whatever|last=Rosenblatt|first=Roger|date=1996-12-30|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]], the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' ran an article entitled "The 'cocooning' trend draws reinforcement" which asserted that the terrorist attacks intensified cocooning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-10-21/news/0110210261_1_consumer-trends-faith-popcorn-popcorn-report|title=The `cocooning' trend draws reinforcement|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[La-Z-Boy]], in partnership with Popcorn debuted "cocooning chairs" for women, scaled-down reclining chairs allowing women to get up and down easily but still big enough to pull children onto their laps. An even smaller version was sold for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-02-08/lifestyle/0202070561_1_recliner-faith-popcorn-chairs|title=Faith Popcorn, Still Cocooning, Comes Up With Recliner For Women|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by sociologists at the University of Toronto in 2004 concluded that Canadians were socializing less with their friends and family and spending more time "cocooning" home alone. The change was attributed to "higher rates of separation and divorce, smaller households with fewer children, delayed marriages and more individuals living alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/people-cocooning-more-study-says/article1348903/|title=People cocooning more, study says|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
In 2013, a ''[[USA Today]]'' article entitled "Cocooning: It's back and thanks to tech, it's bigger" concluded that cocooning had turned into "super-cocooning": "Thanks to always-on wireless Internet connectivity and bigger, better TVs that reproduce pixel-perfect high-definition video, cocooning is entering a new evolutionary stage. Consumers are staying home more, watching movies delivered via cable, satellite, Internet or disc, eating in and transforming their apartments and houses into a shelter from the daily social storm."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' in 2015, Popcorn said "uber-cocooning, and now even bunkering" were becoming prominent because people had become "terrified" of world conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/12/30/faith-popcorn-predictions-2016/|title=Here’s What Top Trend Spotter Faith Popcorn Sees for 2016|date=2015-12-30|website=Fortune|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child Rearing and Adoption Cocooning==

A 2014 clinical book for mental health practitioners, lawyers and educators describes the parental strategy of cocooning (or "restrictive mediation") as explicitly limiting objectionable material, including from television and the movies, from younger children. When the same practice is used with older adolescents, it was determined parents were less connected to their children, more likely to be resented and less successful in maintaining control in the long term.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3pPAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT220&amp;dq=cocooning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx176By4_PAhXJ3SYKHe-XAfE4MhDoAQg5MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=cocooning&amp;f=false|title=Adolescent Sexual Behavior in the Digital Age: Considerations for Clinicians, Legal Professionals and Educators|last=Saleh|first=Fabian|last2=Jr|first2=Albert Grudzinskas|last3=Judge|first3=Abigail|date=2014-04-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199357970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia'', its authors contend that adoptive parents have "popularized" cocooning as "a strategic way in which to create a safe and secure home in which to raise a newly adopted child."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The psychologist Patti Zordich trademarked "cocooning" as the focus of the resources she provides to adoptive families.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Standard cocooning tactics for adoptive parents include retreating from the outside world to focus on the immediate family in order to build bonds that will secure attachment with the child.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jKn4XPi8qgC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=adoption+cocooning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqmYzR0o_PAhVCYiYKHScDAhQQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=adoption%2520cocooning&amp;f=false|title=Adoption Is a Family Affair!: What Relatives and Friends Must Know, Revised Edition|last=Johnston|first=Patricia Irwin|date=2012-04-15|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=9780857006196|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital Cocooning ==
A 1994 article in ''[[PC Magazine]]'' described "virtual cocooning" in terms of virtual reality products for exploring and designing one's own interiors or world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9TvMcu1mIwC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=digital+cocooning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t7z2d4L2E9&amp;sig=bSzP-miC-FVI_FqDNREmlNmQWsQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMrKH12Y_PAhUMySYKHRVQDI04ChDoAQgwMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=digital%2520cocooning&amp;f=false|title=PC Mag|last=Inc|first=Ziff Davis|date=1994-01-11|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Korea, experts who saw the rise of "digital cocooning" in 2006 said that while some people were experiencing a nomadic outdoor life thanks to wireless devices, others were choosing to stay "nested up at home" with them.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.international.ucla.edu/institute/article/46418|title=More people living in digital cocoons|website=web.international.ucla.edu|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6uc1i3d-LEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=digital+cocooning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sLzVsIj9Hb&amp;sig=zDNzgQOHA2y8bBJbEkziZs7xoHg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-4NyL2Y_PAhVC2SYKHdzqBLgQ6AEIZjAN#v=onepage&amp;q=digital%2520cocooning&amp;f=false|title=Work, Learning and Sustainable Development: Opportunities and Challenges|last=Fien|first=John|last2=Maclean|first2=Rupert|last3=Park|first3=Man-Gon|date=2008-10-26|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402081941|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who almost never left home because of the internet were characterized as "digital zombies."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Digital cocooning was the subject of a 2014 panel discussion about "isolating elements of pervasive mobile technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uxmag.com/articles/quickpanel-digital-cocooning|title=QuickPanel: Digital Cocooning {{!}} UX Magazine|website=uxmag.com|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 report by Euromonitor International, a strategic market research firm, contends that "A major consequence of the growth in mobile web use is that the trend towards cocooning – the home-centred lifestyle that characterised the early part of the century – has given way to a movement towards mobile or individual cocooning, whereby consumers are immersed in their own digital worlds anywhere and anytime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/mobile-cocooning-how-growing-reliance-on-smart-devices-is-influencing-consumer-behaviour/report|title=Mobile Cocooning: How Growing Reliance on Smart Devices is Influencing Consumer Behaviour|website=www.euromonitor.com|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tele-Cocooning is a term developed by Ichiyo Habuchi in 2005 to describe intimate human computer interaction, specifically in reference to "the communication of one person to the next without having physical interaction with that person".&lt;ref&gt;Ichiyo Habuchi, “Accelerating Reflexivity,” in Personal, Portable, Pedestrian: Mobile Phones in Japanese Life, ed. Mizuko Ito, Daisuke Okabe, and Misa Matsuda (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, an academic study of Japanese youth supported the "tele-cocooning hypothesis", which contends that mobile "texting is associated with increasingly insular communication because it strengthens core ties at the expense of interactions with lesser-known weak ties."  The study says that research from many sources showed that texting among youth usually involves "the intensive exchange of text messages among intimate and homogeneous peers." This decreases social tolerance and trust.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

A 2015 follow up study concluded that tele-cocooning behavior could be mitigated with smartphone applications stimulating interaction with communication weak ties through on-screen reminders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=Tetsuro|last2=Boase|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Suzuki|first3=Tsutomu|last4=Suzuki|first4=Takahisa|date=2015-05-01|title=Emerging From the Cocoon?

==Books==

===Popcorn Report===

In her 1991 book, The Popcorn Report, Popcorn describes cocooning as: "the impulse to go inside when it just gets too tough and scary outside. To pull a shell of safety around yourself, so you're not at the mercy of a mean, unpredictable world - those harassments and assaults that run the gamut from rude waiters and noise pollution to crack-crime, recession and AIDS. Cocooning is about insulation and avoidance, peace and protection, coziness and control-a sort of hyper-nesting."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_bf8l6fJckC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=faith+popcorn+popcorn+report&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH-YP6nZfPAhUIeT4KHY8hDI0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=faith%2520popcorn%2520popcorn%2520report&amp;f=false|title=The Popcorn Report: Faith Popcorn on the Future of Your Company, Your World, Your Life|last=Popcorn|first=Faith|date=1992-10-13|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=9780887305948|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1991 book, Popcorn argues that since she had defined the trend it had been substantiated by subsequent skyrocketing VCR sales; declining restaurant sales just as take out restaurant sales substantially grew; the emergence of "shelter" magazines; screening calls; and the increase in birth rates.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Popcorn described three sub-trends within cocooning: the armored cocoon, the wandering cocoon, and the socialized cocoon.

====Armored Cocoon====

Indicators of the "armored cocoon" included greater gun ownership among women, and the growth in "paranoia" industries. These include home security systems, computerized watchdog systems linked to private guards and emergency help, anti-snooping devices, home warehousing of supplies and home delivery of food and other supplies to "stock the cocoon."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

====Wandering Cocoon====
The "wandering cocoon" is characterized by controlling one's environment when outside the home, such as car and mini-van design intended to make automobiles more pleasurable and livable. Signs of the "mobile cocoon" included people eating more meals in their cars; conducting business and "life maintenance chores" over the phone while driving; and the increase in airline security.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
 
====Socialized Cocoon====

The "socialized cocoon" is characterized by surrounding oneself with "soothing, congenial" friends in one's "home cocoon." Rather than entertaining at home as in the past, the socialized cocoon is characterized by selective invitations to a few close friends. Signs included a surge in book clubs, watching television with friends. The 1991 trend was described as "nascent."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

===Other Books===

In her 1997 book, ''Clicking: 17 Trends That Drive Your Business--And Your Life,'' Popcorn asserted that the cocooning trend would give rise to 24-hour, comprehensive home banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqQDal_Zc-sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=clicking+faith+popcorn+cocooning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPgP3X3Y_PAhXB4SYKHaoNAJMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=clicking%2520faith%2520popcorn%2520cocooning&amp;f=false|title=Clicking: 17 Trends That Drive Your Business--And Your Life|last=Popcorn|first=Faith|last2=Marigold|first2=Lys|date=1998-01-06|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=9780887308574|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William A. Sherden, in his 1999 book ''The Fortune Sellers: The Big Business of Buying and Selling Predictions'', takes a skeptical view of Popcorn's ideas about cocooning and concludes she was wrong on several issues.&lt;ref name=sherden /&gt; Sherden's statistics show double digit percentage growth in activities outside the home in the five years following her prediction.&lt;ref name=sherden&gt;{{cite book | last= Sherden| first = William A. | title = The Fortune Sellers: The Big Business of Buying and Selling Predictions | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=  1999 | location = New York | isbn = 0-471-35844-4 | page = 223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, in the ''Encyclopedia of Community: From the Village to the Virtual World'', authors David Levinson and Karen Christensen note that cocooning has intensified with the growth of the internet because people can stay at home for weeks at a time without losing touch with friends, getting food to eat, working or watching recent movies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=cocooning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjX1qzQr4_PAhUFRSYKHYTPA1wQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=cocooning&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Community: From the Village to the Virtual World|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Christensen|first2=Karen|date=2003-06-30|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780761925989|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors cite the growth of home entertainment as a significant factor in cocooning, with people treating large casts of fictional characters as a "surrogate community."  While they saw no evidence of people entertaining at home more, in the wake of September 11, they said that people traveled less, stayed closer to home and spent more time with their families.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A German economics book in 2009 titled ''Cocooning: My Home is My Castle'' asserted that in times of crisis people prefer to "hedgehog" at home and forecast good commercial prospects for chocolate, snacks, ready-made-meals and home furniture.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqO_BgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=cocooning&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Cocooning: My Home is my Castle|last=Reil|first=H.|date=2009-03-02|publisher=GBI Genios Wirtschaftsdatenbank GmbH|isbn=9783737907613|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-help book from 2010, ''The One Year Book of Inspiration for Girlfriends'', advocates cocooning as a form of religious retreat.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In 2014, authors Marilyn Coleman and Lawrence Ganong tie cocooning to the trend for larger homes. Rather than using amenities like public pools, parks and movie theaters, and participate in community activities like church and school functions, the authors contended that more people were retreating to large homes designed as a safe and pleasant refuge.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pp-kBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT446&amp;dq=cocooning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5oo--u4_PAhWDMyYKHdQKBl04FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cocooning&amp;f=false|title=The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia|last=Coleman|first=Marilyn J.|last2=Ganong|first2=Lawrence H.|date=2014-09-02|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781483370422|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corporate design''' (CD) is the official graphical [[design]] of the [[logo]] and name of a [[company]] or institution used on [[letterhead]]s, envelopes, forms, folders, [[brochure]]s, etc. The [[Corporate identity|house style]] is created in such a way that all the elements are arranged in a distinctive design and pattern.

This includes dictating what ink [[pantone]]s should be used in the coloring, and what [[typeface]]s.

Governments may have corporate designs as well. On June 2, 1999, the German federal cabinet introduced a corporate design for the flag of Germany.&lt;ref name="design-literatur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/Webs/SG/DE/Print-Styleguide/Basiselemente/Farben/Primaerfarben/primaerfarben.html |title=Primärfarben |work=Corporate Design Documentation |author=Federal Government of Germany |date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-26 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915085300/http://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/Webs/SG/DE/Print-Styleguide/Basiselemente/Farben/Primaerfarben/primaerfarben.html |archivedate=15 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'corporate design' is not the name of a specific design profession.

Corporations do have special design needs based on their behaviors. They communicate their mission, objectives, needs, and product information -- with users, clients, or members; with suppliers, distributors, service providers; with the surrounding community and the media; with financial institutions and other corporations, and with the state. They create, acquire, modify, organize and distribute large amounts of information and raw data, as well as goods and services. (Sometimes the goods or services are themselves information. For example, ''The Yellow Pages'', or ''The New York Times''.)

A designer whose client is a corporation will include the logo and other elements of the corporate brand as a way to standardize and unify all communication between company and audience, whether in print or online. Scenarios that includes human-computer interactions take place through software and hardware user interfaces that are also branded and designed with the [[corporate culture]] in mind. (Examples of user scenarios: update the Web site, transfer funds, document procedures, control security, operate machinery, plan projects, conduct virtual meetings, check inventory, fill an order, or ship a product.)

These interactions are increasingly taking place through Web sites, through mobile devices and at dedicated terminals, and may include sound, video, animation and user feedback mechanisms. A savvy designer will create designs that can be adapted to all of these applications.

[[File:David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr, 1751-1827) (print) NLW3362443.jpg|right|thumb|David Richards (Dafydd Ionawr)]]
'''David Richards''' (22 January 1751 – 12 May 1827), better-known by his [[bardic name]] '''Dafydd Ionawr''', was a [[Welsh-language]] poet, born at Glanyrafon near [[Bryncrug|Bryn-crug]] in the parish of [[Tywyn]] in [[Merionethshire]] (now [[Gwynedd]]), north-west [[Wales]].

He took an interest in poetry as a result of his acquaintance with [[Evan Evans (poet)|Evan Evans (Ieuan Brydydd Hir)]], who was curate of [[St Cadfan's Church, Tywyn]], and was later sent to a school at [[Ystradmeurig]] to obtain a better education than was available locally. After a period as a junior schoolmaster in [[Wrexham]], he spent one term at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], before going to teach at [[Oswestry]] [[grammar school]].  He then taught at the grammar school in [[Carmarthen]] before being appointed head of a free school in his native area.  From 1800 to 1807, he taught in [[Dolgellau]], where he remained until his death.

'''Egersis''', in medical terminology, is an extreme state of alert [[wakefulness]], often used in the context of [[insomnia]]. This Greek word is usually translated as a rousing up, a rising, and/or an excitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Lexicon.show/ID/G1454/egersis.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian theology it's a stand in for "[[Resurrection]]". The word "egersis" appears once in the Christian New Testament at Matthew 27:53.  "Egeiro", a form of the same word meaning, appears a few times in the new testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntwords.com/resurrect.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some scholarly debate as to the [[Exegesis|exegetical]] interpretation of egersis with respect to the Christian resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVc3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA369&amp;lpg=PA369&amp;dq=egersis+uprising&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pLl23LSgch&amp;sig=UbgYbvo3FgCXHpluRrlHXgAn_Dk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JRR3VeKxCISaNpTrgMAH&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=egersis%20uprising&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theology of the ancient Greeks, the egersis was an annual festival celebrating the 'awakening' of a god/cult statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3424502016/melqart.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeHoLjPOtTUC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266&amp;dq=greek+god+egersis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_wfeps43E_&amp;sig=YLG5KKhBPilvoiOZOjxbDDfEi-A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xw53VdfnM4urNpCmgcAH&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These festivals sometimes took on a high importance. For example, [[Alexander the Great]] was prevented from making a sacrifice to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre's]] god [[Melqart]], in part because the egersis of Melqart was supposed to happen soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Tyre/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander took this as a sign of disrespect and famously laid siege to the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23065">The '''Estonian vocabulary''', i.e., the [[vocabulary]] of the [[Estonian language]], was influenced by many other language groups.

==Germanic languages==
The heaviest external contribution, nearly one third of the vocabulary, comes from [[Germanic languages]], mainly from Low Saxon ([[Middle Low German]]) during the period of [[History of Estonia#The Middle Ages|German rule]], and [[High German]] (including [[standard German]]). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22–25 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Liin, Helgi 1968.

Tallinn: Eesti Raamat, 47–70 {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fillu.edu.ee/sisu.php?id=30&amp;teema=2 History of Estonian vocabulary] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ex nihilo'' lexical enrichment==
Estonian language planners such as [[Ado Grenzstein]] (a journalist active in Estonia in the 1870s–90s) tried to use formation ''[[ex nihilo]]'', ''[[Urschöpfung]]'',&lt;ref name="palgrave.com"&gt;See p. 149 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] 2003, [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], Houndmills: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], (Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change, Series editor: Charles Jones). {{ISBN|1-4039-1723-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. they created new words out of nothing. Examples are Ado Grenzstein's coinages ''kabe'' ‘draughts, chequers’ and ''male'' ‘chess’.&lt;ref name="palgrave.com"/&gt;

The most famous reformer of Estonian, [[Johannes Aavik]] (1880–1973), also used creations ''ex nihilo'' (cf. ‘free constructions’, Tauli 1977), along with other sources of lexical enrichment such as derivations, compositions and loanwords (often from Finnish; cf. Saareste and Raun 1965: 76). Aavik belonged to the so-called [[Young Estonia|Noor Eesti]] (‘Young Estonia’) movement, which appeared in Tartu, a university town in south-eastern Estonia, around 1905 (for discussion, see Raun 1991). In Aavik’s dictionary (1921), which lists approximately 4000 words, there are many words which were (allegedly) created ''ex nihilo''. Consider • ''ese'' ‘object’, • ''kolp'' ‘skull’, • ''liibuma'' ‘to cling’, • ''naasma'' ‘to return, come back’, • ''nõme'' ‘stupid, dull’, • ''range'' ‘strict’, • ''reetma'' ‘to betray’, • ''solge'' ‘slim, flexible, graceful’ (which did not gain currency, cf. Contemporary Estonian ''graatsiline'' ‘graceful’, although the word itself is used for a parasitic worm, namely [[Ascaris lumbricoides]]), and • ''veenma'' ‘to convince’. Other Aavikisms ''ex nihilo'' (not appearing in Aavik 1921) include • ''nentima'' ‘to admit, state’, • ''nördima'' ‘to grow indignant’, • ''süüme'' ‘conscience’, and • ''tõik'' ‘fact’."&lt;ref name="palgrave.com"/&gt;

Note, however, that many of the coinages that have been considered (often by Aavik himself) as words concocted ''ex nihilo'' could well have been influenced by foreign lexical items, for example words from [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[English language|English]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Aavik had a broad classical education and knew [[Ancient Greek]], [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]]. Consider • ''relv'' ‘weapon’ versus English ''revolver'', • ''roim'' ‘crime’ versus English ''crime'', • ''siiras'' ‘sincere’ versus English ''sincere''/''serious'' • ''embama'' ‘to embrace’ versus English ''embrace'', and • ''taunima'' ‘to condemn, disapprove’ versus Finnish ''tuomita'' ‘to judge’ (these Aavikisms appear in Aavik’s 1921 dictionary). Consider also • ''evima'' ‘to have, possess, own’ (cf. also Estonian ''omama'' ‘to own’, and ''mul on'', lit. ‘to me is’, i.e. ‘for me there is’, meaning ‘I have’) versus English ''have''; • ''laup'' ‘forehead’ versus Russian лоб lob ‘forehead’; • ''mõrv'' ‘murder’ and ''mõrvama'' ‘to murder’ versus English ''murder'' and German ''Mord'' (these Aavikisms do not appear in Aavik 1921); and • ''laip'' ‘corpse’ versus German ''Leib'' ‘body’ and German ''Leiche'' ‘body, corpse’. These words might be better regarded as a peculiar manifestation of morpho-phonemic adaptation of a foreign lexical item. The often irregular and arbitrary sound changes could then be explained not as subconscious foreign influence but rather as conscious manipulation by the coiner. Aavik seems to have paid little attention to the origin of his neologisms. On occasion, he replaced existing native words or expressions with neologisms of foreign descent. Therefore, Aavik cannot be considered a [[Linguistic purism|purist]] in the traditional sense, i.e. he was not ‘anti-foreignisms/loanwords’ as such.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 150 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] 2003, [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], Houndmills: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], (Palgrave Studies in Language History and Language Change, Series editor: Charles Jones). {{ISBN|1-4039-1723-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tables of word origin ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}

===Inherited vocabulary===
[[File:Estonian vocabulary.png|350px|thumbnail|right|Approximate share of root word origins in Estonian.]]
Inherited vocabulary in Estonian can be classified according to how far off they have [[cognate]]s among the other [[Uralic languages]].
* "Uralic" words have known cognates in the [[Samoyedic languages]].
* "[[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]]" words have known cognates at furthest in the [[Ugric languages]].
* "[[Finno-Permic languages|Finno-Permic]]" words have known cognates at furthest in the [[Permic languages]].
* "[[Finno-Volgaic languages|Finno-Volgaic]]" words have known cognates at furthest in the [[Mari language]] or the [[Mordvinic languages]] (formerly known as "Volgaic").
* "[[Finno-Samic languages|Finno-Samic]]" words have known cognates at furthest in the [[Samic languages]].
* "Finnic" words have known cognates only among the [[Finnic languages]].
All these groups correspond to different [[Classification of the Uralic languages|proposed subgroups]] of the Uralic languages. However, the historical reality of most groupings is disputed. In principle e.g. a "Finno-Permic" word may be just as old as a "Uralic" word, just one whose descendants have not survived to the modern Samoyedic and Ugric languages.

The '''French Wikipedia''' ({{lang-{{#property:P424}}|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is the [[French-language]] edition of the free [[online encyclopedia]] [[Wikipedia]]. This edition was started in March 2001, and has [[:fr:Special:Statistics|{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|fr|N}}]] [[encyclopedia article|articles]] as of {{Currentmonthday}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, making it the fifth-largest Wikipedia overall, after the [[English Wikipedia|English]]-, [[Dutch Wikipedia|Dutch]]-, [[German Wikipedia|German]]-, [[Swedish Wikipedia|Swedish]]- and [[Cebuano Wikipedia|Cebuano]]-language editions, the largest Wikipedia edition in a [[Romance language]]. It has the third-largest number of edits. It was also the third edition, after the English Wikipedia and German Wikipedia, to exceed 1 million [[encyclopedia]] articles: this occurred on 23 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/wikipedia-en-francais-depasse-le-million-d-articles-39754828.htm|title=Wikipédia en français dépasse le million d'articles|work=ZDNet France}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the project had 4657 active editors who made at least five edits in that month.

In 2008, the French encyclopaedia, ''[[Quid (encyclopedia)|Quid]]'', cancelled its 2008 edition, citing falling sales on competition from the French edition of Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;Litchfield, John.

''[[The Independent]]''. Wednesday 20 February 2008. Retrieved on 26 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2014|June}}, Wikipedia has an [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] ranking of 6 and 5.06% of those visits are to the French-language edition.&lt;ref name="alexa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/wikipedia.org|title=Wikipedia.org Site Info|publisher=[[Alexa Internet]]|accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, there are {{formatnum:{{#expr:{{NUMBEROF|USERS|fr}}round -3}}}} users, {{NUMBEROF|ADMINS|fr}} admins and {{formatnum:{{NUMBEROF|FILES|fr}}}} files on the French Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaFR.htm|title=Wikipedia Statistics - Tables - French|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2014, the French-language Wikipedia encyclopedia became the 3rd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias_by_edits_per_article|title=List of Wikipedias by edits per article|work=wikimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; linguistic edition by number of registered users since its creation, overtaking for the first time the German edition, with {{formatnum:2022504}} registered users,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Spécial:Statistiques]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Spezial:Statistik]]&lt;/ref&gt; behind the English ({{formatnum:23300456}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Special:Statistics]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish ({{formatnum:3401493}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Especial:Estad%C3%ADsticas&amp;action=raw|title=Estadísticas|work=es.wikipedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; language editions.

According to a 2013 study by the [[Oxford Internet Institute]], [[Ségolène Royal]] ([[:fr:Ségolène Royal|FR]]) and [[unidentified flying object]] ([[:fr:objet volant non identifié|objet volant non identifié]]) were the most controversial articles on the French Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Taha Yasseri |author2=Anselm Spoerri |author3=Mark Graham |author4=János Kertész |title=The most controversial topics in Wikipedia: A multilingual and geographical analysis|date=8 Jul 2013|arxiv=1305.5566v2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The audience measurement company [[Médiamétrie]] questioned a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of 8,500 users residing in France with access to [[Internet]] at home or at their place of work. Médiamétrie found that in June 2007, French Wikipedia had: 7,910,000 unique visitors that visited the site at least once during the month of June 2007 (compared to 4,355,000 unique visitors in June 2006); 2.7 visits per visitor during the period (2.0 visits in June 2006); had held the 12th position (21st in 2006) in "the Top 30 most visited sites in France, ''excluding'' Internet applications," according to the criterion of the number of unique visitors and 12th position in "the Top 30 most visited sites in France, ''including'' Internet applications," like [[eMule]] or [[RealNetworks|Real Networks]] (22nd position in June 2006).

By August 2011, French Wikipedia was the 7th most visited site in France, with nearly 16 million unique visitors a month (according to Médiamétrie). In April 2012, it had 20 million unique visitors per month, or 2.4 million per day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/wikipedia-depasse-20-millions-de-visiteurs-mois-en-france-mediametrie-39772318.htm |title=Wikipédia dépasse 20 millions de visiteurs/mois en France (Médiamétrie) |publisher=ZDNet |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 700 million page views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummaryFR.htm|title=French Wikipedia at a glance |website=stats.wikimedia.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530002058/http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummaryFR.htm |archivedate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuerdai are sons and daughters of the Chinese ''nouveau riche'' of the early years of [[Chinese economic reform|China's reform era]] from the late 1970s onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a56901/rich-chinese-kids-vancouver-sports-cars-instagram/|title=Check Out the Insanely Lavish Lives of the Rich Kids of China|date=2016-04-14|newspaper=Cosmopolitan|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the new era, in which private initiative could be rewarded by wealth, many new rich Chinese emerged in the former-[[socialist]] Chinese society. While such wealthy individuals may have reached their new [[socioeconomic]] position either through their own initiative and efforts or by becoming powerful members of the ruling party, their children often enjoy a comfortable lifestyle and have a much easier and obstacle-free life path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Children of the Yuan Percent: Everyone Hates China’s Rich Kids| url =https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-10-01/children-of-the-yuan-percent-everyone-hates-china-s-rich-kids | publisher=Bloomberg | date=September 30, 2015 |accessdate =December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninaxiang/2015/10/19/are-chinas-fuerdai-wisely-investing-or-wasting-their-parents-money/#cd597213e7d3|title=Are China's Fuerdai Wisely Investing, Or Wasting Their Parents' Money? |date=19 October 2015 |last=Xiang|first=Nina |newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many wealthy Chinese send their children abroad for their education.&lt;ref name="newyorker1" /&gt; This is especially true in the [[United States]], Europe, and parts of [[Canada]], where it is very common to see well-off Chinese students attending universities driving expensive cars, and wearing brand name clothing and gadgets which have price tags that are out of reach for the vast majority of North American and European students.&lt;ref name="SCMP1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Young, rich and Chinese: it’s life in the fast lane for the emerging class of fuerdai|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2005658/young-rich-and-chinese-its-life-fast-lane-emerging-class-fuerdai|website=South China Morning Post|date=19 August 2016|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Chinese Students Major in Luxury Cars| url =https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-12-19/chinese-students-in-u-dot-s-dot-boost-luxury-car-sales | publisher=Bloomberg |date=December 19, 2013 |accessdate =December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities look favorably upon this kind of international student, as they generate more revenue and tend to pay higher tuition fees.

The term has also seen limited use a general label for anyone with rich parents and enjoyed a privileged upbringing as a result. Non-Chinese figures, such as [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Donald Trump]], have been described by Chinese media as ''fuerdai''.&lt;ref name="Castro"&gt;{{cite news|title=卡斯特罗：反叛的富二代|url=http://slide.news.sina.com.cn/j/slide_1_45272_43703.html/d/8#p=1|publisher=Sina Images|date=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Generic Access Profile''' ('''GAP''') ([[ETSI]] standard EN 300 444&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT); Generic Access Profile (GAP) - ETSI EN 300 444 V2.5.1 (2017-10)|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/300400_300499/300444/02.05.01_60/en_300444v020501p.pdf|work=European Standard (Telecommunications series)|publisher=ETSI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;) describes a set of mandatory requirements to allow any conforming [[DECT]] Fixed Part (base) to interoperate with any conforming DECT Portable Part (handset) to provide basic telephony services when attached to a 3.1&amp;nbsp;kHz telephone network (as defined by EN 300 176-2).

The objective of GAP is to ensure interoperation at the air interface (i.e., the radio connection) and at the level of procedures to establish, maintain and release telephone calls (Call Control). GAP also mandates procedures for registering Portable Parts to a Fixed Part (Mobility Management). A GAP-compliant handset from one manufacturer should work, at the basic level of making calls, with a GAP-compliant base from another manufacturer, although it may be unable to access advanced features of the base station such as phone book synchronization or remote operation of an [[answering machine]]. Most consumer-level DECT phones and base stations support the GAP profile, even those that do not publicize the feature, and thus can be used together. However some manufacturers lock their systems to prevent interoperability, or supply bases that cannot register new handsets.

The GAP does not describe how the Fixed Part is connected to the external telephone network.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2535">'''Heil og sæl''' ([[English language|English]]: lit. ''healthy and happy'') was a common greeting in [[Norsemen|Norse society]], then spelled ''heill ok sæll''. It was also used by nationalists in the 20th century.

== Etymology ==
Originally a Norse greeting, “heil og sæl” had the form “heill ok sæll” when addressed to a man and “heil ok sæl” when addressed to a woman. Other versions were “ver heill ok sæll” (lit. ''be healthy and happy'') and simply “heill” (lit. ''healthy'').&lt;ref name="Heggstad"&gt;Heggstad 2012:254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian adjective ''heil'' (also ''hel'') is related to the English adjective ''whole''/''hale''. The Norwegian verb ''heile'' (also ''hele'') is related to the English verb ''heal'' through their common origin, the Germanic word stem ''*haila-'', from which even the German verb ''heilen'' descends.

The Norwegian adjective ''sæl'', meaning ''happy'' or ''glad'', is in Old English documented only in the negated variant ''unsǣle'', meaning ''evil''.&lt;ref name="Bjorvand Lindemand"&gt;Bjorvand &amp; Lindemand 2001:900.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th-century use ==
According to ''[[Store norske leksikon]]'', the originally Norse greeting “heill ok sæll” was&amp;mdash;adjusted to modern orthography and pronunciation&amp;mdash;adopted as “heil og sæl” by the political party [[Nasjonal Samling]].&lt;ref name="SNL heil"&gt;[[Store norske leksikon]]: [http://snl.no/heil heil]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Bokmålsordboka]]'', the adoption was inspired by Germany's “[[Nazi salute|Heil Hitler]]” and similar.&lt;ref name="Bokmålsordboka heil"&gt;[[Bokmålsordboka]]: [http://www.nob-ordbok.uio.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=heil&amp;bokmaal heil]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[German occupation of Norway|1940–1945 German occupation of Norway]], Nasjonal Samling, being the governing and only legal political party, sought to introduce all parts of society to a greeting combining “heil og sæl” and a raised right hand. Whilst the attempt was not successful, the said greeting remained compulsory for party members and police. It has subsequently remained closely associated with nationalism.

The '''Itsekiri''' language is a major branch of the [[Yoruboid]]&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Kay 1989, Benue–Congo Overview, p248-278&lt;/ref&gt; group of languages, which as a group, is a key member of the [[Volta–Niger]] sub-family of the [[Niger–Congo]] family of [[African languages]]. Itsekiri is spoken by nearly 900,000 people in [[Nigeria]] as a first language and by many others as an additional language notably in the [[Niger Delta]] and in parts of [[Edo State|Edo]] and [[Ondo State|Ondo]] states of Nigeria. The other key members of the Yoruboid group are [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] (22 million) and  [[Igala language|Igala]] (1.8 million) along with the various Yoruba dialects spoken in [[Benin]] and [[Togo]].

==Classification==
Itsekiri is most closely related to the Yoruba dialects of south western Nigeria with which it shares close similarity in grammar, lexicon and syntax. Itsekiri represents one end of a continuum of Yoruba dialects from the northern Yoruba lands of Oyo and Offa to the western reaches of the Niger-Delta. In many ways standard Yoruba and Itsekiri may be considered official variants of the same language. Although Itsekiri and the South Eastern Yoruba dialects are mutually intelligible to varying degrees depending on proximity to each other, however, unlike Yoruba dialect speakers, native Itsekiri speakers do not recognise or use the standard Yoruba language as their official lingua franca. This may be owing to the historical isolation of the main body of Itsekiri speakers (in the Niger Delta) from the continuum of Yoruba speakers and centuries of developing a separate and distinct Itsekiri socio-cultural and national identity. Nevertheless, from a linguistic standpoint, both Itsekiri and standard Yoruba (based on the Oyo dialect) can be considered to represent two official variants of what is essentially the same language - one is a Southern Yoruba dialectal fusion of Ijebu, Ondo, Owo - spoken as a national language by under a million people and the other a fusion of Oyo and Eko dialects now spoken as a standard language by over 20 million people.

Itsekiri is most closely related to Yoruba and Igala and incorporates elements of both languages. It has also been very heavily influenced by Edo (Bini), [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[English people|English]] and has taken in loan words from neighbouring [[Ijaw languages|Ijo]] and [[Urhobo language|Urhobo]] languages. However its basic structure, grammar and vocabulary is essentially Yoruboid with its closest relatives being the south-eastern family of Yoruba dialects - Ijebu, Ilaje-Ikale, Ondo, Akure and Owo. Whilst closely resembling those dialects however the Itsekiri language also features elements of Northern Yoruba notably The Ife and Oyo dialects. It is generally believed that the Itsekiri Language has developed out of an amalgam of languages spoken by various groups present in the western Niger-delta at the time of the formation of the Itsekiri nation in the 15th century. Because it has developed in the relative isolation of the Niger-Delta away from the main body of Yoruba dialects and from Igala - Itsekiri like most languages (that develop away from the main family body e.g. [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]) has preserved many of the original/archaic features of the original proto-Yoruba-Igala language and in particular the old Ijebu dialect of Yoruba. It is also possible that Itsekiri represents a surviving remnant of what could once have been the original Yoruba-Igala language before the split into separate languages.

Itsekiri is important to philologists and linguists today because of its role in comparative linguistics and in particular the study of the development of the Yoruba language. The Yoruba, English and Pidgin-English languages remain key modern-day influences on the development of the Itsekiri language today.

{{nihongo|'''''Kan-on'''''|漢音||"Han sound"}} is one of the sources of [[pronunciation]] of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[kanji]]. They were borrowed during the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 9th century), introduced by, among others, envoys from [[Japanese missions to Tang China]]. This period corresponds with the Japanese [[Nara period]]. Not to be confused with [[Tō-on]] "Tang sound", which actually refers to later phonetic loans.

''Kan-on'' is based on the central [[Chang'an]] pronunciation.&lt;ref name='Miyake'&gt;{{cite book|last=Miyake|first=Marc Hideo |authorlink=Marc Miyake|title=Old Japanese: A Phonetic Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bp_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-40373-8|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Kan'' could refer to the [[Han dynasty]], which also had Chang'an as its [[capital city]].&lt;ref name='Miyake'/&gt; Furthermore, ''Kan'' has also become a description for all things Chinese, e.g., [[Kanji]] ('Chinese characters').

Kan'on partly displaced the earlier ''[[Go-on|go'on]]'', which were "just imitations of [[Hanja#Pronunciation|Korean imitations]], but ''Kan-on'' were imitations of the real things."&lt;ref name='Miyake'/&gt;

A minority of characters never had their ''Kan-on'' transmitted to Japan; their ''Kan-on'' are sometimes reconstructed in [[Japanese dictionary|Japanese dictionaries]] although not specifically marked as such. A few dictionaries go as far as to discard attested ''Kan-on'' in favour of more systematic pronunciations.&lt;ref name='Miyake'/&gt;

He was a champion of teaching [[Nepal Bhasa]] as a subject in school even though it was not his mother tongue, and played a central role in having it included in the curriculum of Kanya Mandir High School. 

In 1969, Neupane was named an advisor to the National Educational Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title= Nepal Press Report, Issues 200-299 |url= https://books.google.com.np/books?id=erUjAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=kedar+nath+neupane+kanya+mandir&amp;dq=kedar+nath+neupane+kanya+mandir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xrP4UaicDoH7rAeAnIGwCg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA |accessdate=31 July 2013 |year=1969 |publisher= Regmi Research Project |location= Kathmandu |isbn= |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also served as secretary of Chwasā Pāsā, a Nepal Bhasa literary organization, and worked to promote it along with cultural expert Satya Mohan Joshi and litterateurs Kedar Man Byathit and Dhunswa Sayami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Nepal Sambat will have no adverse impact |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=9026&amp;cat_id=29 |accessdate=8 August 2013 |newspaper=The Rising Nepal |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053114/http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/gopa.detail.php?article_id=9026&amp;cat_id=29 |archivedate= 8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appeared in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bajracharya |first= Phanindra Ratna |title= Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher= Nepal Bhasa Academy |location= Kathmandu |isbn=99933-560-0-X |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], closely related to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], all linguistic descendants of [[Old Norse]]. Norwegian is used by some 95% of the population as a first language. The language has two separate [[Standard language|written standards]]: [[Nynorsk]] ("New Norwegian", "New" in the sense of contemporary or modern) and [[Bokmål]] ("Book Language/Tongue/Speech"), both of which are official.

===Norwegian language struggle===
[[Image:Denmark-Norway in 1780.svg|thumb|right|175px|The Kingdom of Denmark-Norway until 1814.]]
Known as ''Språkstriden'' in Norwegian, the [[Norwegian language struggle]] is a movement rooted in both Norwegian nationalism and the 400 years of [[Denmark|Danish]] rule in Norway (''see [[Denmark-Norway]]''). The [[koiné language]] (mixed language) known as [[Dano-Norwegian]] (''Dansk-Norsk'') which developed in Norwegian cities was the result of Danish replacing Norwegian as the language of the upper classes in that country (Danish was used in the courts of law and by the ruling class, and after the [[Lutheran Reformation]] of 1536 it replaced [[Latin language|Latin]] as a [[liturgical language]]). The adoption of Norwegian orthography into the Danish language gave rise to the written standard of [[Riksmål]], which later became Bokmål. Nynorsk, a new standard of Norwegian based upon the spoken language in rural Norway, was acknowledged by the parliament in 1885, and in 1892 it was first possible to use Nynorsk as a language of primary instruction. By 1920, Nynorsk was being used widely in western Norway and the mountain valleys, where it still has its stronghold, and Bokmål was used in the more populous areas of the country. Later, attempts were made to reconcile the two standards into ''Samnorsk'', or "Common Norwegian", although this never came to fruition.

===Bokmål===
Bokmål, the written language of 80-90% of the Norwegian population,&lt;ref name="sprakrad"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Almenningen
| first = Olaf
| year = 1996
| title = Nynorsk i Noreg i dag

| url = http://www.sprakrad.no/upload/snytt961.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on Riksmål, although it differs in terms of genders, lexicon, counting system, a tendency to permit concrete noun endings in abstract situations and diphthongs versus single vowels. Riksmål was officially changed to Bokmål in 1929.

===Nynorsk===
Nynorsk was developed by the linguist [[Ivar Aasen]] in the 1850s, based on rural, spoken Norwegian, rather than the cultured, Danish-influenced Norwegian spoken in cities. Its first official codification was in 1901, was given the name Nynorsk in 1929, and has been used officially (alongside Bokmål) since 1938. Its usage, however has declined: in 1944 it was used by 34.1% (highest recorded number), in 1971 by 17.5% of the population, today, some 15% of schoolchildren are taught Nynorsk as their written language, and Nynorsk is reportedly used as main form of Norwegian by around 7.4% of the total population, whereas an additional 5% switch between Bokmål and Nynorsk.&lt;ref name="sprakrad" /&gt;

;Høgnorsk
A more conservative variation of Nynorsk exists, called [[Høgnorsk]]. It has few active users, but is supported by the [[Ivar Aasen-sambandet]] organization, founded in 1965 in response to the [[samnorsk]] policy of the government at the time.

==Sami languages==
[[Image:Sami languages large.png|thumb|right|150px|Geographic distribution of the Sami languages: 1. South Sami, 3. Pite Sami, 4. Lule Sami, 5. Northern Sami]]
The [[Sami people]] are [[indigenous people|indigenous]] to Northern Scandinavia,&lt;ref&gt;Sammallahti, Pekka, 1990. The Sámi Language: Past and Present. Arctic Languages: An Awakening.

Assimilation of the Sami - Implementation and Consequences. Gáldu Čála: Journal of Indigenous Peoples Rights No. 3. Kautokeino. {{ISBN|82-8144-012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;— some still speak their [[indigenous languages|indigenous]] [[Sami languages]].  Sami languages, like Kven and Finnish, belong to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family. By far the most spoken form of Sami in Norway is [[North Sami]] (spoken by around 15,000 Norwegian Sami). The others are [[Lule Sami]] (spoken by around 500 in Norway),  [[Pite Sami]] (which is [[Endangered language|nearly extinct]]) and [[South Sami]] (which has around 300 speakers in Norway). Sami and Norwegian are the official languages of Norway, and Sami is protected by the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vikør|first=Lars S.|date=2017-10-17|title=språk i Norge|url=http://snl.no/spr%C3%A5k_i_Norge|journal=Store norske leksikon|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norges grunnlov, § 108 (Constitution of Norway, article 108, mention the Sami language specifically)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/stmeld-nr-35-2007-2008-/id519923/sec4|title=St.meld. nr. 35 (2007-2008)|first=Kultur- og|last=kirkedepartementet|date=27 June 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kven==
[[Image:Norway Counties Finnmark Position.svg|thumb|left|150px|The county of Finnmark]]
[[Image:Norway Counties Troms Position.svg|thumb|right|150px|The county of Troms]]
Spoken by the [[Kven people]], the [[Kven language]] is a Finnic language, closely related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and spoken by some five to eight thousand people in northeastern Norway, particularly in [[Tromsø]] (in the county of [[Troms]]) and [[Finnmark]]. Mirroring the situation of [[Meänkieli]] in [[Sweden]], Kven is sometimes considered to be a dialect of Finnish, and has a large degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with the language.

==Romani==
The [[Romani people]] are a diaspora population originating in [[India]], and today are spread across all of [[Europe]]. The [[Romani language]], an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Indo-Aryan language]] (related to other languages spoken in India today), is split into a great number of dialects. Two of these, [[Tavringer Romani]] and [[Vlax Romani]], are spoken in Norway, by populations of 6,000 and 500, respectively. [[Scandoromani]] is another Romani dialect indigenous to Norway, as well as Sweden. Because of the wandering nature of the Roma people, there is no geographic stronghold of the Romani language in Norway.

==Norwegian Traveller==&lt;!-- Americans: the British spelling, "travellers", is better here --&gt;
Spoken by the [[Indigenous Norwegian Travellers|Norwegian Travellers]], a gypsy population in Norway which intermarried with Romani and [[Yeniche people|Yeniche]] (German Traveller) populations, the Norwegian Traveller language, also known as [[Rodi language|Rodi]], is based on Norwegian, but has heavy borrowing from Northern Romani and [[Rotwelsch]]. There is no estimate on how many Norwegian Traveller speakers there are in Norway, but it is known that the language is alive.

'''Latrinalia''' is a type of deliberately inscribed marking made on [[latrine]]s: that is, bathrooms or lavatory walls.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/garden/03punk.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0977282759&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yahoo.com/music/blogs/stop-the-presses/rock-scariest-bathroom-immortalized-cbgb-movie-180133133.html&lt;/ref&gt; It can take the form of [[art]], [[drawing]]s, or [[language|word]]s, including [[poetry]] and personal reflections. Other types of latrinalia include political commentary as well as derogatory comments and pictures. When done without the [[property]] owner's [[consent]], it constitutes [[vandalism]]. Some venues have attempted to curb such vandalism by installing in the lavatory large [[blackboard]]s and providing free [[chalk]]; it is hoped that patrons will avail themselves of the blackboard and chalk rather than applying their latrinalia directly to the walls or toilet stalls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://130.212.44.5/storys01.php?storyid=3407 Golden Gate [X&amp;#93;Press Online | R.I.P. All Your Base Are Belong To Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmmonline.com/article.asp?IndexID=6635560 |title=Cleaning &amp; Maintenance Management Online :: Brought to you by Grand View Media |publisher=Cmmonline.com |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2012-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522154106/http://www.cmmonline.com/article.asp?IndexID=6635560 |archivedate=2006-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The late [[Alan Dundes]], a folklorist at [[University of California, Berkeley]], coined the term ''latrinalia'' in 1966 to refer to [[graffiti]] found in restrooms.&lt;ref name="Alan_Dundes"&gt;{{cite paper | author=[[Alan Dundes|Dundes, Alan]] | title=Here I Sit &amp;mdash; A Study of American Latrinalia | publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]: Kroeber Anthropological Society Papers | date=1966 | url=http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~kas/kas_archives/vol_78/contents/volume_30-39.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120032605/http://sscl.berkeley.edu/~kas/kas_archives/vol_78/contents/volume_30-39.html | archivedate=2005-11-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dundes preferred it over the term ''shithouse poetry'', as not all latrinalia is in verse or poetic form.&lt;ref name="Alan_Dundes" /&gt;

The word is derived from the [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]] of ''latrine'' (or toilet) and the [[Affix|suffix]] ''-alia'', which signifies a worthless collection of something &amp;mdash; in this case bathroom writings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1367">The '''''Laud Herbal Glossary''''' (MS Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 587) is a twelfth-century copy of the single biggest compilation of plant-name glosses of its time in England, rooted in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] sources. Its lemmata are mostly Latin, and these are mostly glossed into [[Old English language|Old English]]/[[Middle English language|Middle English]].&lt;ref&gt;Stracke, J. Richard, ed. 1974. ''The Laud Herbal Glossary''. Amsterdam: Rodopi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Laud Herbal Glossary drew on many sources, its main sources for vernacular glosses are a list of plant-names in the Greek primer, the ''[[Hermeneumata Pseudo-Dositheana]]'' (the best preserved manuscript of which appears to be Brussels, Bibliothèque Royale, 1828–30, folios 94–95, which gives the names under the title 'Nomina herbarum Grece et Latine'); the ''[[Old English Herbarium]]''; and a text very like the ''[[Durham Plant-Name Glossary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rusche, Philip Guthrie. 2008. ‘The sources for plant names in Anglo-Saxon England and the Laud Herbal Glossary’, in ''Health and Healing in the Medieval Garden'', ed. by Peter Dendle and Alan Touwaide, 128–44.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2398">'''Laxman Londhe''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: लक्ष्मण लोंढे 13 October 1944 - 6 Aug 2015) was a noted novelist and [[science fiction]] author in [[Marathi language|Marathi]].  He was part of the modern Marathi literary movement to popularize science in the late 1970s, with a group of authors rising to prominence, including [[Bal Phondke]], [[Niranjan Ghate]], [[Jayant Narlikar]], and several others.&lt;ref name=ency&gt;''Science Fiction (Marathi)'', in 
Mohan Lal, Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: sasay to zorgot, p.3893-94

He had also converted several of his stories into plays, and TV episodes.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt;
Many of his stories have been acclaimed in translation, including the title story from ''Second Einstein'', which has been anthologized in several collections including 
[[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]]'s [[The Road to Science Fiction]] 6: Around the World'', (1989)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iblist.com/book19694.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and

'''Limbu''' (Limbu: ᤕᤠᤰᤌᤢᤱ ᤐᤠᤴ, ''yakthung pān'') is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] spoken by the [[Limbu people]] of eastern [[Nepal]] and [[India]] (particularly [[Darjeeling]], [[Kalimpong]], [[Sikkim]], [[Assam]] and [[Nagaland]]) as well as expatriate communities in [[Bhutan]], [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Canada and the US. The Limbu refer to themselves as ''Yakthung'' and their language as ''Yakthungpan.'' Yakthungpan has four main dialects: Phedape, Chhathare, Tambarkhole and Panthare dialects.&lt;ref&gt;A Grammar of Limbu By George van Driem 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Among four dialects and/or many dialects, the Phedape dialect is widely spoken and well understood by most Yakthungpan speakers. However, as there are some dominant Panthare scholars who have role to create knowledge and control knowledge in the [[Limbu]] communities, Panthare dialect is being popularised as a "standard" Limbu language. As Panthare Yakthungs are much more engaged in central political position and administrative positions, they are trying to introduce Panthare dialect as a Standard Yakthungpan.

Yakthungpan (Limbu language) is one of the major languages spoken and written in Nepal, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Sikkim, Bhutan, Burma, and Thailand. Today, linguists have reached the conclusion that Yakthungpan resembles [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] and [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]].

Before the introduction of the Sirijanga script among [[Limbu]] Kirats, the [[Róng script]] was popular in east Nepal, especially in the early Maurong state. The Sirijanga script had almost disappeared for 800 years and it was brought back into use by [[Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe]] of Tellok Sinam [[Limbuwan]] present day [[Nepal]]. The Limbu script is called 'Sirijanga' after the Limbu culture- hero [[Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe]], who is credited with its invention.&lt;ref&gt;The Unicode Standard 5.0, Front Cover By Unicode Consortium, Addison-Wesley, 2007- Computers 1417 pages, Page 360&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical distribution==
Limbu is spoken east of the [[Arun River, China-Nepal|Arun River]] in the following [[districts of Nepal]] (''[[Ethnologue]]'').

*[[Kosi Zone]]
**[[Sunsari]]
**[[Dhankuta District]]
**[[Sankhuwasabha District]]
**[[Terhathum District]]
**[[Morang District]]
*[[Mechi Zone]]
**[[Taplejung District]]
**[[Panchthar District]]
**[[Ilam District]]
**[[Jhapa District]]

==Dialects==
The Limbu languages are divided into four dialects :&lt;ref&gt;A Grammar of Limbu By George van Driem 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
*Phedappe
*Pachthare
*Chathare
*Taplejunge or Tamarkhole 


''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists the following dialects of Limbu.

*Dialect cluster 1
**Panthare
**Chaubise (Charkhole)
**Yanggrokke (Yanggruppe)
*Dialect cluster 2
**Phedappe
**Tamorkhole (Taplejunge)
*Dialect cluster 3
**Chhatthare (Chatthare, Chhathar)

Yanggrokke, Chaubise, and Charkhole are minor variants of the Panthare dialect. Phedappe and Tamorkhole are similar. Chattare is less well understood by other dialect speakers. The Limbu dialect spoken in [[Sikkim]], India is the same as Panthare.

==Sirijanga Script==
[[File:Limbu script.png|thumb|right|275px|The [[Limbu script]]. Grey letters are obsolete.]] 
Limbu language is one of the few [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] of the central [[Himalayas]] with their own scripts.&lt;ref&gt;(Sprigg 1959: 590)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Limbu script]] or Sirijanga script was devised during the period of Buddhist expansion in [[Sikkim]] in the early 18th century when [[Limbuwan]] still constituted part of Sikkimese territory.&lt;ref&gt;(Sprigg 1959: 591-592 &amp; MS: 1-4)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Limbu script]] was probably designed roughly at the same time as the [[Lepcha script]] (during the reign of the third King of [[Sikkim]], Phyag-dor Nam-gyal (ca. 1700-1717)). However, it is widely believed that the [[Limbu script]] (Sirijanga) had been designed by the King Sirijanga in the 9th century. The Sirijanga script was later redesigned and re-introduced by [[Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe]] . As Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe spent most of his time in the development of Yakthungpan, Yatkhung culture, and [[Limbu script]]; he is considered as the reincarnation of the 9th century King Sirijanga.

As [[Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe]] was astoundingly influential person to spread [[Limbu script]], culture, and language, Tasang monks feared him. Tasang monks feared that [[Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe]] might transform the social, cultural, and linguistic structure of Sikkim. Therefore, Tasang monks captured Sirijunga, bound him to a tree, and shot him to death with poisonous arrows.

Both Limbu and [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]] were ostensibly devised with the intent of furthering the spread [[Buddhism]]. However, Sirijanga was a Limbu Buddhist who had studied under Sikkimese high Lamas. Sirijanga was given the title 'the [[Dorje]] [[Lama]] of Yangrup'.

The language and script's influential structure are mixture of [[Tibetan script|Tibetan]] and [[Devanagari]]. Unlike most other Brahmic scripts, it does not have separate independent [[vowel]] characters, instead of using a vowel carrier letter with the appropriate dependent vowel attached.

The Limbu language and literature have been less practiced in Nepal since the last eighteenth century. The cultural identity of any community was taken as a threat to the national unification by ruling elites until the recent years. The use of [[Limbu alphabet]] was banned and the possession of Limbu writings outlawed. There were no specific laws about it, but the Security Act was enforced for such cases under the strong directives of Kathmandu.

==Writing==
Limbu has its own unique writing system, which is similar to Tibetan and Sikkimese scripts. The [[Limbu script]] or Sirijunga script is unique and scientifically designed by King Sirijanga in the 9th century; it was later re-designed and popularized by [[Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe]] and his followers in the 18th century. Since teaching of Limbu/Yakthung language and writing was banned by the Khas-Hindus in Nepal after the "Noon Pani Sandhi" between the [[Limbuwan]] and [[Gorkha Kingdom]] (Prithvi Narayan Shah), far more Limbus are [[literacy|literate]] in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] than in Limbu in Nepal. Although many Limbu books were written in Devanagari and Roman (English), now Limbus/Yakthungs have well developed computerized writing system and many books are published in [[Limbu script]] or Sirijunga script.

History of Kirat-Yakthung writing can be divided into the following ways:

1.	Classical Kirat-Yakthung period: King Sirijanga (9th century AD)

2.	The 18th century Kirat-Yakthunghang period: [[Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe]] and his cronies movement
3.	The 19th century Kirat-Yakthung writers and rhetors: Period of Jobhansing Limbu, Chyangresing Phedangba, Ranadwaj, and Jit Mohan (Brian Hudgson procured books and requested them to write histories, stories, narratives, culture, and so on)

4. The 20th Century Kirat-Yakthung writers and rhetors: 
i.	After the establishment of "Yakthunghang Chumlung" (1925); thereafter, several books were published. 
ii.  Limbu script was much more influenced by Devnagari script at this period. 
iii.	At the same time, both national and international linguists, researchers, and writers addressed the issued in this period. This period is period of inquiry, communication, discovery, and re/construction.

5. Late 20th and 21st century Kirat-Yakthung writers and rhetors: This period denotes after the restoration of democracy in Nepal in 1990. Introduction of "Anipan" at school; many research and writing such as MA/MPhil theses and research reports; establishment of Limbu organization at the local and global level; period of delinking, relinking, and linking epistemologies.

==Publications==
The Limbu language has many papers and publications in circulation.
Tanchoppa (Morning Star), a monthly newspaper/magazine which has been published since 1995. There are many other literary publications.
The oldest known Limbu writings were collected from the Darjeeling district in the 1850s. They are the ancestors of the modern Limbu script. The writings are now a part of a collection in the India Library in London.

==Teaching==
In [[Nepal]], the Limbu language is taught on private initiative. The Government of Nepal has published " Ani Paan" text books in Limbu for Primary education from grades 1 to 5. Kirant Yakthung Chumlung teaches Limbu language and script in its own initiative.

In [[Sikkim]], since late 1970s Limbu, in Limbu script has been offered in English medium schools as a vernacular language subject in areas populated by Limbus. Over 4000 students study Limbu for one hour daily taught by some 300 teachers. Course books are available in Limbu from grades 1 to 12.

In [[sport]]s, a '''line call''' occurs when there is doubt as to whether a specific and significant event took place, for example, whether the ball in [[tennis]] touched the line rather than landing outside the court.

The phrase ''line call'' is more generally used to indicate any decision in which the correct course is uncertain.

The official rules of most sports indicate how line calls are to be resolved. The actual phrase ''line call'' may or may not appear in the official rules.

==Cricket==
In [[cricket]], uncertainty is generally resolved in the manner most favourable to the [[batsman]]. Thus,  if the umpires are not sure whether a dismissal actually occurred, the batsman is deemed not out. Similarly, if the umpires are unsure as to whether the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]]'s action was legal for a particular delivery, a [[no-ball]] is called.

In the [[Linguistics|study of language]], '''description''' or '''descriptive linguistics''' is the work of [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] analyzing and describing how [[language]] is actually used (or how it was used in the past) by a group of people in a speech community.

All academic research in [[linguistics]] is descriptive; like all other scientific disciplines, its aim is to describe the reality as it is, without the bias of preconceived ideas about how it ought to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić|first=Snježana|authorlink=Snježana Kordić|year=2010|language=Serbo-Croatian|title=Jezik i nacionalizam|trans-title=Language and Nationalism|url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|series=Rotulus Universitas|location=Zagreb|publisher=Durieux|page=60|isbn=978-953-188-311-5|lccn=2011520778|oclc=729837512|ol=15270636W|id={{COBISS|13436977}}|archivedate= 8 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690BiBe4T?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2015|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Moch.

Linguistic description is often contrasted with [[linguistic prescription]], which is found especially in [[education]] and in [[publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lawrence Trask|title=Key Concepts in Language and Linguistics|pages=47-48|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EE4dhRzavEgC|isbn=9780415157414|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Langer|title=Linguistic Purism in Action: How auxiliary tun was stigmatized in Early New High German|year=2013|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110881103|pages=223|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IZUiAAAAQBAJ|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescription seeks to define standard language forms and give advice on effective language use, and can be thought of as a presentation of the fruits of descriptive research in a learnable form, though it also draws on more subjective aspects of language aesthetics. Prescription and description are complementary, but have different priorities and sometimes are seen to be in conflict. Description is sometimes distinguished from "descriptivism", which is then defined as the belief that description is more significant or important to teach, study, and practice than prescription.

==Description==
As English-linguist Larry Andrews describes it, descriptive grammar is the linguistic approach that studies what a language is like, as opposed to prescriptive, which declares what a language should be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, descriptive grammarians focus analysis on how all sorts of people in all sorts of environments, usually in more casual, everyday settings, communicate, while prescriptive grammarians focus on the grammatical rules and structures predetermined by linguistic registers and figures of power for those who are under the control of said authorities to use. An example Andrews uses in his book is ''fewer than'' vs ''less than''.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A descriptive grammarian would state that both statements are correct, as long as the receiver of the message can understand the meaning behind the statement. A prescriptive grammarian, on the other hand, would analyze the rules and conventions behind the statements made and determine which statement is correct according to those rules. Andrews also believes that although the majority of linguists would be descriptive grammarians, the majority of public school teachers tend to be prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26" /&gt;

==Challenges==
Accurate description of real speech is a difficult problem, and linguists have often been reduced to approximations. Almost all linguistic theory has its origin in practical problems of descriptive linguistics. [[Phonology]] (and its theoretical developments, such as the [[phoneme]]) deals with the function and interpretation of sound in language. [[Syntax]] has developed to describe the rules concerning how words relate to each other in order to form sentences. [[Lexicology]] collects "words" and their derivations and transformations: it has not given rise to much generalized theory.

An extreme "mentalist" viewpoint denies that the linguistic description of a language can be done by anyone but a competent speaker. Such speakers have internalized something called "[[linguistic competence]]", which gives them the ability to extrapolate correctly from their experience new but correct expressions, and to reject expressions which do not convey meaning in the way the speaker intends. For example, an expression could be [[ambiguous]], possibly leading to several different interpretations by the listener. Depending on the speaker's intent, ambiguity can be desirable (as in [[joke]]s and other [[humor]]) or not. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A linguistic description is considered descriptively adequate if it achieves one or more of the following goals of descriptive linguistics:
# A description of the [[phonology]] of the language in question.
# A description of the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words belonging to that language.
# A description of the [[syntax]] of well-formed sentences of that language.
# A description of [[Derivation (linguistics)|lexical derivation]].
# A documentation of the [[vocabulary]], including at least one thousand entries.
# A reproduction of a few genuine texts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27558">[[Image:LATAs.png|thumb|right|350px|Map of LATAs in the US]] 
'''Local access and transport area''' ('''LATA''') is a term used in U.S. telecommunications regulation.  It represents a geographical area of the United States under the terms of the [[Modification of Final Judgment]] (MFJ) entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in Civil Action number 82-0192 or any other geographic area designated as a LATA in the [[National Exchange Carrier Association]], Inc. Tariff FCC No. 4. that precipitated the breakup of the original [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] into the "[[Regional Bell Operating Company|Baby Bells]]" or created since that time for [[Plain old telephone service|wireline]] regulation.

Generally, a LATA represents an area within which a [[divested]] [[Regional Bell Operating Company]] (RBOC) is permitted to offer [[telephone exchange|exchange]] telecommunications and exchange access services. Under the terms of the MFJ, the RBOCs are generally prohibited from providing services that originate in one LATA and terminate in another.

LATA boundaries tend to be drawn around markets, and not necessarily along existing [[U.S. state|state]] or [[Telephone numbering plan#Area code|area code]] borders. Some LATAs cross over state boundaries, such as those for the [[New York metropolitan area]] and [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]; [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; and areas between [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]]. Area codes and LATAs do not necessarily share boundaries; many LATAs exist in multiple area codes, and many area codes exist in multiple LATAs.

Originally, the LATAs were grouped into regions within which one particular RBOC was allowed to provide services. The LATAs in each of these regions are numbered beginning with the same digit. Generally, the LATAs were associated with [[telephone carrier|carrier]]s or other indications in the following manner:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Digit||Area/Use||[[RBOC]]
|-
|0xx||unused||
|-
|1xx||[[New York (state)|New York]] &amp; [[New England]]||[[NYNEX]] (now [[Verizon]] and [[FairPoint]])
|-
|2xx||[[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]]||[[Bell Atlantic]] (now Verizon and [[Frontier West Virginia|Frontier]])
|-
|3xx||[[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes]]||[[Ameritech]] (now [[AT&amp;T Inc.]])
|-
|4xx||[[American Southeast|Southeast]]||[[BellSouth]] (now AT&amp;T Inc.)
|-
|5xx||[[American South Central States|South-central]]||[[Southwestern Bell]] (now AT&amp;T Inc.)
|-
|6xx||[[Pacific Northwest]], [[Midwest]], and [[Rocky Mountains]]||[[US West]] (now [[CenturyLink]])
|-
|7xx||[[California]] and [[Nevada]]||[[Pacific Bell]] (now AT&amp;T Inc.)
|-
|8xx||Non-contiguous and international areas||
|-
|9xx||Other/Expansion||
|}

In addition to this list, two local carriers were made independent: [[Cincinnati Bell]] in the [[Cincinnati]] area, and [[Southern New England Telephone|SNET]] (a former unit of AT&amp;T, sold to [[Frontier Communications|Frontier]]) in [[Connecticut]]. These were assigned LATAs in the 9xx range.

Since the [[Modification of Final Judgment|breakup of the original AT&amp;T]] in 1984, however, some amount of [[deregulation]], as well as a number of phone company [[merger]]s, have blurred the significance of these regions. A number of new LATAs have been formed within these regions since their inception, most beginning with the digit 9.

LATAs contribute to an often confusing aspect of [[long distance calling|long distance]] telephone service. Due to the various and overlapping regulatory limitations and inter-business arrangements, phone companies typically provide differing types of “long distance” service, each with potentially different rates:
* within same LATA, within same state
* within same LATA, between different states
* between different LATAs, within same state
* between different LATAs, between different states
Given the complexity of the legal and financial issues involved in each distinction, many long distance companies tend to not explain the details of these different rates, which can lead to billing questions from surprised customers.

Local carriers have various alternative terms for LATAs such as “Service Area” by Pacific Bell in California, or “Regional Calling Area” by Verizon in Maryland.

In order to facilitate the sharing of [[Telcordia]] telephone routing databases between countries, LATAs were later defined for the provinces of [[Canada]], the other countries and territories of the [[North American Numbering Plan]], and [[Mexico]]. Aside from U.S. territories, LATAs have no regulatory purpose in these areas. In 2000, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] eliminated all Canadian provincial LATAs in favor of a single LATA for Canada (888).

No LATAs exist with a second digit of 0 or 1, which distinguished them from traditional [[Numbering plan area|area codes]].

==List of LATAs==

===US state LATAs===
The city or place name given with some LATAs is the name given to identify the LATA, not the limit of its boundary. Generally this is the most significant metropolitan area in the LATA. In some cases, a LATA is named after the largest phone exchange in the LATA that was historically served by an RBOC. For example, the largest city in the Pahrump LATA in Nevada is [[Las Vegas]]. Since Las Vegas was not historically served by an RBOC, the LATA is named after the smaller town of Pahrump, which was historically served by Nevada Bell (now AT&amp;T Inc.). Also, listing under a state does not necessarily limit the LATA's territory to that state; there may be overlaps as well as [[enclave]]s. Areas that include notable portions of other states are explained, but not all LATA state overlaps may be detailed.

LATA boundaries are not always solidly defined. Inter-carrier agreements, change proposals to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), and new wiring developments into rural areas can and do often alter the effective borders between LATAs. Many sources on LATA boundary information conflict with each other at detailed levels. [[Telcordia]] data may provide the most up-to-date details of LATA inclusions.

===U.S. territory LATAs===

*[[American Samoa]] - 884&lt;ref&gt;American Samoa entered the [[North American Numbering Plan|NANP]] in October 2004 and presumably was allocated a LATA by that time. Telcordia LERG data suggests that American Samoa uses LATA 884.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Guam]] - 871
*[[Northern Mariana Islands]] - 870
*[[Puerto Rico]] - 820
*[[U.S. Virgin Islands]] - 822
*[[Wake Island]] - 836

===Non-U.S. LATAs (non-regulatory)===

*[[Mexico]] - 838
*[[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] - 824
*[[Jamaica]] - 826
*[[Dominican Republic]] - 828
*Other [[Caribbean]] - 830
*[[Canada]] - 888

== Canada ==
As LATAs exist for US regulatory purposes, where they serve as a demarcation between intra-LATA calls (handled by regional Bell operating companies) and inter-LATA calls (handled by interstate long distance carriers such as AT&amp;T), they have no legal significance in [[Canada]].

As of 2000, all of Canada (except for non-geographic numbers) is identified as LATA 888.

The use of this LATA set to identify individual provinces is therefore deprecated:
*[[Alberta]] - 881, 884
*[[British Columbia]] - 886
*[[Manitoba]] - 888
*[[New Brunswick]] - 890
*[[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] - 885
*[[Nova Scotia]]/[[Prince Edward Island|P.E.I.]] -  887, 889
*[[Ontario]] - 851
*[[Quebec]] - 850, 883
*[[Saskatchewan]] - 891
*[[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] - 892

===Local interconnection region===
Canada does define '''local interconnection regions''' (LIR's), which determine where points of interconnection (POI) must be provided by [[Competitive local exchange carrier|competing local exchange]] and mobile carriers to provide [[local number portability]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/dt2007-23.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian LIR is geographically smaller than a US LATA, typically comparable in size to a small city's flat-rate local calling area or to an entire large [[regional municipality]]. In areas where a small-city [[Digital Multiplex System]] controls a group of [[remote switching centre]]s, one for each surrounding village, the local interconnect region normally includes each exchange in the city plus all downstream remotes of those exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_listlir.php List of Canadian LIRs] on localcallingguide.com&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Toronto]]-sized city, the LIR will include only the city itself.

While the LIRs resemble local calling areas in geographic size, there are some key differences:
* LIR's normally do not include incumbent local [[independent telephone company]] exchanges in locations not opened to competition, where the independent numbers are currently not portable.
* LIR's do not cross provincial boundaries. [[Lloydminster]] has an LIR for each province, as does [[Ottawa]]-[[Hull, Quebec|Hull]].
* LIR's closely follow network topology, which often does not match a local flat-rate calling area as local calling is defined by arbitrary regulatory constructs.

One example: The tiny unincorporated village of [[Beebe Plain]], divided by the [[Quebec]]-[[Vermont]] border, is served by +1-819-876 [[Rock Island, Quebec]], Canada (a remote station controlled from [[Magog, Quebec|Magog]]) and +1-802-873 [[Derby Line, Vermont]], USA (a remote station controlled from [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St. Johnsbury]]). Magog and St. Johnsbury are both a long-distance call from anywhere in Beebe Plain, even though Canadian subscribers can place local calls to [[Sherbrooke]], US subscribers can locally call [[Newport (city), Vermont|Newport]] and an international call within the village is local. An LIR assignment which follows network topology places the Canadian remote station in Magog's LIR, not Sherbrooke's LIR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_exch.php?exch=172360 Rock Island QC] on localcallingguide.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lydia White''' is a linguist and educator in the area of [[second language acquisition]] (SLA).  She is [[James McGill]] Professor of [[Linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/ap-planningbudgets/mcgilldawson/ James McGill / William Dawson Programme]. McGill University. Retrieved on April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://webpages.mcgill.ca/staff/group2/lwhite/web/ Faculty Page]. McGill University. Retrieved on March 28, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; She received her BA in Moral Sciences and Psychology from [[Cambridge University]] in 1969 and PhD in [[linguistics]] from [[McGill University]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; She currently serves on the editorial boards of the journals ''Language Acquisition'', ''Linguistic Approaches to Bilingualism'', and ''[[Second Language Research]]''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Together with [[Roumyana Slabakova]], she is also co-editor of the book series ''Language Acquisition and Language Disorders''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slabakova|first1=Roumyana|last2=Montrul|first2=Silvina|last3=Prévost|first3=Philippe|title=Inquiries in Linguistic Development: In Honor of Lydia White|date=2006|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her PhD dissertation, published in book form as ''Grammatical Theory and Language Acquisition'', concerns [[poverty of the stimulus|the theoretical problem of first language acquisition]] from the perspective of [[generative grammar]]. Her 1989 survey of SLA research, ''Universal Grammar and Second Language Acquisition'', has become a standard textbook in many university level SLA courses.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The book puts particular emphasis on research which explores the implications that the theory of linguistic universals (the [[Universal Grammar]] theory) has had upon second language acquisition approaches. In 2003, Lydia White published the book ''Second Language Acquisition and Universal Grammar'', which extends the claims that the process of second language acquisition is guided and constrained by [[Universal Grammar]].

*"Grammatical Theory and Language Acquisition", 1982, Dordrecht: Foris
*"Universal Grammar and Second Language Acquisition", 1989, Amsterdam: John Benjamins
*"Second Language Acquisition and Universal Grammar", 2003, New York: Cambridge University Press

==Articles==
Lydia White has edited special issues of several leading journals in the field, and authored many articles in ''Language Learning'', ''Studies in Second Language Acquisition'', ''[[Second Language Research]]'', and ''Language Acquisition''. Some notable examples include the following:

'''Marcela Delpastre''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁsəla dɛlpatʁ}}; {{lang-oc|Marcèla Delpastre}} {{IPA-oc|maɾˈsɛlɔ delˈpatɾe|}}) was an [[Occitan]]- and [[French language|French]]-language author from [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]. She was born on September 2, 1925 and died on February 6, 1998. She is known in non-Occitan-speaking [[France]] as '''Marcelle Delpastre'''.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Marcela Delpastre was born on February 2, 1925 in Germont, near the ''[[Communes of France|commune]]'' of [[Chamberet]] in the ''[[département]]'' of [[Corrèze]]. The daughter, granddaughter and great-granddaughter of local farmers, she grew up in the heart of Limousin’s countryside civilization. At home, she would hear and learn two languages: Occitan and French. She went to primary school in Surdoux and Saint-Léonard in [[Haute-Vienne]] and then to secondary school in [[Brive]] where she took a ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in philosophy and literature. She later entered the college of decorative arts of [[Limoges]] where she developed a strong liking for human shapes (faces and feminine curves) and beauty in general.

In 1945, she returned to the family farm in Germont where she spent the rest of her life working the land, something she did "because one has to earn their daily bread". In the meantime, whether milking the cows or driving a tractor, she’d still think of apt rhymes for the poems she wrote. Poetry accompanied her all day long and she’d always carry a wee jotter and a pen in her pocket. When inspiration came, when the words were there, fine and ready, Marcela took a break and immediately put them down on paper. Indeed, most of her masterpieces probably sprang from a bundle of straw in a stable or in the middle of a field.

From the end of the 1940s to the early years of the following decade, as the exercise books in which she wrote her poems and thoughts were beginning to heap up, Marcela Delpastre sent some of her works to literary journals and arts reviews. She was greatly encouraged by the correspondence she engaged in. As her texts got published, Marcela grew increasingly famous among the well-read people of Limousin.

===Local literary recognition===
In the 1960s, Marcela Delpastre was the helpless witness of the death of her native village of Germont and the painful decline of the millennial farming civilization of Limousin. The tractors replaced the oxen, the machines did the hands and television the evening gatherings... With all of her heart, Marcela now immersed herself into the tales, the legends and the traditions of her home [[Occitania|''país'']] and met with Robert Joudoux, from the ''Lemouzi'' magazine, and Jean Mouzat, another Occitan author.

Marcela Delpastre’s first work in [[Occitan|lenga d’òc]] was called ''La Lenga que tant me platz'' (''The Language I Love So''):
:"''E si m’aproisme a la senta taula, voldriá 'na òstia de pan de blat — per comuniar tot per lo còp emb lo bon Dieu e emb la terra — ensemble belament 'semblats, coma l’alen a la saba daus blats, — dins la lenga que tant me platz.''"
:"And should I get near the holy table, I’d ask for a host of wheat bread — to receive communion both from [[God|Our Lord]] and the earth — the two of them so beautifully alike, as the wind is the sap of corn, — in the language I love so."
From then on, Marcela decided to write in [[Occitan|Limousin]], both the tongue and the place, and about Limousin. In the aforementioned magazine were subsequently published a couple of poems, among which ''Lo Rossinhòl e l’eglantina'' (''The Nightingale &amp; the Wild Rose'') and ''Lo Chamin de tèrra'' (''The Dirt Track''). For an easier writing, she also learned the normalized Occitan spelling.

In the mid-1960s, Marcela began collecting and re-inventing traditional tales from her native Limousin. The first book was published in 1970 and its title was: ''Los Contes dau Pueg Gerjant'' (''The Tales of Mount Gerjant''). At the same time, she did the work of an [[ethnology|ethnologist]] and wrote, in French, ''Le Tombeau des ancêtres'' (''The Tomb of Our Ancestors'') about the customs and beliefs surrounding local religious festivals and cults. In 1968, ''La Vinha dins l’òrt'' (''The Vine in the Garden'') was released: this poem won an award at the Jaufre Rudel competition. Its French version, ''La Vigne dans le jardin'' was adapted for the stage by the Radio-Limoges drama company. They adapted more texts by Marcela Delpastre later in the decade, among which featured ''L’Homme éclaté'' (''The Exploded Man'') and ''La Marche à l’étoile'' (''Walking to the Star''). Marcela kept on writing and published other poems in several reviews, such as ''Lemouzi'', ''Traces'', ''Poésie 1'', ''Vent Terral'' and ''Òc''.

===Occitania-wide acclaim===
In 1974, ''Saumes pagans'' (''Pagan Psalms'') appeared in the collection called ''Messatges de l’[[Institut d'Estudis Occitans|IEO]]''. It’s with these poems that Marcela Delpastre truly gained recognition from the whole Occitan literary world. In ''Le Bourgeois et le paysan'' (''The Bourgeois &amp; the Farmer'') she went another step farther in portraying the customs, beliefs and oral tradition of Limousin, this time around the theme of fire. Later, in her ''Bestiari lemosin'' (''The Limousin Bestiary''), she focused on wild animals and cattle and mixed reality with [[mythology]]. By the end of the 1970s Marcela also met two very important men for her career: one is Micheu Chapduelh and the other is [[Jan dau Melhau]]. She regularly featured in their review, ''Lo Leberaubre'', and grew popular beyond the circle of her readers by giving her opinion in articles and interviews in the local Limousin press (''Limousin Magazine'', ''La Montagne'', ''L’Écho'', ''Le Populaire''...), but most of all, among Occitan activists thanks to magazines like ''Òc, Occitans'' and especially ''Connaissance des Pays d’Òc'', with [[Ives Roqueta]]’s help.

In the last years of her life, Marcela Delpastre (and her friend Jan dau Melhau) spent her time dusting off hundreds of unpublished texts. Suffering from [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Charcot disease]], she died in her bed on February 6, 1998 in her Germont farm, where she was born, where she’d always stayed and worked. Jan dau Melhau, her sole legatee, has since released more of her writings for the Lo Chamin de Sent-Jaume publishing house. The poet’s works are kept at Limoges’s City Library.

A poet, a story-teller, an author and an ethnologist, Marcela Delpastre is now considered one of the ten most important writers of the 20th century, alongside the likes of [[Joan Bodon]], [[Bernat Manciet]], [[Renat Nelli]] and [[Max Roqueta]]. The message of this woman, who never left her home land of Limousin, is one of universal significance, one that addresses everybody, and this is probably what makes her words so strong and beautiful.

Lo paubre auseu, lo chen, la femna —&lt;br&gt;
E tu qui parlas tant, onte aniràs? &lt;br&gt;
Mas se'n van pas! &lt;br&gt;
Demoran qui, que bujan pas, remuedan pas, ni pè ni sòla. &lt;br&gt;

Lo temps qu'a pas besonh de ilhs —&lt;br&gt;

Me desvelhe. &lt;br&gt;
Es be jorn. &lt;br&gt;
Coma un qui se desvelha &lt;br&gt;
E qui la nuech n’a pas barrat sos uelhs,&lt;br&gt;
Ai be trauchat l’ivern sens veire nuech ni nèvia &lt;br&gt;
E sens sentir lo vent.&lt;br&gt;
Me desvelhe. &lt;br&gt;
Veiquí. &lt;br&gt;
De flors mai de fuelhas se’s perfumada l’auba, &lt;br&gt;
E la prima chanta lo vent.&lt;br&gt;
M’a fach durmir ni nuech ni nèvia, &lt;br&gt;
E lo mes mòrt me ten lo sang:&lt;br&gt;
Que me son las fuelhas mai las flors! &lt;br&gt;
E lo vent de prima ni lo solelh de l’auba.&lt;br&gt;
Las peiras daus chamins que lo giau las trabalha, &lt;br&gt;
E la terra daus puegs,&lt;br&gt;
Sentan dins las priondors lo levam de la grana &lt;br&gt;
E las dents de las raiç.&lt;br&gt;
Mas ieu, que me desvelha? &lt;br&gt;
E sabe-ieu qu’es jorn! &lt;br&gt;
E sabe-ieu si l’auba raia, e que me vòl l’amor!&lt;br&gt;
♦ ''La Prima'' [http://ujan.free.fr/poelim/prim.htm]
|||
There is nothing I lack, nothing. &lt;br&gt;
The time to be born, to die, the time to turn around. The time for nothing. &lt;br&gt;
To be that heat. That blood. That breathing. &lt;br&gt;
The time to be myself — Nothing. &lt;br&gt;
The breath of being. &lt;br&gt;
♦ ''The Garden Under the Moon''

Where do they go, those who leave? &lt;br&gt;
The poor bird, the dog, the woman — &lt;br&gt;
And you who speaks so much, where will you go? &lt;br&gt;
They're not leaving at all! &lt;br&gt;
They remain here, not moving, not stirring, neither foot nor sole. &lt;br&gt;
And the time that elapses —&lt;br&gt;
The time that doesn't need them —&lt;br&gt;
The time that doesn't wait —&lt;br&gt;
The time that leaves from here to the morrow and then never comes back. &lt;br&gt;
And you too will walk in there, along the quiet path.&lt;br&gt;
And you sure will walk in there, in the deep silence of eternal eternity.&lt;br&gt;
♦ ''Along the Path''

I'm waking up.&lt;br&gt;
It's well into the day.&lt;br&gt;
Like one who's waking up&lt;br&gt;
And whose eyes the night hasn't shut,&lt;br&gt;
I've been living through the winter without seeing night nor snow,&lt;br&gt;
Without feeling the wind.&lt;br&gt;
I'm waking up.&lt;br&gt;
That's it.&lt;br&gt;
With flowers and leaves the morning has perfumed itself,&lt;br&gt;
And springtime sings of the wind.&lt;br&gt;
Neither night nor snow have made me sleep,&lt;br&gt;
And the dead month is freezing my blood:&lt;br&gt;
What are flowers and leaves to me!&lt;br&gt;
Or the springtime wind or even the morning sun.&lt;br&gt;
The pebbles on the path that frost is working on,&lt;br&gt;
And the earth of the hills,&lt;br&gt;
Feel deep inside the leaven of the seed&lt;br&gt;
And the teeth of the roots.&lt;br&gt;
But me, what is waking me?&lt;br&gt;
Do I even know it's day yet!&lt;br&gt;
Do I even know if the morning's shining, and what loves wants from me!&lt;br&gt;

'''Mpadə''' is an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language spoken in northern [[Cameroon]] and southwestern [[Chad]].  Dialects are Bodo, Digam, Mpade (Makari), Shoe (Shewe), and Woulki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Frawley, William J.|year=2003|chapter=Mpade|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, Volume 1|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC&amp;pg=PA238 238]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is sometimes known as Makari, after one of the towns where it is spoken.  Ngala further west (as described by Barth) once spoke a dialect similar to Makari, but it was moribund by the 1920s, the people having shifted to Kanuri.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4390">'''Neutron embrittlement''', sometimes more broadly '''radiation embrittlement''', is the [[embrittlement]] of various materials due to the action of [[neutron]]s. This is primarily seen in [[nuclear reactor]]s, where the release of high-energy neutrons causes the long-term degradation of the reactor materials. The embrittlement is caused by the microscopic movement of [[atoms]] that are hit by the neutrons, this same action also gives rise to [[neutron-induced swelling]] causes materials to grow in size, and the [[Wigner effect]] causes energy buildup in certain materials that can lead to sudden releases of [[energy]].

Neutron embrittlement mechanisms include:
* [[Hardening (metallurgy)|Hardening]] and [[Pinning points|dislocation pinning]] due to nanometer features created by irradiation
* Generation of lattice defects in [[Collision cascade|collision cascades]] via the high-energy recoil atoms produced in the process of [[neutron scattering]].
* Diffusion of major defects, which leads to higher amounts of solute diffusion, as well as formation of nanoscale defect-solute cluster complexes, solute clusters, and distinct phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0107/odette-0107.html|title=Embrittlement of Nuclear Reactor Pressure Vessels|website=www.tms.org|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embrittlement in Nuclear Reactors ==
Neutron irradiation embrittlement limits the service life of [[Reactor pressure vessel|reactor-pressure vessels]] (RPV) in nuclear power plants due to the degradation of reactor materials. In order to perform at high efficiency and safely contain coolant water at temperatures around 290ºC and pressures of ~7 MPa (for [[Boiling water reactor|boiling water reactors]]) to 14 MPa (for [[Pressurized water reactor|pressurized water reactors]]), the RPV must be heavy-section steel. Due to regulations, RPV failure probabilities must be very low. To achieve sufficient safety, the design of the reactor assumes large cracks and extreme loading conditions. Under such conditions, a probable [[Failure cause|failure mode]] is rapid, catastrophic [[Fracture mechanics|fracture]] if the vessel steel is brittle. Tough RPV base metals that are typically used are A302B, A533B plates, or A508 forgings; these are quenched and tempered, low-alloy steels with primarily tempered bainitic microstructures. Over the past few decades, RPV embrittlement has been addressed by the use of tougher steels with lower trace impurity contents, the decrease of neutron flux that the vessel is subject to, and the elimination of beltline welds. However, embrittlement remains an issue for older reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Odette|first=G. R.|last2=Lucas|first2=G. E.|date=2001-07-01|title=Embrittlement of nuclear reactor pressure vessels|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-001-0081-0|journal=JOM|language=en|volume=53|issue=7|pages=18–22|doi=10.1007/s11837-001-0081-0|issn=1047-4838|bibcode=2001JOM....53g..18O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressurized water reactors are more susceptible to embrittlement than boiling water reactors. This is due to PWRs sustaining more neutron impacts. To counteract this, many PWRs have a specific [[Nuclear reactor core|core]] design that reduces the number of neutrons hitting the vessel wall. Moreover, PWR designs must be especially mindful of embrittlement because of pressurized thermal shock, an accident scenario that occurs when cold water enters a pressurized reactor vessel, introducing large [[thermal stress]]. This thermal stress may cause fracture if the reactor vessel is sufficiently brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/prv.html|title=Backgrounder on Reactor Pressure Vessel Issues|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2016|website=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life, literary and broadcasting career==

Born Abraham Olatubosun Oladapo, he attended Phillip's Primary School in Araromi Owu in 1950, then went to St James’ Olanla in [[Akinyele]], [[Ibadan]] (1951–54), and the [[University of Lagos]].&lt;ref name=nation&gt;Taiwo Abiodun, [http://thenationonlineng.net/sycophants-are-taking-the-shine-off-ewi-poetry/ "‘Sycophants are taking the shine off Ewi poetry’"], ''The Nation'', 26 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

He underwent training at St. Luke’s Teachers’ Training College, Ibadan, where he first started performing poetry with a presentation at the school in the 1965 festival of arts where he chanted ''Ijala'', Yoruba oral poetry.&lt;ref name=DawnCommission&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dawncommission.org/index.php/akinkanjuDetail.php?id=12 |title=Abraham Olatubosun Oladapo |date=25 February 2016 | website = Dawn Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed that in 1967 and was posted to St. David's School, Kudeti, Ibadan. He has said: "It was at St Luke’s that my talent in drama was discovered, and it was on account of this that I was sent to the University of Lagos to study for a diploma in Yoruba Studies free of charge. I came out with a distinction in that programme."&lt;ref name=nation /&gt;

In 1969 he joined "The Sketch newspaper", ''GbounGboun'', a Yoruba newspaper, where he worked for a year before moving in 1970 to Western Nigeria Television (WNTV), Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service (WNBS). There he met the likes of [[Adebayo Faleti]], who impacted on him greatly and Prince Adebayo Sanda, the presenter of ''Kaaro Ooojiire'' and ''Tiwa N’tiwa''. Oladapo resigned in 1977 to found a [[record company]], Olatubosun Records, to seek out, promote and produce indigenous-language artists and folk poets across the Yorùbá country.&lt;ref name=DawnCommission /&gt;

He has produced more than 51 different albums and produced 200 artistes’ records on the label, including the late Ojogbon Ogundare Foyanmu from Ogbomoso, Odolaye Aremu from Kwara, Ayanyemi Atoko wa gbowo nile, the talking-drum specialist; Alabi Ogundepo, and [[Duro Ladipo]] International Theatre, among others.&lt;ref name=DawnCommission /&gt; His personal Yoruba poetry (ewi) albums typically feature Yoruba poetry recited over an orchestra of folk music. Oladapo's back-up choir once included the famous "K-12 Voices" led by the now-deceased Diipo Sodiipo.

==Writing==

Oladapo has released about 29 different books, some of which are used as recommended text across primary and secondary schools and Universities in Nigeria and abroad.&lt;ref name=DawnCommission /&gt;

He is the author of print collections of poetry, ''Aroye Akewi'' (1 and 2) and ''Arofo Awon Omode''. His plays ''Ogun Lakaaye'' and ''Egbade Falade'' were joint prize winners of the [[Oxford University Press]] drama competition in 1970.

==Traditional titles==

He is a traditional chief in the city of Ibadan (in [[Oyo State]]) and Ire-Ekiti (in [[Ekiti State]]), Nigeria.

== Personal life ==
He is father to a number of children, including writer/linguist [[Kola Tubosun]], and writer/accountant [[Yemi Adesanya]].

'''Ramanlal Vasantlal Desai''' (12 May 1892 - 20 September 1954) was a Gujarati writer from India. He is considered as an important figure of the [[Gujarati literature]] as well as Gujarati novel writing. He wrote 27 novels, among which, ''Bharelo Agni'' and ''Gramalakshmi'' is considered to be his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]. His other notable and massive work is ''Apsara'', a essays divided in five volume which is based on the life of prostitutes. He was awarded [[Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak]] in 1932.

== Life ==
Desai was born on 12 May 1892 in [[Sinor]], a village located on the bank of [[Narmada River|Narmada]] river to Vasantlal and Manibai. His family was a native of [[Kalol (Panchmahal)|Kalol]] of [[Panchmahal district]]. His father Vasantlal was [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] in nature while his mother Manibai was [[Vaishnavism|vaishanva]] and religious. Vasantlal run a Gujarati magazine, ''Deshbhakta''&lt;ref name="Kachot2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Sanjay Kachot|title=19 Mi Sadinu Gujarati Patrakaratva Pravaho ane Prabhav|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mkwjDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38|accessdate=18 September 2017|date=14 May 2014|publisher=RED'SHINE Publication. Inc|language=gu|isbn=978-93-84190-11-8|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lit. The Patriot). Beside the printing house of his father Vasantlal, there was a book shop which provided him books for reading during his school life. Desai studied until sixth standard at his uncle's home in Shinor and then moved to [[Vadodara]] in 1902 and was admitted in the Branch School. He was engaged with Kailasvati at age of eight and they married in 1912.&lt;ref name=mehta&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehta|first=Dipak|title=Ramanlal V. Desai|series=ગુજરાતી ગ્રંથકાર શ્રેણી [Gujarati Men of Letters Series]|editor-last=Joshi|editor-first=Ramanlal|editor-link=Ramanlal Joshi|date=1980|publisher=Kumkum Publication|location=Ahmedabad |pages=10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He matriculated in 1908 and shifted to Vadodara college where he failed in Mathematics both in the first year and inter year exams. He used to discuss with friends about topics like Socialism, Communism and marriage and delivered lectures on these topics. His poem ''Shu Karu?'' (Lit. What should I do?) was published in a college magazine and later published in his poetry collection ''Niharika''. He passed B.A. in 1914 with the first rank and selected as a fellow. He wrote a play entitled ''Samyukta'' which was staged at [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] held at [[Surat]] in 1915. He completed Master of Arts in 1916 with English and Gujarati literature. He could not get second rank and thus he could not fulfill his dream to be a professor.

A '''recursive transition network''' ("RTN") is a [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] [[schematic]] used to represent the rules of a [[context-free grammar]]. RTNs have application to [[programming language]]s, [[natural language]] and [[lexical analysis]]. Any [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] that is constructed according to the rules of an RTN&lt;ref&gt;A sentence is generated by a RTN by applying the generative rules specified in the RTN itself. These represent any set of rules or a function consisting of a finite number of steps.&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be "well-formed". The structural elements of a well-formed sentence may also be well-formed sentences by themselves, or they may be simpler structures. This is why RTNs are described as [[Recursion|recursive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3033">{{Other uses|Screen memory (disambiguation)}}
A '''screen memory''' is a distorted memory, generally of a visual rather than verbal nature,&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ‘’Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis’’ (PFL 1) p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; deriving from childhood. The term was coined by [[Sigmund Freud]], and the concept was the subject of his 1899 paper, ''Screen Memories''.

==Childhood origins==
Freud was struck by the presence, in himself and in other adults, of vivid but bland memories standing from early childhood; and he came to believe that their strength and their preservation both derived from their association with other, less innocent infantile occurrences.  As he concluded in his 1899 paper, “The falsified memory is the first that we become aware of….the essential elements of an experience are represented in memory by the inessential elements of the same experience”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in A Phillips, ‘’On Flirtation’’ (London 1994) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Later writers have emphasised the element of [[psychological trauma]] underpinning the screen memory, as well as the way it can encapsulate in miniature the [[Core Conflictual Relationship Theme|core conflicts]] of childhood.&lt;ref&gt;G S Reed ed., ‘’On Freud’s ‘Screen Memories’ ‘’ (2014) p. 47 and p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denial and memory construction==
The construction of the screen memory turns on the balance between memory and [[denial]].  The blocking of an unpleasant event, thought or perception is facilitated if some harmless, but associated object can be substituted for the unpleasantness itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ‘’The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis’’ (London 1945) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The ego searches for memories that can serve as “screens” for the unpleasantness behind, which is thereby removed from consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ‘’The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis’’ (London 1945) p. 529&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related applications==

*Freud considered [[sexual fetishism]] as cognate to screen memories, the fetish serving as a screen for infantile sexual strivings.&lt;ref&gt;S Freud, ‘’On Sexuality’’ (PFL 7) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
*Screen memories may also serve as a source for artistic creation – a process that has been followed for example with respect to [[Lewis Carroll]].&lt;ref&gt;G S Reed ed., ‘’On Freud’s ‘Screen Memories’ ‘’ (2014) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35067">'''Second-language attrition''' is the decline of [[second-language]] skills, which occurs whenever the learner uses the second language to an insufficient degree ([[Kees de Bot|de Bot]] &amp; Weltens 1991:43) or due to environmental changes the language use is limited and another [[language]] is becoming the dominant one (Olshtain 1989: 151).

== Definition ==

A German researcher, Schöpper-Grabe, once expressed that, "Almost everybody who has learned a [[foreign language]] shares the experience of forgetting the acquired language skills once the period of formal instruction is over" (Schöpper-Grabe 1998: 231). This relates to how second-language attrition can be defined as the "non-pathological decrease in a language that had formerly been acquired by an individual" (Köpke &amp; Schmid 2004: 5) and described as the "[…] loss of skills in the individual over time" (de Bot &amp; Weltens, 1995).

Beginning in the 1970s until today, a new and especially young field in the area of [[second-language acquisition]] was developed. It is connected cross-sectionally throughout different research areas. [[Language attrition]], in general, is concerned with what is lost (linguistic focus), how it is lost ([[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic]] and [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] focus) and why it is lost ([[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]], [[Sociology|sociologistic]] and [[Anthropology|anthropologistic]] focus) (Hansen 1999). Over 25 years research has been concentrated on studying the attrition of second languages. First studies, dealing with the topic of [[language loss]] or language attrition, were published in the late 1970s (de Bot &amp; Weltens 1989: 127). In 1980, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] hosted the conference "The Loss of Language Skills", and language attrition was recognized as a field in the research of second-language acquisition. Since then, various [[scientific research]] papers – mainly within America – have been published. Later, several studies in [[Europe]] – especially the [[Netherlands]] – followed. In other countries, however, language attrition research was paid hardly any attention (de Bot &amp; Weltens 1995). Compared to the field of second-language acquisition, language attrition is still relatively young; so much is still unknown.

=== Purpose and development ===

The purpose of language attrition, in general, is to discover how, why and what is lost when a language is forgotten. The aim in foreign or second-language attrition research is to find out why, after an active [[learning process]], the language competence changes or even stops (Gleason 1982). Further, results from research in this area could, as Van Els and Weltens (1989) counter, contribute to the understanding of relations between acquisition and attrition (van Els 1989). L2/FL attrition research is particularly important because it provides results for foreign language instruction. [[Kees de Bot|De Bot]] and Weltens state, "[r]esearch on language attrition can also have a considerable impact on [[curriculum]] planning or foreign language teaching" (1995: 152). The theoretical grounding of the language attrition research derives primarily from [[cognitive]] and [[Psychology|psychological]] theories. Research in the area of language attrition concentrates generally on the loss of the L1 and L2. The first distinction that can be made is between pathological and natural language attrition. The former concentrates on language loss caused by a [[Brain damage|damage of the brain]], [[injury]], age or [[illness]]. However, this topic will not be investigated any further, because the language attrition in these cases is not caused by natural circumstances. Weltens (1987: 24) states another possible distinction, inter and intra generational language attrition. Inter generational language attrition is concerned with attrition within individuals, whereas intra generational language attrition concentrates on the attrition across different generations. Van Els (1986) distinguishes types of attrition in terms of which language is lost and in which environment it is being lost. Therefore, he classifies:
# loss of L1 in L1 environment, e.g. dialect loss
# loss of L1 in L2 environment, e.g. immigrants losing their [[mother tongue]]
# loss of L2/FL in L1 environment, e.g. loss of foreign languages learned at school
# loss of L2/FL in L2 environment, e.g. aging migrants losing their L2.

== Relationship between the first and second languages in the mind ==

It is not exactly known how different languages are stored in the mind. A researcher, [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]], proposes that the languages are separated into distinct compartments. This is termed the separation model. An L2 speaker will speak one of the languages, but no connection is made between them in the mind (Cook 2003: 7). Another proposed model is the integration model, which suggests that rather than having two separate mental lexicons, an L2 speaker has one lexicon where words from one language are stored from one language alongside words from the other. Regarding phonology, it has been found that L2 speakers sometimes have one merged system for producing speech, not distinguished by L1 or L2. The integration model focuses on how there is a balance between the unique elements of both languages, and how they form one system. Though these two proposed models offering different perspectives, it is impossible to have total separation because both languages exist in the same mind. Total integration is impossible because we are able to keep the languages apart in our minds (Cook 2003: 7). Another proposed model is the link language model. This model illustrates the idea that two languages within the same mind are able to influence and interact with one another. Further, the partial integration model illustrates the idea of partial overlapping between two languages in one mind. It doesn't differentiate between the languages in the overlap, but it shows how it functions as a single, conjoined system. These systems illustrate the point that vocabulary, syntax, and other aspects of language knowledge can be shared or overlapped between different languages within one mind (Cook 2003: 8). Finally, all of the models function together to create the integration continuum, an illustration that shows the possible relationships in "multi-competence" (Cook 2003: 9).


===Effects on the L1===

The L1 can be enhanced by the use of an L2 - Cook mentions that "extensive research into bilingual development shows overall that L2 user children have more precocious metalinguistic skills than their monolingual pairs" (Cook 2003: 13).

The L1 can be harmed by the use of an L2 - He also mentions brings up the risk of L1 language attrition from the L2. When one language is less and less used, certain abilities are lost from inactivity.

The L1 is different from the L2, without being better or worse - Oftentimes, the effects of the L2 on the L1 cause no difference in language knowledge or ability. Differences will undoubtedly exist in the first language element because of different linguistic organization. Different characteristics, like phonological properties,  show noticeable differences from a speaker transitioning from L1 to L2. For example, Cook brings up the possibility of differences in "the first language of L2 users for plosive consonants such as /p/ and /b/ or /k/ and /g/ across pairs of languages such as Spanish/English, French/English, and Hebrew/English, which are essentially undetectable in normal language use" (Cook 2003: 13).

===First language attrition===
Researchers, Levy, McVeigh, Marful, and Anderson studied the idea of a new acquired language inhibiting the first, native language. They discussed how "travelers immersed in a new language often experience a surprising phenomenon: Words in their native tongue grow more difficult to recall over time" (Levy 2007: 29). They suggest that the lapses in native-language words can possibly be attributed to "an adaptive role of inhibitory control in hastening second-language acquisition" (Levy 2007: 29). First-language attrition mostly affects the vocabulary is often worse during second-language immersion. During this time, the native-language is practiced infrequently. The attrition can be attributed to the disuse of the native language and functions of forgetting that occur in the mind. They bring up the idea that first-language attrition can be related to "retrieval-induced-forgetting." This is supported by how novice foreign-language speakers immediately access native-language vocabulary for things, although the foreign word is wanted. The aforementioned researchers conducted studies on retrieval-induced forgetting, and examined "whether inhibitory control mechanisms resolve interference from one's native language during foreign-language production" (Levy 2007: 30). The results of their experiments provided evidence for a role of inhibitions in first-language attrition. The experiment showed that "the more often novice Spanish speakers named objects in Spanish, the worse their later production of the corresponding English names became", "subjects who were least fluent with the Spanish vocabulary [they] test showed the largest phonological inhibition of English words", and showed that the inhibition effect was isolated to phonology (Levy 2007: 33).

== Theories of forgetting ==

To provide an answer as to how second-language attrition happens, it is necessary to have a glance at the findings of the research of [[memory]]. Since its establishment by Ebbinghaus in the late 19th century, the [[empirical research]] about learning still plays an important role in the modern research of memory.

=== Decay theory ===

[[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] contributed a lot to the research of the memory of the brain. He made the first [[empirical study]] concerning the function of the memory as to the storage and [[forgetting]] of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the [[decay theory]]. It says that if something new is learned, a ''[[memory trace]]'' is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).

=== Interference theory ===

The [[interference theory]] can be seen as one of the most important theories of forgetting. It indicates that prior, posterior or new learning information compete with already existing ones and therefore forgetting occurs. This [[Memory inhibition|inhibition]] can be divided into two types: the retroactive inhibition, where information acquired at a later point in time blocks the information that was acquired earlier. Proactive inhibition means that information acquired in the past can infer with new information. Hence, a blocking can occur that inhibits the acquiring of the new target item (Ecke 2004: 325).

=== Retrieval-failure hypothesis ===

Today, the retrieval-failure hypothesis, concerning the function of the memory, is more widely accepted and popularized (Schöpper-Grabe 1998:237). It says that the storage of information happens on different levels. Therefore, information or memory is not deleted, but rather, the access to the current level is blocked. Thus, the information is not available. Hansen quotes Loftus &amp; Loftus (1976) to describe forgetting: "[…] much like being unable to find something that we have misplaced somewhere" (1999: 10). Cohen states, evidence for knowing that a learner is not able to "find" something, is the use of the so-called progressive retrieval (1986). Thereby, the learner is unable to express something that is in his mind and consequently uses an incorrect form. He eventually remembers the correct one (Cohen 1986; Olshtain 1989). Time is considered the decisive factor to measure how far the attrition has proceeded already (de Bot &amp; Weltens, 1995).

== Hypotheses of language attrition ==

To have a better understanding of language attrition, it is necessary to examine the various hypotheses that attempt to explain how language memory changes over time.

=== Regression hypothesis ===

The regression hypothesis can be named as the first established theory in language loss. Its tradition goes far back, further than any other theory. The first researcher who designed it was [[Théodule-Armand Ribot|Ribot]] in 1880. Later, [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] took Ribot's idea up again and related it to [[aphasia]] (Weltens &amp; Schmid 2004: 211). In 1940, [[Roman Jakobson]] embedded it into a linguistic framework and claimed that language attrition is the mirror image of language acquisition (Weltens &amp; Cohen 1989: 130). Even though only a few studies have tested this [[hypothesis]], it is quite attractive to many researchers. As Weltens and Schmid (2004: 212) state, children acquire the language in stages. It was then suggested that language competence, in general, appears in different layers and therefore, attrition, as the mirror image of acquisition, will also happen from the top layer to the bottom.

=== Last-learned-first-forgotten hypothesis ===

According to the regression hypothesis, two similar approaches developed. Cohen started to conduct several studies on his own to determine "whether the last things learned are, in fact, the first things to be forgotten, and whether forgetting entails unlearning in reverse order from the original learning process" (Cohen 1975: 128). He observed the attrition of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as the second language, among school children during the [[summer vacation]]. Cohen's results supported the regression hypothesis and his last-learned-first-forgotten thesis. It supported the idea that some things, which are learned last, are the first to be forgotten when the learner has no input of the target language anymore.

=== Best-learned-last-forgotten hypothesis ===

Another variation of the regression hypothesis is the best learned-last-forgotten hypothesis, which emphasizes the intensity and quality of the acquired knowledge, not the order in which it is learned. Therefore, the better something is learned, the longer it will remain. Because the language component is repeated again and again, it becomes automated and increases the probability that it will last in the memory (Schöpper-Grabe 1998: 241).

=== Linguistic-feature hypothesis ===

The linguistic-feature hypothesis was introduced by Andersen (Andersen 1982). He claims that second languages or foreign languages that share more differences with the respective mother tongue than similarities are more endangered to be forgotten than those similar to the L1. Another point is the attrition of components, which are less "functional", "marked" or "frequent" compared to other elements (Weltens &amp; Cohen 1989: 130). This hypothesis is more differentiated and complex than the regression hypothesis because it considers aspects from first- and second-language acquisition research, [[language contact]] and aphasia research and the survey of [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creole]] languages (Müller 1995). By means of this hypothesis research, it tries to detect the aspects of language that are first to be forgotten.

== Process of language attrition ==

To define the process of language attrition, it is necessary to consider that there are different theories as to how the stages of language attrition occur.

=== Acquisition and incubation period ===

Gardner (1982: 519-520) believes that the process of second-language attrition is divided into three points in time:
# second language learning begins (time 1)
# language instruction terminates (time 2)
# assessment of language competence (time 3)
Between times 1 to 2 is termed the acquisition period. Between times 2 to 3 is termed the incubation period (1982: 520). Further, he states that it is not enough to consider only the time that has passed between 2 and 3 to make statements about attrition. It is also necessary to consider the duration, relative success, and nature of the acquisition period and the duration and content of the incubation phase (Gardner 1982: 520). The acquisition period is the time where language learning or language experience occurs, mainly from the first to the last lesson. During the incubation period, no language training or language usage occurs and the forgetting may begin. He says that now that language learning is not active anymore, a study about language attrition can be conducted (Gardner 1982a: 2).

=== The typical forgetting curve ===

The [[forgetting curve]] orientates itself on the typical forgetting curve by Ebbinghaus. He said that already after a very short amount of time, a forgetting process sets in immediately, stabilizes and then levels off. Bahrick conducted a study where he tested 773 persons with Spanish as their L2. His probates had varying acquisition and incubation periods, up to 50 years of non-active learning. He discovered a heavy attrition within the first 5 years, which then stabilized for the next 20 years (Weltens &amp; Cohen 1989: 130). According to Bahrick, the knowledge that remained after 5 years is stored in the permastore. Neisser (1984) uses a different term, he prefers [[critical threshold]], a level that has to be reached. Beyond that threshold, knowledge will resist decay. Contrary to these findings Weltens &amp; Cohen (1989: 130) are reporting from studies where different results were found. According to these findings, the forgetting curve begins with an initial plateau, a period where the language competence is not affected at all. This is then followed by the onset of attrition. Weltens explains these results: it is by the high proficiency of the probates ([[bilingual]]s and [[Language immersion|immersion]] students). However, it is still unknown whether the curve that follows this plateau is potentially exactly like the "normal" forgetting curve of language learners with a lower proficiency level (Weltens &amp; Cohen 1989: 130).

=== Relearning ===

Another phenomenon is [[relearning]]. Some studies show that, despite the end of learning and no language input, a residual learning can happen. Weltens (1989), who studied foreign language learners, identifies an increase in [[Reading comprehension|reading]] and [[listening comprehension]]. He says that it happens because a process of maturation happens. Schöpper-Grabe determines that contact and the intensity with the target language cannot be the only variable causing language attrition (Schöpper-Grabe 1998).

== Factors influencing second-language attrition ==

In literature several factors are named for explaining why language competence is decreasing. Many researchers, however, regard the level of [[Linguistic competence|competence]] of the learner as essential for attrition. It is said that the higher the level of competence, the less attrition will occur. Thus, a reference to the theory of the critical threshold can be drawn. Similar to this theory it is claimed, that according to conducted studies, the higher the level of competence of the learner at the end of the incubation period, the fewer will be lost. Therefore duration, success and intensity of the language instruction or language input in general is vitally important. Weltens (1987) divides the factors influencing language attrition into three categories: characteristics of the acquisition process (method of instruction, length of exposure, proficiency before attrition, relationship between L1 and the FL), characteristics of the attrition period ('post exposure' and length of the attrition period), and learner characteristics. The second category are [[social psychology|sociopsychological]] factors, as the attitude towards the target language and culture and aligned with the motivation for acquiring the language. Further, factors, which are settled in the language environment, should be considered as well, e.g. the status and prestige of the language are meaningful, too. Another frequent occurring factor is age. A variable that seems to be quite important, especially observing language attrition in children. Even though children are regarded as the better foreign language learner, their [[cognitive development]] is less progressed compared to adults. Further, usually they haven't learned to write or read in any language, and usually particularly not in the second language at all. Therefore their [[literacy]] skill in the L2 is very limited if not even there yet. Cohen (1989) conducted a study observing young children. He found out, that the attrition in an 8-year-old boy was stronger than the one in his 12-year-old sister. Tomiyama, suggested on the basis of her findings, that these children might not lose their knowledge of the L2 completely, moreover the access to such information is inaccessible and may vanish with time passing by. At the beginning of the 80s another, so far unnoticed factor, was introduced into the research field. Socioaffective factors as attitude, orientation and motivation are now accounted. On account of that, he established a socio-educational model of language acquisition. Thereby motivation and attitude influence the workload of the individual to keep their language competence. Further, individuals, who have positive attitudes towards the target language, seek possibilities and opportunities during the incubation period to retain their language competence (Gardner 1987: 521). However, the factor motivation is hardly considered examining language attrition. Especially during the last 10–15 years it became more and more acknowledged in the field of language acquisition rather than attrition. Only Gardner considered motivation as a possible factor influencing attrition. Even until today it is hardly recognised as an influencing factor and therefore exist only a few studies about [[motivation]] and its effects.

== Areas affected by language attrition ==

Feuerhake (2004: 7) reports that, looking at released studies, that have been conducted, it can be seen that all four competence areas2 are affected. Though some of these seem more likely to be affected than others, e.g. [[grammar]] and lexical knowledge are more likely to suffer a high attrition process. Showing loss in speaking competence, the first evidence is that the speech tempo decreases. Longer and more frequently occurring speech pauses, under which the [[fluency]] is suffering, are observable as well (Gardner 1987). Olshtain (1986) observed "[…] reduced accessibility in [[vocabulary]] retrieval in all situations of attrition where there is a reduction of language loss over longer periods of time." (1986: 163). Further, gaps concerning grammatical knowledge, especially tenses and conjunction of verbs occur quite frequently. Nevertheless, it can be said that productive skills are more affected than receptive ones, which mainly remain constantly stable (Cohen 1989) and if the learner shows already signs of language attrition it is more likely that transfer from L1 will happen (Berman &amp; Olshtain 1983). Cohen examined in his studies several strategies, the learner applies to compensate the lack of adequate speaking skills, e.g. one strategy is code-switching, to uphold the communication. Another phenomenon observable is a kind of "mixed-language". Müller (1995) states that on many levels of speaking the learner falls back on a mixture between different languages. Still, it is important to mention, that, as with almost every study that has been conducted in the different sub-fields of second-language acquisition research, several problems arise. There are longitudinal vs. cross-sectional studies, different variables, which have been used, and mainly terms and conditions of acquisition and incubation period are not standardised, particularly the length of the incubation period (Feuerhake 2004: 8). That means, some studies only observe language attrition after language programs, other look at the attrition in between breaks of language programs and studies, which examine the attrition after change of environment, regarding language and living conditions (Cohen 1975, Olshtain 1989). Finally, studies reviewed in this paper show that attrition follows a certain order, e.g. productive skills are more affected than receptive skills. Mainly due to difficulties in lexical retrieval a loss in fluency seems to be the first signs of language attrition, followed by attrition in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]]. Further observations in language attrition are necessary, to give a better understanding of how the human mind deals with language (Hansen 1999: 78).

== Motivation ==

The following chapter is trying to explain motivation and its influence on language attrition. Until 1990 the sociopsychological model of Gardner dominated the research about motivation. Gardner and Lambert emphasise thereby the importance of attitude towards the language, the target country and language community (Feuerhake 2004).

=== Instrumental and integrative orientation ===

According to Gardner and Lambert (1972) a learner is instrumental orientated if learning a foreign language has a function, e.g. for success in [[career]] terms. Thereby, the language becomes an instrument to achieve the higher purpose and the foreign language learning is concentrated on fulfilling the aim of the learner (Feuerhake 2004: 9).The integrative orientation follows the aim of [[Acculturation|acculturating]] with the target language and country as well as the integration into the target language community.

=== Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation ===

The instrumental and integrative orientation is not enough to cover all aspects of the term motivation, the term intrinsic and extrinsic motivation was added to the model. The term intrinsic is connected with behaviour, which results from the reward of the activity itself. The learner acts, because he is enjoying the activity or it is satisfying his curiosity. Mainly it is self-determined and the learner is eager to learn a foreign language because he wants to achieve a certain level of competence. The learner enjoys learning and the acquisition of a foreign language is challenging. Extrinsic motivated learners are orientated on external stimuli, e.g. positive feedback or expectations from others. In general four different types of extrinsic motivation can be distinguished (Bahar 2005):
# External: the learner is only motivated through external stimuli, e.g. exams
# Introjected: the learner pushes him/herself to achieve the desired goal, e.g.
# Identified: the value of the learning is recognised and for its own sake fulfilled.
# Integrated regulation: part of the personality, i.e. to fulfil a need.
Bahar (2005: 66) quotes Pintrich &amp; Schunk (1996), who state that "[…] motivation involves various mental processes that lead to the initiation and maintenance of action […]". Hence, motivation is a dynamic process that changes over time and the motivation of a learner as well might change during the learning process. Therefore, it cannot be seen as an isolated factor. Moreover, several other factors, which are settled within the learner, as well as in the environment, influence motivation and are responsible for its intensity and variability.

==Other studies==
Gardner, Lalonde, &amp; Moorcroft (1987) investigated the nature of L2-French skills attriting by L1-English grade 12 students during the summer vacation, and the role played by attitudes and motivation in promoting language achievement and language maintenance. Students who finished the L2 class highly proficient are more likely to retain what they knew. Yet high achievers in the classroom situation are no more likely to make efforts to use the L2 outside the classroom unless they have positive attitudes and high levels of motivation. The authors write: "an underlying determinant of both acquisition and use is motivation" (p.&amp;nbsp;44).

In fact, the nature of language acquisition is still so complex and so much is still unknown, not all students will have the same experiences during the incubation period. It is possible that some students will appear to attrite in some areas and others will appear to attrite in other areas. Some students will appear to maintain the level that they had previously achieved. And still, other students will appear to improve.

Murtagh (2003) investigated retention and attrition of L2-Irish in Ireland with second level school students. At Time 1, she found that most participants were motivated instrumentally, yet the immersion students were most likely to be motivated integratively and they had the most positive attitudes towards learning Irish. Immersion school students were also more likely to have opportunities to use Irish outside the classroom/school environment. Self-reports correlated with ability. She concludes that the educational setting (immersion schools, for example) and the use of the language outside the classroom were the best predictors for L2-Irish acquisition. Eighteen months later, Murtagh finds that the majority of groups 1 and 2 believe their Irish ability has attrited, the immersion group less so. The results from the tests, however, do not show any overall attrition. ''Time'' as a factor did not exert any overall significant change on the sample's proficiency in Irish (Murtagh, 2003:159).

Fujita (2002), in a study evaluating attrition among bilingual Japanese children, says that a number of factors are seen as necessary to maintain the two languages in the [[returnee]] child. Those factors include: age on arrival in the L2 environment, length of residence in the L2 environment, and proficiency levels of the L1. Furthermore, she found that L2 attrition was closely related to another factor: age of the child on returning to the L1 environment. Children returning around or before 9 were more likely to attrite than those returning later.
Upon returning from overseas, pressure from society, their family, their peers and themselves force returnee children to switch channels back to the L1 and they quickly make effort to attain the level of native-like L1 proficiency of their peers. At the same time, lack of L2 support in the schools in particular and in society in general results in an overall L2 loss.

==Definition and usage==

Brinton (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;112) defines "semantic field" or "semantic domain" and relates the linguistic concept to [[hyponymy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Related to the concept of hyponymy, but more loosely defined, is the notion of a semantic field or domain. A semantic field denotes a segment of reality symbolized by a set of related words. The words in a semantic field share a common [[semantic property]]."&lt;ref&gt;
Brinton, Laurel J. (2000). ''The structure of modern English: a linguistic introduction''. Illustrated edition. John Benjamins Publishing Company. {{ISBN|9789027225672}}. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cqhef3mfhXQC&amp;dq=semantic+field&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] (accessed: Sunday May 2, 2010), p.112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A general and intuitive description is that words in a semantic field are not necessarily [[synonym]]ous, but are all used to talk about the same general phenomenon.&lt;ref name=linguistics&gt;Adrian Akmajian, Richard A. Demers, Ann K. Farmer, Robert M. Harnish, ''Linguistics'', MIT Press, 2001, p239. {{ISBN|0-262-51123-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonymy requires the sharing of a [[sememe]] or [[seme (semantics)|seme]], but the semantic field is a larger area surrounding those. A meaning of a word is dependent partly on its relation to other words in the same conceptual area.&lt;ref&gt;Jaakko Hintikka, ''Aspects of Metaphor'', Springer, 1994, p41. {{ISBN|0-7923-2786-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kinds of semantic fields vary from culture to culture and anthropologists use them to study belief systems and reasoning across cultural groups.&lt;ref name=linguistics/&gt;

Andersen (1990: p.&amp;nbsp;327) identifies the traditional usage of "semantic field" theory as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Traditionally, semantic fields have been used for comparing the lexical structure of different languages and different states of the same language."&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Peter Bøgh (1990). ''A theory of computer semiotics: semiotic approaches to construction and assessment of computer systems. Volume 3 of Cambridge series on human-computer interaction''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-39336-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-39336-2}}.

==History==
The origin of the field theory of semantics is the [[lexical field theory]] introduced by [[Jost Trier]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref name=corson&gt;David Corson, ''Using English Words'', Springer, 1995. {{ISBN|0-7923-3711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}} although according to [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] it has historical roots in the ideas of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]].&lt;ref name=jackson14/&gt; In the 1960s [[Stephen Ullmann]] saw semantic fields as crystallising and perpetuating the values of society.&lt;ref name=corson/&gt;{{rp|32}} For John Lyons in the 1970s words related in any sense belonged to the same semantic field,&lt;ref name=corson/&gt;{{rp|32}} and the semantic field was simply a [[lexical category]], which he described as a '''lexical field'''.&lt;ref name=corson/&gt;{{rp|31}} Lyons emphasised the distinction between semantic fields and [[semantic networks]].&lt;ref name=corson/&gt;{{rp|31}} In the 1980s [[Eva Kittay]] developed a semantic field theory of [[metaphor]]. This approach is based on the idea that the items in a semantic field have specific relations to other items in the same field, and that a metaphor works by re-ordering the relations of a field by mapping them on to the existing relations of another field.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Judah Stern, ''Metaphor in Context'', MIT Press, 2000, p242. {{ISBN|0-262-19439-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. T. S. Atkins|Sue Atkins]] and [[Charles J. Fillmore]] in the 1990s proposed [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]] as an alternative to semantic field theory.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela B. Faber, Ricardo Mairal Usón, ''Constructing a Lexicon of English Verbs'', Walter de Gruyter, 1999, p73. {{ISBN|3-11-016416-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semantic shifts==
{{main|Semantic change}}
The semantic field of a given word shifts over time—see "[[semantic shift]]".  For example, the [[English language|English]] word "man" used to mean "human being" exclusively, while today it predominantly means "adult male," but its semantic field still extends in some uses to the generic "[[human]]" (see [[Mannaz]]).

Overlapping semantic fields are problematic, especially in [[translation]]. Words that have multiple meanings (called [[polysemous]] words) are often untranslatable, especially with all their connotations. Such words are frequently [[loanword|loaned]] instead of translated. Examples include "[[chivalry]]" (literally "horsemanship", related to "cavalry"), "[[dharma]]" (literally, "support"), and "[[taboo]]".

==Anthropological discourse==
Semantic field theory has informed the discourse of Anthropology as Ingold (1996: p.&amp;nbsp;127) relates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Semiology is not, of course, the same as semantics. Semiology is based on the idea that signs have meaning in relation to each other, such that a whole society is made up of relationally held meanings. But semantic fields do not stand in relations of opposition to each other, nor do they derive their distinctiveness in this way, nor indeed are they securely bounded at all. Rather, semantic fields are constantly flowing into each other. I may define a field of religion, but it soon becomes that of ethnic identity and then of politics and selfhood, and so on. In the very act of specifying semantic fields, people engage in an act of closure whereby they become conscious of what they have excluded and what they must therefore include."&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Main|Spanish verbs}}
This article presents a set of paradigms—that is, [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] tables—of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[verb]]s, including examples of [[regular verb]]s and some of the most common [[irregular verb]]s.  For other irregular verbs and their common patterns, see the article on [[Spanish irregular verbs]].

The tables include only the "simple" tenses (that is, those formed with a single word), and not the [[Compound verb|"compound" tenses]] (those formed with an [[auxiliary verb]] plus a [[Non-finite verb|non-finite]] form of the main verb), such as the progressive, perfect, and passive voice.  The [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspects]] (also called "continuous tenses") are formed by using the appropriate tense of ''estar'' + gerund, and the [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] constructions are formed by using the appropriate tense of ''haber'' + [[Participle|past participle]].  When the past participle is used in this way, it invariably ends with ''-o''.  In contrast, when the participle is used as an [[Grammatical modifier|adjective]], it agrees in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] with the noun modified.  And similarly, the participle agrees with the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] when it is used with ''ser'' to form the "true" ([[Dynamic verb|dynamic]]) [[passive voice]] (e.g. ''La carta fue escrita ayer'' 'The letter was written [got written] yesterday.'), and also when it is used with ''estar'' to form a "passive of result", or [[Stative verb|stative]] passive (as in ''La carta ya está escrita'' 'The letter is already written.').

The pronouns ''yo, tú, vos,&lt;ref name="voseo"&gt;The pronoun ''vos'' and its verb forms are used in large areas of Central and South America for the second-person singular in the "familiar" or informal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], generally replacing (but in some areas coexisting with) ''tú''. In Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay it is used in the formal register (but the [[T–V_distinction#Spanish|familiar or T form of address]]). See [[Voseo]].&lt;/ref&gt; él, nosotros, vosotros&lt;ref name="vosotros"&gt;The second-person plural familiar pronoun ''vosotros'' / ''vosotras'' is used only in Spain; in the Americas its function is carried by ''ustedes''.&lt;/ref&gt;'' and ''ellos'' are used to symbolise the three [[Grammatical person|persons]] and two [[Grammatical number|numbers]].  Note, however, that Spanish is a [[pro-drop language]], and so it is the norm to omit subject pronouns when not needed for contrast or emphasis. Note also that the subject, if specified, can easily be something other than these pronouns. For example, ''él'', ''ella'', or ''usted'' can be replaced by a [[noun phrase]], or the verb can appear with impersonal ''se'' and no subject (e.g. ''Aquí se vive bien'', 'One lives well here'). The first-person plural expressions ''nosotros'', ''nosotras'', ''tú y yo'', or ''él y yo'' can be replaced by a noun phrase that includes the speaker (e.g. ''Los estudiantes tenemos hambre'', 'We students are hungry').  The same comments hold for ''vosotros'' and ''ellos''.

The normative form for ''vos'' is the one used in Rioplatense Spanish: see [http://lema.rae.es/drae/srv/search?id=f9iYgCeetVcRjQ1FAuZq amar] in the [[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española|Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy]].&lt;/ref&gt;||''ame''||''amemos''||''améis''||''amen''

When the object pronoun ''os'' is attached to make the

[[File:Page from gurre kamilaroi or Kamilaroi Sayings.png|300px|thumb|A page from an 1856 book illustrating the letters of the alphabet for [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] at that time. Note the use of the letter [[Eng (letter)|eng]] (ŋ) and [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s (¯).]]

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] had been purely spoken languages, and had no [[writing system]]. On their arrival, Latin script became a standard for '''transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages''', but the details of how the sounds were represented has varied over time and from writer to writer, sometimes resulting in a great many variant spellings of the same word or name.

==Early writing==
At first, Australian languages were written following [[English orthography]] as it sounded to the writer. This meant that sounds which were distinguished in Australian languages but not in English were written identically, while at the same time sounds which were [[allophone]]s in Australian languages but distinct in English were written differently.

Most [[List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin|Aboriginal words used in English]] follow these early conventions, and therefore do not usually give a good idea of how the word was pronounced in the original language.

|style="text-align: center;"| {{IPA|[waɾul]}}
| &lt;small&gt;Early spellings may fail to distinguish between {{IPA|[ɾ]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}, which are allophones in English but distinct in Australian languages.&lt;/small&gt;
|}

Writers with more linguistic knowledge sometimes employed symbols such as {{angbr|[[eng (letter)|ŋ]]}} or {{angbr|[[ġ]]}} for {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, {{angbr|[[ñ]]}} for {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s {{angbr|¯}} or [[circumflex]]es {{angbr|ˆ}} for long vowels, [[breve]]s {{angbr|˘}} for short vowels, but these were often applied inconsistently.

==Modern practical orthography==
Linguists working with Australian languages today purposely use unambiguous [[phoneme|phonemic]] orthographies based on detailed [[phonology|phonological analysis]] of the language in question. In orthographies of this kind each spoken word can only be written one way, and each written word can only be read one way.

Usually, but not always, practical orthographies use just the letters of the basic Roman alphabet. This necessitates the use of [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for sounds that do not have a standard character. In some cases this can lead to ambiguities, for example where the single sound {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and the consonant cluster {{IPA|/nɡ/}} could both be written as {{angbr|ng}}. These are commonly distinguished by writing the cluster {{angbr|n.g}} (inserting a [[full stop]]), {{angbr|n’g}} (inserting an [[apostrophe]]), or {{angbr|nk}}.

===Vowels and semivowels===
Most Australian languages distinguish just three vowels, which are written {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|u}}. Even though they may sound like {{angbr|e}} or {{angbr|o}} at times, they are not written {{angbr|e}} or {{angbr|o}}, e.g. the [[Martuthunira language|Martuthunira]] word ''wirrirri'' "flame" is pronounced as {{IPA|[weɾeɾɪ]}}. [[Vowel length|Long vowels]] are represented by double letters, i.e. {{angbr|ii}} {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{angbr|aa}} {{IPA|/aː/}}, {{angbr|uu}} {{IPA|/uː/}}.

The [[semivowel]]s {{angbr|w}} and {{angbr|y}} are usually pronounced as in English. In some languages, {{angbr|w}} may not be pronounced next to {{angbr|u}}, and {{angbr|y}} next to {{angbr|i}}, but for various reasons a linguist may still choose to write them, so that e.g. [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] ''yinarr'' "woman" is actually pronounced {{IPA|[inar]}}.

A handful of languages have a dental semivowel, which is written {{angbr|yh}} (see Place of articulation below).

===Rhotics===
Most Australian languages have two [[rhotic consonant|rhotics]] or ''r''-like sounds: a [[retroflex approximant]], as in [[American English]], written {{angbr|r}}; and a [[trill consonant|trill]] or [[flap consonant|flap]] (both of which are found in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), written {{angbr|rr}}.

In languages that have only one of the two r's, it is simply written {{angbr|r}}.

===Place of articulation===
The [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]], [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] consonants are usually written the same as in English, i.e. {{angbr|p}} {{IPA|/p/}}, {{angbr|b}} {{IPA|/b/}}, {{angbr|m}} {{IPA|/m/}}, {{angbr|k}} {{IPA|/k/}}, {{angbr|g}} {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{angbr|ng}} {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, {{angbr|t}} {{IPA|/t/}}, {{angbr|d}} {{IPA|/d/}}, {{angbr|n}} {{IPA|/n/}}, {{angbr|l}} {{IPA|/l/}}. {{angbr|ng}} may also be written using the non-English letter {{angbr|ŋ}}, called [[Eng (letter)|eng]]. Note that {{angbr|ŋ}} sounds like the ''ng'' in ''singer'', not as in ''finger;'' the latter would be written {{angbr|ŋg}}.

[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]] consonants are often represented by a digraph made of an alveolar consonant + {{angbr|j}} or {{angbr|y}}, i.e. {{angbr|tj}} {{IPA|/c ɟ ɲ ʎ/}} can be written {{angbr|tj}}/{{angbr|ty}}, {{angbr|dj}}/{{angbr|dy}}, {{angbr|nj}}/{{angbr|ny}}, and {{angbr|lj}}/{{angbr|ly}}. {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|j}} are other possible ways of writing the palatal stops.

[[Dental consonant|Dental]] consonants are represented by a digraph made of an alveolar consonant + {{angbr|h}}, i.e. {{angbr|th}} {{IPA|/t̪/}}, {{angbr|dh}} {{IPA|/d̪/}}, {{angbr|nh}} {{IPA|/n̪/}}, {{angbr|lh}} {{IPA|/l̪/}}. Note that {{angbr|th}} is not a [[voiceless dental fricative|fricative]] as in [[Australian English]], but a [[voiceless dental stop|stop]] as in [[Irish English]].

[[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]] consonants are usually represented by a digraph made of {{angbr|r}} + an alveolar consonant, i.e. {{angbr|rt}} {{IPA|/ʈ/}}, {{angbr|rd}} {{IPA|/ɖ/}}, {{angbr|rn}} {{IPA|/ɳ/}}, {{angbr|rl}} {{IPA|/ɭ/}}, as in [[Swedish_phonology#Sonorants|Swedish]]. In some varieties, such as [[Pitjantjatjara dialect|Pitjantjatjara]], a digraph is not used and instead the alveolar consonant is underlined to indicate that it is retroflex thus: {{angbr|ṯ}}, {{angbr|ṉ}} and {{angbr|ḻ}}.

A handful of languages have [[palato-velar consonant|palato-velar]] consonants, between palatal and velar. For [[Yanyuwa language|Yanyuwa]], these are written {{angbr|yk}} {{IPA|/ɡ̟/}}, {{angbr|nyk}} {{IPA|/ⁿɡ̟/}} (a prenasalised stop—see Prenasalisation below), {{angbr|nyng}} {{IPA|/ŋ̟/}}.&lt;ref name="yanyuwa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradley |first=John |authorlink=John Bradley (anthropologist) |author2=Kirton, Jean |year=1992 |title=Yanyuwa Wuka: language from Yanyuwa country |others=unpublished |url=http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00000072/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222014008/http://eprint.uq.edu.au/archive/00000072/ |archivedate=2005-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voicing of stops===
Most Australian languages do not distinguish between [[voiced consonant|voiced]] and [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]] [[plosive consonant|stop]]s, so that e.g. ''t'' and ''d'' both occur as variants of the same sound. Both the voiced and voiceless allophone will usually be written the same way, but whether to use the voiceless symbol or the voiced symbol varies depending on which occurs more frequently in the language. Some languages have been written using the voiced symbols by one linguist and the voiceless symbols by another. Moreover, some linguists choose to use voiceless symbols for some consonants in a language and voiced symbols for others.

Some languages do distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops, however.

===Prenasalisation===
Some languages have [[prenasalized consonant]]s, a stop preceded by a nasal sound which is considered one consonant. In [[Yanyuwa language|Yanyuwa]] these are written {{angbr|mb}} {{IPA|/ᵐb/}}, {{angbr|ngk}} {{IPA|/ᵑɡ/}}, {{angbr|nj}} {{IPA|/ᶮɟ/}}, {{angbr|nth}} {{IPA|/ⁿd̪/}}, {{angbr|nd}} {{IPA|/ⁿd/}}, {{angbr|rnd}} {{IPA|/ᶯɖ/}}.&lt;ref name="yanyuwa" /&gt;
