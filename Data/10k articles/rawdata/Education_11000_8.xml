Although made available to other organizations, the materials were primarily used in courses taught to youth ages 12–14 (in mixed-gender groups) in [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] congregations.

AYS covered many topics including anatomy, gender identity, relationships, sexual intercourse and intimacy; as well as covering sexually transmitted diseases and birth control. AYS was based on the assumption that sexuality is a natural and healthy part of being a human. It considered the wide range of sexual feelings and behaviors as normal. AYS was unique among sex education courses because it used visual materials that depicted human sexuality in a realistic and graphic fashion. For example, film strips used in the course showed images of real [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]] encounters, and [[masturbation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The slides concluded with images of the man ejaculating into his navel and then tasting his own semen. Other media used in the course of AYS included audio tapes of interviews with [[transgender]], homosexual, and heterosexual men and women speaking about their sexuality.

AYS was considered very controversial both at the time of its inception and in the mid-1990s when it was replaced by [[Our Whole Lives]]. It was also featured in the book ''[[Harmful to Minors]]'' by [[Judith Levine]] as an example of complete sexual education.

[[Germany]] uses a 6-point [[grade (education)|grading scale (GPA)]] to evaluate the performance of school children. Grades vary from 1 (excellent, ''sehr gut'') to 6 (insufficient, ''ungenügend''). In the final classes of German [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium schools]] that prepare for university studies, a point system is used with 15 points being the best grade and 0 points the worst. The percentage causes the grade can vary from teacher to teacher.

==Grades by education==

=== Primary and lower secondary education ===
In primary and lower secondary education (1st to 10th grade), German school children receive grades based on a 6-point grading scale ranging from 1 (excellent, ''sehr gut'') to 6 (insufficient, ''ungenügend''). Variations on the traditional six grade system allow for awarding grades suffixed with "+" and "-".

To calculate averages of suffixed grades, they are assigned fractional values, where 1 is 1.0, 1- is 1.3, 2+ is 1.7, 2 is 2.0, 2- is 2.3 and so on. As schools are governed by the states, not by the federal government, there are slight differences. Often a more granular scale of "1-" (equal to 1.25), "1-2" (= 1.5), "2+" (= 1.75), etc. is used; sometimes even decimal grading (1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and so on) is applied.

In end-of-year [[report card]]s, only unmodified integer grades may be used; in some regions they are written in text form.

==== Pedagogic grading ====
Teachers who teach Grundschule (primary school) or Sonderschule (special education school) are allowed to use "pädagogische Noten" ("pedagogic grades"). Thus if a student tries very hard, but still does very poorly compared to the rest of the class, the teachers are allowed to give them good grades because they tried so hard.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Upper secondary education ===
In the final classes of [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium schools]] (11th to 12th/13th grade) the grades are converted to numbers ("points"), where "1+" equals 15 points and "6" equals 0 points. Since 1+ exists in this system, theoretically a final Abitur grade of less than 0.6 is possible and such grades are used in an informal setting, although officially any student with less than 1.0 will be awarded a 1.0 Abitur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/schule/super-abiturient-felix-geisler-koenig-der-ueberflieger-a-500915.html|title=Super-Abiturient Felix Geisler: König der Überflieger|last=Christ|first=Sebastian|date=2007-08-21|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the point system is used, a grade of 4 (5 points) is the lowest passing grade, and 4- (4 points) the highest failing grade.

=== Tertiary education ===
In [[Education in Germany#College and University|German universities]] (except for law schools) a 1 to 5 scale is used:
* 1,0–1,5 ''sehr gut'' (very good: an ''outstanding'' achievement)
* 1,6–2,5 ''gut'' (good: an achievement which lies ''substantially above average'' requirements)
* 2,6–3,5 ''befriedigend'' (satisfactory: an achievement which corresponds to ''average'' requirements)
* 3,6–4,0 ''ausreichend'' (sufficient: an achievement which ''barely meets'' the requirements)
*     5,0 ''nicht ausreichend'' / ''nicht bestanden'' (not sufficient / failed: an achievement which ''does not meet'' the requirements)

==== Law schools ====
For law students at German universities, a similar system to the 1 to 5 scale is used that comprises one more grade that is inserted between 2 (''gut'') and 3 (''befriedigend''), named ''vollbefriedigend''. This is because the grades 2 (''gut'') and 1 (''sehr gut'') are extremely rare, so an additional grade was created below ''gut'' to increase differentiation. Every grade is converted into points similarly to the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' system described above, starting at 18 points (excellent) down to 0 points (poor). 4 points is the lowest pass grade.

&lt;small&gt;* This conversion scheme is intended as a guideline, as exact conversions may differ.&lt;/small&gt;

==Conversion of grades==

A matter of particular interest for those considering studying abroad or even enrolling full-time in a German university is the conversion of grades. While the below information may prove useful, it is recommended to contact the interested university directly to inquire which method they use to convert grades.

===Modified Bavarian formula===

A number of systems exist for the conversion of grades from other countries into German grades. One such system, used by most universities in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Bavaria]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}, is called the "Modified Bavarian Formula":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ia.uni-stuttgart.de/asb/faq/docs/Bayerische_Formel.pdf|title=University of Stuttgart: Bavarian Formula|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x={N_{\mathrm{max}}-N_{\mathrm{d}}\over N_{\mathrm{max}}-N_{\mathrm{min}}}3+1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; = German grade, &lt;math&gt;N_{\mathrm{max}}&lt;/math&gt; = best possible score in foreign country's grading system, &lt;math&gt;N_{\mathrm{min}}&lt;/math&gt; = lowest passing score in foreign grading system and &lt;math&gt;N_{\mathrm{d}}&lt;/math&gt; = obtained foreign grade (to be converted into German grade). The resulting value is rounded to the next German grade (e.g. 1.6 is rounded to the German grade 1.7 and 2.4 is rounded to 2.3). For resulting values between two German grades, the score is rounded to the better grade (e.g. 2.5 is rounded to the German grade 2.3 and 1.15 is rounded to 1.0).

===Latin grades===

Sometimes, esp. with a Dr. Phil. (D.Phil. / Ph.D.) the Latin versions are used for the grading.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In this case the grade (Note/Zensur) is called ''Prädikat''. The following rough guide may be used to convert into standard German grades:

* summa cum laude (&lt;1.0 = mit Auszeichnung, "with distinction")
* magna cum laude (1.0 = sehr gut, "very good")
* cum laude (2.0 = gut, "good")
* rite (3.0 = bestanden, "passed")

There is no fail grade; in that case the dissertation is ''formally rejected'' without a grade.

== East Germany (1950s-1980s) ==
{{Unreferenced section |date=September 2010}}
In former [[East Germany]], a 5-point grading scale was used until July 1991:
{| class="wikitable"
!Grade
!Text
!Explanation
|-
|1
|sehr gut (very good)
|best possible grade
|-
|2
|gut (good)
|next-highest grade
|-
|3
|befriedigend (satisfactory) 
|average performance
|-
|4
|genügend (sufficient)
|lowest passing grade
|-
|5
|ungenügend (insufficient)
|lowest possible grade and the only failing grade
|}
With the polytechnic reform of the school system initiated by the ''Act on Socialistic Development of the School System in the German Democratic Republic'' the Ministry of People's Education wanted to adapt academic grading for all institutions in its jurisdiction, which were general educational schools, vocational schools and professional schools for the qualification of lower classes teachers, educators and kindergartners. Therefore, a reorganized grading scale was enacted in ''Directive on the introduction of a unified grading scale for secondary schools, extended secondary schools, special schools, vocational schools, institutes of vocational masters' education, institutes of vocational school teachers' education, institutes of vocational teachers' further education, institutes of teachers' education and pedagogic institutes''. This directive was unchangedly effective from September 1, 1960, to August 25, 1993.

For all of the different subjects there were further recommendations with even more specific descriptions in relation to the general grading scale. These particular comments should help the teacher to grade the achievements of the students as objectively as possible.

This scale is identical to the current [[Grade (education)#Austria|Austrian]] grading scale.

== Criticism of German grading policies ==

=== The case of Sabine Czerny ===
At public schools in Germany, teachers are supposed to evaluate students against fixed course-specific criteria, but often feel implicit pressure to [[Grading on a curve|grade students on a curve]] where grades are awarded based on performance relative to all other individuals rather than performance relative to the difficulty of a specific course.

Specifically, in the 2008 case of Sabine Czerny, a Bavarian primary school teacher, Czerny thought that 91% of the class would be able to make a successful transition into a [[Realschule]] or a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] (high schools for which normally only circa 50% of Bavarian children qualify based on their educational achievements). While the parents liked this result, the educational authorities questioned Czerny's grading standards. Czerny claims that her students' results stood up in cross-classroom tests; nonetheless she was transferred to another school.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Bleher: [http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/wissen/artikel/1/bitte-nicht-fuer-schueler-engagieren/ "Wenn die Kids zu gut sind: Bitte nicht für Schüler engagieren"]. TAZ. July 30th 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Bleher: [http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/wissen/artikel/1/nachhaltig-den-schulfrieden-gestoert/ "Kritische bayerische Lehrkraft versetzt: Störerin des Schulfriedens"]. TAZ. August 4th 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Czerny received much public sympathy and later went on to write a book about her experiences.

=== Comparisons between Gymnasium and Gesamtschule (comprehensive school) ===
German [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]s are schools which aim to prepare students for college education. These schools are selective, and tough grading is a traditional element of the teaching. The culture of these works against students of average academic ability who barely qualify for a Gymnasium place, and who may then find themselves on the bottom of their class; these same students would have achieved better grades for the same effort if they had attended a non-selective comprehensive school (Gesamtschule).&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Tücke. "Psychologie für die Schule, Psychologie für die Schule: Eine themenzentreirte Einführung in die Psychologie für (zukünftige) Lehrer". 4. Auflage 2005. Münster LIT Verlag; p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

A study revealed that a sample of Gymnasium high school seniors of average mathematical ability&lt;ref&gt;who scored 100 on a math test, provided by the scientists&lt;/ref&gt; who chose to attend advanced college-preparatory math classes at their school ("Leistungskurs") found themselves in the very bottom of their class and had an average grade of 5 (i.e. failed the class). Comprehensive school students of equal mathematical ability found themselves in the upper half of the equivalent course in their school and obtained an average grade of 3+.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Tücke: "Psychologie in der Schule, Psychologie für die Schule: Eine themenzentrierte Einführung in die Psychologie für (zukünftige) Lehrer". 4 Auflage 2005. Münster: LIT Verlag; p. 127; the study was done in [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]], students were attending a Leistungskurs&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that students who graduated from a Gesamtschule tend to do worse in college than their grades in high school classes would predict - and vice versa for Gymnasium students.

== Predictive ability ==
{{or-section|date=November 2014}}
Often the German grades are treated like an [[interval scale]] to calculate means and deviations for comparisons. Despite the fact that it lacks any psychometric standardization, the grading system is often compared to normally distributed norm-referenced assessments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Using an expected value of 3 and a standard deviation of 1, transformations into other statistical measures like Percentiles, T, Stanine etc. or (like in the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA studies]]) an [[IQ]] scale are then possible.

This transformation is problematic both for high school grades and for university grades:

At high school level, schooling in most of Germany is selective — thus for instance a Gymnasium student who is underperforming compared to his classmates is likely to still be close to or above average when compared to his entire age group.

At university level, the distribution is highly non-normal and idiosyncratic to the subject. Substantially more German students fail exams in university than in other countries (usually about 20-40%, often even more){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. Grades awarded vary widely between fields of study and between universities. (In law degrees, for instance, only 10-15% of candidates get a grade better than "befriedigend".)

This might be one reason for the low graduation rates at university in international comparisons, as well as for the small number of people who obtain an "Abitur" in the first place. However, several empirical psychological studies show that the grades awarded in Germany at school and university have a high reliability when taking up higher education and research jobs. The universities usually demand high grades in Diploma Thesis or a Master Thesis. Thesis grades are by far the most critical factor while applying for job or higher education e.g. PhDs.&lt;ref name="ingenkamp"&gt;{{cite journal

  |url=
  |format=
  |title= Handbuch der Pädagogischen Diagnostik
  |publisher= Weinheim: Beltz (Psychologie Verlags Union)
  |version=
  |accessdate=
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; One study from 1995 found that GPAs from school are a mild (weak) predictor for success in university and to a slightly better degree for success in vocational trainings, and that GPAs from school or university have nearly no predictive value for [[job performance]].&lt;ref name="hollmann"&gt;{{cite journal

  |accessdate=
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, due to rarity of psychometric testing (like [[Scholastic Aptitude Test]] (SAT) or the [[Medical College Admission Test]] (MCAT) and the like in the US) the GPA is usually used as the most predictive criterion available within an application process. For job recruiting, school/university grades have a high impact on career opportunities, as independent scientifically based recruitment and assessment is used by less than 8% of the German employers (50-70% in other European countries ).&lt;ref name="schuler"&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Bowling for Columbine''''' is a 2002 American [[documentary film]] written, produced, directed, and narrated by [[Michael Moore]]. The film explores what Moore suggests are the primary causes for the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999 and other acts of violence with guns. Moore focuses on the background and environment in which the massacre took place and some common public opinions and assumptions about related issues. The film also looks into the nature of violence in the United States.

A critical and commercial success, the film brought Moore international attention as a rising filmmaker and won numerous awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]], the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature]], a special ''55th Anniversary Prize'' at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]],&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3137379/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Bowling for Columbine |accessdate=2009-10-24 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710235222/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3137379/year/2002.html |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[César Award for Best Foreign Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310793/awards|title=Bowling for Columbine|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is considered one of the [[list of films considered the best|greatest documentary films of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.cwu.edu/media/intnationaldoc20.htm |title=International Documentary Association Top Twenty Documentaries of All-Time|publisher=Central Washington University — Brooks Library (at Archive.org)|accessdate=2009-09-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213002531/http://www.lib.cwu.edu/media/intnationaldoc20.htm |archivedate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aabowlingawardnews.htm|title="Bowling for Columbine" Named Best Documentary Film|date=2002-12-12 |publisher=About.com|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_documentary_movies/ Top 100 Documentary Movies]&lt;br /&gt;[[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;br /&gt;Retrieved 2016-02-08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/pov/blog/news/2012/12/the-25-greatest-documentaries-of-all-time/22/ The 25 Greatest Documentaries of All-Time]&lt;br /&gt;[[PBS]]&lt;br/ &gt;Retrieved 2016-02-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film content==
In Moore's discussions with various people&amp;mdash;including ''[[South Park]]'' co-creator [[Matt Stone]], the [[National Rifle Association]]'s then-president [[Charlton Heston]], and [[musician]] [[Marilyn Manson]]&amp;mdash;he seeks to explain why the Columbine massacre occurred and why the United States' violent crime rate (especially concerning crimes committed with firearms) is substantially higher than those of other nations. &lt;!-- That is bordering on POV as well --&gt;

===Bowling===
The film's title refers to the story that [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]]—the two students responsible for the [[Columbine High School massacre]]—attended a school [[bowling]] class at 6:00 AM on the day they committed the attacks at school, which started at 11:17 AM. Later investigations showed that this was based on mistaken recollections, and Glenn Moore of the Golden Police Department concluded that they were absent from school on the day of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.salon.com/0001137/2005/04/16.html#a1561 |title=A little unfinished business on Bowling and Columbine |first=Dave |last=Cullen |date=2005-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715233749/http://blogs.salon.com/0001137/2005/04/16.html |archivedate=2011-07-15}} recorded by the ''Boulder Daily Camera''&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore incorporates the concept of bowling into the film in other ways as well. For example, the [[Michigan Militia]] use bowling pins for their target practice. When interviewing former classmates of the two boys, Moore notes that the students took a bowling class in place of [[Physical education class|physical education]]. He suggests that this might have very little educational value and the girls he interviews generally agree, noting how Harris and Klebold led introverted lifestyles and careless attitudes towards the game, and that nobody thought twice about it. Moore questions whether the school system is responding to the real needs of students or if they are reinforcing fear. Moore also interviews two young residents of [[Oscoda, Michigan|Oscoda]], [[Michigan]]. Moore suggests a [[culture of fear]] created by the government and the media leads Americans to arm themselves, to the advantage of gun-making companies. Moore suggests that bowling could have been just as responsible for the attacks on the school as Marilyn Manson, or even [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], who launched [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing attacks]] on [[Serbia]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2004/01/wesley_me.html|title=Wesley &amp; Me|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|first=Michael|last=Hastings|date=2004-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free gun for opening a bank account===
[[Image:Bowling4columbine.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Michael Moore upon receiving his free gun at the bank&lt;ref name="cst" /&gt;]]
An early scene depicts a bank in Michigan that gives customers a free hunting rifle when they make a deposit of a certain size into a [[time deposit]] account.&lt;ref name="cst"&gt;Nol, Michael. [https://www.webcitation.org/5YAIv8uxD?url=http://www.overcast.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/print/press/cst1.htm Banks use gifts to target depositors], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. January 28, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The film follows Moore as he goes to the bank, makes his deposit, fills out the forms, and awaits the result of a background check before walking out of the bank carrying a brand new [[Weatherby]] hunting rifle. Just before leaving the bank, Moore asks: "Do you think it's a little dangerous handing out guns at a bank?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://bowlingforcolumbine.michaelmoore.com/media/clips/index.php Bowling for Columbine : Media Clips - Michael At The Bank] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110235715/http://bowlingforcolumbine.michaelmoore.com/media/clips/index.php |date=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mike Wilson (filmmaker)|Michael Wilson]]'s documentary ''[[Michael Moore Hates America]]'', bank employees from the branch at which Moore is handed a free hunting rifle assert that they were misled during filming of the segment. They say that the bank's policy was to conduct background checks on rifle recipients and mail the rifles to a licensed gun dealer, but Moore's agents, under the pretext of "doing a story on unique businesses across America", convinced bank employees to have his rifle presented to him on camera the morning after filming his account opening. Further, they counter that contrary to the film's supposition that the bank kept hundreds of guns on their premises, the gun which was handed to Michael Moore in the film was shipped overnight from a vault in a branch 300 miles away. Moore denied that this sequence was staged but acknowledged the timing of events was compressed for production reasons. He reminded his readers that North Country Bank is a licensed firearms dealer and, in addition to its [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] license number, he produced out-takes where bank employee Jan Jacobson confirms on camera that rifles are secured locally on bank premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Michael Moore responds to the wacko attacks ... | url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/books-films/facts/bowling-columbine/ | author=Michael Moore | date=September 2003 | accessdate=2008-05-30 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002185200/http://michaelmoore.com/books-films/facts/bowling-columbine | archivedate=2009-10-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Bowling for Columbine" outtakes |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/wackoattacko/movie.php?mov=bank-full |author=Michael Moore |date=September 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313141106/http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/wackoattacko/movie.php?mov=bank-full |archivedate=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2016-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Happiness Is a Warm Gun" montage===
About 20 minutes into the film, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]" plays during a [[Montage sequence|montage]] in which footage of the following is shown:

* People buying guns
* Residents of [[Virgin, Utah]], a town that passed a law requiring all residents to own guns
* People firing rifles at [[carnival]]s and [[shooting range]]s
* Denise Ames operating a [[rifle]]
* [[Carey McWilliams (marksman)|Carey McWilliams]], a blind gun enthusiast from [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[North Dakota]]
* [[Gary Plauche]] killing Jeff Doucet, who had kidnapped and [[sexual abuse|molested]] Plauche's son
* The suicide of [[R. Budd Dwyer]]
* A 1993 murder where Emilio Nuñez shot and killed his ex-wife [[Maritza Martin]] during an interview on the [[Telemundo]] program ''[[Ocurrió Así]]''
* The suicide of [[Daniel V. Jones]], an AIDS/cancer patient who was protesting [[HMO]]s
* A man who takes his shirt off and is shot during a [[riot]]

===Weapons of mass destruction===
Early in the film, Moore links the violent behavior of the Columbine shooters to the presence of a large defense establishment manufacturing rocket technology in [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]]. It is implied that the presence of this facility within the community, and the acceptance of [[structural violence|institutionalized violence]] as a solution to conflict, contributed to the mindset that led to the massacre.

Moore conducts an interview with Evan McCollum, Director of Communications at a [[Lockheed Martin]] plant near Columbine, and asks him:

{{quote|So you don't think our kids say to themselves, 'Dad goes off to the factory every day, he builds missiles of [[weapon of mass destruction|mass destruction]].' What's the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School?}}

McCollum responds:

{{quote|I guess I don't see that specific connection because the missiles that you're talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us.}}

After the release of the film, Lockheed Martin spokesperson Evan McCollum clarified that the plant no longer produces missiles (the plant manufactured parts for [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s with a nuclear warhead in the mid-1980s), but rockets used for launching [[satellite]]s:

{{quote|I provided specific information to Moore about the space launch vehicles we build to launch spacecraft for NASA, NOAA, the Dept. of Defense and commercial customers, including DirecTV and EchoStar.&lt;ref name="möller"&gt;Möller, Erik. [http://www.kuro5hin.org/print/2003/8/12/171427/607 A defense of Michael Moore and "Bowling for Columbine"] kuro5hin.org August 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Erik Möller argues that Moore's question was not limited to the Littleton-area Lockheed Martin facility:

{{quote|First, note the word "our" in Moore's question. Moore is not from Colorado -- his question is generic, not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question. ... Of course, critics [David Hardy, et al.] have conveniently ignored the fact that Lockheed Martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the US military, and that the company is the nation's largest military contractor.&lt;ref name="möller" /&gt;}}

==="What a Wonderful World" montage===
The film cuts to a montage of American [[foreign policy]] decisions, with the intent to counter McCollum's statement by citing examples of how the United States has frequently been the aggressor nation. This montage is set to the song "[[What a Wonderful World]]", performed by [[Louis Armstrong]].

The following is a transcript of the onscreen text in the ''Wonderful World'' segment:

The montage ends with handheld-camera footage of [[United Airlines Flight 175]] crashing into the South Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001, the audio consisting solely of the emotional reactions of the witnesses, recorded by the camera's microphone. On the website accompanying the film, Moore provides additional background information for this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/books-films/bowlingforcolumbine/library/wonderful/index.php|title=Bowling for Columbine : Library : What a Wonderful World|publisher=MichaelMoore.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628131147/http://www.michaelmoore.com/books-films/bowlingforcolumbine/library/wonderful/index.php|archivedate=2009-06-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate of fear===
Moore contrasts his portrayal of the U.S. attitude toward guns and violence with the attitude prevailing in areas of Canada where gun ownership is at similar levels to the U.S. He illustrates his thesis by visiting neighborhoods in Canada near the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–U.S. border]], where he finds front doors unlocked and much less concern over crime and [[security]]. In regards to the film, Farber states "Moore's thesis, which he later elaborated in ''Fahrenheit 9/11'', is that the fear-mongering that permeates American society contributes to our epidemic of gun violence". We are also shown news stories being covered in Canada and how they don't follow the "if it bleeds it leads" mentality. This adds to Moore's argument that the media is driving America's fear as well as their need for protection. The cartoon "A Brief History of the United States of America" encompasses Moore's view of where the fear in America started and how it's progressed and changed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.documentary.org/magazine/michael-moores-bowling-columbine-2002|title=Michael Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' (2002)|last=Farber|first=Stephen|date=|website=IDA|publisher=|accessdate=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this section, there is a montage of several social pundits stating possible causes for gun violence. Many claim links with violence in television, cinema, and [[personal computer game|computer games]]; towards the end of the montage, however, the same people all change their claims to [[Marilyn Manson]]'s responsibility. Following this is an interview between Moore and Marilyn Manson. Manson shares his views about the United States' climate with Moore, stating that he believes U.S. society is based on "fear and consumption", citing [[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate]] commercials that promise "if you have bad breath, [people] are not going to talk to you" and other commercials containing fear-based messages. Manson also mentions that the media, under heavy government influence, had asserted that his influence on the acts of Klebold and Harris was far greater than that of President Clinton, who ordered more bombings on [[Kosovo]] on April 20, 1999, than any other day during the Balkans campaign. When Moore asks Manson what he would say to the students at [[Columbine High School|Columbine]], Manson replies, "I wouldn't say a single word to them; I would listen to what they have to say, and that's what no one did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/media/clips/windowsmedia.php?Clip=manson1021LG|title = Marilyn Manson Interview on Bowling for Columbine|publisher = Bowling for Columbine Official Website|date = 2002-10-11|accessdate = 2010-11-15|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615135947/http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/media/clips/windowsmedia.php?Clip=manson1021LG|archivedate = 2011-06-15|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[South Park]]'' co-creator [[Matt Stone]]—who grew up in Littleton—agreed to talk with Moore about his hometown and the shooting in the film. Although he did not feel that Moore mischaracterized him or his statements in the film, he harbored ill feelings about the cartoon "A Brief History of the United States of America". Both Stone and his fellow ''South Park'' creator [[Trey Parker]] felt that the cartoon was done in a style very similar to theirs. Also, its proximity to Stone's interview may have led some viewers to believe, incorrectly, that they created the cartoon. "It was a good lesson in what Michael Moore does in films. He doesn't necessarily say explicitly this is what it is, but he creates meaning where there is none by cutting things together," Stone remarked in a later interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC - Movies - Interview - Matt Stone|work=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2005/01/13/matt_stone_team_america_interview.shtml|author= Anwar Brett|date=2005-01-13 |accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a humorous retort to this, Stone and Parker portrayed Moore as "a gibbering, overweight, hot-dog-eating buffoon" who ultimately commits a suicide bombing against the protagonists in their 2004 film, ''[[Team America: World Police]]''.&lt;ref name="msnbc 6228221"&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6228221/ ‘Team America’ takes on moviegoers] [[msnbc.com]], October 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
Moore follows up by exploring popular explanations as to why gun violence is so high in the United States. He examines Marilyn Manson as a cause, but states that more German citizens listen to Marilyn Manson (per capita) and that the country has a larger Goth population than the United States, with less gun violence (Germany: 381 incidents per year). He examines violent movies, but notes that other countries have the same violent movies, showing ''[[The Matrix]]'' with French subtitles (France: 255 incidents per year). He also examines video games, but observes that many violent video games come from Japan (Japan: 39 incidents per year). He concludes his comparisons by considering the suggestion that the United States' violent history is the cause, but notes the similarly violent histories of Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom (68 incidents per year). Moore ends this segment with gun-related-deaths-per-year statistics of the following countries:

* Japan: 39 (0.030/100,000)
* Australia: 65 (0.292/100,000)
* United Kingdom: 68 (0.109/100,000)
* Canada: 165 (0.484/100,000)
* France: 255 (0.389/100,000)
* Germany: 381 (0.466/100,000)
* United States: 11,127 (3.601/100,000)

''[[The American Prospect]]'' published a piece by [[Garance Franke-Ruta]] criticizing the film for ignoring the role that [[Local government|municipal governance]] plays in crime in the United States, and ignoring [[African American|African-American]] urban victims of violence while focusing on the unusual events of Columbine. "A decline in murders in [[New York City]] alone—from 1,927 in 1993 to 643 in 2001—had, for example, a considerable impact on the declining national rate. Not a lot of those killers or victims were the sort of sports-hunters or militiamen Moore goes out of his way to interview and make fun of."&lt;ref&gt;Garance Franke-Ruta, [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=moores_the_pity Moore's the Pity], ''[[The American Prospect]]'', November 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kmart refund===
Moore takes two Columbine victims, Mark Taylor and Richard Castaldo (along with Brooks Brown, who remains unidentified during the segment), to the headquarters of American superstore [[Kmart]] in [[Troy, Michigan]], to claim a refund on the bullets still lodged in their bodies. After a number of attempts to evade the issue, a Kmart spokesperson says that the firm will change its policy and phase out the sale of handgun ammunition; this comes after Moore and the victims go to the nearest Kmart store in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]], purchase all of their ammunition, and return the next day with several members of the media. "We've won," says Moore, in disbelief. "That was more than we asked for."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/reviews/2002-10-25-sacra.php "I'm trying to connect the dots between the local violence and the global violence," says director Michael Moore of his new film, "Bowling for Columbine"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703233332/http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/reviews/2002-10-25-sacra.php |date=July 3, 2009 }}, ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'', October 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charlton Heston interview===
For the final scene of the film, Moore visits [[Charlton Heston]]'s home and asks to speak to him via the speakerbox in front of his gated home. Heston declines to speak to him at the time, but agrees to look at his schedule for the next day. Moore returns and first shows his NRA card, which Heston expresses pleasure at. They go inside the large property and sit down to discuss American firearm violence. Heston's response includes the suggestions that the United States has a "history of violence" and more "mixed ethnicity" than other countries. He also states that he doesn't believe that the United States is anymore violent than other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-10-18/entertainment/17566584_1_columbine-killings-columbine-high-school-nra-president-charlton-heston |title=Moore captures U.S. zeitgeist |author=Jonathan Curiel |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2002-10-18 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbiachronicle.com/back/2002_fall/2002-10-21/arts1.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729012201/http://www.columbiachronicle.com/back/2002_fall/2002-10-21/arts1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-29 |title=Moore puts gun culture in cross hairs |author=Chris Coates |publisher=The Columbia Chronicle |date=2002-10-21 |accessdate=2011-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore then asks Heston if he would like to apologize for leading NRA rallies in [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Michigan]] (Moore's hometown) after the [[Shooting of Kayla Rolland|shooting death of a six-year-old girl at Buell Elementary School]] and in Littleton after the Columbine shooting. Heston claims he didn't know about Kayla's death or how soon the rally was after it. When Moore presses to know if he would have cancelled the rally, he declines to answer and walks out of the interview. Moore implores him not to leave and asks him to look at a picture of Kayla. Heston turns around, but then turns back to continue his exit. Upon his exit, Moore leaves Kayla's picture outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bostonreview.net/BR28.3/stone.html |title=Cheap Shots |author=Alan A. Stone |publisher=[[Boston Review]] |date=Summer 2003 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore was later criticized by some for his perceived "ambush" of the actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title='9/11': Just the facts? |author=Ebert, Roger|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=2004-06-18 |page=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In memory of===
The film is dedicated to the memory of three people who all died in gun related circumstances:

* John Alberts, a sound designer and mixer for much of Moore's work. He had initially been hired to do the sound work on the film, but ended his life with a gun in January 2001.
* Herbert "Sluggo" Cleaves, Jr., the oldest child of two of Moore's closest friends. He was shot in the stomach in a [[drive-by shooting]] and died at an area hospital in February 2001.
* Laura Wilcox, a victim of handgun violence who was murdered in the [[2001 Nevada County shootings]]. Her death led to the implementation of [[Laura's Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~polfilm/student5/allen/dedications.htm|title=This film was dedicated to the following individuals |author=Sam Allen |publisher=Indiana University |date=2002 |accessdate=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
===Critical reception===
Reviews for the film were overwhelmingly positive, with a 96% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bowling_for_columbine/?critic=columns|title=Bowling for Columbine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "Certified Fresh".Another score aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average rating in the 0–100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated a score of 72 based on 32 reviews, signifying 'generally favorable reviews'. Michael Wilmington of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote, "It's unnerving, stimulating, likely to provoke anger and sorrow on both political sides&amp;mdash;and, above all, it's extremely funny."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/reviews/2002-10-18-metromix.php Bowling for Columbine : Reviews &amp; Acclaim : Articles &amp; Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021206171943/http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/reviews/2002-10-18-metromix.php |date=December 6, 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "The slippery logic, tendentious grandstanding, and outright [[Demagogy|demagoguery]] on display in ''Bowling for Columbine'' should be enough to give pause to its most ardent partisans, while its disquieting insights into the culture of violence in America should occasion sober reflection from those who would prefer to stop their ears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/11/movies/film-review-seeking-a-smoking-gun-in-us-violence.html|title=Film Review: Bowling for Columbine|first=A.O.|last=Scott|date=2002-10-11 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the film had its negative reviews. [[Desson Thomson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' thought that the film lacked a coherent message, asking "A lot of this is amusing and somehow telling. But what does it all add up to?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A40384-2002Oct17&amp;notFound=true | work=The Washington Post | title=Moore Shoots Himself In the Foot | first=Desson | last=Howe | date=2002-10-18 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MPAA rating===
The film was rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which means that children under the age 17 were not admitted to see the film theatrically unless under supervision. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] chastized the MPAA for this move as "banning teenagers from those films they most need to see".&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger (October 18, 2002). [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180303/1023 Bowling For Columbine]. rogerebert.com&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert had criticized the MPAA rating system on previous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703766704576009343432436296 |title=Getting Real About Movie Ratings|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2010-12-11 |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was noted for "some violent images and language".&lt;ref&gt;Turan, Kenneth (October 11, 2002). [http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/11/entertainment/et-kenny11 "'Columbine's' Aim Slightly Off"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gross revenue===
With a budget of $4 million, ''Bowling for Columbine'' grossed $58,008,423 worldwide, including $21,576,018 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;In nominal dollars, from 1982 to the present.&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary also broke box office records internationally, becoming the highest-grossing documentary in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Austria. These records were later eclipsed by Moore's next documentary, ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=documentary.htm|title=Documentary Movies at the Box Office - Box Office Mojo|website=www.boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore was both applauded and booed at the [[Academy Award]]s on March 23, 2003, when he used his acceptance speech as an opportunity to proclaim his opposition to the [[presidency of George W. Bush]] and the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|United States-led invasion of Iraq]], which had begun just a few days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/24/oscars2003.film|title=Chicago scoops six Oscars|date=2003-03-24 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|Scottish university student societies|the 19th-century Irish [[learned society]]|Irish Archaeological Society|the societal structure of the ancient Celts|Celts#Society}}

The term '''Celtic Society''' is used to refer to a type of student society at the four [[ancient universities of Scotland]], which were founded between the late 18th to mid-19th centuries in the wake of the [[Celtic Revival]] and [[Romanticism]] with the primary aim of supporting the practical and academic study of the [[Scottish Gaelic language]] and [[Gaels|culture]]. These societies are the oldest at their respective universities, and were instrumental in campaigning for the establishment of academic departments dedicated to Gaelic Studies.

'''[[St Andrews University]] Celtic Society''', founded 1796, was the first of these student societies. In the 20th century, as the other ancient universities began offering Gaelic as an academic subject, students with an interest in Gaelic chose to attend these instead. Consequently, the society at St Andrews shifted its focus towards [[Scottish country dance]], and is no longer related to the other three societies.

== List ==
The following three societies are extant and continue to promote Gaelic language and culture as their main objective, or as part of their main objective:
* Aberdeen University Celtic Society, founded 1854
* [[Edinburgh University Highland Society]], founded in 1851 (preceded by the ''Ossianic Society'', 1837-1848)
* Glasgow University Ossianic Society, founded 1831

== History ==
In August 2011, Sam Chaudhary and Liam Don moved to [[Palo Alto]], California, from the [[United Kingdom]] to launch ClassDojo after the startup was accepted in the first cohort of ImagineK12, a [[Y Combinator (company)|Y-combinator]] program and funding for education startups.&lt;ref name="phil"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cityam.com/article/insights-young-silicon-valley-startup | first = Philip | last = Salter | website = [[City A.M.]] | date = April 23, 2012 | title = Insights from a young Silicon Valley startup | accessdate = August 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 the company released a [[Development stage|beta version]] of the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://pando.com/2012/08/15/classdojo-raises-1-6m-announces-upcoming-iphone-and-ipad-apps/ | website = [[PandoDaily]] | accessdate = August 8, 2015 | first = Andrew | last = James | title = ClassDojo Raises $1.6M, Announces Upcoming iPhone and iPad Apps | date = August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year of launching, the platform had been used by 3.5 million teachers and students, in more than 30 countries.&lt;ref name="tech"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/15/classdojo-launch-seed-funding/ | website = [[TechCrunch]] | date = August 15, 2012 | accessdate = August 8, 2015 | last = Empson | first = Rip | title = ClassDojo Lands $1.6M From Paul Graham, Ron Conway To Help Teachers Control Their Classrooms }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paul"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/08/15/classdojo-announces-1-6m-seed-funding-rolls-student-behaviour-improvement-platform-beta/| website = [[TheNextWeb]] | first = Paul | last = Sawers | accessdate = August 8, 2015 | date = August 15, 2012 | title = ClassDojo taps $1.6m in seed funding, as its student behaviour-improvement platform rolls out of beta }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, ClassDojo announced it had raised $1.6 million of main [[Seed money|seed capital]] from [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]], SV Angel, [[SoftTech VC]],  [[Mitch Kapor]], Lerer Ventures, and [[General Catalyst Partners]].&lt;ref name="crunch"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/classdojo | website = [[Crunchbase]] | title = Crunchbase: ClassDojo | accessdate = August 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2012/08/15/funding-daily-watch-out-for-spies-and-ninjas/ | title = Funding Daily: watch out for spies and ninjas | date = August 15, 2012 | accessdate = August 8, 2015 | first = Rebecca | last = Grant | website = [[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, ClassDojo partnered with [[Stanford University|Stanford University's]] Project for Education Research That Scales (PERTS) lab, to release a five-part series of educational videos discussing  [[Mindset#Fixed mindset and growth mindset|growth mindset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-19-classdojo-s-critters-want-to-teach-you-about-growth-mindsets|title=ClassDojo's Critters Want to Teach You About Growth Mindsets|publisher=EdSurge News|first=Tony |last=Wan|date=January 19, 2016 |access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, it was reported that the series had been viewed by one of every four kids in American classrooms.&lt;ref name=quartz&gt;{{cite web|url= http://qz.com/791388/meet-mojo-a-monster-stanford-helped-create-to-teach-your-kids-that-effort-matters-more-than-iq/|title=Meet Mojo, The Monster Stanford and Harvard Are Using to Teach Your Kids "Growth Mindset" and Empathy|publisher=Quartz|first=Jenny|last=Anderson|date=September 27, 2016|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the platform added School Story, the update enables school administration and teachers to share school-related content to all parents connected to the school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eschoolnews.com/2016/04/18/classdojo-expands-beyond-classrooms-to-whole-school-sharing/|title=ClassDojo Moves Beyond Classrooms to Whole School Sharing|publisher=eSchool News|date=April 18, 2016|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Student Stories, a tool for students to manage their unique portfolios, interact with classmates and share their experiences with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2016/07/20/classdojo-launches-parental-engagement-tool.aspx|title=ClassDojo Launches Parental Engagement Tool|publisher=The Journal|first=Joshua|last=Bolkan|date=July 20, 2016|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, ClassDojo released a video series about empathy that it created in partnership with the Making Caring Common Project at [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]].&lt;ref name=quartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt; In May 2017, the company, in partnership with the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, released a mindfulness curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/05/08/mindfulness-schools/101447370/|title=Breathe Deeply: Mindfulness Coming to a School Near You|publisher=USA Today|first=Greg|last=Toppos|date=May 8, 2017|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hechingerreport.org/mindful-tech-tool-can-help/|title=Be Mindful: How a Tech Tool Can Help|publisher=The Hechinger Report|first=Nichole|last=Dobo|date=May 10, 2017|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In 2017, The London School of Economics, [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/parenting4digitalfuture/2017/01/04/classdojo-poses-data-protection-concerns-for-parents/ Parenting for a Digital Future] , published a series of ethical, legal and mental health concerns related to the rapid growth of ClassDojo's use in the classroom. In the article, Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Stirling, Ben Williamson and Alasdair Rutherford, write about the possible conflict that the ClassDojo Company could encounter as a private for-profit company collecting and storing sensitive student behavior data. They ask if parents are being fully informed about what the ClassDojo Company intends to do with the collected student data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/parenting4digitalfuture/2017/01/04/classdojo-poses-data-protection-concerns-for-parents/|title=ClassDojo poses data protection concerns for parents|date=2017-01-04|work=Parenting for a Digital Future|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Williamson and Rutherford warn of a scenario where the ClassDojo Company could be sold for the data it collects and stores.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Williamson and Rutherford also explore the possible negative impact ClassDojo could impose on the classroom environment where they claim ClassDojo essentially acts as a classroom social media application where students face constant competition for teacher awarded ClassDojo behavior points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They question whether the classroom time teachers spend on data input could potentially reduce critical face-to-face interaction between teachers and students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also warn of the possible negative impact the application can have on children's mental health potentially creating a distressed classroom climate where student behavior is individualized to dojo points discounting larger social and environmental influences on behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Williamson and Rutherford write that they believe when considering the serious concerns of student data protection and mental health, it is time for teachers and parents to have a transparent conversation regarding use of ClassDojo in the classroom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

She published several academic books dealing with her interests including ''Celestial Origin of Elpheta and Algarsyf in Chaucer's "Squire's Tale,"'' ''Melville's "Orienda"'' and ''[[The Matter of Araby in Medieval England]]''.

==Personal life==

Dorothee Metlitzki was born in 1914 in the city of [[Königsberg]], ([[East Prussia]])&lt;ref&gt;“Dorothee Metlitzki.” ''The Independent'', 7 May 2001. &lt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dorothee-metlitzki-729087.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  but soon moved to [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Russia]], where her father worked as an international banker who is still waiting to be repaid by the king of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb987008v1&amp;chunk.id=div00047&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text University of California: In Memoriam Dorothee Metlitzki]&lt;/ref&gt;
Her father was imprisoned during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] and her mother moved the rest of the family to [[Lithuania]], where her father rejoined them after his stay in prison.&lt;ref name="education.guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

Having left Lithuania for London following outbreaks of [[anti-semitism]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, Metlitzki became an active Zionist in England, working with fellow Zionists [[Aubrey Eban]], [[Golda Meir]] and [[Moshe Sharet]] on the development of the State of Israel. She moved to [[Jerusalem]] after [[World War II]] and spent 15 years there founding the English department at Hebrew University.&lt;ref name="yale.edu"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n28/story16.html Obituary. “Dorothee Metlitzki dies; scholar played role in Israel's founding.”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225021219/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v29.n28/story16.html |date=2015-02-25 }} ''Yale Bulletin &amp; Calendar'', 27 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within several months Kraus was found dead, alleged to have committed suicide. She remarried the Jewish [[Egyptologist]] [[Bernhard Grdseloff]] in 1945, and the couple had a daughter, Ruth. In 1947 Grdseloff developed cancer, and was hospitalized in Cairo, before the family was able to leave for Palestine, towards the establishment of the State of Israel. Dorothee spent the next years traveling between Israel and Egypt - then enemy states, and tending to her husband, till his death in a [[Cairo]] hospital in 1950.

In 1953, she moved to Connecticut with her sole daughter, and worked at Yale University. There she had a short marriage with the [[Assyrologist]] Jacob Finkelstein, moving after him to [[Berkeley, California]], but the two quickly parted, and she returned to Yale where she taught until her death.&lt;ref name="yale.edu"/&gt;

==Political and social activity==
In the late 1930s, Before the establishment of the state of [[Israel]], Metlitzki worked for advancing the Zionist movement, visiting various countries and speaking before Zionist women.

During the term of [[Golda Meir]] as [[Prime Minister of Israel]], Metlitzki worked in the government there as a press officer for the Foreign Ministry and secretary for the affairs of Arab women in the [[Histadrut|Israeli Federation of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Cary. “Dorothee Metlitzki, 86, Scholar Of Medievalism and Melville.” ''The New York Times'', 9 May 2001. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/arts/dorothee-metlitzki-86-scholar-of-medievalism-and-melville.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Using her knowledge of the Arabic language and culture, she served the Arab women, protecting their rights, with the vision of a bi-lingual bi-cultural state.

{{lowercase|title=eLearning Credits}}
'''eLearning Credits''' (or '''eLCs''') was a government initiative in the UK which put money aside for schools for [[multimedia]] resources. All government-funded schools from nursery to secondary are eligible for eLearning Credits.  The 2007–08 allocation was £1,000 for each maintained school and academy that directly provides nursery, primary or secondary education up to Key Stage 4 plus £3.42 for each pupil aged between 3 and 15. This was the final allocation of eLCs – ring-fenced funding via eLCs ceased at the end of August 2008.

ELC funding was '''not''' available for the purchase of hardware items such as computers, projectors and [[interactive whiteboard]]s. The funding was targeted to support the purchase of digital learning materials. There was a small allowance in the scheme that permits the inclusion of a small ineligible item such as a printed manual or small hardware item necessary for the effective delivery of the product in the classroom.

The only [[Microsoft]] product eligible under the scheme is [[Encarta]].

Elearning Credits have been rolled into the Harnessing Technology Grant which is being distributed to schools via Local Authorities. This is a capital grant and initial guidance seemed to indicate that subscription resources like www.educationcity.com may be precluded from it. However, after working with industry [[Becta|BECTA]] issued spending guidance that permitted the use of the fund for subscription resources.

==Biography==
Edna Meade Colson was born October 7, 1888 in Petersburg City, [[Virginia]]. She was the oldest of five children of prominent educators, James Major Colson and Kate Deaver Hill Colson.

She received her B.A. from [[Fisk University]] in 1915 and received a Ph.D. from Teachers College, [[Columbia University]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=LVA/&gt;

After overcoming her own obstacles to higher education, she became a champion of making graduate education available to African Americans. In 1937 Colson chaired the committee to implement the program offering graduate courses to African Americans at the [[Virginia State College for Negroes]].

Colson was also politically active beyond education. She was among the first women to register to vote after the ratification of the 19th Amendment, and she was the first African American woman to become a lifetime member of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].

Colson lived with her partner [[Amaza Lee Meredith]]. They occupied the house in Chesterfield County, Virginia named ''[[Azurest South]]'', which was designed by Meredith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|title=Azurest South|url=http://www.aahistoricsitesva.org/items/show/30?tour=13&amp;index=1|website=Virginia Foundation for the Humanities|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colson retired from [[Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=LVA/&gt; She died at the age of 96 in a Colonial Heights nursing home on January 17, 1985&lt;ref name="DVB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edna Meade Colson (7 October 1888–17 January 1985)|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/dvb/bio.asp?b=Colson_Edna_Meade|website=Dictionary of Virginia Biography|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was laid to rest at Eastview Cemetery, Petersburg City, Virginia alongside Meredith.&lt;ref name=Findagrave/&gt;

Documentation of events before 1990.

==Structure of education system==
The academic year is 33 weeks across all levels and is conducted in two semesters each consisting of 16–17 weeks.&lt;ref name="World Data on Education ed. 7"&gt;{{cite web|last=p7, World Data On Education |title=World Data On Education|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Lao_PDR.pdf|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below breaks down the ages of the students in the pre-primary, primary and secondary levels in the Laos education system.  
[[File:Education Structure (Laos).png|Education Structure in Laos from Pre-Primary till Secondary School]]

===Pre-school===

There are [[kindergartens]] that cater to children from 3 to 5 years old. However, attendance in pre-school is not compulsory. Hence there is a low enrollment rate of below 10% for both males and females.&lt;ref name="Education Statistics : Lao PDR"&gt;{{cite web|last=p1, Education Statistics : Lao PDR|title=Education Statistics : Lao PDR|url=http://www.childinfo.org/files/EAPR_Lao_PDR.pdf|publisher=UNICEF, Division of Policy and Practice, Statistics and Monitoring Section|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lao Students.jpg|thumb|A typical classroom setting in Laos]]

===Primary school===
There are 8,968 primary schools in [[Laos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Op. Cit|title=Education Statistics: Lao PDR`|url=http://www.childinfo.org/files/EAPR_Lao_PDR.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary school starts at the age of 6 and lasts for five years. This phase of education was made compulsory in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Article 22|title=Constitution of Lao PDR|url=http://www.la.emb-japan.go.jp/jp/laos/Constitution.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new law did not boost enrollment rate. It has stagnated since year 2000 with slight increase for female enrollment.&lt;ref name="Education Statistics : Lao PDR"/&gt; [[Lao language]], mathematics and physical education are some of the lessons conducted in a primary school. Students are given quizzes, tests and exams periodically and achieve a certificate after sitting for primary leaving examination.

===Secondary school===
There are an estimated 1,000 formal secondary schools established in Laos.&lt;ref name="Opportunity for all, Room to Read Laos: School Visit November 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opportunity for all, Room to Read Laos|url=http://www.opportunity-for-all.com/News/LaosSchoolsNov2011/LaosSchoolsNov2011.html|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition rate from primary to secondary is estimated to be 77.6%.&lt;ref name="World Data On Education"&gt;{{cite web|last=pg 10 Op. Cit.|title=World Data on Education|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Lao_PDR.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondary school is branched into lower-secondary and upper-secondary. Before 2009, lower- and upper-secondary each lasted three years. It is now four years of lower secondary and three years of upper-secondary. Upper secondary is open to students who pass the lower secondary examinations. Thereafter, it is further divided into general, technical, vocational and primary school. Secondary education is legally free-of-charge, though the schools charge a registration fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=p13 Op. Cit|title=World Data on Education |url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Lao_PDR.pdf|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education===
Higher education can be attained from [[National University of Laos]] (NUOL), private institutions and teacher training colleges. Qualifications on offer include diploma, Bachelor’s degree, Master’s degree and Doctoral.

====[[National University of Laos]]====

In 1975, the Sisavangvong University was dissolved following the departure of many teaching staff. Upper secondary graduates had to seek higher education in Eastern Europe and the USSR.&lt;ref name="Education, Lao Cultural Profile"&gt;{{cite web|last=Education, Lao Cultural Profile|title=Education, Lao Cultural Profile|url=http://www.culturalprofiles.net/laos/directories/laos_cultural_profile/-29.html|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, UNOL was set up to provide higher education for Laotian. It now comprises 11 faculties: Architecture, Engineering, Economics and Business Management, Environment, Law and Political Science, Agriculture, Education, Forestry, Letters, Sciences and Social Science.&lt;ref name="Faculties, National University of Laos"&gt;{{cite web|last=Faculties, National University of Laos |title=Faculties, National University of Laos|url=http://www.nuol.edu.la/index.php/en/faculty.html|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, they had 26,673 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibid. |title=Faculties, National University of Laos|url=http://www.nuol.edu.la/index.php/en/faculty.html|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems in Laos' education system==
[[File:Repetition Rates in Primary School.png|Enrollment of primary school children]]

Accessibility to education in Laos is low, and this is a major problem. Only 50% of the primary schools offer full education up to Grade 5.&lt;ref name="The World Bank, Improving Primary Education for poor children in Lao PDR, July 2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=The World Bank, Improving Primary Education for poor children in Lao PDR, July 2011|title=The World Bank, Improving Primary Education for children in Lao PDR, July 2011|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/LAOPRDEXTN/0,,contentMDK:22943011~menuPK:293703~pagePK:2865066~piPK:2865079~theSitePK:293684,00.html|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the students are poor and are deterred from attending school by the costly daily transport (due to the lack of boarding facilities) as well as the opportunity cost of not working.&lt;ref name="Education in Laos, 2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Education in Laos, 2000|title=Education in Laos, 2000|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/wef/countryreports/laos/rapport_2_2.html|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, up to 30% of primary school teachers are unqualified to teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Op. Cit|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Lao_PDR.pdf|accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hinders school progression and takes up to 10 years to produce a primary school graduate (refer to graph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=pg 11, Op. Cit.|title=World Data on Education|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Lao_PDR.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequality sets in through the years. It is almost non-existent in pre-school but reaches to more than 10% by lower secondary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=pg 12, Ibid.|title= World Data on Education |url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/WDE/2010/pdf-versions/Lao_PDR.pdf |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nepal map.png|thumb|alt=Map of Nepal|Nepal's location relative to its neighbors, China and India]]
'''Education in Nepal''' was long based on [[home-schooling]] and ''[[gurukula]]s''.&lt;ref name="IIJSTR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/july2013/Performance-Of-Community-Schools-In-Nepal-A-Macro-Level-Analysis.pdf | title=Performance Of Community Schools In Nepal : A Macro Level Analysis | publisher=[[International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research]] | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Deepak Raj Parajuli , Tapash Das}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first formal school (Durbar School), established by Jung Bahadur Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. The birth of [[Nepalese democracy]] [[Revolution of 1951|in 1951]] opened its classrooms to a more diverse population.&lt;ref name="IIJSTR"/&gt;
Education in Nepal from the primary school to the university level has been modeled from the very inception on the [[Education in India|Indian system]], which is in turn the legacy of the old [[British Raj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.educatenepal.com/education_system/display/education-system-in-nepal |title=Education System in Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nepal's 1971 education plan hastened its development in the country.&lt;ref name="IIJSTR"/&gt; In 1951 Nepal had 10,000 students in 300 schools and an adult literacy rate of five percent.&lt;ref name="IIJSTR"/&gt; There were 49,000 schools in 2010,&lt;ref name="IIJSTR" /&gt; and by 2015 the overall adult literacy rate was 63.9 percent (males 76.4 percent and females 53.1&amp;nbsp;percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html#np|title=CIA world Fact book|last=|first=|date=2015|website=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has already been more than half decade that public schools started imparting the education in the country. Curriculum developed in the country is not oriented towards
the practical education.  Public schools
are criticized for not being able to provide quality education. Lower-caste discrimination, and indigenous bias are now the primary barriers to equitable access to education. After thorough review
of secondary literature, analysis through macro perspective under the influence of critical pedagogy it is  found lack of physical and infrastructures,
textbooks, centralized curriculum, monolingual instructional, lack of constructive and critical pedagogical strategies, poverty and social exclusion are the
major factors contributing for poor performance.&lt;ref name="IIJSTR"/&gt;

==Administration==
[[File:Nepali-School-Uniform.JPG|thumb|alt=Uniformed schoolchildren with an adult, possibly their teacher|Schoolchildren in [[Kathmandu]]]]
The Ministry of Education is responsible for managing educational activities in Nepal. The Minister of Education (assisted by the state or assistant minister) is the political leader of the ministry. The ministry, as a part of the government, is headed by the Secretary of Education and consists of the central office and other offices at the regional and district levels. Its central office is primarily responsible for policy development, planning, monitoring, and evaluation.

The ministry has established directorates in each of the five development regions and education offices in each of Nepal's 75 districts to bring educational administration to the people. These decentralized offices are responsible for overseeing local informal and school-level educational activities. Regional directorates are primarily responsible for coordinating, monitoring and evaluating educational activities, and the district education offices provide services.

The National Center for Educational Development (NCED) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nced.gov.np/index.php?option=Home|title=National Center for Educational Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is Nepal's teacher-training body. It has 34 educational training centers (ETCs) to provide pedagogical support for teachers.

Nepal has two primary types of schools: community and institutional. Community (public) schools receive government grants, and institutional (private) schools are self-funded. Institutional schools are non-profit trusts or companies.

With one exception, all universities and [[Academy (educational institution)|academies]] are publicly managed and supported by public funding. Public universities also provide affiliation to private colleges. Academies of higher education are typically single-college institutes, and universities have constituent and affiliated colleges across Nepal.

==Structure==
[[File:Nepalese school.jpg|thumb|250 px|alt=Teacher in Nepalese dress and a group of uniformed schoolchildren of different ages|Teacher and schoolchildren in [[Pokhara]]]]
Primary education in Nepal consists of grades one through five. Lower secondary levels are grades six through eight, and secondary levels cover grades nine and ten. Pre-primary education is available in some areas, and students usually begin grade one at age six. A national [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|School Leaving Certificate]] (SLC) examination was conducted at the end of grade 10; according to the new Education Act, the national grade-12 examination will result in an SLC; the grade-10 examination will be known as the Secondary Education Examination (SEE).

Grades 11 and 12 are considered the higher secondary level. The Higher Secondary Education Board (HSEB) supervises higher secondary schools, most of which are private. These grades had been controlled by the university system, and awarded proficiency certificates. Although some universities still offer these programs, most of these grades are now part of the school system. 

Higher education consists of bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. levels. Depending upon the educational stream and subject, a bachelor's degree may require three to five years of study; two years is the typical course. Some universities offer [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil.]] and post-graduate diplomas.

[[Vocational education]] begins after lower secondary education, and students can follow a two-year curriculum leading to a Technical School Leaving Certificate.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/wtdb/worldtvetdatabase_npl_en.pdf | title=World TVET Database Nepal - Vocational Education in Nepal | publisher=[[UNESCO-UNEVOC]] / Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training Nepal| accessdate=March 18, 2018 | date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universities also offer professional and technical degrees. In addition to the formal track, one-year programs focusing on skills development are also available.&lt;ref name="UNEVOC"/&gt; The [[District Level Examination]] is given in grade eight. The new educational system has two levels: basic (grades one through eight) and secondary (grades nine through twelve).

=={{anchor|Marginalization, Crises, and Illiteracy}}Crises and illiteracy==
Although the [[Chitwan District]] was declared 100% literate in 2014, many children in remote villages do not have access to education past the primary level.&lt;ref name="ktmpostprimary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2015-12-20/children-in-chitwan-deprived-of-education-past-primary-level.html|title=Kathmandu Post- Children in Chitwan deprived of education past primary level|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chepang people]] have been called the "poorest of the poor" (in Nepal) by sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;Beine, Caughley and Shrestha. 2012. ''[http://www.blurb.com/b/3218442-chepang-then-and-now Chepang Then and Now: Life and Change Among the Chepang of Nepal]''. [[Blurb Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Students often leave primary schools after they learn to read and write, but without additional education these skills may be forgotten.&lt;ref name="ktmpostprimary"/&gt; The [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|April 2015 earthquake]] and [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 blockade]] destroyed schools and severely impacted the nation's ability to keep its remaining schools open.

==Textbooks==
[[File:Nepalese Children.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Nepalese Children [[Used book|secondhanded textbook]] at their home]]
Government schools use Janak textbooks, and private schools use reference books such as Ekta, Read More, Reliant, Asia, and Vidyarthi. Government schools perform poorly in the [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|SLC]] exam, presently [[Secondary Education Examination (Nepal)|SEE]] exam, due to the lack of skilled teachers, textbooks, and neglect by the Ministry of Education of textbook reform.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Tertiary Education==
{{See also|List of universities and colleges in Nepal}}

==={{anchor|University}}Universities===
Nepal's first college was [[Tri-Chandra College]], founded in 1918. Until 1985, [[Tribhuvan University]] was the country's only university. During the early 1980s, the government developed the concept of a multi-university system in which each school would have its own nature, content, and function.

The first new university was [[Mahendra Sanskrit University]]. It was followed by [[Kathmandu University]] (the first private university) in 1990 and [[Purbanchal University|Purbanchal]] and [[Pokhara University|Pokhara]] Universities in 1995 and 1996, respectively.

==={{anchor|Medical Colleges}}Medical colleges===
Medical colleges, mostly private, exist throughout Nepal. Local students are admitted after an entrance exam, and foreign students are admitted after an interview. To be eligible for admission to [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]] courses in Nepal’s medical colleges, students must pass the higher secondary examination in science or its equivalent.
Medical education is regulated by the Medical Council of Nepal. In addition to accrediting the country's medical colleges, the council conducts the licensing examination for new doctors, makes policies related to curriculum, admission, terms and examinations and makes registration recommendations.

==={{anchor|Engineering Colleges}}Engineering colleges===
Engineering colleges also exist throughout Nepal, with most admitting local students through an entrance exam. Like the country's medical colleges, foreign students are admitted after an interview. To be eligible for admission to Nepalese engineering colleges, candidates are encouraged to pass the Intermediate in Science or have a diploma in engineering (or its equivalent).

The Institute of Engineering of Tribhuvan University is the country's oldest engineering school. It has four colleges, and 13 private engineering colleges are affiliated with it. The IOE's central campus is Pulchowk Campus, considered to the best engineering college in Nepal.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Pulchowk offers bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. degrees in engineering.  More than 16,000 students from around the world take the school's entrance examination.{{cn|date=July 2017}}  

Nepal Engineering College (NEC) in [[Changunarayan]] is the country's first private engineering college to offer bachelor's- and master's-level courses. Popular engineering fields in Nepal are architecture, civil engineering, computer engineering, electronics and communications, electrical and electronics, energy and rural engineering. The [[Bachelor of Engineering|B.E.]] architecture courses take five years to complete, and other bachelor's-degree courses take four years.

=={{anchor|Human capital flight in Nepal}}Study abroad==
Nepal ranks 11th in countries of origin for international students in the United States. According to "Open Doors 2009", the annual report on international academic mobility published by the [[Institute of International Education]] with support from the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of State]], the number of Nepali students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education increased from 8,936 in the 2007–08 academic year to 11,581 in 2008–09 (a 29.6-percent increase). In the 2006–07 academic year, Nepal ranked 13th among countries of origin of international students.

According to Terry J. White, counselor for public affairs at the [[U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu]], "America's nearly 3,000 accredited schools of higher education continue to attract new students in what is becoming a highly competitive international 'market' around the world."{{cn|date=July 2017}} The U.S. is the preferred destination for students from Nepal who want to study abroad because of the quality and prestige associated with an American degree. Another contributing factor is access to comprehensive, accurate information about study in the U.S. through [[EducationUSA]] offices in Nepal and increased activity by United States colleges and universities to attract students from Nepal. However, "a culture of disrespect" for humble Nepalese by U.S. Embassy staff has been reported by a co-founder of Nepali/American NGO, [[Possible Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/culture-of-disrespect-plagues-us-embassy-in-nepal_us_59816848e4b02be325be0234 | title=Culture of Disrespect Plagues US Embassy in Nepal | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=August 2, 2017 | accessdate=March 18, 2018 | author=Maru, Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning is considered one of the founders of [[Lindy Hop]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
Manning was born in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in 1914. After his parents separated, at the age of 3 he moved to [[Harlem]] with his mother, who was a dancer.

Manning began dancing as a child. Manning's mother sent him to spend summers with his father, aunt and grandmother on their farm in [[Aiken, South Carolina]].  On Saturdays, farmhands and locals would come to the farm to play music on the front porch with [[harmonica]]s and a [[washtub bass]]. Manning's grandmother encouraged the bashful boy to get out in the yard and dance with the others.  Once he got in the dance circle, he developed a feel for dancing and did not want to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop|last=By Frankie Manning, Cynthia R. Millman|first=|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in New York, he started attending the dances at the Renaissance Ballroom in 1927 after his mother invited him to help her decorate the ballroom for a [[Halloween]] dance and promised to take him to the 9:00 dance that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop|last=Frankie Manning, Cynthia R. Millman|first=|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=25, 26, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching from the balcony, he was surprised to see his mother dancing formal ballroom styles such as [[foxtrot]] and [[waltz]], having only seen her dance before in a much looser and casual style at neighborhood [[rent party|rent parties]]. He danced with his mother later that night and she told him afterwards that "Frankie, you'll never be a dancer, because you're too stiff."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop|last=Frankie Manning, Cynthia R. Millman|first=|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=26, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning really loved his mother and wanted to do things to please her, so that is why he wanted to learn how to dance. He started listening to records on a [[Victrola]] in his bedroom and would practice dancing with a broom or a chair trying to get "un-stiff".  When he was older, he started going to Harlem's [[Savoy Ballroom]], which was for better dancers, and was also the only integrated ballroom in New York. He frequented the Savoy in the 1930s, eventually becoming a dancer in the elite and prestigious "Kat's Corner," a corner of the dance floor where impromptu exhibitions and competitions took place. During a dance contest in 1935, Manning and his partner, Frieda Washington, performed the first [[aerial (dance move)|aerial]] in a [[swing (dance)|swing]] dance competition against [[George Snowden|George "Shorty" Snowden]], the inventor of the term [[Lindy Hop]], and his partner, Big Bea, at the Savoy Ballroom. The airstep he performed was a "back to back roll" and was danced while [[Chick Webb]] played "Down South Camp Meeting," which was Manning's request after having heard the song earlier in the evening. The airstep went flawlessly to the music and astonished the more than 2,000 audience members.

===Career===
In 1935, Herbert White organized the top Savoy Ballroom lindy hop dancers into a professional performance group that was eventually named [[Whitey's Lindy Hoppers]].  Manning created the troupe's first ensemble Lindy Hop routines and functioned as the group's ''de facto'' choreographer, although without that title.  The troupe toured extensively and made several films. While with Whitey's, Manning also danced with [[Norma Miller]], who became known as the Queen of Swing. Whitey's Lindy Hoppers disbanded around [[World War II]] when many of the male dancers entered the armed forces. Manning himself served in the [[U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/lindy-hop-great-frankie-manning-dies-94-article-1.363298 |title=Lindy Hop great Frankie Manning dies at 94 |author=Hinkley, David |date=April 27, 2009 |work=Daily News |location=New York |access-date=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, in 1947, Manning created a small performance group called the [[Congaroos]]. When the Congaroos disbanded in 1955, Manning quietly settled into a career with the [[United States Postal Service]]. Some 30 years later, Manning started his second career in dancing: travelling the world as a renowned instructor and inspirator.

===Revival===
In 1982, [[Al Minns]], a former member of Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, started to teach Lindy Hop at the Sandra Cameron Dance Center, where he introduced a new generation of dancers to the Lindy Hop. Before he died in 1985, he told his students that Manning, another surviving member of Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, also lived in New York City.

In 1986, dancers Erin Stevens and Steven Mitchell contacted Manning and asked him to teach them the Lindy Hop. Manning at first declined, before finally agreeing to meet with them; he was skeptical that a much younger generation would really be interested in swing or Lindy. However, Mitchell and Stevens returned to California and helped to spread Lindy Hop to the West Coast and other areas of the U.S.  Thus, the swing revival began. That same year, Lennart Westerlund contacted Manning and invited him to Sweden to work with [[The Rhythm Hot Shots]]. Manning traveled to Sweden in 1987 and returned there every year from 1989 onward to teach at the [[Herräng Dance Camp]].

===Later years===
Once the swing dance and Lindy Hop revival took hold during the late 1980s, Manning taught Lindy Hop to eager devotees around the world, occasionally appearing with [[Norma Miller]]. Sometimes, dance workshops returned him to places he had not been in decades. For example, Manning first visited [[Melbourne, Australia]] in 1939 to perform at the [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne|Princess Theatre]]. The [[swing revival]] and Melbourne's Swing Patrol, brought him back again in 2002; it was his first visit to Melbourne in 63 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://mel.swingpatrol.com/resource/frankie-melbourne-1939/&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 75, Manning co-choreographed the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] musical [[Black and Blue (musical)|''Black and Blue'']], for which he received a 1989 [[Tony Award]]. In 2000, he was a recipient of a [[National Heritage Fellowship]] from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arts.gov/honors/heritage/year/2000 |title=NEA National Heritage Fellowships 2000 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;  |website=www.arts.gov |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning's [[autobiography]], ''Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop'', written with co-author Cynthia R. Millman, was published by [[Temple University Press]] in May 2007. It contains a collection of stories about the early days of [[swing (dance)|swing]] dancing, Manning's years performing with [[Whitey's Lindy Hoppers]], his experiences during [[World War II]], and his post-war dance troupe, the [[Congaroos]]. The book also recounts his experiences of the revival of swing dancing that began in the mid-1980s, and the two decades following.&lt;ref name=ambassador&gt;{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Frankie |author2=Cynthia R. Millman |title=Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop |year=2007 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=1-59213-563-3 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning's annual birthday celebrations attracted dancers and instructors from all over the world. His 80th birthday, in 1994, was commemorated by a weekend-long celebration in [[New York City]]; his 85th culminated in a sold-out party at New York's [[Roseland Ballroom]], where a pair of his dance shoes were placed in a showcase along with those of dancers such as [[Fred Astaire]]. For his 86th birthday, a huge gala was held in Tokyo in his honor, which included workshops taught by the maestro himself; the climax of the festivities featured a live orchestra.  Manning drew a huge crowd of Japanese and foreign expatriate swing enthusiasts for this memorable occasion.  Dedicated cruises were organized for his 89th and 90th birthdays; for his birthday dances, Manning followed his custom of dancing with one woman for every year of his life, partnering 89 and 90 women, respectively, in succession.

===Death===
A resident of [[Corona, Queens]], Manning died in [[Manhattan]] on April 27, 2009, aged 94.&lt;ref name=NYTObit /&gt;

He is interred in the Hillcrest Plot at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[Bronx]], New York.

==Legacy==
Before his death in April 2009, Manning had been planning to celebrate his 95th birthday in May 2009 in New York City at a special Lindy Hop dance event over Memorial Day weekend.  The event, commonly referred to as Frankie Fest or Frankie 95, proceeded without him but in his memory and gathered dancers and instructors from around the world.  In anticipation of the event, dance groups from all over the globe posted more than 160 videos to [[YouTube]] of local performances of the [[Shim Sham]] (a swing line dance long associated with Manning) as well as many videos of a Savoy-style routine choreographed especially for the Frankie 95 celebration by noted swing dancer and Lindy instructor Peter Strom. On Sunday of Frankie 95, attendees attempted to set three [[Guinness world records]] in [[Central Park]], including one for the greatest number of people dancing the Shim Sham simultaneously in one place.

Proceeds from the five-day Frankie 95 celebration were used to create a Frankie Manning Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frankie95.com/ |title=Frankie's 95th Birthday Festival |publisher=Frankie95.com |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222221445/http://www.frankie95.com/ |archivedate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;!--Exists on https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.frankie95.com/ but need version that mentions the foundation--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning was inducted into the [[National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame|National Museum of Dance's Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

On July 4, 2012, a road in the village of [[Herräng]], Sweden, was named after Manning,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yehoodi.com/comment/174679/local-road-renamed-frankie-man-2/ "Local Road Renamed "Frankie Manning Street" in Herrang", Yehoodi.com, July 4, 2012.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417090451/http://yehoodi.com/comment/174679/local-road-renamed-frankie-man-2/ |date=April 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a gift from the municipality of [[Norrtälje]] for the 30-year jubilee of [[Herräng Dance Camp]].

'''Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel''' or '''Froebel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈaʊɡʊst ˈfʁøːbl̩|lang|GT Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel.ogg}}; 21 April 1782 – 21 June 1852) was a German [[pedagogue]], a student of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]], who laid the foundation for modern education based on the recognition that children have unique needs and capabilities. He created the concept of the "[[kindergarten]]" and coined the word, which soon entered the English language as well. He also developed the educational toys known as [[Froebel gifts]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Fröbelhaus.jpg|thumb|left|House in Oberweißbach where Friedrich Fröbel was born]]
Friedrich Fröbel was born at [[Oberweißbach]] in the Principality of [[Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt]] in [[Thuringia]]. A cousin of his was the mother of [[Henriette Schrader-Breymann]], and Henriette became a student of his.&lt;ref name="froebelweb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.froebelweb.org/images/niece.html|title=Henriette Schrader-Breymann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fröbel's father, who died in 1802, was the pastor of the orthodox [[Lutheran]] (alt-lutherisch) parish there. The church and Lutheran Christian faith were pillars in Fröbel's own early education. Oberweißbach was a wealthy village in the Thuringian Forest and had been known centuries long for its natural herb remedies, tinctures, bitters, soaps and salves. Families had their own inherited areas of the forest where herbs and roots were grown and harvested. Each family prepared, bottled, and produced their individual products which were taken throughout Europe on trade routes passed from father to son, who were affectionately called "Buckelapotheker" or ''Rucksack Pharmacists''. They adorned the church with art acquired from their travels, many pieces of which can still be seen in the renovated structure. The pulpit from which Fröbel heard his father preach is the largest in all Europe and can fit a pastor and 12 people, a direct reference to Christ's apostles.

Shortly after Fröbel's birth, his mother's health began to fail. She died when he was nine months old, profoundly influencing his life. In 1792, Fröbel went to live in the small town of [[Stadtilm|Stadt-Ilm]] with his uncle, a gentle and affectionate man. At the age of 15 Fröbel, who loved nature, became the apprentice to a forester. In 1799, he decided to leave his apprenticeship and study [[mathematics]] and [[botany]] in [[Jena]]. From 1802 to 1805, he worked as a [[Surveying|land surveyor]].

On 11 September 1818, Fröbel wed Wilhelmine Henriette Hoffmeister (b. 1780) in [[Berlin]]. The union was childless. Wilhelmine died in 1839, and Fröbel married again in 1851. His second wife was Louise Levin.

===Career===
He began as an educator in 1805 at the ''Musterschule'' (a secondary school) in [[Frankfurt]], where he learned about [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]'s ideas. He later worked with Pestalozzi in [[Switzerland]] where his ideas further developed. From 1806 Fröbel was the live-in teacher for a Frankfurt noble family's three sons. He lived with the three children from 1808 to 1810 at Pestalozzi's institute in [[Yverdon-les-Bains]] in Switzerland.

In 1811, Fröbel once again went back to school in [[Göttingen]] and Berlin, eventually leaving without earning a certificate. He became a teacher at the ''Plamannsche Schule'' in Berlin, a [[boarding school]] for boys, and at that time also a pedagogical and patriotic centre.

[[Image:Unterhaus keilhau.jpg|thumb|Allgemeine Deutsche Erziehungsanstalt in [[Rudolstadt|Keilhau]], nowadays the Keilhau Free Fröbel School]]
During his service in the [[Lützow Free Corps]] in 1813 and 1814 – when he was involved in two campaigns against [[Napoleon]] – Fröbel befriended Wilhelm Middendorf, a theologian and fellow pedagogue, and Heinrich Langethal, also a pedagogue. After [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], Fröbel found himself a civilian once again and became an assistant at the Museum of Mineralogy under [[Christian Samuel Weiss]]. This did not, however, last very long, and by 1816 he had quit and founded the ''Allgemeine Deutsche Erziehungsanstalt'' (German General Education Institute) in [[Ilmtal|Griesheim]] near [[Arnstadt]] in Thuringia. A year later he moved it to Keilhau near [[Rudolstadt]]. In 1831, work was continued there by the other cofounders Wilhelm Middendorf and Heinrich Langethal.

In 1820, Fröbel published the first of his five Keilhau pamphlets, ''An unser deutsches Volk'' (To Our German People). The other four were published between then and 1823.

In 1826 he published his main literary work, ''Die Menschenerziehung'' (The Education of Man) and founded the weekly publication ''Die erziehenden Familien'' (The Educating Families). In 1828 and 1829 he pursued plans for a people's education institute (''Volkserziehungsanstalt'') in Helba (nowadays a constituent community of [[Meiningen]]), but they were never realized.

From 1831 to 1836, Fröbel once again lived in Switzerland. In 1831 he founded an educational institute in Wartensee ([[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]). In 1833 he moved this to [[Willisau]], and from 1835 to 1836, he headed the [[orphanage]] in [[Burgdorf, Switzerland|Burgdorf]] ([[Canton of Berne|Berne]]), where he also published the magazine ''Grundzüge der Menschenerziehung'' (Features of Human Education). In 1836 appeared his work ''Erneuerung des Lebens erfordert das neue Jahr 1836'' (The New Year 1836 Calls For the Renewal of Life).

He returned to Germany, dedicated himself almost exclusively to preschool child education and began manufacturing playing materials in Bad Blankenburg. In 1837 he founded a ''care, playing and activity institute for small children'' in Bad Blankenburg. From 1838 to 1840 he also published the magazine ''Ein Sonntagsblatt für Gleichgesinnte'' (A Sunday Paper for the Like-Minded).

In 1840 he coined the word [[kindergarten]] for the Play and Activity Institute he had founded in 1837 at [[Bad Blankenburg]] for young children, together with Wilhelm Middendorf and Heinrich Langethal. These two men were Fröbel's most faithful colleagues when his ideas were also transplanted to Keilhau near Rudolstadt.

He designed the educational play materials known as [[Froebel Gifts]], or ''Fröbelgaben'', which included geometric building blocks and pattern activity blocks. A book entitled ''Inventing Kindergarten'', by Norman Brosterman, examines the influence of Friedrich Fröbel on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[modern art]].

Friedrich Fröbel's great insight was to recognise the importance of the activity of the child in [[learning]]. He introduced the concept of "free work" ''(Freiarbeit)'' into [[pedagogy]] and established the "game" as the typical form that life took in childhood, and also the game's educational worth. Activities in the first kindergarten included [[singing]], [[dancing]], [[gardening]] and self-directed play with the Froebel Gifts. Fröbel intended, with his ''[[:de:Mutter- und Koselieder|Mutter- und Koselieder]]'' – a songbook that he published – to introduce the young child into the adult world.

These ideas about childhood development and education were introduced to academic and royal circles through the tireless efforts of his greatest proponent, the Baroness (Freiherrin) [[Bertha von Marenholtz-Bülow|Bertha Marie von Marenholtz-Bülow]]. Through her Fröbel made the acquaintance of the Royal House of the Netherlands, various Thuringian dukes and duchesses, including the Romanov wife of the Grand Duke von Sachsen-Weimar. Baroness von Marenholtz-Bülow, Duke von Meiningen and Fröbel gathered donations to support art education for children in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Goethe]]. The Duke of Meiningen granted the use of his hunting lodge, called Marienthal (Vale of Mary) in the resort town of [[Bad Liebenstein]] for Fröbel to train the first women as Kindergarten teachers ''(Kindergärtnerinnen)''.

Fröbel died on 21 June 1852 in Marienthal, now a constituent community of [[Schweina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.froebelweb.de/index.php/biogr.html Fröbel's biography]&lt;/ref&gt; His grave can still be found in the cemetery at Schweina, where his widow, who died in [[Hamburg]], was also buried on 10 January 1900.

==Legacy==
[[Image:Fröbeldenkmal.jpg|thumb|upright|The Fröbel Memorial at the Fröbel Kindergarten in Mühlhausen, Thuringia shows the pedagogical basic forms.]]
[[Image:Fröbelturm.jpg|thumb|left|''Fröbelturm'' near Oberweißbach]]
Fröbel’s idea of the kindergarten found appeal, but its spread in Germany was thwarted by the [[Prussia]]n government, whose education ministry banned it on 7 August 1851 as "atheistic and demagogic" for its alleged "destructive tendencies in the areas of religion and politics". Other states followed suit. The reason for the ban, however, seems to have been a confusion of names. Fröbel's nephew Karl Fröbel had written and published ''Weibliche Hochschulen und Kindergärten'' (Female Colleges and Kindergartens), which apparently met with some disapproval. To quote [[Karl August Varnhagen von Ense]], "The stupid minister (Karl Otto) von Raumer has decreed a ban on kindergartens, basing himself on a book by Karl Fröbel. He is confusing Friedrich and Karl Fröbel."

Fröbel's student [[Margarethe Schurz]] founded the first kindergarten in the [[United States]] at [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] in 1856, and she also inspired [[Elizabeth Peabody]], who went on to found the first English-speaking kindergarten in the United States – the language at Schurz’s kindergarten had been German, to serve an immigrant community – in [[Boston]] in 1860. This paved the way for the concept's spread in the USA. The German émigré Adolph Douai had also founded a kindergarten in Boston in 1859, but had to close it after only a year. By 1866, however, he was founding others in [[New York City]].

The pedagogue August Köhler was the initiator and cofounder in 1863 of the ''Deutscher Fröbelverein'' (German Fröbel Association), first for Thuringia, out of which grew the ''Allgemeiner Fröbelverein'' (General Fröbel Association) in 1872, and a year later the ''Deutscher Fröbelverband'' (German Fröbel Federation). August Köhler critically analyzed and evaluated Fröbel theory, adopted fundamental notions into his own kindergarten pedagogy and expanded on these, developing an independent "Köhler Kindergarten Pedagogy". He first trained kindergarten teachers in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] in 1857. In the beginning, Köhler had thought to engage male educators exclusively, but far too few applied.

Thekla Naveau founded in October 1853 the first kindergarten in [[Sondershausen]] and on 1 April 1867 the first kindergarten after the Prussian ban was lifted in [[Nordhausen]]. Angelika Hartmann founded in 1864 the first kindergarten after Fröbel’s model in [[Köthen (Anhalt)|Köthen]], Anhalt. In 1908 and 1911, kindergarten teacher training was recognized in Germany through state regulatory laws.

In the meantime, there are many kindergartens in Germany named after Fröbel that continue his method. Many have sprung from parental or other private initiatives. The biggest Fröbel association, ''Fröbel e.V.'', today runs more than 100 kindergartens and other early childhood institutions throughout the country through the ''Fröbel-Gruppe''.

[[File:2010-05 terborg froebelhuuske.JPG|thumb|In the Netherlands, ''fröbelen'' means to be busy with arts and crafts. Here a shop in [[Terborg]].]]
Committed to Fröbel's legacy is also the ''Neuer Thüringer Fröbelverein'' (NTFV; New Thuringian Fröbel Association), and in particular to protecting the legacy's business receipts. As well, the Association runs a school museum and the Fröbel Archive in Keilhau. Furthermore, it engages itself in Fröbel institutions worldwide (United States, [[United Kingdom]], [[Japan]]). Through this network, the NTFV further continues one of the most prominent lines of modern pedagogy from the authentic "Fröbel town" of Keilhau. The Fröbel Diploma, now conferred by the Fröbel Academy in Nordhausen, can also be traced back to the NTFV. All this ensures that Fröbel’s ideas will live on into the future.

Fröbel's building forms and movement games are also forerunners of [[abstract art]] as well as a source of inspiration to the [[Bauhaus]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick M. Logan, ''Kindergarten and Bauhaus'', College Art Journal, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Autumn, 1950), pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; In Fröbel’s honour, [[Walter Gropius]] designed the ''Friedrich Fröbel Haus''.

In 1892 followers of Fröbel established a college of teacher education in South West London to continue his traditions. [[Froebel College]] is now a constituent college of [[Roehampton University]] and is home to the university's department of education. The University of Roehampton Library is also home to the Froebel Archive for Childhood Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://studentzone.roehampton.ac.uk/library/specialcollectionsandarchives/froebelarchiveforchildhoodstudies/ |title=Froebel Archive for Childhood Studies |publisher=Studentzone.roehampton.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718031222/http://studentzone.roehampton.ac.uk/library/specialcollectionsandarchives/froebelarchiveforchildhoodstudies/ |archivedate=2012-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of books, archives, photographs, objects and multi-media materials, centring on Friedrich Fröbel’s educational legacy, early years and elementary education. The Demonstration School, originally located at Colet Court, Kensington, has evolved into [[Ibstock Place School]], Roehampton.

Today the [[Pestalozzi-Fröbel-Haus]] in Berlin continues to train nursery school teachers.&lt;ref name=english&gt;[http://www.pfh-berlin.de/english Pestalozzi Froebel Haus], retrieved 2 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goddard School Springboro OH USA.JPG|thumb|The Goddard School, [[Springfield, Ohio]].]]

The '''Goddard School''' is an [[early childhood education]] provider with more than 400 franchised Schools in 35 states and hundreds of markets, including the [[Atlanta]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Houston]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] markets. Goddard Systems, Inc. (GSI) franchises The Goddard School from its headquarters in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

== History ==

The Goddard School was founded in 1983 by Lois Goddard Haines in an effort to better the lives of children and their families who required childcare.The logo used by later owners features the original carousel horse which Ms. Haines had installed in the entrance hall of the original school.The school was located at 250 Paoli Pike, Malvern, Pennsylvania.

The Goodard School was the first childcare center to obtain licenses from The Pennsylvania Department of Education and The Department of Public Welfare to serve as a model to elevate the standard of care and early childhood education.

The original school incorporated a variety of teaching methods and progressive ideologies from all areas of child psychology and neurology to create a warm yet individualized experience to meet each child's needs.

The original Goddard School augmented the daily curriculum with art, theatre, music, garden to table, and made use of traveling programs of The Philadelphia Museum of Art, The Please Touch Museum, and The Franklin Institute.

Influenced by friends Peter Bergson and Susan Shilcock, co founders of Open Connections, Ms. Haines customed designed an interior play environment as well as the outdoor playground equipment for maximum safety and enjoyment .

The school served children from two years and seven months through Kindergarten with a student to teacher ratio of 3:1.

The Goddard School was sold to Joseph Scandone, et al. in 1988.

In 1988, [[Anthony A. Martino]], founder of the [[AAMCO Transmissions]] and [[MAACO|MAACO Auto Painting and Bodyworks]] franchises, established Carousel Systems, Inc. to offer Goddard Early Learning Center childcare and preschool franchises.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Goddard Systems|url=http://www.goddardschoolfranchise.com/about-us.html|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goddard Early Learning Centers became The Goddard School in 1993. In 1996, Philip Schumacher became president of Carousel Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schumacher replaces Schumacher at Goddard Systems|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2009/12/14/daily44.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|date=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the 100th Goddard School opened in [[Pickerington, Ohio]].

Wind River Holdings, LP acquired the franchise assets of Carousel Systems in 2002 and continued franchising Carousel Systems as Goddard Systems, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goddard Systems, Inc. |url=http://www.windriverholdings.com/portfolio-goddard.asp |work=Wind River Holdings |accessdate=28 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429050218/http://www.windriverholdings.com/portfolio-goddard.asp |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first West Coast Goddard School opened the same year in Portland, Oregon. The 200th Goddard School opened in [[Vancouver, Washington]] in 2005. In 2007, Joe Schumacher, who represented the company as outside counsel for 20 years, joined GSI as the chief operating officer. The following year, the 300th Goddard School opened in [[Centennial, Colorado]]. Joe Schumacher became president and CEO in 2010.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goddard Systems, Inc.

GSI was named the number one childcare franchise in the United States by ''Entrepreneur'' magazine for the fifteenth consecutive year (January 2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goddard Systems Inc.|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/goddardsystemsinc/282378-0.html#|work=Entrepreneur|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the Top 200 Franchise Systems (in worldwide sales) by ''Franchise Times'' for the tenth consecutive year (October 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise Times Top 200|url=http://www.franchisetimes.com/Resources/Top-200/|work=Franchise Times|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curriculum ==

The Goddard School offers preschool programs for children from six weeks to six years old. The Goddard School’s proprietary F.L.EX.® Learning Program focuses on building children’s emotional, academic, social, creative and physical skills through play-based learning. The FLEX Learning program is structured around developmental guidelines, child-focused lesson plans, a creative and fun learning environment, and child-centered teachable moments. The program is based on research that shows that children experience the most genuine learning when they are having fun. Each School also provides additional learning programs, such as baby sign language, yoga, music, Spanish and Mandarin. Additionally, Goddard School teachers provide parents with daily activity reports and schedule regular conferences throughout the year to discuss children’s progress and behaviors with parents. Some centers send daily photos to parents as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Goddard School Approach to Learning|url=http://www.goddardschool.com/the-goddard-experience/approach-to-learning|work=The Goddard School|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==

GSI received [[AdvancED]] Corporation Accreditation in January 2009 and [[Middle States]] Corporate Accreditation in 2012. Many Schools have achieved or are pursuing individual School accreditation with AdvancED, the Middle States Association, the [[National Association for the Education of Young Children]] and/or individual state accreditation programs.&lt;ref name="accred"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Goddard School Accreditations and Accolades|url=http://www.goddardschool.com/the-goddard-experience/educators-and-teachers/accreditation-and-accolades|work=The Goddard School|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality assurance ==

The Goddard School Quality Assurance (QA) program measures each Goddard School against internal standards, which are often stricter than state requirements. The Goddard QA team makes unannounced visits and provides helpful guidance on how to continuously improve for the benefit of the children and their families.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Goddard School Quality Assurance|url=http://www.goddardschool.com/the-goddard-experience/approach-to-learning/quality-assurance|work=The Goddard School|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Goddard Quality Assurance ensures: respect for the individual needs of every child, a warm and nurturing atmosphere in a safe setting, open and daily communication with families, a professional faculty committed to early childhood development, and a learning environment with opportunities for creativity and exploration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Affiliations ==

In 2011, the Partnership for 21st Century Skills, a national organization that advocates for 21st century readiness for students, named GSI a Strategic Council Member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goddard Systems, Inc. Named Strategic Council Member of The Partnership for 21st Century Skills|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/goddardfranchise/p21/prweb9128100.htm|accessdate=28 April 2014|date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6695">The '''Governess of the Children of France''' (sometimes the '''Governess of the Royal Children''') was office at the royal French court during the Pre-Revolutionary France and the Bourbon Restoration. She was charged with the education of the children and grandchildren of the [[Monarchy of France|monarch]]. The holder of the office was taken from the highest ranking [[French nobility|nobility of France]]. The [[governess]] was supported by various deputies or under-governesses (''sous gouvernantes'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3821">The '''Great Apes Survival Partnership''' ('''GRASP'''), established in 2001, aims to conserve the non-human [[great ape]]s ([[chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[bonobo]]s, and [[orangutan]]s) and their habitats — primarily forested tropical ecosystems that provide important services to humanity, through pro-poor conservation and sustainable development strategies.

GRASP is a [[UNEP]] and [[UNESCO]]-led [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD) Type II Partnership bringing together all the principal institutional actors in great ape conservation — [[United Nations]] agencies, [[biodiversity]]-related multilateral environmental agreements, great ape [[range state]] and donor governments, non-governmental organizations, scientists, local communities and the private sector.&lt;ref name="Structure"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Structure | url = http://www.un-grasp.org/the-partnership/structure | accessdate = 15 March 2013 | publisher = Great Apes Survival Partnership | year = 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121104220235/http://www.un-grasp.org/the-partnership/structure | archivedate = 4 November 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-human great apes are found in 21 countries in [[Africa]] ([[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]]) and in two countries in [[South East Asia]] ([[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]).&lt;ref name="RangeStates"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Range states | url = http://www.un-grasp.org/the-partnership/partners#CategoryA | accessdate = 15 March 2013 | publisher = Great Apes Survival Partnership | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-human Great ape populations are declining worldwide. The continuing destruction of habitat, in combination with the growth in the [[Bushmeat|commercial bushmeat trade in Africa]] and increased logging activities in Indonesia, have led scientists to suggest that the majority of great ape populations may be extinct in our lifetime. Even if isolated populations were to survive, the long-term viability of these great apes is in doubt due to their limited numbers and the [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation of their habitat]].&lt;ref name="OurWork"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Our work | url = http://www.un-grasp.org/the-partnership/our-work | accessdate = 15 March 2013 | publisher = Great Apes Survival Partnership | year = 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130407052707/http://www.un-grasp.org/the-partnership/our-work | archivedate = 7 April 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The endangered great apes share their habitat with millions of humans, the majority of whom live below the poverty line. The need to link the welfare of humans and wildlife is a central objective of the GRASP Partnership.

International commitment to the great apes was reaffirmed at an Intergovernmental Meeting on great apes and the first GRASP Council Meeting held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in September 2005, where the [[Kinshasa Declaration on Great Apes]] was adopted by more than 70 signatories.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4232174.stm | title = Declaration signed on great apes | date = 12 September 2005 | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hong Kong Mathematics Olympiad''' ('''HKMO''', {{zh|t=香港數學競賽}}) is a Mathematics Competition held in Hong Kong every year, jointly organized by the [[Hong Kong Institute of Education]] and [[Education Bureau]]. At present, more than 250 [[secondary school]]s send teams of 4-6 students of or below Form 5 to enter the competition. It is made up of a Heat Event and a Final Event, which both forbid the usage of [[calculator]]s and calculation assisting equipments (e.g. printed [[mathematical table]]). Though it bears the term ''Mathematics Olympiad'', it has no relationship with the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]].

==History==
The predecessor of HKMO is the '''Inter-school Mathematics Olympiad''' initiated by the Mathematics Society of [[Northcote College of Education]] in 1974, which had attracted 20 [[secondary school]]s to participate. Since 1983, the competition is jointly conducted by the Mathematics Department of [[Northcote College of Education]] and the Mathematics Section of the Advisory Inspectorate Division of the [[Education Department (Hong Kong)|Education Department]]. Also in 1983, the competition is formally renamed as '''Hong Kong Mathematics Olympiad'''.

==Format and Scoring in the Heat Event==
The Heat Event is usually held in four venues, for contestants from schools on [[Hong Kong Island]], and in [[Kowloon]], [[New Territories]] [[New Territories East (constituency)|East]] and [[New Territories]] [[New Territories West|West]] respectively. It comprises an individual event and a group event. Each team sends 4 contestants among 4-6 team members for each event.

For the individual event, 1 mark and 2 marks will be given to each correct answer in Part A and Part B respectively. The maximum score for a team should be 80.

For the group event, 2 marks will be given to each correct answer. The maximum score for a team should be 20.

For the geometric construction event, the maximum score for a team should be 20 (all working, including construction work, must be clearly shown).

In other words, a contesting school may earn 120 marks at most in the Heat Event. The top 50 may enter the Final Event.

==Format and Scoring in the Final Event==
The Final Event is usually held at the [[Education University of Hong Kong]] in [[Tai Po]]. It comprises 4 individual events and 4 group events. Before the real events begin, there is a mock event which carries no marks. Each team may send any 4 students for the individual events, and any 4 students for the group events. For every events, only answers are required. 

There are 4 questions in each Final Individual Event. The questions have to be solved by alternate contestants independently, and no discussions are allowed. For each event, the questions are interrelated, i.e. to solve the second question, the answer of the first question is needed, and to solve the third, the answer from the second is needed, etc.. 

There are also 4 questions in each Final Group Event, which may be interrelated or not. The four contestants shall complete each event together, and discussion is allowed.

For each event, 5 minutes is given. There are timekeepers to report the time taken used for each team in each event. The detailed scoring method is:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5685">'''Hussian College''', formally Hussian College, School of Art, formally Hussian School of Art, is a private [[vocational college]] for different types of design in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Established in 1946, it offers a four-year, full-time program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/edu/colleges/6690/|title=Infoplease.com: Hussian College}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussian College is located in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania and offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree for Art, with four concentrations: User Interface &amp; Experience, Digital Media, Graphic Design, Visual Communications.

'''Studio School''', its Los Angeles branch campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://studioschool.edu/|title=Studio School, A Branch Campus of Hussian College}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers four Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degrees in Art, Film + Digital Content, Acting, Commercial Dance and Contemporary Musical Theatre + Film and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Entrepreneurship.

==History==

The first class at Hussian School of Art commenced on July 1, 1946. John Hussian, a member of Philadelphia's art community and a renowned lecturer, was encouraged by what is now the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] to open a school for veterans returning from World War II. Working under the [[G.I. Bill]], Hussian worked with the Pennsylvania Department of Education Vocational Training and the Veterans Administration to provide training in fine art.

In the 1960s, many local competitors transitioned to collegiate status, while feedback from the industry and enrollment numbers indicated a continued need for career training in the visual arts. With Hussian’s guidance as president, the curriculum shifted to concentrate on commercial art. Hussian became a charter member in [[PAPSA]] (Pennsylvania Association of Private School Administrators) in the early 1960s.

The school was incorporated on July 1, 1969 and received its initial national accreditation as a member of [[National Association of Trade and Technical Schools]] (NATTS) in 1972.

In 1973, Ronald Dove became president of the Hussian School of Art.  Dove adopted the same curriculum model and education philosophy that Hussian had established for the institution. In 1978, Hussian applied to the [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]] for consideration to award a 4-year AST degree. Formal approval to award the degree was granted in May 1979. In 1992, Hussian received its initial accreditation from [[ACCSCT]], now ACCSC, and has remained in good standing from the time of initial accreditation.

As Dove retired, he appointed Bruce Wartman as president in July 2010 with the intention to train his predecessor as he reduced his responsibilities. Dove’s health began to suffer and he decided to sell the institution in 2011 to Education Equities, LLC. With the change of ownership, a formal board of directors was established and a strategic plan for the institution was created based on a needs assessment of the modern job market and professional art community. The planning process included introducing new institutional policies, introducing new digital media curriculum, hiring more faculty, and transitioning the institution to collegiate status.

In September 2011, Hussian submitted an application to become a degree-granting institution with the Pennsylvania Department of Education.  This decision was made based on feedback from industry advisors, alumni, and prospective students that the BFA degree was more desirable in the industry and more indicative of the program rigor of the 4-year AST program.

In May 2012, Bruce Wartman stepped down from the position of president.  Alan Garfield served as interim president for three months while the board of directors conducted a search.  In August 2012, Melissa Morgan, who was acting as Dean of Academic Affairs, was appointed president.

In November 2013, Hussian was granted the ability to begin conferring a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree by the Pennsylvania Department of Education and immediately began the approval process with ACCSC.  In January 2014, Hussian received approval to add the BFA to Hussian’s list of ACCSC approved programs. In January 2015 Hussian College received final approvals from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and ACCSC to change the institution name from “Hussian School of Art” to “Hussian College.”

==Notable alumni==

'''Emmanuel Olakunle Filani''' (born 8 September 1957) is a Nigerian educator and artist. His works are closely identified with the school of thought named Onaism; Onaism is an art movement that is based on the fusion of the designs, ornamentation and motifs found in traditional [[Yoruba art|Yoruba carvings]] and textiles with modern art pieces such as drawings and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mufu Onifade (2 November 2007), [http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=36007 Garlands for master-artist, Filani] ''The Nation''.&lt;/ref&gt; Filani is also a lecturer and an administrator – he served as a former provost of the Federal College of Education, Osiele, [[Abeokuta]].

==Early life and education==
Filani was born 8 September 1957 to a [[polygamous]] family,&lt;ref name=CCAF&gt;Ademuleya, B., Onipede, A., Azeez, A., &amp; Culture and Creative Art Forum. (2007). Kunle Filani: Artist, critic and art administrator. Lagos: Culture and Creative Art Forum (CCAF)&lt;/ref&gt; his father Jacob Ogunmoroti Filani was a native of [[Ikole|Ikole-Ekiti]] in Ekiti State, he was a civil servant who worked in the municipal government council while his mother was a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalmirroronline.net/new/we-must-preserve-our-culture-from-being-influenced-kunle-filani/&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1975 when Filani was 17 years old. Due to his father's job, the family lived in various towns when he was a young child. He completed his primary education at Bishop Akinyele Primary School, Ibadan (1967-1969) and St Peter's Primary School, Ikole (1969).  He attended Doherty Memorial Grammar School in Ijero Ekiti with his brother, fellow artist Tolu Filani. While in Form 2, the school provided a classroom for students  inclined towards artistic activities and subsequently hired an arts teacher to manage the class.&lt;ref name=CCAF/&gt; He finished secondary education in 1974 and briefly worked for two years as a clerk at the Lafarge Cement plant in [[Ewekoro]]. From 1976-1980, he studied at [[Obafemi Awolowo University]] where he earned a degree in Fine Arts. At Ife, he was taught by some faculty staff that included [[Babatunde Lawal]], Munio Makuchi, Agbo Folarin and Rowland Abiodun. It was at the university he met some of his fellow artists such as [[Moyo Okediji]] and Moyo Ogundipe;  together they later went on to form the Ona art movement in the late 1980s. He also developed an interest in petro-polystyrene experimentation at Ife. He obtained a Master of Fine Arts degree from the [[University of Benin (Nigeria)|University of Benin]], as part of his fulfilment for the completion of the degree, he staged an academic exhibition entitled 'A Trip to Wonderland'. He also developed skills in contrast composition and [[printmaking]]. Filani later earned a doctoral degree in Visual Arts from [[University of Ibadan]] in 2002.

==Career==
Filani served as a [[National Youth Service Corps|corps member]] at Kano Teacher's College between 1980 and 1981. He started his career as an art teacher in St Louis School, [[Owo]] in 1981. On completion of his M.F.A. studies, he joined the arts faculty of [[Adeyemi College of Education]], Ondo in 1985, he rose through the ranks to become head of department before leaving the college in 1992 to establish the new arts department in the Federal College of Education, Akoka, Lagos. While at Adeyemi College, Filani was involved with the formation of Ona Group. Ona as an artistic concept is focused on re-adaptation and re-interpretation of traditional materials and methods that will culminate in the aesthetic high point of contemporary Yoruba art and design.&lt;ref name=CCAF/&gt; He had two solo exhibitions during this period – "Coming on Strong", an exhibition of prints, paintings and drawings in August 1989 and "Salute to Patience" in 1991. Between 1992 and 1997, some of his works were shown in some group exhibitions in Lagos, the group exhibitions include, "Best of Ife" in 1993, "On and On" in 1993, "Harvest of Sensation" in 1991 and "Legacy", an exhibition in honor of Irein Wangboje in 1996. He had a solo exhibition in 1997 termed "Patterns of Ona".

He was at a time the dean of School of Technical Education and Provost, Federal College of Education, Osiele-Abeokuta.

Filani's paintings fall under four categories:figurative expression, landscapes, partially dissected works and completely dissected compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Irivwieri, Godwin  (July 2010), [http://www.ajol.info/index.php/afrrev/article/download/60180/48429 "Onaism: An Artistic Model of Yoruba Civilization in Nigeria"] ''African Research Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; A common feature of some of his paintings is the use of decorative linear drawings and patterns.

'''Matt's Law''' is a [[California law]] that allows for [[felony]] [[Prosecutor|prosecution]]s when serious injuries or deaths result from [[hazing]] [[rite]]s. The bill amended the California Education Code and [[California Penal Code]] to change charges for some hazing [[ritual]]s from [[misdemeanor]]s to felonies, and for the first time gave prosecutors the ability to seek hazing charges against nonstudents.

The [[long title]] of the act was ''An act to amend Section 48900 of, and to repeal Sections 32050 and 32051 of the Education Code, and to add Section 245.6 to the Penal Code, relating to hazing''.

It was introduced into the [[California State Senate]] by [[Tom Torlakson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Antioch, California|Antioch]], as '''Senate Bill 1454'''. SB 1454 passed the state Senate 34–2 on May 30, 2006. It passed the [[California State Assembly]] with amendments on August 24, 2006, and the Senate concurred with the bill as amended on August 30, 2006. It was signed into law by [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on September 29, 2006.

Matt's Law was named in memory of Matt Carrington, a 21-year-old [[California State University, Chico]] student from [[Pleasant Hill, California]]. Carrington died in the basement of a [[Fraternity and sorority houses|fraternity house]] located two blocks from campus.

Prior to the enactment of Matt's Law, hazing (even in the case of death) was a misdemeanor as part of California's education code, rather than punishable under the state's penal code. Matt's Law prevents unaffiliated fraternities from using the argument that they cannot be punished for hazing, simply because they are not student organizations. The law also gives prosecutors clear authority to bring charges against anyone or any organization involved in hazing, not just currently enrolled students.

==Matt Carrington's case==
{{see also|Chi Tau}}
On February 2, 2005, Matt Carrington died as the direct result of a hazing ritual at Chico State University in [[Chico, California]]. In the basement of the fraternity house of fraternity [[Chi Tau]] (XT), Carrington was forced to drink water and do [[calisthenics]] with fans blowing on him.  This [[water intoxication]] ritual, which dates back over 20 years at Chi Tau, caused swelling of his brain, seizures, and heart failure. Members of the fraternity delayed calling for emergency help for over an hour.

Four young men pleaded guilty to [[involuntary manslaughter]]. Media from all over the [[United States]] came to the [[Butte County, California|Butte County]] courtroom for the sentencing, including reporters and camera crews from ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' and ''[[Inside Edition]]''.

James DeVilla Abrille, 22, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor hazing, Jerry Ming Lim, 25, and John Paul Fickes, 20, both pleaded guilty to being accessories to involuntary manslaughter, 22-year-old Gabriel John Maestretti, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.  These were the first felony charges for hazing in the United States.

Started in 2008, '''Model Crime Investigations (or Model CI, MCI)''' is a student-associated international [[Meeting|conference]]. Model Crime Investigations is held annually in [[South Korea]] so it is usually known as KMCI. MCI is an [[extracurricular activity]] where students gather to learn about how a police department operates, as well as about how the broader criminal justice system functions. In the actual conference of simulation, participants will [[debate]] upon civil or criminal cases to find culprits among virtual suspects in committees. Unlike [[scientific investigation]], in Model Crime Investigation participants usually interrogate suspects in oral arguments, and gather verbal evidence. Issues that can be discussed will vary from minor cases such as robbery to major crimes such as international [[terrorism]], which are currently happening all around us{{Who|date=August 2009}}. During the sessions, students who charge the investigation will have to work on [[affidavit]] by summarizing the points given by the suspects and witnesses, for the purpose of exterminating crimes by means such as arrest and/or complaint; and prosecute suspects. Along with [[Model United Nations]], [[Moot Court]], [[Mock Trial]], or [[Model Congress]], Model Crime Investigations aims to build students' global perspective.

== History ==

*On December 8, 2008, '''YMCI''' (Youth Model Crime Investigation) was created. Back then, YMCI only aimed for high school students around the world.
*On April 2, 2009, the name was changed to '''MCI''' (Model Crime Investigations), so that university students can join a conference also. (Official age restriction is from 9th to 12th grade students.)

== Operation ==
[[File:HWKu.JPG|right|thumb|250px|A student making a speech]]
KMCI basically follows the system of [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in United States. Committees students can take are Federal Bureau of Investigation, US Marshals, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive, or Department of Homeland Security. Each student will work as '''police''' designated as a Lieutenant, Sergeant, or Commander, or will work as '''suspects''' defending themselves as innocent. Participants (if they are suspects) will typically receive a criminal case ahead of time, which includes the facts of the crime, their roles, [[alibi]]s and pieces of evidence. Students taking roles as suspects must prepare and memorize the cases given to them. During model crime investigation sessions, participants working as Police, not knowing who the actual criminal(s) is (are), must gather these pieces of evidence through investigating, interrogating and interviewing suspects in order to find out who the offender(s) is(are).

== Organization ==
 [[File:Kmci structure.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The organization of KMCI]]

Whole committees are supervised and controlled by students role-playing as Generals: &lt;br /&gt;
'''Commissioner General, Chief Superintendent General, Senior superintendent general, Superintendent General.'''

''(University of Students who took role as Generals in 2009 Korea Model Crime Investigations)''

Each session is operated by students following roles as Chiefs:&lt;br /&gt;
'''Chief of Police, Deputy Chief, and Assistant Chief'''

Participants will be designated in the following committees randomly

*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]
*[[U.S. Marshals Service]]
*[[Drug Enforcement Administration]]
*[[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] and
*[[Department of Homeland Security]]

And be given the roles in POLICE as&lt;br /&gt;
'''Commander, Captain, Lieutenant, Sergeant, Senior Lead Officer, Patrol Force'''

, OR be given the roles in SUSPECT as&lt;br /&gt;
'''Criminal, [[Accomplice]], Witness, and so on''' (Types of roles are subjected to be changed according to a criminal case of 
committee, and participants’ role must be kept fugitive by themselves.)

== Goals ==
Police and Suspects has different goal of their own. As mentioned above, police should find out actual offenders by summarizing evidences given by suspects. Suspects should not let police to find about who the actual criminal is. Whoever achieves their goal is to win.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Insession.JPG|left|thumb|250px|committee in sessions|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 15 September 2009}}]] --&gt;

=== Role as Police ===
By going through procedures step by step, police officers have to find out the actual criminal, or criminals. All officers shall strictly adhere to the policy of the KMCI prior to any [[interrogation]] of suspects. No coercion, threats or promises shall be used under any condition to obtain a [[Confession (law)|confession]], statement, or admission from any individual. The immediate objective of the interviewing officer should be to establish a cooperative relationship. To this objective, an officer should:&lt;br /&gt;
i.	Display a sincere interest,&lt;br /&gt;
ii.	Be patient and tactful, &lt;br /&gt;
iii.	Be respectful&lt;br /&gt;
iv.	Control personal feelings, and&lt;br /&gt;
v.	Provide reassurance.

[[File:wrkshpqw5.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Executive explaining rules of procedure in COEX]]

=== Role as a Suspect ===
Participants can be designated as a criminal, accomplice or as a witness. They are able to lie about their positions in order to confuse police, but their evidences should match with the stances Chiefs provides several weeks before session. Suspects’ positions MUST be kept in a secret before sessions start. Actual number of criminals among suspects can vary from zero to all. Suspects making a speech, refusing interrogation or getting an interview should: &lt;br /&gt;
1.	Display utmost respect,&lt;br /&gt;
2.	Be kind to interviewers, &lt;br /&gt;
3.	Cooperate interview as much as interviewee wants to, and&lt;br /&gt;
4.	Never distort their evidence

== Investigation ==

[[File:KMCI International student conference.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An international Student Conference: Debate Sessions]][[File:KMCIparticipants.jpg|left|thumb|200px|KMCI participants: A student delivering his speech]]&lt;br /&gt;Investigation procedures are the only way which investigators can find valuable evidences. These investigations are  divided into two parts: Preliminary investigation, and Follow-up investigation.

=== Preliminary investigation ===
Most preliminary investigations will be conducted by the members of Patrol Force since they usually are the first to arrive at the criminal scene. All officers designated to conduct preliminary investigation shall do their utmost to gather as much information as possible during this stage of investigation since its police department’s the very first stage figuring out the information of suspects. The officers responsible for a preliminary investigation shall interrogate the suspect, find out personal information about the suspect such as, but not limited to age, address, phone number, family members, and shall report the incident fully and accurately and yield the responsibility to the follow-up investigators.

=== Follow-up Investigation ===
Follow-up investigation will be preceded by the Senior Lead Officer, Sergeant and Lieutenant because they are usually responsible for deeper investigations. It may be possible for the patrol force to conduct follow-up investigations, but the priority is given to other class officers. In this stage of investigation, police department would try to figure out more concrete and detailed information about the offenses and the suspects as thorough as possible, including following steps, although all of the steps may not be necessary in each case: review and analyze all previous reports prepared in the preliminary phase: conduct additional interviews with suspects, and preliminary investigating officers if necessary, conduct interrogations of all suspects, plan, organize and conduct crime scene searches for the purpose of gathering additional evidences: check criminal records of potential suspects: identify and apprehend suspects and: interview apprehended suspects in order to determine involvement in other crimes.

== Debate ==
[[File:KMCIsuspect.jpg|thumb|180px|A student is interrogating virtual suspect during preliminary investigation]]
Debate procedure incorporated [[Model united nations#Format|UNA-USA format]](United Nations Associations of United States of America) to foster active participation from students. Motions and points have to be introduced by participants to take an action in the committee, and the conference will be governed under the authority of student chiefs.

'''''Introduction of an affidavit'''''&lt;br /&gt;
Once an affidavit has been approved, copied, and distributed, a person/people may make a motion to introduce the affidavit. The Chief will recognize the affiant of the affidavit to read the paragraphs of the affidavit. The Chief, at his or her discretion, may allow the main signatories to answer any clarification points on the affidavit. for any reason. After that, the affiant has to express his/her reasons for supporting his/her own affidavit.

'''''Speaker's list'''''&lt;br /&gt;
When a speaking time designated for an affidavit elapse, the Chief will terminate his speech. After that, the floor will be yielded to the Chief who will open the floor to debate. Chief will entertain other suspects’ or police agents’ speeches. These speeches must include reasons for disagreeing or sometimes supporting the contents in the affidavit. (Affiant also can take the floor again as long as the Chief recognizes him/her.)

'''''Closure of the debate'''''&lt;br /&gt;
When total allotted debate time is almost elapsed, a session will have final speeches. Usually, a final speech lasts 1 minute for, and 1 minute against the affidavit. When the final speeches are over, the debate procedure will automatically be closed, and voting procedures will begin.

The '''Morehead-Cain Scholarship''' (originally the '''Morehead Scholarship''') was the first merit scholarship program established in the United States, founded at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. It is named for its benefactors, [[John Motley Morehead III]] and the Gordon and Mary Cain Foundation. Modeled after the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], the Morehead-Cain provides a full four-year scholarship covering tuition, books, room and board, a laptop computer, and four summer experiences known as the Morehead-Cain's Summer Enrichment Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moreheadcain.org/about/ Morehead-Cain Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228171247/http://moreheadcain.org/about/ |date=2010-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nominees must be a competitive applicant to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and unmarried with no children.

==History==
The Morehead Scholarship was created in 1951 by the Morehead Foundation, when [[John Motley Morehead III]], bequeathed to the University of North Carolina $130 million, commissioned the University's planetarium, and funded the John Motley Morehead Foundation. The Foundation and scholarship was renamed the Morehead-Cain in 2007 after the Gordon and Mary Cain Foundation contributed $100 million to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Topics: Morehead-Cain Scholarship|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/section/moreheadcain_scholarship|publisher=''The Daily Tarheel''|accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer Enrichment Program==
The Summer Enrichment Program was established in 1974. It fully funds activities for students in four areas (Outdoor Leadership, Civic Collaboration, Global Perspective, and Professional Experience) which occur in the summers before their respective class year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Summer Enrichment Program|url=http://moreheadcain.org/about/the_summer_enrichment_program|publisher=The Morehead-Cain Foundation|accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor Leadership===
The summer before students enter the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, they participate in an [[National Outdoor Leadership School|NOLS]] or an [[Outward Bound]] course throughout the country in order to push themselves physically and mentally through a number of individual and group challenges.

===Civic Collaboration===
A relatively recent addition to the program is the development of the Civic Collaboration summer, in which teams of rising sophomores are placed in mid-sized US cities to partner with a governmental or community organization to help develop solutions to local and regional challenges. Previous placements have taken place in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. 

===Global Perspective===
Before the student's Junior year they have an opportunity to design a summer that will bring them into contact with a global perspective or work environment. While many students travel abroad for this summer, other elect to remain in the United States to pursue global-minded work domestically. Students may pursue study abroad programs, traditional internships, purposeful travel, or other avenues for this summer

===Professional Experience===
The final summer program encourages students to work in a professional capacity. Projects have ranged from policy work with the [[World Health Organization]] to investment banking and industry research with [[Goldman Sachs]]. This may be swapped with the Global Perspective option in the sequence of a student's summers in accordance with their individual four-year plan.

==Selection process==
The selection process for the Morehead-Cain is extremely rigorous, with only three percent of each year's nominees selected as Morehead-Cain Scholars. High school seniors demonstrating exceptional impact and academic achievement from North Carolina and from select schools across the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and various other countries are eligible for the prestigious scholarship. Criteria for selection are:

* Moral Force of Character
* Leadership
* Physical Vigor
* Scholarship

'''Parag A. Pathak''' (born c. 1980) is Professor of Economics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and is affiliated with the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] where he co-founded and directs the working group on [[Mechanism design|market design]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/workinggroups/md/md.html|title=Market Design (MD)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Pathak grew up in Corning, New York. His parents emigrated to the United States from Kathmandu, Nepal. Pathak was educated at Harvard University where he received a Bachelor's and master's degrees in [[Applied Mathematics]] (summa cum laude) and PhD in [[Business Economics]] in 2007 with the support of [[The Paul &amp; Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parag Pathak, 2003|url=https://www.pdsoros.org/meet-the-fellows/parag-pathak|publisher=P.D. Soros Fellowship for New Americans|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2002-2003, Pathak served as a visiting fellow at the University of Toulouse where he studied under [[Jean Tirole]], the 2014 winner of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. Pathak served as a Junior Fellow at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/06/newsmakers-33/|title=Newsmakers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the MIT faculty in 2008, and was voted tenure two years later in 2010 at the age of 30.

At MIT, Pathak co-founded and serves as Director of the [http://seii.mit.edu School Effectiveness &amp; Inequality Initiative], a group of economists who study the economics of education and the connections between human capital and the American income distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seii.mit.edu/people/parag-pathak/|title=Parag Pathak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathak is an [[Sloan Fellowship|Alfred P. Sloan Fellow]] and a recipient of a 2012 [[PECASE|Presidential Early Career for Scientists and Engineers]] by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.  In 2012, he was selected to give the Shapley Lecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Games 2012, Istanbul Bilgi University|url=http://games2012.bilgi.edu.tr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a lecture in honor of [[Lloyd Shapley]] given by a distinguished game theorist aged 40 or under at the 4th World Congress of the Game Theory Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shapley Lecture|url=http://www.gametheorysociety.org/bulletin/2011.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 he was awarded the [[John Bates Clark Medal]], for his work that "blends institutional knowledge, theoretical sophistication, and careful empirical analysis to provide insights that are of immediate value to important public-policy issues.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-20/mit-s-pathak-school-choice-scholar-wins-young-economist-award|title=MIT's Pathak, School-Choice Scholar, Wins Young-Economist Award|date=2018-04-20|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parag Pathak, Clark Medalist 2018|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/honors-awards/bates-clark/parag-pathak|website=American Economic Association|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Market design ===
A protege of 2012 Nobel Prize winner [[Alvin E. Roth]], Pathak is best known for his work in [[market design]].  He is a leader in the recent push to apply engineering methods to [[microeconomics]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; As a graduate student, Pathak worked with Roth to design the algorithm underlying the system used to match [[New York City Department of Education|New York City public school]] students to high schools as incoming freshman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pathak|first=Parag |author2=Atila Abdulkadiroğlu |author3=Alvin Roth|title=The New York City High School Match|journal=American Economic Review|year=2005|volume=95|issue=2|pages=364–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, he worked together with Atila Abdulkadiroglu, Roth, and [[Tayfun Sönmez]] to design a new student assignment system for [[Boston Public Schools]], which was adopted in 2005.  The team of economists identified parents in Boston who developed heuristics on how to play this real-world game so that their children would not be unassigned, leaving those unaware of these features disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pathak|first=Parag|author2=Tayfun Sonmez|title=Leveling the Playing Field: Sincere and Sophisticated Players in the Boston Mechanism|journal=American Economic Review|year=2008|volume=98|issue=4|pages=1636–1652|doi=10.1257/aer.98.4.1636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boston held citywide discussions and hearings on the school selection system and finally in 2005 narrowed the choice to one of two mechanisms: the [[top trading cycles]] mechanism for schools and the student-optimal stable mechanism based on the [[stable marriage problem]]. Eventually, Boston adopted the student-optimal stable mechanism.  The policy change was the first time an [[incentive compatible]] [[strategyproof]] mechanism, based on an abstract concept from mechanism design, played a role in a public policy discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sonmez|first=Tayfun|author2=Atila Abdulkadiroglu |author3=Parag Pathak |author4=Alvin E. Roth |title=Changing the Boston Mechanism|journal=NBER Working Paper Series|year=2006|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w11965}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work was recognized in the 2012 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] awarded to [[Alvin E. Roth]] and [[Lloyd Shapley]] ``for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.''

Since then, a number of other districts have abandoned Boston's old mechanism. In 2007, through an act of Parliament,
British authorities outlawed the use of First Preference First arrangements, which made Boston's old method of school assignment illegal throughout 150 English districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sonmez|first=Tayfun|author2=Pathak, Parag|title=School Admissions Reform in Chicago and England: Comparing Mechanisms by their Vulnerability to Manipulation|journal=American Economic Review|date=February 2013|volume=103|issue=1|pages=80–106|doi=10.1257/aer.103.1.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathak continues to be involved with the Boston school choice plan.  In 2012, Boston Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] asked for Pathak's help by appointing him the Technical Advisor to the Boston School Choice Plan.  The city embarked on a discussion of several alternative zone plans, including the complete elimination of school choice, and Mayor Menino commissioned a report evaluating the alternative proposals.  This frustrated some groups because it delayed citywide discussions about Boston's choice plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vaznis|first=James|title=Boston school-choice recommendations delayed|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2012/11/30/boston-school-choice-recommendations-delayed/UpGYF95S8gdtqzckZSk7BN/story.html|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the report was released, some parent groups were unhappy even though it made no recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parent Imperfect|title=I got algo-rhythm, who could ask for anything more?|url=http://parentimperfectct.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/i-got-algo-rythm-who-could-ask-for-anything-more/|accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2013, the school committee adopted a proposal developed by one of Pathak's graduate student.  The proposal was controversial and seen as complicated. Nonetheless, members of the Boston school committee voted for it because it was the best compromise between competing objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Division Required in This School Problem|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/education/no-division-required-in-this-school-problem.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=New York Times | first=Katharine Q.|last=Seelye|date=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathak helped to design the OneApp common enrollment system used in the [[Recovery School District]] in New Orleans in 2011, involving a collaboration of assignment processes between charter schools and traditional public schools.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centralized enrollment in Recovery School District gets first tryout|url=http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2012/04/centralized_enrollment_in_reco.html|publisher=Times Picayune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education reform ===
Pathak is also a leading scholar in education reform.  He is most well known for numerous studies of [[Charter School (Massachusetts)|charter schools]] which use randomness in assignment lotteries to deal with differences between charter and traditional students.  One study compares Boston's charter, pilot and traditional schools, and finds Boston's charter schools to be unusually effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Atila |last=Abdulkadiroğlu |first2=Joshua D. |last2=Angrist |first3=Susan M. |last3=Dynarski |first4=Thomas J. |last4=Kane |first5=Parag A. |last5=Pathak |title=Accountability and Flexibility in Public Schools: Evidence from Boston's Charters And Pilots |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=126 |issue=2 |date=2011 |pages=699–748 |doi=10.1093/qje/qjr017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   A report by the Boston Teacher's Union criticized the report, claiming that they could not generalize the methodology to less-popular schools without waiting lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skinner|title=Charter School Success or Selective Out-Migration of Low Achievers?|url=http://www.btu.org/sites/default/files/MTA_Charter_School_Report_%209_09.pdf|publisher=Center for Education Policy and Practice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also conducted the first such study of a [[KIPP]] charter school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w15740|title=Who Benefits from KIPP?|first1=Joshua D.|last1=Angrist|first2=Susan M.|last2=Dynarski|first3=Thomas J.|last3=Kane|first4=Parag A.|last4=Pathak|first5=Christopher R.|last5=Walters|date=1 February 2010|publisher=|via=National Bureau of Economic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work with [[Joshua Angrist]] finds that charter schools outside of urban areas are not particularly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zubrzycki|first=Jaclyn|title=Studies Find Charters Vary in Quality, Creativity|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2012/03/07/23biz-charter-side.h31.html|publisher=Education Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study considers the effects of Boston's charter schools on college enrollment and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vaznis|first=Jamie|title=Charter schools in Boston score higher on key tests|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/05/21/charter-schools-outperform-traditional-schools-key-tests-study-says/ZssXZZRZ174wy39OmwVDnN/story.html|publisher=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more controversial study examines the effects of Boston and New York's exam schools ([[Bronx Science]], [[Boston Latin School]], [[Stuyvesant High School]]) finding that the high achievement of these students is not due to the school, but to the school's admissions process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kix|first=Paul|title=What exam schools can't do|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2011/10/29/what-exam-schools-can/AEaxP4NJGr9dT8JTxLKwSK/story.html|publisher=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though they continue to remain popular among parents, the Washington Post's [[Jay Mathews]] wondered if exam schools are even needed based on the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=Jay|title=Exclusive high schools: Who needs them?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/class-struggle/post/exclusive-high-schools-who-needs-them/2011/08/13/gIQAftWfFJ_blog.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=October 14, 2011|date=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
Pathak has also studied the effect of home foreclosures on home prices in their surrounding neighborhood.  This work has been cited in congressional testimony and featured in several outlets including PBS&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/parag_pathak_mit_economist_100722/&lt;/ref&gt; and NPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.wbur.org/2010/07/25/foreclosure-study|title=Researchers Quantify The Foreclosure Effect|date=25 July 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Platform of European Memory and Conscience''' is an [[education]]al project of the [[European Union]] bringing together government institutions and [[NGO]]s from EU countries active in research, documentation, awareness raising and education about the crimes of [[totalitarian]] regimes. Its membership include 55 government agencies and NGOs from 13 EU member states as well as from the [[United States]], such as the [[Institute of National Remembrance]], the [[Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial]], the [[Stasi Records Agency]] and the [[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]]. The platform has offices in [[Prague]] and [[Brussels]]. The President of the platform is [[Łukasz Kamiński]], former President of the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]].

The platform was founded in [[Prague]] on the occasion of the summit of Prime Ministers of the [[Visegrád Group]] on 14 October 2011. The signing ceremony took place in the [[Liechtenstein Palace (Kampa Island, Prague)|Lichtenstein Palace]] under the auspices of Czech Prime Minister [[Petr Nečas]], Polish Prime Minister and President of the European Council [[Donald Tusk]], and Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.poland.pl/news/article,Institute_of_National_Remembrance_Cofounds_the_Platform_of_European_Memory_and_Conscience,id,462088.htm |title= Institute of National Remembrance Cofounds the Platform of European Memory and Conscience |publisher=Poland.pl |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-hungarian-polish-pms-sign-european-memory-platform/700991 |title=Czech, Hungarian, Polish PMs sign European memory platform  |publisher=Ceskenoviny.cz |date=14 October 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is described as helping "prevent intolerance, [[extremism]], [[Anti-democratic thought|anti-democratic]] movements and the recurrence of any [[totalitarian]] rule in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2011/10/20/czech-prime-minister-petr-necas-the-years-of-totalitarianism-were-years-of-struggle-for-liberty/ |title=Czech Prime minister Petr Nečas: The years of totalitarianism were years of struggle for liberty |language= |publisher=Memoryandconscience.eu |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative was originally proposed by the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] and the [[Government of the Czech Republic]], and the 2008 [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]];&lt;ref name="RFE-RL"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rferl.org/content/interview_how_much_does_west_know_about_communist_crimes/24358883.html |title= How Much Do Western Europeans Know About Communist Crimes? |author= Charles Recknagel |date= 13 October 2011 |work= |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/6595himxu | archivedate = 2 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 2 April 2009, the [[European Parliament]] passed a resolution in favour of the initiative,&lt;ref name="EP-Resolution"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2009-0213+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN |title= European Parliament resolution of 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism |author= |date= |work= |publisher= [[Europa.eu]] | archiveurl  = | archivedate = |accessdate= 2011-05-10 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2009, the [[Council of the European Union]] welcomed the initiative. The Platform of European Memory and Conscience was founded as an initiative of the Polish [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU presidency]] in 2011, after the project had been promoted by the Czech EU presidency already in 2009 and by the Hungarian EU presidency in 2011.&lt;ref name="praguemonitor"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://praguemonitor.com/2011/10/04/european-memory-platform-be-founded-prague |title= European memory platform to be founded in Prague |author= |date= |work= |publisher= [[Prague Daily Monitor]] ([[Czech News Agency]]) | archiveurl  =https://www.webcitation.org/62mXlrb7a | archivedate = 10 October 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-10 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The secretariat of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience was originally hosted by the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]], and the platform has received a strategic grant from the [[Visegrád Group|International Visegrád Fund]]. The founding institutions included government agencies of the [[Czech Republic]], Poland, Germany, Hungary, [[Romania]], Lithuania, [[Estonia]], and [[Latvia]], as well as several NGOs. The organisation's strategic partners include the International Visegrád Fund and the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]]. The motto of the platform is "[[democracy]] matters."

==History==
On 8 April 2008, the Slovenian EU Presidency and the [[European Commission]] organised the [[European Public Hearing on Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes]]. The hearing called for the establishment of a foundation which would increase "public awareness at the EU level, develop cultual and educational projects and notably provide support to networking of national research institutions specialised in the subject of totalitarian experience, provide support for the European and national research and educational projects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2011/08/17/new-webpage-test/ |title= Platform of European Memory and Conscience – a brief history |publisher= Platform of European Memory and Conscience |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the international conference European Conscience and Communism was hosted by the Czech [[Committee on Education, Science, Culture, Human Rights and Petitions (Czech Republic)|Senate Committee on Education, Science, Culture, Human Rights and Petitions]]. The resulting [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]] called for the establishment of an ''Institute of European Memory and Conscience''.

In 2009, Czech EU Presidency and the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] invited all member states to participate in the joint establishment of a Platform of European Memory and Conscience. Following a meeting in Prague in November 2008, representatives of 19 states and 12 partner institutions decided to establish a Working Group on the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, which was co-ordinated by the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]]. As of 2011, the working group included 35 institutions and organisations from 19 European countries. The working group co-operates closely with the [[Reconciliation of European Histories Group]], an all-party group in the [[European Parliament]] which is chaired by former European Commissioner [[Sandra Kalniete]].

On 18 March 2009, the Czech EU Presidency hosted the [[European Public Hearing on European Conscience and Crimes of Totalitarian Communism: 20 Years After]], as "the third step towards the establishment of a European Platform of Memory and Conscience to support the activities of institutions engaged in reconciling with totalitarian regimes in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/hearing-in-the-european-parliament-on-the-crimes-of-communism |title= Hearing in the European Parliament on the Crimes of Communism: Third step towards European platform of memory and conscience – a Czech Presidency initiative |publisher=[[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 2009, the European Parliament adopted (553:44:33) a [[European Parliament resolution of 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism|resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism]], which called "for the establishment of a Platform of European Memory and Conscience to provide support for networking and cooperation among national research institutes specialising in the subject of totalitarian history, and for the creation of a pan-European documentation centre/memorial for the victims of all totalitarian regimes."&lt;ref name="EP-Resolution" /&gt;

In its 15 June 2009 conclusions, the EU [[General Affairs Council|General Affairs]] and [[Foreign Affairs Council|External Relations Council]] welcomed the initiative to create the Platform of European Memory and Conscience and requested that the European Commission provide financial instruments for the activities.

In February 2010, the Working Group on the Platform of European Memory and Conscience hosted the international conference Crimes of the Communist Regimes in the Czech Senate and the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic under the auspices of Prime Minister [[Jan Fischer (politician)|Jan Fischer]]. The conference resulted in the adoption of the [[Declaration on Crimes of Communism]], which called "upon EU member states to increase the awareness raising and education about crimes of communism," and stated that "the creation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, as supported by the European Parliament and the EU Council in 2009, must be completed at EU level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/international-conference-crimes-of-the-communist-regimes |title= International conference Crimes of the Communist Regimes: Declaration on Crimes of Communism |publisher= [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] | archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/62mWvL5SW | archivedate = 28 October 2011 |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 9–10 June 2011 conclusions on the memory of crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe, the EU [[Council of the European Union|Justice and Home Affairs Council]] invited all interested parties to make use of existing EU programmes to establish a Platform of European Memory and Conscience.

The then-incumbent Polish EU Presidency founded the Platform of European Memory and Conscience with the participation of the governments and government institutions of a number of other EU countries on 14 October 2011. The Platform has received a strategic grant from the [[Visegrád Group|International Visegrád Fund]].

==Executive board, board of trustees and secretariat==
The first President of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience was [[Göran Lindblad]] (former MP, Sweden, who drafted the [[Council of Europe resolution 1481]]); he was succeeded in 2016 by [[Łukasz Kamiński]]. The Executive Board members include [[Siegfried Reiprich]] ([[Stiftung Sächsische Gedenkstätten zur Erinnerung an die Opfer politischer Gewaltherrschaft|Stiftung Sächsische Gedenkstätten]], Germany), Paweł Ukielski ([[Warsaw Rising Museum]], Poland), Zsolt Szilágyi (Head of Cabinet of [[László Tökés]], [[Vice-President of the European Parliament]]), and Toomas Hiio (Estonian Institute of Historical Memory). Andreja Valič Zver (Study Centre for National Reconciliation, Slovenia) was a member 2011–2015.

The Platform has offices in [[Prague]] and [[Brussels]]. Neela Winkelmann serves as managing director of the Platform.&lt;ref name="BSTU"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/BundesbeauftragteUndBehoerde/Aktuelles/2011_10_14_prag.html |title= Meilenstein in Prag: Europäische Aufarbeitungs-Plattform gegründet |author= |date= |work= |publisher= [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]] | archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/62iR1p3kO | archivedate =25 October 2011  |accessdate= 2011-10-25 | quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the institution's Board of Trustees was elected. The first elected members were [[Sandra Kalniete]] MEP, [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] MEP, [[Tunne Kelam]] MEP, [[László Tökés]] MEP, and [[Milan Zver]] MEP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2012/07/01/platform-appoints-board-of-trustees-and-elects-8-new-members/ Platform appoints Board of Trustees and elects 8 new Members], Platform of European Memory and Conscience, 29 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the Board of Trustees includes the original members as well as [[Paweł Robert Kowal]] MEP, [[Werner Schulz]] MEP, [[Monica Macovei]] MEP, [[Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė]] MEP, former Czech Senator [[Martin Mejstřík]], former Czech Deputy Prime Minister [[Alexandr Vondra]], former Solidarność leader [[Wojciech Roszkowski]] MEP, historian [[Stéphane Courtois]], journalist [[Anne Applebaum]], former Prime Minister of Slovenia [[Janez Janša]], and Czech actor [[Ondřej Vetchý]].

==Activities==
The platform will co-ordinate the study of the totalitarian past on the European level. According to [[Daniel Herman]], the Director of the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]], one of the first joint projects might be a European history textbook.&lt;ref name="praguemonitor" /&gt;

{{quote|text=When the countries of the former Eastern bloc entered the EU, their totalitarian communist past became a part of the European heritage|sign=Daniel Herman|source=Prague Daily Monitor}}

On 5 June 2012, the Platform of European Memory and Conscience and the [[Reconciliation of European Histories Group]] hosted the conference Legal Settlement of Communist Crimes in the [[European Parliament]], under the auspices of [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]] and [[Jerzy Buzek]], devoted to the issue of forming a special court tribunal for the crimes of communism, and "raising the issue of justice for the most serious crimes committed by the Communist dictatorships in Central and Eastern Europe from the national to a European level." The conference was a response "to growing calls for strengthened international justice formulated e.g., in the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2009/05/15/conference-programme/ Legal Settlement of Communist Crimes], Platform of European Memory and Conscience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eureconciliation.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/june-5th-conference-in-the-ep-legal-settlement-of-communist-crimes/ June 5th Conference in the EP: "Legal Settlement of Communist Crimes"], [[Reconciliation of European Histories Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conference, the Platform of European Memory and Conscience founded an international legal expert group to "work on a road map for establishing a supranational institution of justice" devoted to the "crimes committed by the Communist dictatorships."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoryandconscience.eu/2012/06/07/platform-will-seek-establishment-of-a-supranational-court-for-international-crimes-committed-by-communists/ Platform will seek establishment of a supranational court for international crimes committed by Communists], Platform of European Memory and Conscience, 7 June 2012&lt;!-- https://www.webcitation.org/68IkJKd72 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Si Tandang Bacio Macunat''''' (lit. Old Man Bacio Macunat), alternatively spelled as '''''Si Tandang Basio Macunat''''', is a work written by Spanish friar, Miguel Lucio Bustamante published in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] in the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|Spanish Philippines]]. It is known for its premise which argues that education is undesirable to indios or [[Filipino People|native Filipinos]], a criticism against the pursuit of education by members of the [[Ilustrado]] class.&lt;ref name="transgression"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reyes|first1=Soledad|title=Transgression and Absolution in ''Si Tandang Basio Macunat'' (1885)†|journal=Budhi|date=1998|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.13185/495|url=http://journals.ateneo.edu/ojs/budhi/article/viewFile/495/497|accessdate=12 February 2016|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philstudiesuppress"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Patajo-Legasto|editor1-first=Priscelina|title=Philippine Studies: Have We Gone Beyond St. Louis?|date=2008|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|location=Diliman, Quezon City|isbn=9715425917|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=uF6WDAQHu08C&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;ots=z1AJxf8uzc&amp;dq=si%20tandang%20basio%201885&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q=si%20tandang%20basio&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
*Gervasio "Bacio" Macunat – An old farmer whom the narrator of the story meets. The eponymous character lacks ambition and accepts his sociopolitical position as an indio. He is critical of education preferring to remain on his farm working with his carabao. He claims that if he deviates from this expectation it would mean rebelling against God and the King. He is married to Silia with whom he has many children. His father is likewise obedient and a strict person. Bacio narrates an eye-witness account of his father about a indio youth known as Proper to the narrator.
*The Narrator – the character who remains unnamed throughout the story, in an effort to understand society the narrator travels through many towns around Manila meeting Bacio. He is supportive of giving indios access to education.
*Prospero "Proper" – A youth who belongs to a indio [[ilustrado|middle class]] family with Andres Baticot and Maria Dimaniuala as his parents. Proper described in a story as a good Christian at the start of the narrative along with his sister, Pili, was sent to Manila for education by the cabeza with his father's consent. He returns to town as a hedonistic and arrogant person as a result of his education in Manila and causes misdeeds which brings tragedy to his family.
*Felicita "Pili" – Proper's sister who worried about the sending of his brother to Manila. She is also the cousin of Bacio's father.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24197">The '''Siemens Competition''' was a science competition funded by the [[Siemens Foundation]], which was administered by the [[College Board]] from 1999-2013 and by [[Discovery Education]] from 2014-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens Competition|url=https://siemenscompetition.discoveryeducation.com/|publisher=Discovery Education|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Siemens Foundation released a statement on February 1, 2018 stating that the 2017 iteration of the competition was the final one. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens Competition|url=https://www.siemens-foundation.org/programs/siemens-competition-archives|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Siemens AG]] purchased [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]'s power generation unit in 1997, but sponsorship of the [[Westinghouse Science Talent Search]] (now the [[Regeneron Science Talent Search]]) was not part of the deal. When Siemens lost the bidding for the competition to [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], Siemens decided to create the [[Siemens Foundation]] to continue the tradition using the well-known Westinghouse name, calling the new competition the Siemens Westinghouse Competition (SWC) and, later, the Siemens Competition. The first awards were given in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Fairs Pump Up the Rewards of Talent|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/1999/12/science-fairs-pump-rewards-talent|publisher=Science|date=6 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition had the same goals as the old Westinghouse Competition, but with several added dimensions, most notably awards for team projects and regional awards. The regional finals were held in cooperation with six partner universities: [[MIT]], [[Georgia Tech]], [[Caltech]], [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[the University of Notre Dame]], and [[Carnegie Mellon]].&lt;ref name="process"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/competition/competition_process.htm | title=Siemens Foundation: Competition Process | accessdate = 2007-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2007 was the first year that women won the top prizes in both the individual and team competitions at Siemens.
The individual winner was Isha Jain of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and the top team winners were Janelle Schlossberger and Amanda Marinoff of Plainview, New York.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voanews.com/learningenglish/home/a-23-2007-12-13-voa1-83133097.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Siemens Competition ran for 18 years. On February 1, 2018, the Siemens Foundation announced that the 2017 competition would be its last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SIEMENS COMPETITION IS ENDING.|url=https://www.siemens-foundation.org/programs/siemens-competition-archives|website=Siemens Foundation|publisher=Siemens Foundation|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selection process ==

Each year, research reports submitted before a late-September to early-October deadline were subjected to a blind reading. 300 outstanding research reports, from more than 1600 entries, were selected as semifinalists. All semifinalists received a special recognition package, with their names announced in a full page USA Today advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Process|url=http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/competition/competition_process.htm|publisher=Siemens Foundation|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the pool of semifinalists, 30 individuals and 30 teams (2-3 students) were selected as Regional Finalists and invited to compete during the month of November at one of the six partner universities (Caltech, UT Austin, Notre Dame, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Ga. Tech). In addition to project content, judging was also based on the oral presentation, poster display, cited references, and the question and answer session. All regional finalists received $1,000 scholarships and bronze medals. One individual and one team from each region advanced to the National Finals. These Regional winners received $3,000 (individual) or $6,000 (total for teams) scholarships, and silver medals.

The National Finalists (6 individual and 6 team projects) received an all-expense paid trip during the first weekend of December to Washington, DC. Winners of the Nationals received scholarships ranging from $10,000 to the coveted $100,000 grand prize for the top individual and top team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siemens Competition Scholarships|url=http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/competition/scholarships.htm|publisher=Siemens Foundation|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silvina Fabars''' (born 1944) is a Cuban folk dancer and ballerina who is the principal dancer of the [[National Folkloric Ensemble of Cuba]] and a noted folk dance instructor throughout Latin America and Europe. She has won numerous awards and recognition throughout her career including the ''Vanguardia Nacional'', the ''Distinción por la Cultura Nacional'' (Distinction of the National Culture), and the Alejo Carpentier Medal. In 2014, she was honored as the recipient of the National Dance Prize of Cuba.

==Biography==
Silvina Fabars Gilall was born on 22 February 1944 in [[Santiago de Cuba]], [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Silvina Fabars Gilall|url=http://www.encaribe.org/es/article/silvina-fabars-gilall/1185|website=Enciclopedia de Historia y Cultura del Caribe|publisher=Comité Científico Técnico General de la enciclopedia|accessdate=6 February 2016|location=Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ancestry includes grandparents from [[Guinea]] and [[Ghana]], who helped raise her. As a child, she was taught to read and write by an aunt and was only able to attend elementary school for 2 or three years, as her labor was needed. She worked in the [[Sugarcane|cane fields]], planted sweet potatoes, picked coffee and hauled wood and water. She lived in a community of [[Haitians]] and learned their folk dances and [[patois]].&lt;ref name="Díaz Rondón, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Díaz Rondón|first1=Francisnet|title=Silvina Fabars, una diosa de la danza|url=http://www.vanguardia.cu/cultura/2369-silvina-fabars-una-diosa-de-la-danza|accessdate=6 February 2016|publisher=''Vanguardia''|date=19 December 2014|location=Havana, Cuba|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fourteen, she joined [[Fidel Castro]]'s rebel army in the [[Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution#Guerrilla war in the Sierra Maestra: 1956–58|Sierra Maestra]] and participated in the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cubadebate"&gt;{{cite news|title=Silvina Fabars, Premio Nacional de Danza 2014|url=http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2014/04/19/silvina-fabars-premio-nacional-de-danza-2014/#.VrYFjtA2UVI|accessdate=6 February 2016|publisher=''[[Cubadebate]]''|date=19 April 2014|location=Havana, Cuba|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1959, she began working at the airport in San Antonio de los Banos as a member of the legendary [[Mariana Grajales Coello|Mariana Grajales]] Women's Squad. Around the same time, she co-founded the first Cuban folk dancing company, known as the ''Ballet Folklórico de Oriente'' (Eastern Folk Dancing Company), where she performed as a singer and dancer until 1965.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

In 1966, Fabars was invited by the playwright and theater director, Eugenio Hernández Espinosa, to come to Havana and try out for the National Folkloric Ensemble ({{lang-es|Conjunto Folclórico Nacional}}) (CFN).&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; She was hired as a singer, but after a serious accident which damaged her vocal chords, was offered a position as a hairdresser or makeup artist.&lt;ref name="Díaz Rondón, 2014" /&gt; Fabars was determined to continue performing as a dancer. Unfamiliar with the folk dances and traditions of the western part of Cuba, she studied with the anthropologist [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández]], as well as many of the company's premier dancers,&lt;ref name="Sánchez, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sánchez|first1=Martha|title=Silvina Fabars: an eternal queen of movement|url=http://oncubamagazine.com/culture/silvina-fabars-an-eternal-queen-of-movement/|accessdate=6 February 2016|publisher=''On Cuba Magazine''|date=3 January 2014|location=Miami, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Santiago Alfonso, Luisa Barroso, Nieves Fresneda, Zenaida Hernandez and Emilio O’Farrill.&lt;ref name="Camejo, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Camejo|first1=Katia|others=Translator: Fanego, Pedro A.|title=Silvina Fabars, the Ebony Goddess|url=http://www.cadenahabana.cu/2014/05/07/silvina-fabars-the-ebony-goddess/|accessdate=6 February 2016|publisher=Radio Cadena Habana|date=7 May 2014|location=Havana, Cuba}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, she was offered a professorship to teach dance and the following year, she became the principal dancer of the CFN.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; Some of her most noted performances include ''Yoruba Iyessá'' by the Mexican choreographer [[Rodolfo Reyes Cortés]], which became a signature piece for Fabars; ''Ciclo Congo''; ''Arara'', which features spinning movements with a basket on her head;&lt;ref name="Sánchez, 2014" /&gt; and ''Rumbas y comparsas'', in which she was the zebra. She has performed in most of the repertoire productions of the CFN and has performed throughout the world, including in Algeria, Angola, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, England, France, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Martinique, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Spain, and the United States.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

In addition to teaching at the CFN, Fabars has taught throughout the country and helped establish groups and dance companies. As a teacher for the International Laboratory of Cuban Folklore which is a biannual course offered to teach Cuban dance, she has taught at the [[University of Alberta]], in Canada; [[University of Liverpool]] and [[University of London]] in England; at the Tokyo Cultural Center of Japan, as well as in Cuba,&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; Russia and Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Camejo, 2014" /&gt; She spent two years in Venezuela helping the ministry of culture develop a folk dance company&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; before returning to Cuba and establishing a folk dance training facility at the House of Culture in [[Camagüey]], where she currently teaches.&lt;ref name="Cubadebate" /&gt;

Throughout her career, Fabars has won many honors. As part of the CFN, she has shared in awards which include the Golden Sandal trophy from Festidanza 1974 held in [[Arequipa]], Peru; in the Golden Barrel and Silver Necklace awarded by the 30th International Vineyard Festivities of Dijon, France (1975); the Silver Platter from the 1976 Billingham Folkloric  Festival of [[Billingham]], England;{{sfn|Orovio|2004|p=148}} and the Golden Temple trophy from the 1988 Almond Blossom Festival of [[Agrigento]], [[Sicily]],&lt;ref name="Vasallo, 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vasallo|first1=María del Carmen|title=Conjunto Folklórico Nacional: medio siglo en la escena|url=http://www.cubasi.cu/cubasi-noticias-cuba-mundo-ultima-hora/item/6352-conjunto-folklorico-nacional-medio-siglo-en-la-escena|accessdate=6 February 2016|publisher=''Cuba Sí''|date=7 May 2012|location=Havana, Cuba|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; among many others. Her individual awards include the ''Vanguardia Nacional'' (National Vanguard), the ''Distinción por la Cultura Nacional'' (Distinction of the National Culture), and the Alejo Carpentier Medal.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; In 2014, she was honored as the recipient of the National Dance Prize of Cuba.&lt;ref name="Sánchez, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Camejo, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Díaz Rondón, 2014" /&gt;

[[File:New US-UK Fulbright Logo.jpeg|thumb|US-UK Fulbright Commission]]
'''The US-UK Fulbright Commission''' was created by a treaty signed by both countries on 22 September 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Fact Sheet for Fulbright Scholars, Partners and Press&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a non-profit organisation based in London, UK.  Its aim is to foster mutual cultural understanding through educational exchange between both nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://exchanges.state.gov/academicexchanges/index/fulbright-program.html&lt;/ref&gt;  To do this, Fulbright helps students, scholars and professionals interested in studying abroad in the US or UK through its world-renowned scholarship programme and its [[EducationUSA]] advice service.

==Global Fulbright Programme ==
The US-UK Fulbright Commission is part of the worldwide [[Fulbright Program]]. This is one of the most prestigious and well-known scholarship programmes. The global programme was conceived by [[J William Fulbright|Senator J. William Fulbright]] after the [[Second World War]] to promote leadership, learning and empathy between nations through educational exchange.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cies.org/senator_fulbright.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The global programme operates over 155 countries and has supported 300,000 alumni in exchanges to and from the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://fulbright.state.gov/uploads/80/52/8052426b30e4a3b1e628bfccfd8bbaab/2010-Fulbright-fact-sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  
Within the global Fulbright programme, 28 alumni have served as head of state or government, 11 Fulbright alumni have been elected to [[US Congress]], 1 Fulbright alumnus has served as Secretary-General of the [[UN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bolivia.usembassy.gov/educational_exchange/fulbright-scholars.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234834/http://bolivia.usembassy.gov/educational_exchange/fulbright-scholars.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 43 Fulbright alumni from 11 countries have received the [[Nobel Prize]] (including 2 in 2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iie.org/en/Alumni/Nobel-Laureates |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317002009/http://www.iie.org/en/Alumni/Nobel-Laureates |archivedate=17 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 78 alumni have received [[Pulitzer Prize]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iie.org/en/Alumni/Pulitzer-Prize-Winners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701234811/http://www.iie.org/en/Alumni/Pulitzer-Prize-Winners |archivedate=1 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UK Fulbright Awards ==
There are several scholarship programmes operating between the US and UK. However, the US-UK Fulbright Commission is the only organisation offering scholarships on a bi-national basis, in any field and at any university.&lt;ref&gt;http://fulbright.state.gov/participating-countries/europe-and-eurasia/united-kingdom.html&lt;/ref&gt;  According to its website, Fulbright offers a wide range of programmes including Distinguished Chairs for senior academics, postgraduate study scholarships, professional awards and Summer Institutes for younger students. 
Since 1948, the UK Commission has supported approximately 15,000 British nationals on exchanges to the US and nearly 12,000 Americans to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Fact Sheet for Fulbright Scholars, Partners and Press&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, around 50 UK and 50 US citizens received grants annually in the US and UK respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://us.fulbrightonline.org/program_country.html?id=112&lt;/ref&gt;

== EducationUSA Advisory Service ==
In addition to its scholarships, Fulbright provides information on and promotes US-UK exchange. In 2009/10, 8,861 British students studied in the US,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data&lt;/ref&gt; and with the rise of tuition at UK universities, there has been increased interest in US study.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11832373&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, another 45,000+ Americans studied in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iie.org/en/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data&lt;/ref&gt; 
Fulbright’s advisory service is part of the EducationUSA network of over 450 advising centres worldwide. The advisors are the UK's official source of information on educational exchange opportunities to the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationusa.info/about.php&lt;/ref&gt;  Advisors are able to provide accurate, unbiased information about all accredited US higher education institutions. 
Fulbright’s website provides a lot of information on how to apply to US universities. They also offer events on US study, such as their College Day undergraduate university fair each autumn, a Grad School Day workshop in the spring, student and parent seminars throughout the year, webinars and advisor training. Students can also get additional advice by phone, email and in person at their office in Battersea.

==Funding and administration==
The US-UK Commission is funded partially by the US State Department and UK government through BIS. They get additional support from individual and institutional partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://fulbright.state.gov/uploads/80/52/8052426b30e4a3b1e628bfccfd8bbaab/2010-Fulbright-fact-sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Fulbright is governed by a Board of Commissioners that includes representatives nominated by the US and UK governments. Work is carried out by ten full-time staff and participants in their internship programme.
The [[Fulbright-Hays Act of 1961]] states that the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] (ECA) administers the global Fulbright Program under policy guidelines set by the [[J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board]] (FSB). ECA does this with assistance of bi-national commissions and foundations, U.S. embassies, and cooperating agencies in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cies.org/Fulbright/&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Institute of International Education]] (IIE) and [[Council for International Exchange of Scholars]].

==Alumni==
The British Fulbright Scholars Association (BFSA) is the alumni association for British Fulbright Scholars. The BFSA is a private, non-profit organisation that promotes transatlantic relationships and international understanding through its network of Fulbright scholars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bfsa.org&lt;/ref&gt; US-UK Fulbright alumni are also invited to join the State Alumni&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://alumni.state.gov/landing-page |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519211225/https://alumni.state.gov/landing-page |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fulbright Association]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fulbright.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universal Forum of Cultures''' ({{lang-ca|'''Fòrum de les Cultures'''}}, {{lang-es|'''Fórum de las culturas'''}}) is an international cultural event intended to take place every three years. This event is organized by [[Forum Foundation]].

The first Forum was held in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]] (Spain), from May 9 to September 26, 2004. It was organized by Barcelona's local council, the Catalan government (the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]]), the Spanish Government and [[UNESCO]]. It was conceived by Catalan prime mover ([[Pasqual Maragall]], then Mayor of Barcelona) as a way of promoting the city's burgeoning [[tourist industry]] in the wake of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]]. The official aims of the [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures]] included support for peace, sustainable development, human rights and respect for cultural diversity. However, many [[NGO]]s (including [[Greenpeace]] and [[Amnesty International]]) criticised the event for failing to live up to these lofty ideals and boycotted it as a result.

The event was controversial, with critics pointing to the $2.3 billion price tag and commercial sponsorship by multinationals ([[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]], [[Nestlé]], [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Telefónica]], and [[Indra sistemas|Indra]]) with dubious reputations in the [[Third World]]. Several groups also criticised the massive property and coastline destruction involved in building the Forum site. This may explain why the Forum fell so far short of its projected attendance figures for the 141-day event. The forecasts were progressively scaled back from the planning stage, to 7 million and then 5 million during the event. The official final attendance figure was around 3.5 million, although even this figure is hotly disputed.

The [[2007 Universal Forum of Cultures]] was held in [[Monterrey]], Mexico. The event  promoted  Native American  and "White" cultures.

For the third edition (2010), candidate cities were [[Chicago]] (United States), [[Amsterdam]] ([[Netherlands]]), [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] (Japan), [[Alexandria]] ([[Egypt]]), [[Suwon]] and [[Gwangju]] ([[South Korea]]), [[Santiago de Chile]] and [[Valparaíso]] ([[Chile]]), [[Budapest]] (Hungary) and [[Durban]] ([[South Africa]]). [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]] was selected as host for the 2010 Universal Forum of Cultures.
[[Naples]], Italy was selected as host for the 2013 Universal Forum of Cultures, while both [[Quebec City]], Canada and [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] were selected to host the 2016 forum. Quebec City decided to back off and give Amman the whole organisation of the event.

'''William Alphonsus Scott''' (1871–1921) was  a well-known Irish [[Roman Catholic]] ecclesiastical architectural historian, academic, and architect active throughout late—nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century [[Ireland]]. His offices were first located in [[Drogheda]], later located at 45 [[Mountjoy Square, Dublin]].

==Career==
Scott was apprenticed to [[Thomas Newenham Deane]] in the early 1890s. Deane was [[Superintendent of National Monuments]]. He worked in London from 1899 to 1902 and was there influenced by the Arts &amp; Crafts movement. His ecclesiastical work, mostly for Catholic churches, was influenced by  Early Irish Christian and Byzantine architecture. In 1911, he was appointed Chair of Architecture at [[University College, Dublin]], succeeding the eminent [[Sir Thomas Drew]]. Much of his was completed by fellow academic [[Rudolf Maximilian Butler]] (1872–1943), then of 23 [[Kildare Street]], [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;Irish Architectural Archive, Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720-1940. http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/3948 (accessed 21 July 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wolf Schneider 2437.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Wolf Schneider]]
'''Wolf Schneider''' (born 7 May 1925 in [[Erfurt]]) is a [[Germans|German]] [[journalist]], [[author]] and [[language critic]].

== Life ==
Wolf Schneider grew up in Berlin. Having passed his [[Abitur]] he served with the German [[Luftwaffe]] until the end of the war. His post-war career began as a translator for the US Army, in 1947 he joined the Munich-based [[Neue Zeitung]], a newspaper of the US military government. It was here that he received journalistic training and later worked as an editor. In the early 1950s Schneider was a correspondent for the news agency [[Associated Press|AP]]; in later years he was in charge of the news team and correspondent in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] for the ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]''.

In 1966 Schneider joined the ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' magazine, where he worked as [[editor in chief]] and from 1969 as manager of the publishing house. German media tycoon [[Axel Springer]] hired Schneider in 1971 to design the news magazine ''Dialog'' aimed at challenging [[Der Spiegel|Spiegel's]] dominant position in the German market. The project ended in failure, however, and Schneider was appointed editor in chief of Springer’s conservative daily ''[[Die Welt]]'', based in Hamburg. A commentary on the Chilean dictator [[Pinochet]] deemed too critical by Springer cost Schneider his job within a year of his appointment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Schneider remained at Springer as editor in chief without portfolio. In 1979 he was appointed first director of the newly founded Hamburg school of journalism, now called [[Henri-Nannen-Schule]]). He was to hold this position until 1995. He taught more than 300 pupils, many of whom are now in leading positions. He also became widely known during this time as the godfather of concise German prose.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In the 1980s and early 90s he also presented the [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] talkshow.

Schneider lives in [[Starnberg]].

== Language critic ==
Since 1995 Wolf Schneider has been a vigorous lecturer on the German language and has been giving seminars for press officers and young journalists. He is a prolific writer and has produced 28 best-selling nonfiction books, among them staple works on good German style (e.g. „German for life. What school forgot to teach“). His latest works are „Speak German“ – a defence of the German language in the face of Anglicisms and „Man: A career“ which tells the story of Man’s rise to mastery of the Earth and plots our uncertain future.

His ideal is a concise written style, which avoids the typically German pitfalls of rambling sentences, separated verbs and complex constructions. Schneider is a critic of orthography reform and has founded with others the pressure group „living German“.

He has received several prizes and holds a chair as honorary professor in [[Salzburg]].
