'''Abdul Latif Galadari ''' (born on 1939) is the youngest son of Ebrahim Galadari. The late Abdul Latif, along with his elder brother, Abdul Rahim, who died in 1994, headed the Galadari Group, which was involved in a variety of industrial and business activities. He along with his brother created a new wave of companies.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/rich-list-2009/list?view=profile&amp;itemid=150343#.VZY0A_kirIV&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Abdul Latif Galadari was born in 1939, as the youngest son of Ebrahim Galadari and grandson of merchant Hassan Galadari. The business tradition stretched as far back as his grandfather, Hassan Galadari, who was a businessman in 1879.As a young man, Abdul Latif Galadari studied in [[Beirut]] [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/rich-list-2009/list?view=profile&amp;itemid=150343#.VZY0A_kirIV |title=Rich List |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
The Galadari Brother’s Group was fuelled initially by the entrepreneurial vision of the late Abdul Rahim E. Galadari, the late Abdul Latif E. Galadari, and the late Abdul Wahab E. Galadari in the early 1960s.This group created a new wave of companies and furthered the entrepreneurial vision to the family business. The three brothers were also involved in the gold business, which had made them multimillionaires by the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/BankruptinDubai1983.shtm&lt;/ref&gt; It was from this generation that another three brothers created the Ilyas &amp; Mustafa Galadari Group, started by Ilyas &amp; Mustafa Galadari, as well as Galadari Investment Office, formed by their younger brother Rashid A.W. Galadari. Abdul Latif Galadari and his two brothers were well placed to take advantage of Dubai's 1970s Oil Boom. Together they started a major conglomerate, building the Intercontinental Hotel, opening Dubai Bank, establishing a Mazda Vehicle Dealership, starting Dubai's first English Language Daily Newspaper - the Khaleej Times - and opening a string of construction, engineering, and trading companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaiasitusedtobe.com/pagesnew/BankruptinDubai1983.shtm |title=AW Galadari Dubai's First Bankrupt 1983 |publisher=Dubaiasitusedtobe.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also started GICC,which is the flagship company of the Galadari Brothers Group. GICC is the master franchisee for the Baskin-Robbins brand in the GCC, and is the world's largest franchisee for Baskin-Robbins with close to 700 stores spread across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman,Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. GICC has been the first company to introduce an international brand of ice cream in the area and has the largest store network in the Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) industry in the [[Persian Gulf]] region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/galadari-ice-cream-company-receives-developer-of-the-year-award-from-dunkin-brands-269935611.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galadari's wealth is largely invested in real estate, including in the City of Arabia, a 20 million sq.ft.plot on Emirates Road. The land is earmarked for the Mall of Arabia, a project that will see the Galadaris build the largest and most expensive mall in the world.
The brothers' other assets include manufacturing concerns, a major taxi firm, a driving school, restaurants, hotels, and Sunseeker Yachts Middle East. They have Galadari Hotel in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="arabianbusiness.com"/&gt; They have already introduced over 30 global brands into the region. And their business is multi-industry, multi-product, multi-service and multi-national, overseeing operations across the Persian Gulf, Asia, and Australia. Until now, the Galadari Brothers have held a significant market share in the industries of Media, Automobiles, Food &amp; Beverage, Industrial and Technical products, Trucks &amp; Heavy Equipment, Engineering, Real Estate and Hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jd.ae/CompanyProfile.aspx?cid=7801 |title=J.D :: Galadari Rent A Car |publisher=Jd.ae |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Founded by Abdul Rahim and Abdul Latif Ibrahim Galadari in Dubai, the Galadari GroupHead Office remains in its city of origin while conducting activities in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, Sri Lanka, and Australia and employing over 4000 people, from more than 30 nationalities working across the world.
In 2015, the Galadari Brothers ranked 27th on Forbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/en/lists/people/pname/galadari-brothers/pid/84806/ |title=Galadari Brothers - Top Companies in the Arab World 2015 |publisher=Forbes Middle East |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adolf Törngren''' (27 April 1824 – 3 March 1895) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[jurist]] and [[industrialist]].

Törngren studied [[law degree]], but shortly after he [[Inheritance|inherited]] significant property and became industrialist. Törngren operated [[Nuutajärvi glassworks]] and later he had a significant role in [[industrialisation]] of [[Tampere]]. In 1861 he founded [[Tampella|Tampere Linen and Iron Industry Ltd]] together with [[Gustaf Wasastjerna]]. Törngren was co-founder of [[shipbuilding]] and engineering company [[Helsingfors Skeppsdocka]] in [[Helsinki]]. His [[investment]]s drove him into cash crisis, which caused him [[bankruptcy]].

In 1877 Törngren founded [[Metsä Board Tako|Tampere Asphalt- and Roof Membrane Works]] in old groundwood mill premises. While there was demand for such products, the company fell into trouble due to Törngren's optimistic business decisions, and he sold it later.

Törngren's son [[Adolf Törngren (doctor)|Adolf Törngren Jr.]] became a notable [[politician]].

== Nuutajärvi glassworks ==
Törngren studied [[jurisprudence]]&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; and graduated as [[jurist]] in 1845. He got title of [[varatuomari]] in 1848. He was his parents' only child who survived after them, and he [[Inheritance|inherited]] a large property. Following to death of his mother Eva Agatha in 1849, he inherited Nuutajärvi mansion and started developing it by draining [[wetland]]s, acquired [[Ayrshire cattle]] and engaged in [[forestry]]. The mansion area included also [[Nuutajärvi glassworks]] which was at the beginning leased to another operator, but in 1851 Törngren started took lead of the factory. He invested on two new furnaces, grinding shop and [[porcelain]] shop, and started [[pressed glass]] production first in Finland.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;

Törngren recruited skilled workforce from abroad to run Nuutajärvi glassworks. One of them was [[Prussia]]n-born [[bookkeeper]] [[Georg Franz Stockmann]], who run Törngren's glassware shop in [[Helsinki]] and later developed [[Stockmann|his own business]] from it.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;

== Beginning of Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus ==
In 1856 Törngren bought an area by lower rapids of [[Tammerkoski]] in [[Messukylä]] and got permissions for [[silk]] and [[linen]] manufacturing. As there was no industrial linen production in Finland, it is not known how Törngren got this business idea, but speculatively the initiator was Törngren's wife Sofia. Raw material was widely available, as flax growing was common in [[Häme Province|Tavastia]]. However, the factory plan was postponed due to complaints. Törngren met his old friend [[Gustaf Wasastjerna]], who had bought a nearby lot of an old [[ironworks]] at other side of the rapids in [[Tampere]] and planned to convert it into engineering works. The men decided to start business with joined forces, and Törngren applied for moving the location of his industrial rights to the other side of the river. A five-storey linen factory building was finished already in 1858 and taken into use in the following spring. Törngren's linen mill and Wasastjerna's engineering works were [[Merger|merged]] in 1861 as Tammerfors Linne- &amp; Jern-Manufaktur Aktie-Bolag ("Tampere Linen and Iron Industry Ltd") but kept as separate business units. By the merger the men aimed to attract investors, but eventually they did not manage at gaining more capital because [[Osakeyhtiö|limited company concept]] was new in Finland, and Törngren and Wasastjerna finally owned 95% of the shares. The business developed favourably and in 1862 the linen mill was with its 755 workers the second biggest factory of Finland after the nearby [[Finlayson (company)|Finlayson]] cotton mill.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;

During 1856–1859 Törngren additionally operated small glassworks in Tourula, [[Yläne]]. After Törngren's father, [[Johan Agapetus Törngren]] died in 1859, he again leased out the Nuutajärvi glassworks and moved to Laukko in [[Vesilahti]], where he could manage his business in Tampere.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;

== Jokioinen baize factory ==
Törngren had invested a large sum on [[Jokioinen]] baize factory which moved its production to Tampere. When the company bankrupted in 1863, Törngren lost a large part of his property. The [[Famine of 1866–68|prevailing famine]] further weakened Törngren's affairs.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;

== Helsingfors Skeppsdocka ==
{{main|Helsingfors Skeppsdocka}}
Törngren left in Helsinki [[magistrate]] on 2 August 1864 an application for starting a shipyard and engineering works in [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Hietalahti]]. He applied for the premises an area which consisted 12,200&amp;nbsp;m² land and 9,500&amp;nbsp;m² water. After an assent of the city elders, [[Uusimaa Province]] governor and Senate Manufacturing Board, he was granted the permission for the business on 4 March 1865. Törngren appointed engineer Lieutenant Fridolin Stjernvall to make plans for the yard layout and the construction project was led by engineer Theodor Tallqvist.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.7-27"&gt;Osakeyhtiö Hietalahden...: ''Laivatelakan synty ja ensimmäiset toimintavuodet.'' pp. 7–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Törngren got run out of cash in 1866 and the construction project was halted. By then the costs had reached to 200,000 marks. Törngren made an arrangement in which the company ownership was transferred to Tampere Linen and Iron Industry to which he owed 435,000 marks. The work was continued under the same leadership after the transaction. The management of Tampere Linen and Iron Industry presumably planned selling the yard soon after the construction work was to be finished, but the yard required further large sums of money before becoming operative.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.7-27"/&gt; The yard was finally sold in 1880 with significant losses.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.28-37"&gt;Osakeyhtiö Hietalahden...: ''Toiminta Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Osakeyhtiön hallinnan alaisena.'' pp. 28–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bankruptcy ==
The large investments on the shipyard together with the Finnish monetary reform had caused Törngren running out of cash reserves in 1866.

After Törngren had decided to start business with Wasastjerna, he had sold the lot at Tammerkoski. His wife's younger brother [[Fredrik Idestam]] had built there a [[Nokia|groundwood mill, which he later moved to Nokia]]. In 1877 Törngren founded company [[Metsä Board Tako|Tampereen Asfaltti- ja Kattohuopatehdas Oy]] ("Tampere Asphalt- and Roof Membrane Works") that bought the old factory and converted it for [[Membrane roofing|asphalt membrane]] production. Due to new [[fire protection]] regulations, the material had high demand and it was applied on roofs in urban areas and [[railway station]]s. Törngren grew the business aggressively, and once again fell into financial troubles. He sold the business and moved to [[Pirkkala]], where he developed [[grain drying]] concepts, which were granted a [[patent]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;

== Political career ==
Törngren took part in a Finnish industrial development planning committee, installed by the [[Senate of Finland]] in summer 1856. In 1862 Törngren became selected to so-called January Committee by [[Finnish nobility|Nobility]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt; During [[Diet of Finland]] 1863–1864, he represented his family as member of Estate of Nobles.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; He had liberal views, and he supported development of [[Rail transport in Finland|railway network]]. Törngren initiated installing [[Supreme Court of Finland|Supreme Court]]; his proposal was approved, but implemented much later, after the [[Finnish Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Törngren was married in 1849 to daughter of [[Bergmeister]] [[Gustaf Idestam]], Sofia Charlotta (1830–1913). Their son [[Adolf Törngren (doctor)|Adolf Törngren Jr.]] became a notable [[politician]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt; Törngren spent the last years of his life in Haapaniemi Manor, where he died in 1895.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Adolf Törngren (1824-1895)"/&gt;

They married on December 22, 1907, at the Varaždin [[synagogue]]. After wedding, Ehrmann moved with his wife to Slavonski Brod, where his company was located. In 1909 their oldest daughter Ada was born. In 1912 Ehrmann family moved to Zagreb. In 1913 their second daughter Hedi was born, and in 1916 son Leon. In April 1918, Ehrmann moved with his family to Budapest, and in March 1919 they returned to Zagreb. Given the fact that Ehrmann family permanently settled in Zagreb, in 1922 architect [[Viktor Kovačić]] built the villa for the Ehrmann family which was located at Jurjevska ulica 23. Ehrmann and his family were known philanthropists who aided the poor and needy, city of Zagreb, various Catholic and Jewish organizations, [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] Croatia and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Jutarnji list (br. 9.571) 18. rujna 1938.

Ehrmann had invested a large sum of funds on the  castle reconstruction, which was in poor condition.&lt;ref name="FFSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Zemljišnoknjižni odjel Općinskog suda u Jastrebarskom, Zbirka isprava, Kupoprodajni ugovor

br. Z-1418/26, Čl. 1. ugovora.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], with the [[Independent State of Croatia]] regime in power, Ehrmann and his family were required to submit mandatory application of wealth to the office for the Jews at Ministry of Public economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} HDA-ZG, Fond obnove privrede Ministarstva narodnog gospodarstva, kutija 666.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ante Pavelić]] ordered that Ehrmann is to be treated as the representative of Portugal in Croatia.&lt;ref name = "holokaust u zagrebu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvat"/&gt; Ehrmann helped Jews escape the Independent State of Croatia, by issuing them visas for Portugal.&lt;ref name="ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "holokaust u zagrebu"/&gt; His son Leon was jailed in [[Nazi Germany]] as an officer of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] army, and his daughter Ada escaped to [[Split, Croatia|Split]] with her husband Julius Weinreb, which was under [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] occupation. During the war, Ehrmann helped, protected and saved the victims of the Nazi terror. From 1939 to 1942 he also gave considerable sums of money for the fight against the Nazis.&lt;ref name="FFSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} PAOB-ZG, Potvrda dr. Srećka Šilovića&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, although anti-fascist, Ehrmann was a class enemy of the newly established [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. Ehrmann right to a pension was not recognized, and his wealth and properties were not returned to him. He lived, with his wife, modestly until his death on April 13, 1965, in Zagreb. He was buried in the family grave at [[Mirogoj Cemetery]] arcades.&lt;ref name="FFSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Općina Medvešćak (Zagreb), Izvadak iz matične knjige umrlih, br. 215/65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Gradska groblja Zagreb: Aleksandar Ehrman, Mirogoj Ž-924-ARKP-13/1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Barbary Coast Trail medallion.jpg|thumb|A Barbary Coast Trail medallion]]

'''The Barbary Coast Trail''' is a walking tour connecting 20 historic sites and local history museums in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. Approximately 180 bronze medallions and arrows embedded in the sidewalk mark the 3.8-mile (6.1&amp;nbsp;km) trail.

The historic sites of the Barbary Coast Trail relate primarily to the period from the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849 to the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|Earthquake and Fire of 1906]], a period when San Francisco grew from a small village to the busiest port on the West Coast.

Sites along the trail include the Old Mint, a national historic landmark; [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]]; [[Maiden Lane (San Francisco)|Maiden Lane]]; Old St. Mary's, first Catholic cathedral West of the Rockies; T'ien Hou temple, first Asian temple in North America; Wells Fargo History Museum; [[Pony Express]] headquarters site; [[Jackson Square, San Francisco|Jackson Square Historic District]], which contains the last cluster of Gold Rush and Barbary Coast-era buildings in San Francisco; Old Ship Saloon, once a shanghaiing den; [[Coit Tower]]; [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, California|Fisherman's Wharf]]; [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park|SF Maritime National Historical Park]], which maintains a large collection of historic ships; and [[Ghirardelli Square]].

Each end of the Barbary Coast Trail is connected by the Hyde-Powell [[San Francisco cable car system|cable car]] line, itself a national historic landmark.

== History ==
The Barbary Coast Trail was founded by historian Daniel Bacon in collaboration with the [[San Francisco Museum and Historical Society|San Francisco Historical Society]]. The trail was inaugurated in May 1998 and originally marked with painted images. The first 150 bronze medallions to mark the trail were installed by 2000, with design by Daniel Bacon and illustrator Jim Blair.

In [[industrial chemistry]], '''black liquor''' is the waste product from the [[kraft process]] when digesting [[pulpwood]] into [[Pulp (paper)|paper pulp]] removing [[lignin]], [[hemicellulose]]s and other extractives from the wood to free the [[cellulose]] fibers.&lt;ref name="PSaT"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Per |editor1-last= Stenius |title= Forest Products Chemistry|edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 3 |year= 2000 |publisher= Fapet OY |location=Helsinki, Finland |language= |isbn=952-5216-03-9 |page= |pages= 62–78|chapter= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent material in the [[sulfite process]] is usually called brown liquor, but the terms red liquor, thick liquor and sulfite liquor are also used.

==Composition==

Approximately 7 tonnes of black liquor are produced in the manufacture of one tonne of pulp.&lt;ref name="bier"&gt;{{cite book |last=Biermann |first=Christopher J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Essentials of Pulping and Papermaking |year=1993 |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |location=San Diego |isbn=0-12-097360-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black liquor is an aqueous solution of lignin residues, hemicellulose, and the [[inorganic compound|inorganic chemicals]] used in the process. The black liquor comprises 15% solids by weight of which 10% are organic chemicals and 5% are inorganic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Pulping and Papermaking SE, 1996, {{ISBN|0-12-097362-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the organics in black liquor are 40-45% soaps{{Citation needed|reason=Unrealistic. Extractives, and soaps, are only a minor component of wood. See yield of tall oil from the Kraft process|date=September 2018}}, 35-45% lignin and 10-15% other organics.

The [[organic compound|organic matter]] in the black liquor is made up of water/alkali soluble degradation components from the wood.&lt;ref name="PSaT" /&gt; [[Lignin]] is degraded to shorter fragments with sulphur content at 1-2% and sodium content at about 6% of the dry solids. [[Cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]] is degraded to aliphatic carboxylic acid soaps and hemicellulose fragments. The extractives gives [[tall oil]] soap and crude [[turpentine]]. The soaps contain about 20% sodium.

The residual lignin components currently serve for hydrolytic or pyrolytic conversion or just burning only. Hemicellulosis may undergo fermentation processes, alternatively.

==History==
Early kraft pulp mills discharged black liquor to watercourses. Black liquor is quite toxic to aquatic life, and causes a very dark [[caramel color]] in the water.  The invention of the [[recovery boiler]] by G.H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s, was a milestone in the advancement of the kraft process.&lt;ref name="eero"&gt;{{cite book |author= E. Sjöström |title= Wood Chemistry: Fundamentals and Applications |publisher= [[Academic Press]]|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000,{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} the better kraft mills recovered 99.5% or more of the black liquor, and purified the remainder in biological treatment plants, reducing the environmental effect of the waste waters below the level of scientific significance, except perhaps in very small streams. Even in the 21st century, some small kraft mills remained (producing at most a few tons of pulp per day) that discharged all black liquor.  However, these are rapidly disappearing. Some kraft mills, particularly in North America,{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} still recovered under 98% of the black liquor in 2007, which can cause some environmental contamination, even when biologically treated.  The general trend is for such obsolete mills to modernize or shut down.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Usage==
The black liquor contains more than half of the energy content of the wood fed into the [[Kraft process|digester]] of a kraft pulp mill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paperstudies.org/research/projects/gasification/background.htm The Center for Paper Business and Industry Studies (CPBIS)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is normally concentrated to 65 - 80% by multi-effect [[evaporator]]s and burned in a [[recovery boiler]] to produce energy and recover the cooking chemicals. The [[viscosity]] increases as the concentration goes up. At about 50 - 55% solids the salt solubility limit is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fundamentals of the craft recovery process | last=Empie |first=H. Jeff |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2009|publisher=Tappi Press |location=USA |isbn=1-59510-186-1 |page=7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tall oil]] is an important [[byproduct]] separated from the black liquor with [[Skimmer (machine)|skimming]] before it goes to the evaporators or after the first evaporator stage.

===Energy source for the pulp mill===
[[Pulp mill]]s have used black liquor as an energy source since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="wpost"/&gt;
Most kraft pulp mills use [[recovery boiler]]s to recover and burn much of the black liquor they produce, generating steam and recovering the cooking chemicals ([[sodium hydroxide]] and [[sodium sulfide]] used to separate lignin from the cellulose fibres needed for papermaking). This has helped paper mills reduce problems with water emissions, reduce their use of chemicals by recovery and reuse, and become nearly energy self-sufficient by producing, on average, 66 percent of their own electricity needs on-site.

In the United States, paper companies have consumed nearly all of the black liquor they produce since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="wpost"&gt;{{cite news | title = Papermakers Dig Deep in Highway Bill To Hit Gold | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032703116.html | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = March 28, 2009 | accessdate=2009-06-03 | first=Steven | last=Mufson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the forest products industry has become one of the United States' leading generators of carbon-neutral renewable energy, producing approximately 28.5 terawatt hours of electricity annually.

===Use as biofuel feedstock===

====Gasification====
[[File:Svartlut 76.jpg|thumb|Black liquor as used for gasification]]
New [[waste-to-energy]] methods to recover and utilize the energy in the black liquor have been developed. The use of [[black liquor gasification]] has the potential to achieve higher overall [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] than the conventional recovery boiler, while generating an energy-rich [[syngas]] from the liquor. The syngas can be burnt in a [[gas turbine]] [[combined cycle]] to produce electricity (usually called ''BLGCC'' for Black Liquor Gasification Combined Cycle; similar to [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]]) or converted through [[Catalysis|catalytic processes]] into chemicals or fuels such as [[methanol]], [[dimethyl ether]] (DME), or [[Fischer-Tropsch process|F-T]] diesel (usually called ''BLGMF'' for Black Liquor Gasification for Motor Fuels). This gasification technology is currently under operation in a 3 MW pilot plant at [[Chemrec|Chemrec’s]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemrec.se/ Chemrec] website&lt;/ref&gt; test facility in [[Piteå]], [[Sweden]]. The DME synthesis step will be added in 2011 in the "BioDME" project, supported by the [[European Commission]]'s [[Seventh Framework Programme]] (FP7) and the [[Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications (Sweden)|Swedish Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodme.eu/index.html BioDME Project] website&lt;/ref&gt;

Used for biofuels production, the black liquor gasification route has been shown to have very high [[Energy conversion efficiency|conversion efficiency]] and [[greenhouse gas]] reduction potential.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/media/WTW_Report_010307.pdf Well-to-Wheels analysis of future automotive fuels and powertrains in the European context] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304231419/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/media/WTW_Report_010307.pdf |date=2011-03-04 }}
EUCAR / Concawe /JRC Well-to-Wheels Report Version 2c, March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hydrothermal liquefaction====
[[Hydrothermal liquefaction]] is suitable for converting black liquor to advanced biofuels due to the process' ability to handle high moisture inputs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Ramirez|first2=Jerome|last3=Nguyen|first3=Jenny|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Lin|first6=Carol|last7=Rainey|first7=Thomas|title=Hydrothermal liquefaction of bagasse using ethanol and black liquor as solvents|journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining|date=10 Sep 2015|volume=9|issue=6|page=630-638|doi=10.1002/bbb.1578|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bbb.1578/}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Extraction of lignin====
Where [[recovery boiler]] capacity is limited and a bottleneck in the [[pulp mill]] the [[lignin]] in the black liquor may be extraordinary and exported or used as fuel in the mill's [[lime kiln]], thereby often replacing fossil based fuel with biofuel.

==U.S. tax credit 2007–2010==
A tax credit created by the U.S. Congress in 2005 as part of the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users|2005 Highway Bill]] to reward and support the use of liquid [[alternative fuel]] derived from hydrocarbons in the transportation sector was expanded in 2007 to include non-mobile uses of liquid alternative fuel derived from biomass.  This change meant that, in addition to fish processors, animal renderers and meat packers, kraft pulp producers became eligible for the tax credit as a result of their generation and use of black liquor to make energy.  For one large company ([[International Paper]]) this could amount to as much as $3.7 billion in benefits.&lt;ref name="wpost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73062&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1269301 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714135024/http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=73062&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1269301 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |title=International Paper Provides Update on Alternative Fuel Credits |publisher=[[International Paper]] |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Weyerhaeuser]] announced in May 2009 that it was also pursuing the tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/30580378/site/14081545/for/cnbc/ | title= Weyerhaeuser says applied to become qualified as alternative fuel mixer | publisher= [[CNBC]] | date= May 5, 2009 | accessdate=2009-06-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some{{Who|date=April 2013}} have criticized the paper industry's eligibility for the alternative fuel mix tax credit on the grounds that it is increasing fossil fuel use, the industry has countered that adding a fossil fuel is actually a requirement of the law and that, regardless, this does not result in a net increase in fossil fuel use since companies are merely replacing the existing fossil fuel they already mix with black liquor—natural gas—with one of the three fuels specified by the law: gasoline, kerosene or diesel. The bio-fuel credit for Black Liquor ended on January 1, 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9141">A '''chief data officer''' ('''CDO''') is a [[corporate officer]] responsible for enterprise wide governance and utilization of information as an asset, via [[data processing]], analysis, [[data mining]], information trading and other means. CDOs report mainly to the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO). Depending on the area of expertise this can vary. CDO is a member of the executive management team and manager of enterprise-wide data processing &amp; data mining.

==Role definition==

The Chief Data Officer title shares its abbreviation with the [[Chief Digital Officer]] but the two are not the same job. The Chief Data Officer has a significant measure of business responsibility for determining what kinds of information the enterprise will choose to capture, retain and exploit and for what purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bigdataparis.com/presentation/mercredi/PDelort.pdf?PHPSESSID=tv7k70pcr3egpi2r6fi3qbjtj6#page=11&lt;/ref&gt; However, the similar-sounding [[Chief Digital Officer]] or [[Chief Digital Information Officer]] often does not bear that business responsibility, but rather is responsible for the information ''systems'' through which data is stored and processed.

==History and evolution==

The role of manager for data processing was not elevated to that of senior management prior to the 1980s.  As organizations have recognized the importance of information technology as well as [[business intelligence]], [[data integration]], [[master data management]] and data processing to the fundamental functioning of everyday business, this role has become more visible and crucial. This role includes defining strategic priorities for the company in the area of data systems and opportunities, identifying new business opportunities pertaining to data, optimizing revenue generation through data, and generally representing data as a strategic business asset at the executive table.

With the rise in [[service-oriented architecture]]s (SOA), large-scale system integration, and heterogeneous data storage/exchange mechanisms ([[database]]s, [[XML]], [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]], etc.), it is necessary to have a high-level individual, who possesses a combination of business knowledge, technical skills, and people skills, guide data strategy. Besides the revenue opportunities, acquisition strategy, and customer data policies, the chief data officer is charged with explaining the strategic value of data and its important role as a business asset and revenue driver to executives, employees, and customers. This contrasts with the older view of data systems as mere [[Front and back ends|back-end]] IT systems.

More recently, with the adoption of [[data science]] the Chief Data Officer is sometimes looked upon as the key strategy person either reporting to the [[Chief Strategy Officer]] or serving the role of CSO in lieu of one. This person has the responsibility of measurement along various business lines and consequently defining the strategy for the next growth opportunities, product offerings, markets to pursue, competitors to look at etc.  This is seen in organizations like [[Chartis]], [[AllState]] and [[Fidelity]]

* [[Usama Fayyad]] was the first CDO for [[Yahoo!]] in 2004-2009 and he is now CDO of [[Barclays]] in London since 2013—he showed how the role can generate value by creating a $500 million new revenue source based on behavioral Targeting of Ads for [[Yahoo!]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chiefdataofficereurope.com/speaker/usama-fayyad/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506072020/http://www.chiefdataofficereurope.com/speaker/usama-fayyad/ |archivedate=2016-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maria Villar was appointed CDO at Fannie Mae and Justin Magruder was appointed CDO at Freddie Mac in 2007, in the months leading up to the 2008 Credit Crisis to assist the GSE's in implementing new financial control frameworks for risk management. Beth Hiatt succeeded Maria and Diane Schmidt succeeded Justin in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fanniemae.com/resources/file/ir/pdf/proxy-statements/2007_annual_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Henri Verdier was appointed in September 2014 Administrateur Général des Données (CDO) of the French Administration, probably the first CDO of a Country.&lt;ref&gt;ANDSI - The association of French CIOs http://www.andsi.fr/tag/henri-verdier/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zachary Townsend]] was appointed the inaugural CDO of [[California]] by [[Jerry Brown]] in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/people/Inaugural-Chief-Data-Officer-Appointed-California.html|title=Inaugural Chief Data Officer Appointed in California|website=www.govtech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role has wide authority around transparency, efficiency and accountability in state operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govfresh.com/2016/04/california-seeks-chief-data-officer/|title=California seeks chief data officer - GovFresh|date=13 April 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry and geographic trends in CDOs==

Many major Banks and Insurance companies, subsequent to the credit crisis of 2008, created the CDO role to ensure data quality and transparency for regulatory and [[risk management]] as well as analytic reporting.

Various branches of US Government have CDOs. The CDO role is far more common in the United States than elsewhere. However several European banks have a CDO.

==Professional skills and educational background in CDOs==
To better harness values of data, more and more organizations are establishing Chief Data Officer (CDO) position. The professional skills of CDOs are rather diverse because CDOs are expected to undertake a variety of roles in their companies including enterprise data architect, data quality and governance manager, business strategy leader, business regulation compliance officer, etc. CDO is an emerging research field, few studies have been done on CDO. This paper tries to profile what are the key professional skills and education background that current CDOs have by studying their resumes on LinkedIn using topic modeling technique. This work is a step forward towards understanding the roles of CDOs in organizations and what are the professional skills and experience they may need have in order to undertake their responsibilities of managing data and realizing its true values for their organizations.

A research team at University of Arkansas at Little Rock uses text mining and machine learning to analyze CDOs' resumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2017/AdvancesIS/Presentations/26/ 
 |title=Profiling Essential Professional Skills of Chief Data Officers Through Topic Modeling Algorithms
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the paper, on average each CDO has received two degrees. 
* 16.9% of them have a Ph.D. degree or doctoral degree;
*  62.2% have at least one master's degree.  
In terms of degree concentration, 
* 47.8% of them have a computer science, computer engineering, or information science degree; 
* 31.8% of them have a MBA degree; 
* 16.0% of them have a business, finance, or economics degree.

'''Corporate services''' are activities that combine or consolidate certain [[Business|enterprise]]-wide needed support services, provided based on specialized knowledge, [[best practices]], and technology to serve internal (and sometimes external) customers and business partners.  The term '''corporate services providers''' (CSPs) is also used.

In the United Kingdom, the public audit agencies produced a report in May 2007 called "Value for Money in public sector corporate services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.public-audit-forum.gov.uk/publicat.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102151250/http://www.public-audit-forum.gov.uk/publicat.htm |archivedate=2008-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides performance indicators in five categories: Finance, Human Resources, Information &amp; Communication Technology, Procurement, and Estates Management.

==Examples of Corporate Services==

===Business Advisory Service===

{{accounting}}
'''Creative accounting''' is a [[euphemism]] referring to [[accounting]] practices that may follow the letter of the rules of [[standard accounting practice]]s, but deviate from the spirit of those rules. They are characterized by excessive complication and the use of novel ways of characterizing income, assets, or [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and the intent to influence readers towards the interpretations desired by the authors. The terms "innovative" or "aggressive" are also sometimes used. Other synonyms include '''Cooking the books''' and '''[[Enron Scandal|Enronomics]]'''.

The term as generally understood refers to systematic misrepresentation of the true [[income]] and [[asset]]s of corporations or other organizations. "Creative accounting" has been at the root of a number of [[accounting scandals]], and many proposals for [[accounting reform]]&amp;nbsp;– usually centering on an updated analysis of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[factors of production]] that would correctly reflect how value is added.

Newspaper and television journalists have hypothesized that the [[stock market downturn of 2002]] was precipitated by reports of "accounting irregularities" at [[Enron]], [[MCI Inc.|Worldcom]], and other firms in the [[United States]].

One commonly accepted incentive for the systemic over-reporting of corporate income&lt;ref&gt;[[Corporate tax]]&lt;/ref&gt; which came to light in 2002 was the granting of [[stock option]]s as part of [[executive compensation]] packages. Since stock prices reflect earning reports, stock options could be most profitably exercised when income is exaggerated, and the stock can be sold at an inflated profit.

The most notable activist is [[Abraham Briloff]] ([[professor emeritus]] of [[CUNY Baruch]]) who for years wrote a column for ''[[Barron's Magazine|Barron's]]'' that constantly analyzed breaches of ethics and audit professionalism among [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] firms. His book is called ''Unaccountable Accounting''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham J. Briloff]]&lt;/ref&gt; The profession, in turn, was not kind to Dr. Briloff&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date = |url = http://aaahq.org/PublicInterest/newsletr/spring99/item07.htm|last = Owsen|first = Dwight M.|journal = In the Public Interest|publisher = American Accounting Association|volume = 27|issue = 2|publication-date = Spring 1999|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041221054447/http://aaahq.org/PublicInterest/newsletr/spring99/item07.htm|archivedate = December 21, 2004|title = The AICPA's Prosecution of Dr. Abraham Briloff, Some Observations}}&lt;/ref&gt; but much of what he advocated has been forced on the industry in the wake of the [[Enron scandal]] (See [[Sarbanes-Oxley]]).

According to critic [[David Ehrenstein]], the term "creative accounting" was first used in 1968 in the film [[The Producers (1968 film)|''The Producers'']] by [[Mel Brooks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/918-the-producers The Producers - From the Current - The Criterion Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Customer retention''' refers to the ability of a company or product to retain its customers over some specified period. High customer retention means customers of the product or business tend to return to, continue to buy or in some other way not defect to another product or business, or to non-use entirely. Selling organizations generally attempt to reduce [[Customer switching|customer defections]]. Customer retention starts with the first contact an organization has with a customer and continues throughout the entire lifetime of a relationship and successful retention efforts take this entire lifecycle into account. A company's ability to attract and retain new customers is related not only to its [[Product (business)|product]] or services, but also to the way it services its existing customers, the value the customers actually generate as a result of utilizing the solutions, and the reputation it creates within and across the [[marketplace]].

Successful customer retention involves more than giving the customer what they expect. Generating loyal advocates of the [[brand]] might mean exceeding customer expectations. Creating [[customer loyalty]] puts 'customer value rather than maximizing profits and [[shareholder value]] at the center of business strategy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Loyalty Effect: The hidden force behind growth, profits and lasting value |last=Reicheld |first=Frederick |year=1996 |publisher=Business Harvard Review |location=Watertown MA. |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key differentiation in a competitive environment is often the delivery of a consistently high standard of [[customer service]]. Furthermore, in the emerging world of [[Customer Success]] Retention is a major objective.&lt;ref&gt;Mehta N., Steinman D. and Murphy L.: Customer Success: How Innovative Companies Are Reducing Churn and Growing Recurring Revenue. Wiley. February 2016 Pg 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Customer retention has a direct impact on [[Profit (economics)|profitability]]. Research by John Fleming and Jim Asplund indicates that engaged customers generate 1.7 times more revenue than normal customers, while having engaged employees and engaged customers return a revenue gain of 3.4 times the norm.

== Measurement ==
The measurement of customer retention should distinguish between behavioral intentions and actual customer behaviors. The use of behavioral intentions as an indicator of customer retention is based on the premise that intentions are a strong predictor of future behaviors, such that customers who express a stronger repurchase intention toward a brand or firm will also exhibit stronger corresponding behaviors. Customer repurchase and retention behaviors can be measured in a variety of different ways which are enumerated in several award-winning articles published in the marketing discipline. The different studies that also involve different metrics to measure customer repurchase intention and actual repurchase behaviors are summarized in a series of review papers such as Keiningham and colleagues (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Keiningham, Timothy L., Bruce Cooil, Lerzan Aksoy, Tor W. Andreassen, and Jay Weiner. "The value of different customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics in predicting customer retention, recommendation, and share-of-wallet." Managing Service Quality: An International Journal 17, no. 4 (2007): 361-384.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gupta and Zeithaml (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Sunil, and Valarie Zeithaml. "Customer metrics and their impact on financial performance." Marketing Science 25, no. 6 (2006): 718-739.&lt;/ref&gt; and Morgan and Rego (2006).&lt;ref name="Morgan, Neil A. 2006"&gt;Morgan, Neil A., and Lopo Leotte Rego. "The value of different customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics in predicting business performance." Marketing Science 25, no. 5 (2006): 426-439.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies point to the following general conclusions:

#  Customer satisfaction is a strong predictor of both customer repurchase intentions and repurchase behavior
#  Repurchase intentions are statistically significantly, and positively associated with repurchase behavior: as people's repurchase intention increases, so does their likelihood to actually repurchase the brand. However, the magnitude of the association, though positive, is moderate to weak—suggesting that intentions and behaviors are not interchangeable constructs to measure customer retention.
#  The association between different retention metrics is not always straightforward. It can be (a) non-linear exhibiting increasing or diminishing returns, (b) different for different customer segments), and also vary by type of industry.
#  Customer retention is a strong predictor of a firm's financial success, both using accounting and stock market metrics. A study of a Brazilian bank showed that bank branches that were more adept at efficiently satisfying and retaining customers were more profitable than their counterparts that did one or the other but not both.&lt;ref name="Morgan, Neil A. 2006"/&gt;

In terms of measurement, the intention measures can typically be obtained using scale-items embedded in a customer survey. The retention behaviors must be measured using secondary data such as/ accounting measures of the volume (amount and financial value) and frequency with which a customer purchases the firm's goods or services. This requires that the firm should have a strong customer information management department that can capture all the relevant metrics that may be needed for analysis. In a typical firm, these may come from a diverse set of departments such as accounting, sales, marketing, finance, logistics, and other customer research.

== Antecedents and drivers ==
Customer retention is an outcome that is the result of several different antecedents as described below.
# [[Customer satisfaction]]: Research shows that customer satisfaction is a direct driver of customer retention in a wide variety of industries. Despite the claims made by some one-off studies, the bulk of the evidence is unambiguously clear: there is a positive association between customer satisfaction and customer retention/ though the magnitude of the association can vary based on a whole host of factors such as customer, product, and industry characteristics. Some companies and individuals have created mathematical models to evaluate customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022435993900032|title = Customer satisfaction, customer retention, and market share|last = Rust|first = Roland|date = 1993|journal = Journal of Retailing|doi = 10.1016/0022-4359(93)90003-2|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Customer delight]]: Some scholars argue that in today's competitive world, merely satisfying customers is not enough; firms need to delight customers by providing exceptionally strong service. It is delighted customers who are likely to stay with the firm, and improve overall customer retention.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Richard L., Roland T. Rust, and Sajeev Varki. "Customer delight: foundations, findings, and managerial insight." Journal of Retailing 73, no. 3 (1997): 311-336.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been argued that customer delight may be more strongly applicable to hedonic goods and services rather than for utilitarian products and services.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
# [[Customer switching]] costs: Burnham, Frels, and Mahajan&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Thomas A., Judy K. Frels, and Vijay Mahajan (2003), "Consumer Switching Costs: A Typology, Antecedents, and Consequences," Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 31 (2), 109−27.&lt;/ref&gt; (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;110) define switching costs as "one-time costs that customers associate with the process of switching from one provider to another."  Customers usually encounter three types of switching costs: (1) financial switching costs (e.g., fees to break contract, lost reward points); (2) procedural switching costs (time, effort, and uncertainty in locating, adopting, and using a new brand/provider); and (3) relational switching costs (personal relationships and identification with brand and employees).  A recent meta-analysis examined 233 effects from over 133,000 customers and found that all three types of switching costs increased customer retention—however, relational switching costs have the strongest association with customer repurchase intentions and behavior.
# [[Customer relationship management]]: Acknowledging the social and relational aspects—especially those embedded in services—it has been argued that firms can increase retention by focusing on managing customer relationships. Relationship management occurs when firms can take a longer-terms perspective, rather than a transactional perspective to managing their customer base. However, it should be noted that all long-term customers are not profitable, and worth retaining; sometimes, short-term transactional customers can be more profitable for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Reinartz, Werner J., and V. Kumar. "The impact of customer relationship characteristics on profitable lifetime duration." Journal of marketing 67, no. 1 (2003): 77-99.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, companies may have to strategically develop a framework to manage unprofitable customers.

== Customer lifetime value ==
[[Customer lifetime value]] enables an [[organization]] to calculate the net present [[Value (economics)|value]] of the [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] an organization will realize on a [[customer]] over a given period of time. Retention Rate is the percentage of the total number of customers retained in context to the customers that approached for cancelation.

== Standardization of customer service ==
Published standards exist to help organizations deliver process-driven [[customer satisfaction]] and [[Customer Success]] in order to increase the lifespan of a customer. [[The International Customer Service Institute]] (TICSI) has released The International Standard for Service Excellence (TISSE 2012). TISSE 2012 enables organizations to focus their attention on delivering excellence in the management of customer service, whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party certification scheme. TISSE 2012 focuses an organization's attention on delivering increased customer satisfaction by helping the organization through a Service Quality Model.  TISSE Service Quality Model uses the 5 P's - [[Policy]], [[business process|Processes]], [[People]], [[Premises]], [[Product (business)|Product]]/[[service (economics)|Service]], as well as performance [[measurement]]. The implementation of a customer service standard leads to improved customer service practices, underlying operating procedures and eventually, higher levels of customer satisfaction, which in turn increases [[customer loyalty]] and customer retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=TICSS2009 |last= The International Customer Service Standard |first= |year=2009 |publisher= The International Customer Service Institute |location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dan Roman''' is an entrepreneur, investor and IT professional with focus on emerging markets. In 1990, after the termination of the communist era in Romania, he was a pioneer in establishing one of the first private companies in the country, RBS Ltd. (Romanian Business Systems), that became the local market leader. Roman managed RBS as CEO and owner until 1995, when he sold the company to [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin.ro/articol_68550/dan-roman-fostul-presedinte-de-ca-al-st-deschide-in-romania-biroul-unei-firme-austriece.html |title=Dan Roman, fostul presedinte de CA al S&amp;T, deschide in Romania biroul unei firme austriece &amp;#124; IT&amp;C |publisher=Fin.ro |date=2011-10-31 |accessdate=2012-03-05 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he was appointed Director of IBM CER in Vienna, being responsible for countries in the [[Balkans]] and [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] area. In this capacity, he created for IBM a partner network and a framework for establishing local subsidiaries.

In 2000, Roman set up his own company, eNet Data G.m.b.H, based in Austria, dealing with IT services and solutions and with branches in a couple of countries from EE. eNet Data was acquired in 2002 by [[S&amp;T (company)|S&amp;T]], an Austrian IT public company.

'''Daniel "Donie" Cassidy''' (born 15 September 1945) is an Irish businessman and a former [[Fianna Fáil]] politician.&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;HouseNum=23&amp;MemberID=1886&amp;ConstID=206|title=Mr. Donie Cassidy|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) for the [[Westmeath (Dáil constituency)|Westmeath constituency]] from 2002 to 2007. From 1982 to 2002 and from 2007 to 2011, he served as a member of [[Seanad Éireann]].

==Early and personal life==
Cassidy was born in [[Castlepollard]] in [[County Westmeath]]. He came to prominence in Ireland through the showband scene. A saxophone player with Jim Tobin and the Firehouse, he moved into showbusiness management. He was the manager of [[Foster and Allen]], a popular singing duo that enjoyed success inside and outside Ireland.

==Political career==
He first became involved in politics in 1982 when he was elected as a Fianna Fáil [[Seanad Éireann|Senator]] on the [[Labour Panel]]. He was a member of [[Westmeath County Council]] from 1985 until 2003 at which point he resigned from the council due to the abolition of the [[dual mandate]].

Cassidy was elected to [[Dáil Éireann]] for the [[Westmeath (Dáil constituency)|Westmeath]] constituency at the [[Irish general election, 2002|2002 general election]], taking the seat of sitting TD and Government Minister [[Mary O'Rourke]].&lt;ref name=elecs_irl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=4146|title=Donie Cassidy|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a rift between the two politicians and Cassidy lost his seat to O'Rourke at the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 general election]] when both candidates contested the [[Longford–Westmeath (Dáil constituency)|Longford–Westmeath]] constituency. The fact that Cassidy lost most of his home base of Castlepollard and north Westmeath due to the redrawing of the constituency did not help him. On 22 June 2007 Cassidy was [[Nominated members of Seanad Éireann|nominated by the Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] to [[Seanad Éireann]] and created Leader of the Seanad for the remaining weeks of the [[22nd Seanad]]'s existence. Cassidy was subsequently elected to the [[Labour Panel]] at the 2007 Seanad general election and was [[Leader of the Seanad]] until March 2011. He lost his seat at the 2011 Seanad election.

==Business interests==
Cassidy owns two [[Dublin]] hotels and has another on the former site of the [[National Wax Museum (Ireland)|National Wax Museum]], which he also owned. He also owns Celtic Note, a specialist Irish music store on Dublin's Nassau Street and since 1984 has had the franchise to sell CDs and DVDs at Dublin Airport. He also owns several buildings in [[Mullingar]]. His other interests include record and music publishing companies. He owns the publishing rights to many well known songs such as 'Grace' and 'My Lovely Rose of Clare'.

==Prediction: Irish property prices==
In a debate in Seanad Éireann on 10 April 2008, Cassidy stated the following about [[Irish property bubble|house prices in Ireland]]: ''"We have a duty to tell first-time house buyers, young couples with no previous experience, that there is unbelievable value in the marketplace today. It will not last forever. It is never the wrong time to do the right thing. I offer the House the benefit of my experience and my opinion which is all any Member can do. I will remind the House, perhaps in 12 or 18 months, when prices have again increased by 25% or 30%, that they were told this by the Leader of the House on this historic day, the tenth anniversary of the [[Good Friday Agreement]]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/seanad/2008/04/10/00004.asp|title=Parliamentary Debates – Seanad Éireann – Vol. 189 No. 3|work=Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas|date=10 April 2008|accessdate=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, 12 months later the average house price had decreased by 21.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/StatisticsandRegularPublications/HousingStatistics/FileDownLoad,21279,en.pdf|title=Quarterly House Prices Bulletin, Q2 2009|work=Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government|date=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
European DataWarehouse was founded in January 2012 for the purpose of facilitating risk assessment and improving transparency in European Asset-Backed Security (ABS) deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=REFILE-ECB launches structured transparency programme|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ecb-abs-disclosure/refile-ecb-launches-structured-transparency-programme-idUSL5E8MRBBK20121130|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
European DataWarehouse's responsibilities include ensuring that ABS market data is openly accessible and that all transactions are recorded. A key aim of European DataWarehouse is to instil trust back into the ABS market, which has been a problem in recent times. The [[European Central Bank]] is set to make compliance with loan-level data disclosure compulsory before it will accept [[asset-backed securities]] as collateral for financing.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lld"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eficiencia"/&gt;

== Boards ==
ED has three decision-making bodies and 17 shareholders:
*'''Supervisory Board''': the main decision-making body. It comprises the shareholder members and governors/observers from the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and NCB. It is responsible for strategy and monitoring ED’s operations.
*'''Pricing Committee''': sets the fee structure for ED customers and consists of 8 members of the ABS industry.
*'''ED Management''': represented by CEO Christian Thun.

'''Feminist therapy''' is a set of related [[therapy|therapies]] arising from what proponents see as a disparity between the origin of most psychological theories and the majority of people seeking counseling being female.  It focuses on [[society|societal]], [[culture|cultural]], and [[politics|political]] causes and solutions to issues faced in the counseling process. It openly encourages the client to participate in the world in a more social and political way.

[[Feminist]] therapy contends that women are in a disadvantaged position in the world due to sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion, age and other categories.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Rowan, John. "AHP A Guids to Humanistic Psychology." 2001. Association for Humanistic Psychology. 25 Nov. 2008 &lt;http://www.ahpweb.org/rowan_bibliography/chapter16.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist therapists argue that many problems that arise in therapy are due to disempowering social forces; thus the goal of therapy is to recognize these forces and empower the client.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In a feminist therapy setting the therapist and client work as equals. The therapist must demystify therapy from the beginning to show the client that she is her own rescuer, and the expectations, roles, and responsibilities of both client and therapist must be explored and equally agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;Byram Fowles, Tammie. "Contributions to Feminist Therapy." Psych-Net- UK. 25 Nov. 2008 &lt;http://www.psychnet-uk.com/readers_articles/contributions%20of%20feminist%20theory.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The therapist recognizes that with every symptom a client has, there is a strength.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[Lenore E. Walker|Walker, Lenore]]. "A Feminist Therapist Reviews the Case.” Women As Therapists. Cantor, Dorothy. 1990. as cited in Byram Fowles, Tammie. "Contributions to Feminist Therapy." Psych-Net- UK. 25 Nov. 2008 &lt;http://www.psychnet-uk.com/readers_articles/contributions%20of%20feminist%20theory.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist therapy grew out of concerns that established therapies were not helping women. Specific concerns of feminist therapists included gender bias and stereotyping in therapy; [[victim blaming|blaming victims]] of [[physical abuse]] and [[sexual abuse]]; and the assumption of a traditional [[nuclear family]].
== Principles ==
# An [[egalitarian]] relationship (a relationship in which the participants have equal status) between therapist and client is key in feminist therapy, utilizing the therapist's psychological knowledge and the client's knowledge of herself. The inherent power differentials between therapist and client are addressed, and the client must realize that the therapist is not giving her power, but power comes from within herself. This relationship provides a model for women to take responsibility in making all of their relationships egalitarian. Feminist therapists focus on embracing the client's strengths rather than fixing their weaknesses, and accept and validate the client's feelings.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
In 1977, scholar Susan Thomas argued that feminist therapy was "more [a] part of a social movement than [a] type of psychotherapy", and was so intimately tied to broader social and political feminism that its legitimacy as a therapeutic school was questionable.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Becker, Dana. (2005). The Myth of Empowerment: Women and the Therapeutic Culture in America. New York: New York University Press, 2005. p 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Sally Satel]] of Yale University has been critical of feminist therapy since the late 1990s, characterizing it as promoting a [[paranoid]] [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Satel, Sally (1998) [http://www.familytx.org/research/articles/patriarchymademe.html The Patriarchy Made Me Do It], Originally published in The Women's Freedom Network Newsletter September/October, 1998, Vol. 5, Number 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Satel argued in her 2000 book ''P.C. MD: How Political Correctness Is Corrupting Medicine'' that the very concept of feminist therapy is contrary to the methods and goals of [[psychotherapy]], sometimes so far as to veer into potential [[malpractice]].&lt;ref&gt;Satel, Sally, M.D. (2000) P.C., M.D.: How Political Correctness Is Corrupting Medicine. Basic Books, {{ISBN|0-465-07182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, notes Satel, the goal of therapy is to help the patient understand and alter unrealistic thinking and unhealthy behaviors to improve the patient's confidence, interpersonal skills, and quality of life. Traditional therapy, while rooted in well-tested methods, must also be flexible enough to adapt to each patient's unique experiences, personality and needs.

The  '''Financial Supervisory Authority''' ({{lang-arz|لهيئة العامة للرقابة المالية}}) is the integrated government agency that regulates the financial service industry in [[Egypt]].  The agency supervises all non-banking financial transactions and markets including capital markets, derivative markets, commodities, insurance, mortgage finance, financial leasing and factoring.

==History==
With the passing of Law no. 10, 2009, issued on February 25, 2009, the agency was established and became operationally effective on July 1, 2009. It replaced three major regulating authorities: the Capital Market Authority, the Insurance Supervisory Authority, and the Mortgage Finance Authority. This unification was intended to foster Egypt's financial sector. 

Establishing the new authority is part of at a series of reforms aimed to strengthen the stability and security of the non-banking financial sector in Egypt and its interoperability with the banking sector. This move came against a backdrop of the global economic and [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] which highlighted the need for integrity and transparency in financial markets.

Ashraf El-Sharkawy headed the authority after the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|January 2011 uprising]].&lt;ref name="minister"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's who: Meet Egypt's 10 new ministers in Sherif Ismail's cabinet|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/195704/Egypt/Politics-/Whos-who-Meet-Egypts--new-ministers-in-Sherif-Isma.aspx|agency=Ahram Online|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities and structure==
The Financial Supervisory Authority supervises all [[Non-banking financial company|non-banking financial]] transactions and [[financial market|markets]] including importantly capital markets, derivative markets on financial assets and commodities, insurance contracts and services, mortgage finance, financial leasing, factoring and securitization.

The agency is an ordinary member of the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO). Both [[Cairo &amp; Alexandria Stock Exchange|Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges]] (CASE) as well as ''Misr Company for Central Clearing, Depository &amp; Registry'' (MCDR) have membership of the IOSCO too, but they are affiliate members.

The headquarters is located in [[Smart Village, Egypt|Smart Village]].

The '''Hotel McAlpin''' is a historic hotel building on [[Herald Square]], at the corner of [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It currently operates as an apartment building known as '''Herald Towers'''.

==History==
The Hotel McAlpin was constructed in 1912 by General [[Edwin A. McAlpin]], son of [[David Hunter McAlpin]]. When opened it was the largest hotel in the world. The hotel was designed by the noted architect [[Frank Mills Andrews]] (1867–1948). Andrews also was president of the Greeley Square Hotel Company which first operated the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=FM Andrews Dies, a Noted Architect |url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40A16FB345B157A93C1A91782D85F4C8485F9|work= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 September 1948|accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the Hotel McAlpin neared completion by the end of 1912 so that the hotel had an open house on 29 December. The largest hotel in the world at the time, ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that it was so tall at 25 stories that it “seems isolated from other buildings”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Flock to Inspect the Biggest Hotel |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/12/30/100566150.pdf |work= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=30 December 1912 |accessdate=2008-09-01 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boasting a staff of 1,500, the hotel could accommodate 2,500 guests. It was built at a cost of $13.5 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|13500000|1912}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}). The top floor had a [[Turkish bath]] and there were two gender-specific floors; women checking into the hotel could reserve a room on the women's only floor and bypass the lobby and check in directly at their own floor. One floor, dubbed the “sleepy 16th” was designed for [[shift work|night workers]] so that it was kept quiet during the day. It also hosted a travel agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where are you going to spend your summer? |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n77/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 13, 1914 |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel underwent an expansion half a decade later. The owners had purchased an additional 50 feet of frontage on 34th street two years early and proceeded to dismantle those properties. The new addition was the same height as the original 25-story building, and was expected to provide an additional 200 rooms, four more elevators, and a large ballroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hotel McAlpin Addition|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/03/18/113302651.pdf |work= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 March 1917|accessdate=2008-09-01 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major refurbishment costing $2.1 million was completed in 1928 refreshing the rooms, installing modern bathrooms and updating the elevators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hotel McAlpin Changes Completed|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60B17F9355B167A93C3AB1789D95F4C8285F9|work= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 December 1928|accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The McAlpin family sold the hotel in 1938 to Jamlee Hotels, headed by Joseph Levy, president of Crawford Cloths, a prominent real estate investor in New York for $5,400,000. Jamlee reportedly invested an additional $1,760,000 in renovations. During the Jamlee ownership, the hotel was managed by the Knott Hotel Chain until 1952 when management was taken over by Tisch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=$9,000,000 is Paid for the M'Alpin|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60E1FF73B5B167B93C7A8178BD95F408585F9&amp;scp=51&amp;sq=m%27alpin&amp;st=cse |work= |newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 October 1954|accessdate=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, 1954, Jamlee sold the hotel to [[Sheraton Hotels]] for $9,000,000 and it was renamed the '''Sheraton-McAlpin'''. Sheraton completely renovated the hotel five years later and renamed it the '''Sheraton-Atlantic Hotel''' on October 8, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/10/08/archives/redone-mcalpin-hotel-now-sheratonatlantic.html|title=Redone McAlpin Hotel Now Sheraton-Atlantic|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheraton sold the hotel to the investing partnership of Sol Goldman and Alexander DiLorenzo on July 28, 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/110821159/|title=The Courier-Journal from Louisville, Kentucky on July 28, 1968 · Page 83|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $7.5 million and it reverted to the '''Hotel McAlpin''' name.

==Notable events==
On Christmas Eve 1916, [[Harry K. Thaw]], former husband of [[Evelyn Nesbit]] and the murderer of [[Stanford White]], attacked 19-year-old Fred Gump, Jr. in a large suite on the 18th Floor. Thaw had enticed Gump to New York with a promise of a job but instead sexually assaulted him and beat him repeatedly with a stocky whip until he was covered in blood. According to the New York Times, Thaw had rented two rooms on either side of his suite to muffle the screams. The next day, Thaw's bodyguard took Gump to the aquarium and zoo before the boy managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Whipping of Boy Stars Hunt for Harry K Thaw |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/01/10/118129533.pdf|work= |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 January 1917|accessdate=2014-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gump's father sued Thaw for $650,000 for the "gross indignities" that his son suffered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Suit is Initiated Against Harry K Thaw |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19171011&amp;id=qkksAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3MkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2165,508962|work= |publisher=The Spartanburg Herald |date=17 October 1917|accessdate=2014-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually settled out of court.

In 1920, The McAlpin hosted what may have been the first broadcast from a New York hotel. The Army Signal Corps arranged the broadcast by singer [[Luisa Tetrazzini]] from her room in the hotel. Tetrazzini (1871-1940) was an Italian lyric coloratura soprano who had an enormous popularity in America from the 1900s-1920s. Several dishes were named after her, the origin of the “Tetrazzini” dish is unknown, but several newspaper articles attribute it to a famous chef (not named) in New York City. Luisa Tetrazzini supposedly gave her recipe for “Spaghetti Tetrazzini” to Louis Paquet, Executive Chef of the McAlpin Hotel on Herald Square in New York City. Luisa Tetrazzini would subsequently take cooking lessons from Chef Louis Paquet of the McAlpin Hotel on how to make his Spaghetti Tetrazzini before embarking on one of her concert tours.

In 1922, the McAlpin became one of the first hotels to link ship-to-shore radios into their phone system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaker|first=Bill|title=The Airwaves of New York|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=1998|pages=119|isbn=0-7864-0343-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qr_W5B1SAQC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=mcalpin+new+york&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3|accessdate=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel would later be the first home of, and give the call letters to, [[radio station]] [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] in 1925.

In 1947, [[Jackie Robinson]], a resident living on the 11th floor, received the phone call here from the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] that would change America forever by being the first African American player in [[Major League Baseball]].

From 1969 to 1975 (excepting 1973), the hotel hosted the US National High School Chess Championship, organized by prolific chess promoter Bill Goichberg.

==Marine Grill==
The hotel's Marine Grill was considered one of the more unusual interiors in the city of New York due to "an expansive grotto of polychrome terra cotta designed by the artist [[Frederick Dana Marsh]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christophaer |last=Grey |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Streetscapes:The McAlpin Marine Grill; The Fate of a Polychrome Grotto Hangs in Balance
|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DE163DF930A15754C0A96F948260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=hotel%20mcalpin&amp;st=cse|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 July 1989|accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building owner had closed the restaurant and historic preservationists were concerned with the future of the artwork. Their worst fears were realized when Susan Tunick, president of the non-profit group Friends of Terra Cotta, saw dumpsters outside the hotel filled with fragments from the murals. Rescue efforts were eventually successful when the murals were reassembled under the oversight of the MTA Arts for Transit Program at the [http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&amp;line=J&amp;artist=1&amp;station=21 William Street entrance] to the [[Fulton Street (New York City Subway)|Fulton Street subway station]].

'''Jørgen Vig Knudstorp''' (born 21 November 1968 in [[Fredericia]]) is the executive chairman and former CEO of the [[Lego Group]]. He succeeded [[Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen]] and is the first non-family member to head Lego.

==Early years==

Knudstorp was born in 1968, grew up in [[Fredericia]] and graduated from [[Fredericia Gymnasium]] before attending [[Aarhus University]].&lt;ref name="Arhus Uni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/en/annualcelebration/annual-celebration-2014/the-aarhus-university-distinguished-alumnus/?no_cache%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010200515/http://www.au.dk/en/annualcelebration/annual-celebration-2014/the-aarhus-university-distinguished-alumnus/?no_cache=1 |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining his undergraduate degree, Knudstorp began an academic career as a researcher at his alma mater as well as obtaining a master's degree (1995) and a PhD (1998) in Economics from [[Aarhus University]].&lt;ref name="Arhus Uni" /&gt; He stayed in academia, but worked as a business consultant from 1998 to 2000.&lt;ref name="Arhus Uni" /&gt;

==Lego career==
Jørgen Vig Knudstorp joined the LEGO Group in 2001 after working as a [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] consultant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feloni|first1=Richard|title=How LEGO Came Back From The Brink Of Bankruptcy|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-lego-made-a-huge-turnaround-2014-2?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T|website=businessinsider.com|publisher=Business Insider Inc.|date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and university researcher at [[Aarhus University]].&lt;ref name="Arhus Uni" /&gt;

The KBR Tower has the headquarters of [[KBR (company)|KBR]].&lt;ref name="Ditch"&gt;Eriksen, Helen.

The 40 story building has about {{convert|1047748|sqft|sqm}} of rentable office space. The design architect was Neuhaus &amp; Taylor, the general contractor was Linbeck Construction Company, the mechanical engineer was Sam P. Wallace, and the structural engineer was Ellisor Engineering, Inc.

Retrieved on August 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By 1991, [[Dresser Industries]] and its subsidiary, M. W. Kellogg, switched office buildings. Kellogg took over {{convert|400000|sqft|sqm}} of space on 16 floors of the Houston skyscraper formerly occupied by its parent firm. The skyscraper was renamed the M. W. Kellogg Tower. In exchange Dresser took over space at [[Greenway Plaza|3 Greenway Plaza]], which had been renamed to the Dresser Tower. The building swap satisfied Kellogg's need for more space.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Lettice. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/15/business/real-estate-a-big-swap-of-offices-in-houston.html REAL ESTATE; A Big Swap Of Offices In Houston]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. Wednesday May 15, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Exxon]] announced that it was forming a new subsidiary, Exxon Upstream Development Co. The company planned to initially house the company in the Kellogg Tower before moving it to the [[Greenspoint, Houston|Greenspoint]] business district.&lt;ref&gt;Durgin, Hillary. "[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5584111_ITM Exxon Forms New Houston-Based Company to Focus on Deepwater Projects.]" ''[[Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News]]''. June 3, 1998. Retrieved on November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, [[Halliburton]] owned the tower in a joint venture with [[TrizecHahn]]. In August of that year, Halliburton announced that it would consolidate 8,000 local employees to office space in [[Westchase, Houston|Westchase]]. Halliburton planned to vacate about {{convert|650000|sqft|sqm}} of [[Office#Grading|Class B]] office space in the Kellogg Tower.&lt;ref name="Sarnoffhole"&gt;Sarnoff, Nancy. "[http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2001/08/13/story7.html Halliburton move could create hole in Houston's office market]." ''[[Houston Business Journal]]''. Friday August 10, 2001. Retrieved on November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2001 Halliburton canceled its plans to relocate employees to Westchase. Nancy Sarnoff of the ''[[Houston Business Journal]]'' said that it made more sense for the company to lease existing space instead of constructing new office space in times of economic downturns.&lt;ref name="SarnoffNancy"&gt;Sarnoff, Nancy. "[http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2001/12/24/newscolumn3.html Downtown up, Westchase down as Halliburton postpones project]." ''[[Houston Business Journal]]''. Friday December 21, 2009. Retrieved on November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Jeanneret &amp; Associates renewed its lease of {{convert|9806|sqft|sqm}} space in the KBR Tower for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Sarnoff, Nancy. "[http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2004/02/16/daily29.html?jst=b_ln_hl Cullen Center snags new leases]." ''[[Houston Business Journal]]''. Wednesday February 18, 2004. Retrieved on November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, at the KBR Tower, [[Brookfield Properties]] began offering office suites from {{convert|1200|sqft|sqm}} to {{convert|2000|sqft|sqm}} to small businesses and laid off individuals seeking to start their own businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Sarnoff, Nancy.

In 2010, KBR signed a 20-year lease for {{convert|1200000|sqft|sqm}} at the KBR Tower and 500 Jefferson. In 2011 Brookfield Properties Corp. offered a 50% interest in the KBR Tower for sale. Paul Layne, Suresh Brookfield's Houston area executive vice president, said that the KBR lease made the building a major candidate for the sale of its interest. KBR owns the other 50% interest. Layne did not state whether KBR had the right of first refusal on Brookfield's interest.

==History==
Nien-Ling Wacker founded Compulink Management Center Inc., a custom software development company, in 1974. By the early 1980s, Wacker had identified an emerging need among her clients for an electronic document repository that would provide both secure storage and instant retrieval by any word or phrase in the document.

The concept for a [[Personal computer|PC]]-based [[document management]] system began in 1981 when a client, a large Japanese auto manufacturer, required litigation support for a large volume of documents.{{citation needed
|date=July 2017}}  At the time, paralegals had to wade through thousands of pages of depositions, entering [[Index term|keyword]]s into a database.  Attorneys were limited to searching on keywords to find relevant testimony.&lt;ref name="AIIM"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.aiim.org/article-docrep.asp?ID=25296
|last=Duhon
|first=Bryant
|publisher=AIIM e-doc magazine
|title=One-on-One With Nien-Ling Wacker
|date=November 12, 2002
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nien-Ling Wacker realized that if a [[full-text index]] of every page were available, the search capabilities would be greatly enhanced, and the amount of physical labor required to index the documents would decrease substantially.  With the release of [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]] drives that cost "only" $200 for 200MB of diskspace, the conceived system could be made cost effective.&lt;ref name="AIIM" /&gt;

The first version of Laserfiche was released in 1987, becoming the first [[DOS]]-based [[document imaging]] system in the world.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news

In 2002, Laserfiche 6 marked the company’s first foray into MSSQL{{Clarify|date=November 2013}}-based document management. That year, the company also introduced Quick Fields,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Fields|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/Quick-Fields|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an automated document processing module, and WebLink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weblink|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/WebLink|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided read-only, Web-based access to documents stored in Laserfiche.

In 2004, Laserfiche 7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Plans Continued Growth with Release of Version 7|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2004/08/31/laserfiche-plans-continued-growth-with-run-smarter-market-positioning-and-release-of-its-version-7|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the company’s first offering for Oracle users.

In early 2008, the company released Laserfiche 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Next Generation Laserfiche 8|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2008/01/14/next-generation-laserfiche-8-optimizes-infrastructure-integrating-content-with-business-processes|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a re-written workflow engine and integration with Microsoft SharePoint. In August 2008, the company launched Laserfiche Rio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Rio|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2008/08/08/rio|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an enterprise content management offering with unlimited servers, named user licensing and bundled functionality including content management, business process management and a thin-client interface called Web Access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Access|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/Web-Access|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Laserfiche filed a lawsuit against [[SAP AG|SAP]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche files lawsuit against SAP|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2010/10/25/laserfiche-files-lawsuit-against-sap-for-trademark-infringement|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for trademark infringement over the disputed trademark phrase "Run Smarter".

Later that year, Laserfiche was listed as a Champion in Info-Tech Research Group’s Enterprise Content Management (ECM) for Process Workers Vendor Landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Identified as champion by Info-Tech Research Group|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/NewsPortal/Article/2011/12/28/laserfiche-identified-as-a-champion-by-info-tech-research-group|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Info-Tech, “Laserfiche is a stalwart that is exploiting the new capabilities of emerging technology.

In 2012, Laserfiche released Laserfiche Mobile for [[iPad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laserfiche Mobile for iPad|url=http://www.laserfiche.com/en-us/Products/Laserfiche-Mobile-iPad|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an app that extends governance, risk and compliance standards to the iPad.

[[File:Retail Lease In Chicago.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|A sign in Chicago offering space for lease.]]
A '''lease''' is a [[contract]]ual arrangement calling for the [[wikt:lessee|lessee]] (user) to pay the [[Lessor (leasing)|lessor]] (owner) for use of an asset.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney and Weil 2007 p. 791  (Glossary of Financial Accounting: An Intro. to Concepts, Methods, and Use 12e).&lt;/ref&gt; Property, buildings and vehicles are common assets that are leased. Industrial or business equipment is also leased.

Broadly put, a lease agreement is a contract between two parties, the lessor and the lessee. The lessor is the legal owner of the asset; the lessee obtains the right to use the asset in return for regular rental payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/sg/en/student/acca-qual-student-journey/qual-resource/acca-qualification/f7/technical-articles/accounting-for-leases.html|title=Accounting for leases {{!}} F7 Financial Reporting {{!}} ACCA Qualification {{!}} Students {{!}} ACCA Global|last=http://www.accaglobal.com|first=ACCA -|website=www.accaglobal.com|language=en-SG|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lessee also agrees to abide by various conditions regarding their use of the property or equipment. For example, a person leasing a car may agree that the car will only be used for personal use.

The narrower term '''rental agreement''' can be used to describe a lease in which the asset is [[tangible property]].&lt;ref&gt;34 Am. Jur. 2d Federal Taxation ¶ 16762 Section 467 rental agreements defined: “A rental agreement includes any written or oral agreement that provides for the use of tangible property and is treated as a lease for federal income tax purposes."&lt;/ref&gt;  Language used is that the user ''rents'' the land or goods ''let out'' or ''rented out'' by the owner.  The verb ''to lease'' is less precise because it can refer to either of these actions.&lt;ref&gt;It is possible to rent in such a way many things such as domestic animals, electrical appliances, handbags and jewelry.[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/jan/04/renting-luxury-goods "If you want it, rent it ... from a 'must have' handbag to an Aston Martin"], ''[[The Observer]]'', 2009-01-04. Retrieved on 2009-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of a lease for [[intangible property]] are use of a computer program (similar to a license, but with different provisions), or use of a radio frequency (such as a contract with a cell-phone provider).

The term '''rental agreement''' is also sometimes used to describe a periodic lease agreement (most often a month-to-month lease) internationally and in some [[region]]s of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/before-rent.shtml|title=California Tenants - California Department of Consumer Affairs|last=California|first=Department of Consumer Affairs, State of|website=www.dca.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General terms ==
A lease is a legal [[contract]], and thus enforceable by all parties under the [[contract law]] of the applicable jurisdiction.

In the [[United States]], since it also represents a conveyance of possessory rights to real estate, it is a hybrid sort of contract that involves qualities of a [[deed]].

Some specific kinds of leases may have specific clauses required by statute depending upon the property being leased, and/or the jurisdiction in which the agreement was signed or the residence of the parties.

Common elements of a lease agreement include:
* Names of the parties of the agreement.
* The starting date and duration of the agreement.
* Identifies the specific object (by street address, VIN, or make/model,serial number) being leased.
* Provides conditions for renewal or non-renewal.
* Has a specific consideration (a lump sum, or periodic payments) for granting the use of this object.
* Has provisions for a security deposit and terms for its return.
* May have a specific list of conditions which are therein described as Default Conditions and specific Remedies.
* May have other specific conditions placed upon the parties such as:
** Need to provide insurance for loss.
** Restrictive use.
** Which party is responsible for maintenance.
* Termination clause (describing what will happen if the contract is ended early or cancelled, stating the rights of parties to terminate the lease, and their obligations)

All kinds of personal property (e.g. cars and furniture) or real property (e.g. raw land, apartments, single family homes, and business property (including wholesale and retail)) may be leased.  As a result of the lease, the owner (lessor) grants the use of the stated property to the lessee.

== Leases of land ==
The narrower term 'tenancy' describes a lease in which the [[tangible property]] is land (including at any vertical section such as airspace, [[Storey|storey]] of building or [[mining|mine]]).  A premium is an amount paid by the tenant for the lease to be granted or to secure the former tenant's lease, often in order to secure a low rent, in long leases termed a ''ground rent''.  For parts of buildings it is most common for users to pay also by collateral contract, or by the same contract, a [[service charge]] which is normally an express list of services in a lease to minimize disputes over service charges.  A [[gross lease|gross lease or tenancy]] stipulates a rent that is for the global amount due including all service charges.

A cancelable lease ([[United Kingdom|UK]]: determinable/breakable lease) is a lease that may be terminated (formally ''determined'') solely by the lessee or solely by the lessor without penalty.  A mutually determinable lease can be determined by either.  A non-cancelable lease is a lease that cannot be so terminated.  Commonly, “lease” may imply a non-cancelable lease, whereas “rental agreement” may connote a cancelable lease.

Influenced by [[land registration]], commonly tenancies initially granted for more than a year are referred to more simply as leases.&lt;ref&gt;For land in the UK, a tenancy or lease granted for more than 7 years must be registered at the land registry and a tenancy or lease for more than 3 years must be granted and witnessed by using a [[deed]].  [http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/professional/guides/practice-guide-25 HM Land Registry Practice Guide 25. Retrieved 2012-07-08] and s52(1) ([[Law of Property Act 1925|LPA 1925]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The lease will either provide specific provisions regarding the responsibilities and rights of the lessee and lessor, or there will be automatic provisions as a result of local law.  In general, by paying the negotiated fee to the lessor, the lessee (also called a '''[[leasehold estate|tenant]]''') has possession and use (the '''rental''') of the leased property  to the exclusion of the lessor and all others except with the invitation of the tenant. The most common form of real property lease is a residential rental agreement between landlord and tenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The right to possession by the tenant is sometimes called a '''leasehold interest'''. A lease can be for a fixed period of time (called the '''[[Time|term]]''' of the lease). 
A lease may be terminated sooner than its end date by:
* Break/cancellation (this depends upon the terms of the lease)
* A negotiated deed of [[Surrender (law)|surrender]] or yielding-up.
* [[Forfeiture (law)|Forfeiture]]
* By operation of statute (rare)

A lease should be contrasted with a '''[[license]]''', which may entitle a person (called a '''licensee''') to use property, but which is subject to termination at the will of the owner of the property (called the '''licensor''').  An example of a licensor/licensee relationship is a parking lot owner and a person who parks a vehicle in the parking lot.  A license may be seen in the form of a ticket to a baseball game or a verbal permission to sleep a few days on a sofa.  The difference is that if there is a term (end time), a degree of privacy suggestive of exclusive possession of a clearly defined part, practised ongoing, recurrent payments, a lack of right to terminate save for misconduct or nonpayment, these factors tend toward a lease; by contrast, a one-time entrance onto someone else's property is probably a license.  The seminal difference between a lease and a license is that a lease generally provides for regular periodic payments during its term and a specific ending date. If a contract has no ending date then it may be in the form of a ''perpetual license'' and still not be a lease.

Under normal circumstances, owners of property are at liberty to do what they want with their property (for a lawful purpose), including dealing with it or handing over '''possession''' of the property to a tenant for a limited period of time.  If an owner has granted possession to another (i.e., the tenant) then any interference with the quiet enjoyment of the property by the tenant in lawful possession is itself unlawful.

Similar principles apply to [[real property]] as well as to [[personal property]], though the terminology differs. The right to sub-lease may or may not be permitted to a tenant. Where it is permitted, the lease granted directly by the owner is called a "headlease", or sometimes a "master lease". Headlease tenants and their tenants who may in turn also sublet are termed ''mesne {{IPAc-en|m|iː|n}} landlords'' from the old French for middle. The headlease tenant has no right to grant a sublease which extends beyond the end of the headlease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizoptions.com/glossary/h.asp |title=Real Estate Glossary Business Dictionary Definition Head Lease |publisher=www.bizoptions.com |accessdate=2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To circumvent [[privity of estate]] which is the general principle flowing from [[privity of contract]], laws exist in several jurisdictions to bind subtenants to some of the restrictive covenants (terms) of the headlease, for instance in England and Wales those which have been held by courts to touch and concern the land.&lt;ref&gt;City of London Corporation v Fell [1994] 1 A.C. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

A transfer of a remaining interest in a lease, '''assignment''', is a type of (''alienation'') is often possible and an implied rights to assign exist by compulsory law or as a default position in some jurisdictions.  Sharing or parting with possession can be a breach of certain leases resulting in action for forfeiture.

'''Enfranchisement''' is the obtaining of the landlord's title and is most commonly negotiated with the landlord where a tenant pays only a ''ground rent''.  '''Merger''' is where the landlord and tenant happen to be the same and can terminate a lease where there are no subtenants in certain jurisdictions.

== History of leases of land ==
Over the centuries, leases have served many purposes and the nature of legal regulation has varied according to those purposes and the social and economic conditions of the times. Leases, for example, were mainly used for [[agricultural]] purposes until the late 18th century and early 19th century when the growth of cities in industrialized countries made leases an important form of landholding in [[urban area]]s.

The modern law of [[landlord]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]] in common law jurisdictions retains the influence of the common law and, particularly, the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' philosophy that dominated the law of [[contract]] and [[property law]] in the 19th century. With the growth of [[consumerism]], [[consumer protection]] legislation recognised that common law principles, which assume equal bargaining power between the contracting parties, create hardships when that assumption is inaccurate. Consequently, reformers have emphasised the need to assess residential tenancy laws in terms of protection they provide to tenants. Legislation to protect tenants is now common.

== Types of tenancies ==

=== Fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years ===
A fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years lasts for some fixed period of time. It has a definite beginning date and a definite ending date. Despite the name "tenancy for years", such a tenancy can last for any period of time—even a tenancy for one week may be called a tenancy for years. At [[common law]] the duration did not need to be certain, but could be conditioned upon the happening of some event, (e.g., "until the crops are ready for harvest" or "until the war is over"). In many jurisdictions that possibility has been partially or totally abolished.

A fixed term tenancy comes to an end automatically when the fixed term runs out or, in the case of a tenancy that ends on the happening of an event, when the event occurs. If a holdover tenant remains on the property after the termination of the lease, s/he may become a tenant at sufferance because the lessor/landlord has suffered (or allowed) the tenant to remain as a tenant instead of evicting him or her.  Such a tenancy is generally "at will," meaning the tenant or the landlord may terminate it at any time, upon the providing of proper statutory notice.

=== Periodic tenancy ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
A periodic tenancy, also known as a tenancy from year to year, month to month, or week to week, is an estate that exists for some period of time determined by the term of the payment of rent. An oral lease for a tenancy of years that violates the [[Statute of Frauds]] (by committing to a lease of more than — depending on the jurisdiction — one year without being in writing) may actually create a periodic tenancy, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the leased premises are located. In many jurisdictions the "default" tenancy, where the parties have not explicitly specified a different arrangement, and where none is presumed under local or business custom, is a month-to-month tenancy.

Either the landlord or the tenant may terminate a periodic tenancy when the period or term is nearing completion, by giving notice to the other party as required by statute or case law in the jurisdiction. Neither landlord nor tenant may terminate a periodic tenancy before the period has ended, without incurring an obligation to pay for the months remaining on the lease.  Either party must give notice if it intends to terminate a tenancy from year to year, and the amount of notice is either specified by the lease or by state statute.  Notice is usually, but not always, at least one month, especially for the year-to-year periodic tenancy.  Durations of less than a year must typically receive notice equal to the period of the tenancy - for example, the landlord must give a month's notice to terminate a tenancy from month to month. However, many jurisdictions have increased these required notice periods, and some have reduced the capacity of a landlord to use them drastically. For jurisdictions that have local rent control laws, a landlord's ability to terminate a residential tenancy is substantially reduced.  For example, in California, the cities of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, West Hollywood, San Francisco, and Oakland have "rent stabilization ordinances" that limit a landlord's ability to terminate a periodic tenancy, among other restrictions.

The notice must also state the effective date of termination, which, in some jurisdictions, ''must'' be on the ''last day'' of the payment period. In other words, if a month-to-month tenancy began on the 15th of the month, in a jurisdiction with a ''last day'' requirement the termination could not be effective on the 20th of the following month, even though this would give the tenant more than the required one month's notice.

=== Tenancy at will ===
A ''tenancy at will'' is a tenancy which either the landlord or the tenant may terminate at any time by giving reasonable [[notice]].  Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period.  It may last for many years, but it could be ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all.  Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state's statutes.  If there is no formal lease, the tenancy at will is the one that usually exists.  In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for [[consideration]].  Under the modern [[common law]], a tenancy at will without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a nominal consideration may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for [[causation (law)|cause]], even if there is no written lease. (However, an oral lease for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to "at will" tenancy subject to 30-days notice.  Alternatively, a tenancy at will (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the tenancy at will is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed.  The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.

If a lease exists at the sole discretion of the landlord, the law of the jurisdiction may imply that the tenant is granted, by [[operation of law]], a reciprocal right to terminate the lease at will. However, a lease that explicitly exists at the will of the tenant (e.g. "for as long as the tenant desires to live on this land") generally does not imply that the landlord may terminate the lease; rather, such language may be interpreted as granting the tenant a [[life estate]] or even a [[fee simple]].

A tenancy at will is broken, again by [[operation of law]], if the:
* Tenant commits [[waste (law)|waste]] against the property;
* Tenant attempts to [[assignment (law)|assign]] the tenancy;
* Tenant uses the property to operate a criminal enterprise;
* Landlord transfers his/her interest in the property;
* Landlord leases the property to another person;
* Tenant or landlord dies.

The specifics of these rules differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Subject to any notice required by law, a tenancy at will also comes to an end when either the landlord or the tenant acts inconsistently with a tenancy. For example, the changing of locks by the landlord is an indication of the end of the tenancy, as is the vacation of the premises by the tenant.  However, in some jurisdictions, such as California, a landlord is prohibited from using a "self help" remedy, such as changing the locks, to terminate a tenancy, particularly a residential tenancy.  Doing so may constitute a "constructive eviction" and expose the landlord to civil and criminal liability.

=== Tenancy at sufferance ===
A ''tenancy at sufferance'' (sometimes called a ''holdover tenancy'') exists when a tenant remains in possession of a property after the expiration of a lease, and until the landlord acts to eject the tenant from the property. Although the tenant is technically a [[trespasser]] at this point, and possession of this type is not a true estate in land, authorities recognize the condition in order to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may [[eviction|evict]] such a tenant at any time, and without notice.

The landlord may also impose a new lease on the holdover tenant. For a residential tenancy, this new tenancy is month to month. For a commercial tenancy of more than a year, the new tenancy is year to year; otherwise it is the same period as the period before the original lease expired. In either case, the landlord can raise the rent, so long as the landlord has told the tenant of the higher rent before the expiration of the original lease.

== Formalities ==
Formal requirements for a lease are determined by the law and custom of the jurisdiction in which real property is located. In the case of personal property, it is determined by the law and custom of the jurisdiction in which the rental agreement is made.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A tenancy for a duration greater than one year must be in writing in order to satisfy the [[Statute of frauds|Statute of Frauds]].

=== Term ===
The [[Term (time)|term]] of the lease may be fixed, periodic or of indefinite duration. If it is for a [[tenancy for years|specified period]] of time, the term ends automatically when the period expires, and no notice needs to be given, in the absence of legal requirements. The term's duration may be conditional, in which case it lasts until a specified event occurs, such as the death of a specified individual. A periodic tenancy is one which is renewed automatically, usually on a monthly or weekly basis. A tenancy at will lasts only as long as the parties wish it to, and may be terminated by either party without penalty.

It is common for a lease to be extended on a "holding over" basis, which normally converts the tenancy to a periodic tenancy on a month by month basis. It is also possible for a tenant, either expressly or impliedly, to give up the tenancy to the landlord. This process is known as a "surrender" of the lease.

=== Transparency and fine print ===
[[File:Contract 20160994.jpg|thumb|Before signing any contract, read and understand the fine print.]]
As stated by the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), 2013, a lack of transparency regarding a term in a standard-form consumer contract may cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="Aus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Rental%20cars%20-%20an%20industry%20guide%20to%20the%20Australian%20Consumer%20Law.pdf|title=Rental cars: An industry guide to the Australian Consumer Law|date=2013|website=Australian Consumer Laws|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=9 May 2016}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia license.&lt;/ref&gt;

A term is considered transparent if it is:
* expressed in reasonably plain language
* legible
* presented clearly
* readily available to any party affected by the term

Terms that may not be considered transparent include terms that are hidden in fine print or schedules or phrased in complex or technical language.&lt;ref name="Aus"/&gt;

=== Rent ===
Rent is a requirement of leases in some common law jurisdictions, but not in civil law jurisdictions. In England and Wales it was held in the case of ''[[Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold]]'' that rent was not a requirement for there to be a lease, however the court will more often construe a licence where no rent is paid as it is seen as evidence for no intention to create legal relations. There is no requirement for the rent to be a commercial amount; a [[Peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]] or rent of some nominal amount is sufficient for this requirement.

=== Exclusive possession ===
A sharing arrangement with much of a landlord's property or, for no specific room of a building for instance, may defeat a finding of a lease, however this common requirement of a lease is interpreted differently in many jurisdictions.

== Provisions specific to car rental ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

In addition to the above, a car rental agreement may include various restrictions on the way a renter can use a car, and the condition in which it must be returned.  For example, some rentals cannot be driven off-road, or out of the country, or towing a trailer, without specific permission.  In New Zealand you may have to specifically endorse a promise that the car will not be driven onto [[Ninety Mile Beach, New Zealand|Ninety-Mile Beach]] (because of the hazardous tides).

There will certainly be a requirement to show a [[driver's license]], and only those drivers appearing on the contract may be authorized to drive. It may include an option to purchase [[auto insurance]] (UK: motor insurance), if the renter does not already have a policy to cover rentals—another important consideration for multiple drivers.  Some agencies may even require a [[Surety bond|bond]] payable if the car is not returned in order, often held in the form of a credit-card authorization—voided if the car is returned per agreement.  A renter should be advised that he or she will be responsible for any tolls, parking or traffic violations incurred upon the vehicle during the rental period.  There should also be advice on handling thefts, accidents, break-downs, and towing.

Further terms may include added fees for late returns, drop-off at a different location, or failure to top up the petrol immediately before the return.

Finally, there may be provisions for making a non-refundable deposit with a booking, terms for payment of the initial period (with discounts, vouchers, etc.), extended periods, and any damages or other fees that accrue prior to the return.

== Leasing property ==
A rental agreement is often called a lease, especially when [[real estate]] is rented.  Real estate rentals are initiated by a rental application which is used to build the terms of the lease. In addition to the basics of a rental (who, what, when, how much), a real estate rental may go into much more detail on these and other issues.  The real estate may be rented for [[Housing tenure|housing]], [[parking]] a vehicle(s), storage, business, agricultural, institutional, or government use, or other reasons.
* Who: The parties involved in the contract, the lessor (sometimes called the owner or [[landlord]]) and the lessee (sometimes called the renter or [[leasehold estate|tenant]]) are identified in the contract.  A housing lease may specify whether the renter is living alone, with family, children, roommate, visitors.  A rental may delineate the rights and obligations of each of these.  For example, a "sub-let" to a stranger might not be permitted without permission of the landlord.  This also applies to whether or not [[pet]]s may be kept by the renter.  On the other hand, the renter may also have specific rights against intrusions by the landlord (or other tenants), except under emergency circumstances.  A renter is in possession of the property, and a landlord would be trespassing upon the renter's rights if entry is made without proper notice and authority (e.g., 24 hours' notice, daytime, knock first, except for emergency repairs, in case of fire, flood, etc.).
* What: Rented real estate may include all or part of almost any [[real property]], such as an [[apartment]], [[house]], [[building]], business office(s) or suite, land, farm, or merely an inside or outside space to [[Parking|park]] a vehicle, or store things.  The premises rented may include not only specific rooms, but also access to other common areas such as off-street parking, basement or attic storage, laundry facility, pool, roof-deck, balconies, etc. The agreement may specify how and when these places may be used, and by whom.  There may be detailed description of the current condition of the premises, for comparison with the condition at the time the premises are surrendered.
* When: the term of the rental may be for a night (e.g., a hotel room), weeks, months, or years.  There may be statutory provisions requiring registration of any rental that could extend for more than a specified number of years (e.g., seven) in order to be enforceable against a new landlord.

:A typical rental is either annual or month-to-month, and the amount of rent may be different for long-term renters (because of lower turnover costs). Leaving a long-term lease before its expiration could result in penalties, or even the cost of the entire agreed period (if the landlord is unable to find a suitable replacement tenant, after diligent pursuit). If a tenant stays beyond the end of a lease for a term of years (one or more), then the parties may agree that the lease will be automatically renewed, or it may simply convert to a tenancy at will (month-to-month) at the pro-rated monthly cost of the previous annual lease. If a tenant at will is given notice to quit the premises, and refuses to do so, the landlord then begins eviction proceedings. In many places it is completely illegal to change locks on doors, or remove personal belongings, let alone forcibly eject a person, without a court order of eviction.  There may be strict rules of procedure, and stiff penalties (triple damages, plus attorneys' fees) for violations.
* How much: Rent may be payable monthly, annually, or in advance, or as otherwise agreed. A typical arrangement for tenancy at will is "first and last month's rent" plus a [[security deposit]]. The "last month's rent" is rent that has yet to be earned by the landlord.

=== Deposit ===
{{See also|Security deposit|Damage deposit|Key money}}

The security deposit is often handled as an [[escrow]] deposit, owned by the tenant, but held by the landlord until the premises are surrendered in good condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted).  In some states, the landlord must provide the tenant with the name and account number of the bank where the security deposit is held, and pay annual interest to the tenant.  Other regulations may require the landlord to submit a list of pre-existing damage to the property, or forfeit the security deposit immediately (because there is no way to determine whether a prior tenant was responsible). In UK the government has introduced deposit protection scheme leading to several property inventory services which can optionally be used to carry out an inventory.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Insurance ===
In order to rent (alternatively called lease) in many apartment buildings, a renter ([[lessee]]) is often required to provide proof of renters [[insurance]] before signing the rental agreement. There is a special type of the [[homeowners insurance]] in the [[United States]] specifically for renters — '''[[Home insurance#HO4 .E2.80.93 Contents Broad Form|HO-4]]'''. This is commonly referred to as renter’s [[insurance]] or renter's coverage. Similar to [[condominium]] coverage, referred to as a '''[[Home insurance#HO6 .E2.80.93 Unit-Owners Form|HO-6]]''' policy, a renter's insurance policy covers those aspects of the [[apartment]] and its contents not specifically covered in the [[blanket policy]] written for the complex. This [[policy]] can also cover liabilities arising from accidents and intentional injuries for guests as well as passers-by up to 150' of the domicile. Renter’s policies provide "named peril" coverage, meaning the policy states specifically what you are insured against. Common coverage areas are:
* Accidental discharge of water{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* [[Fire]] or [[lightning]]
* [[Smoke]]
* [[Theft]]
* [[Vandalism]] or malicious mischief
* [[Windstorm]]

Additional events including riot, aircraft, explosion, hail, falling objects, [[volcanic eruption]], snow, sleet, and weight of ice may also be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{note label|PI|2002: 5.3–5.4|none}}{{cite book

== Sublease ==
In [[real estate law]], sublease (or, less formally, sublet) is the name given to an arrangement in which the lessee (e.g. tenant) in a lease assigns the lease to a third party, thereby making the old lessee the sublessor, and the new lessee the sublessee, or subtenant. This means they are not only leasing the property, but also subleasing it simultaneously. For example, if a company leases an office space directly from a landlord, the lessor, and subsequently outgrows the office, then the company can sublease the smaller office space to another company, the subtenant, and enter into a new lease for a larger office space, thereby hedging their real estate exposure.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The sublessor remains liable to the original lessor in accordance with the initial lease, including all remaining rent payments, including operating expenses and all other original lease terms. In a down-market, the original lessee may require a lower rent payment from the sublessee than what he or she may have originally paid, leaving the remaining rent owed to the lessor to be paid by the original lessee. However, if market prices have increased since the original lease was signed, the sublessor might be able to secure a higher rent price than what is owed the original lessor. However, many commercial leases stipulate that any overages in rent be shared with the landlord, the lessor.

In residential real estate, it is sometimes illegal to charge the subtenant more than the original amount in the sublessee's contract (for instance, in a [[rent control]] situation where the rental amount is controlled by law). Subletting of [[social housing]] is generally illegal, whatever the rent charged to the subtenant; in the UK it is officially described as a category of housing fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, 4 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A sublease can also apply to vehicles as an alternate type of car rental. In a vehicle sublease, a lessee or vehicle owner can assign a lease to a third party and by way of contractual agreement for specific dates. Although this arrangement is not popular, it is a growing trend in the travel industry as a less expensive alternative for travelers and locals.

==Equipment leasing==
Leasing is also used as a form of financing to acquire equipment for use and purchase.&lt;ref name="ELFA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.elfaonline.org/About/?fa=overview |title=Industry Overview |publisher=Equipment Leasing and Finance Association |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many organizations and companies use lease financing for the acquisition and use of many types of equipment, including manufacturing and mining machinery, vessels and containers, construction and off-road equipment, medical technology and equipment, agricultural equipment, aircraft, rail cars and rolling stock, trucks and transportation equipment, business, retail and office equipment, IT equipment and software.&lt;ref name="ELFA"/&gt;

Lease financing for equipment is generally provided by banks, captives and independent finance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.elfaonline.org/news/IndNews/news_report.cfm?id=21488 |title= Industry News: Around the Industry |accessdate= 21 September 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141013163443/https://www.elfaonline.org/news/IndNews/news_report.cfm?id=21488 |archivedate= 13 October 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elfaonline.org/Research/IMAGES/SEFAInfographicFINAL.png |title=Equipment Financing On The Rise |accessdate=21 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013163531/http://www.elfaonline.org/Research/IMAGES/SEFAInfographicFINAL.png |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], leases of goods are generally governed by Article 2A of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC) as [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] by the various jurisdictions.

In [[U.S. antitrust law]], the phrase "'''merger doctrine'''" is used to broadly describe the approaches that courts have taken to address [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] between [[corporation]]s which might tend to reduce [[Competition (economics)|competition]] and raise prices. More specifically, courts tend to make separate discussions of a ''horizontal merger doctrine'' (where direct competitors merge) and ''vertical merger doctrine'' (where a company merges with its own suppliers and distributors, cutting them off from supplying or distributing to competitors).

'''''Morning Call''''' is&lt;!-- should be "is", as per [[WP:TVNOW]] --&gt; an American TV business program that aired on [[CNBC]], from 10AM to 12 noon ET weekdays. The show premiered as ''[[Midday Call]]'' on February 4, 2002, offered a clear focus on real-time market coverage at the heart of the trading day. Previous programs shown in the same time slot were ''[[The Money Wheel]]'' with [[Ted David]] and [[Martha MacCallum]] (who later joined [[Fox News Channel]]) and ''[[Market Watch]]''. The program last aired August 8, 2007.

==About the program==
On February 3, 2006, Ted David, who had co-anchored ''Morning Call'' with Liz Claman since 2003, left the program while being promoted to senior anchor at CNBC Business Radio.  From 2006-02-06 to 2007-07-17, Claman was joined in the 10-11am hour by [[Mark Haines]] (who reported from the [[New York Stock Exchange]]), and in the 11am-noon hour by various anchors, including [[Dylan Ratigan]] (see anchor roster below).

On July 20, 2007, CNBC replaced the first hour of the two-hour program with an expanded ''[[Squawk on the Street]]'', due in part to Claman's departure from the network (which she joined [[Fox Business Network|Fox News Channel's sister network financial unit]] three months later).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnbc/cnbcs_new_mornings_squawk_on_the_street_expands_to_two_hours_63384.asp#more mediabistro.com: TVNewser&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dylan Ratigan]] and [[Trish Regan]] served as interim anchors for the program, which was completely revamped on 2007-07-23.  In addition to the aforementioned 2007-07-23 revamp, the anchors were joined on set by a guest contributor, very similar to ''[[Squawk Box]]''.

On August 8, 2007, the show was renamed—and replaced—by ''The Call''.  The name change to ''The Call'' with Dylan Ratigan (who left the show in late 2008 and was replaced by [[Larry Kudlow]]), [[Melissa Francis]], and Trish Regan on that date was due in part to avoid confusion with the early-morning  [[Bloomberg Television]] program of the same name.

A '''Neo-classical contract''' is a form of contract, defined by McNeil, describing a [[contract]] dependent upon [[wikt:trilateral|trilateral]] governance, in which "[[wikt:third party|third party]] assistance" is used  for resolving disputes or evaluating performance.&lt;ref&gt;I.R. Macneil, “Contracts: adjustment of long-term economic relations under classical, neoclassical, and relational contract law” (1977) ''Northwestern University Law Review'' vol:72 pg:854 .&lt;/ref&gt; Such contracts form a distinct group, along with classical and relational contracts, in McNeil's system of classification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="885">'''Ong Soo Hin''' is a [[Malaysian Chinese]] businessman and head of a salvaging company in south-east Asia.

He was born to Chinese parents in [[Malaysia]]. He was business partners with marine salvor [[Mike Hatcher]].

In 1996, Ong Soo Hin teamed up with [[Oxford University]] archaeologist [[Mensun Bound]] to work with Vietnam's [[National History Museum]] in excavating the [[Hoi An Wreck]] site off the coast of [[Hoi An]], [[Vietnam]]. The project took four years and cost an estimated $14 million. Over 250,000 intact examples of Vietnamese ceramic were recovered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16092">'''Performance based contracting''' ('''PBC'''), also known as '''[[performance-based logistics]]''' ('''PBL''') or '''performance-based acquisition''', is a product support strategy used to achieve measurable supplier performance. A PBC approach focuses on developing strategic [[performance metric]]s and directly relating contracting payment to performance against these metrics. Common metrics include [[availability]], [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]], [[maintainability]], [[support engineering|supportability]] and [[total cost of ownership]]. The primary means of accomplishing this are through incentivized, long-term contracts with specific and measurable levels of operational performance defined by the customer and agreed on by contracting parties. The incentivized performance measures aim to motivate the supplier to implement enhanced practices that offer improved performance and cost effective. This stands in contrast to the conventional transaction-based, or [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] approach, where payment is related to completion of milestones and project deliverables.

Performance-Based approaches are most widely used the defense industry, but can be applied across any spend category.

==Overview==
PBC is about buying performance, not transactional goods and services, through an integrated acquisition and [[logistics]] process delivering improved capability to a range of products and services. PBC is a support strategy that places primary emphasis on optimising system support to meet the needs of the user. PBCs delineate outcome performance goals, ensure that responsibilities are assigned, provide incentives for attaining these goals, and facilitate the overall life-cycle management of system reliability, supportability, and total ownership costs.
A PBC in practice involves a contracting agency (who are contracting the work to an external provider) and a contractor (who are responsible for completing the work set out in the contract). Several other parties are often involved, including subcontractors, a legal team and consultants. These parties work for both contracting agency and contractor completing various elements of work associated with contract development, contracted work completion or performance management / measurement.

United States [[Federal Acquisition Regulation|federal law]] defines performance-based acquisition &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2037_6.html#wp1074195 Federal Acquisition Regulation, Subpart 37.7: Performance-Based Acquisition], accessed 13 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and treats it as "the preferred method for acquiring services".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2037_1.html#wp1082895 Federal Acquisition Regulation, Subpart 37.102: Service contracts: general - policy], accessed 13 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
A typical process for implementing a PBC is as follows:

#Business Case – a document which reviews potential risks, benefits and other potential impacts of a PBC, usually presented to senior managers to aid in their decision making
#Outcomes – a short statement reflecting the desired result or final deliverable of the contract
#Measures – define a set of performance measures that collectively measure the organisations performance against the outcome statement
#Levels – set performance levels for the performance measures, i.e. how well the contractor needs to perform
#Payment – develop a set of payment curves which set out the pay for performance regime i.e. how much the contractor gets paid for their performance level
#Incentives – set out a group of incentives that encourage positive behaviours and discourage negative behaviours
#Contract – draft, review, workshop and finalise a contract which covers all aspects of the performance, payment and terms and conditions of the relationship
#Review – conduct an analysis of the outcomes of the PBC, taking into account the differing definitions of success from the different groups involved in the contract.

===Naming===
PBC is the name used in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]] to describe the practice of attaching contract payment to a set of [[performance metric]]s. It is commonly known as [[performance-based logistics]] in the US and Contracting for Availability or [[Contractor Logistics Support]] in the UK. Although it was developed in the US for defence applications, and is most actively applied there, PBC strategies are growing in popularity around the world and in industry sectors other than defence. In particular, PBC frameworks are becoming popular in shipping, transport, health services and the energy sector.

==Applications==

===Defence===
PBC is widely applied in the Australian defence sector, primarily by the major acquisition and support organisation, the [[Defence Material Organisation]] (DMO). It is particularly useful in the defence environment because of the inherent complexity and large scale of the projects.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Recently, Australian Defence has initiated an escalation of the use of PBCs with the strategic aims of improving capability outcomes and reducing total cost of ownership. In Australia and the US, PBC frameworks are most commonly applied in Defence situations.

PBC frameworks are currently being used in numerous Defence related projects, including:{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

* [[Lockheed Martin]][http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/press-releases/2014/november/MFC-111814-2014-Secretary-of-Defense-PBL-Award.html]

===Industry===
Although it is applied primarily in the defence environment, PBC is becoming more popular{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} in a broader range of private and public sector organisations as they seek to reduce costs and create a closer link between expenditure and performance goals.

Areas outside defence where PBC is applied include:{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* Commercial Shipping
* Public Transport
* Health Services
* Energy Generation
* [[Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul]]
* Commercial Airlines
* Manufacturing
* [[IT]] and [[Business Process Outsourcing]] (BPO)
* Facilities Management
Some examples:
* PBC for Australian Road Maintenance.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} This case study{{which|date=September 2012}} provides insight into road maintenance contracts conducted in [[Western Australia]] and [[New South Wales]]. In both instances, very positive outcomes are recorded. Another case study related to Performance Based Contracting in Road Maintenance claims that in 2005, 35 countries were employing PBC for Road Maintenance, and in 2006 15 others had implemented a PBC or were investigating its use.

===PB Contracts as related to Sourcing Business Models===
'''Procurement/Sourcing Business Models'''

A performance-based model is one of seven Sourcing Business Models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keith|first=Bonnie, et. al.,|title=Strategic Sourcing in the New Economy: Harnessing the Potential of Sourcing Business Models for Modern Procurement|year= 2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=NewYork|isbn=978-1137552181|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sourcing Business Models theory is a systems-based approach to structuring supplier relationships. A sourcing business model is a type of [[business model]] that is applied to business relationships where more than one party needs to work with another party to be successful. There are seven sourcing business models that range from the transactional to investment-based. The seven models are: Basic Provider, Approved Provider, Preferred Provider, Performance-Based/Managed Services Model, Vested Business Model, Shared Services Model, and Equity Partnership Model. Sourcing business models are targeted for procurement professionals seeking a modern approach for achieving the best fit between buyers and suppliers. Sourcing business model theory is based on a collaborative research effort by the [[University of Tennessee]] (UT), the Sourcing Industry Group [https://www.sig.org/] (SIG) the Center for Outsourcing Research and Education [https://www.core-outsourcing.org/cpages/home-page] (CORE), and the International Association for Contracts and Commercial Management (IACCM). Their initial research formed the basis for the 2015 book, ''Strategic Sourcing in the New Economy: Harnessing the Potential of Sourcing Business Models in Modern Procurement.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keith|first=Bonnie, et. al.,|title=Strategic Sourcing in the New Economy: Harnessing the Potential of Sourcing Business Models for Modern Procurement|year= 2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=NewYork|isbn=978-1137552181|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
There is discussion{{where|date=September 2012}} about the efficacy of PBC as a product support measure. However, there is significant research to suggest that PBC can reduce costs and result in better supplier outputs/performance against metrics than traditional contracting approaches, such as transaction-based contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate, et. al.,|title=Vested: How P&amp;G, McDonald's, and Microsoft are Redefining Winning in Business Relationships|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230341705|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Defense/Air Force/Defense Acquisition University sponsored a research project conducted by the University of Tennessee study An American study into the effectiveness of PBC frameworks in Defence projects. The study found that projects employing a true PBC framework resulted in substantially lower costs and improved system readiness / capability when compared to non-PBC arrangements. The U.S. Department of Defense has many documented case studies from award winning PBL contracts.[https://dap.dau.mil/acquipedia/Pages/ArticleDetails.aspx?aid=68d85f91-3fbf-4182-b55a-f2dbc5a33943]

In addition, a study by [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] found that even incorporating a small amount of a PBC framework into weapons system support will create positive results.

In a more general sense, implementing a PBC framework has a broad range of benefits for organisations, contractors and contracting agencies{{why|date=September 2012}}, including:
* Improved contracting for supplier performance against supplier performance metrics
* Possible reduction in [[Total Cost of Ownership]] (TCO)
* Ability to forecast cost within contract bounds
* Improved accountability for performance
* Development of a clear understanding of performance requirements
* Promotion of strategic benefits for Contracting Agency and Contractor
* Integration of all contracting aspects in a single set of performance measures
* A 'Fair' contract 
* A greater understanding of [[Whole-life cost|life-cycle costs]]
* Investment in workforce and skills

The '''Prime Time Entertainment Network''' ('''PTEN''') was an [[United States|American]] [[television network]] that was operated by the Prime Time Consortium, a [[joint venture]] between the [[Warner Bros. Television|Warner Bros. Domestic Television]] subsidiary of [[Time Warner]] and [[Chris-Craft Industries]]. First launched on January 20, [[1993 in television|1993]] and operating until 1997, the network mainly aired drama programs aimed at adults between the ages of 18 and 54. At its peak, PTEN's programming was carried on 177 television stations, covering 93% of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Space, 2258, in the Year 1994|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-23/news/tv-14354_1|page=4|author=Susan King|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Times Mirror Company]]|date=January 23, 1994|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
At the time of PTEN's founding, co-owner Chris-Craft Industries owned [[Independent station (North America)|independent]] [[television station]]s in several large and mid-sized U.S. cities (among them its two largest stations, [[WWOR-TV]] in [[New York City]] and [[KCOP-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]]) through its [[BHC Communications|BHC Communications and United Television]] divisions, which formed the nuclei of the network.&lt;ref name=vty&gt;{{cite news|title=Warner weblet to 2-night sked|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR107288.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|author=Jim Benson|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information|Cahners Business Information]]|date=May 28, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PTEN was launched as a potential fifth television network, and was created in reaction to the success of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network (which debuted in October 1986, seven years before PTEN launched) as well as the successes of first-run syndicated programming during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It offered packaged nights of programming to participating television stations, beginning with a two-hour block on Wednesday evenings, with a second block (originally airing on Saturday, before moving to Monday for the 1994-95 season) being added in September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PTEN goes to two evenings, sort of|author=Mike Freeman|page=16|periodical=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=May 31, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the station groups involved in the Prime Time Consortium helped finance PTEN's programs; however, that deal was restructured at the beginning of the network's second year.

The service sought affiliations with various television stations not affiliated with the [[Big Three television networks]]. However, close to half of PTEN's initial affiliates were stations that were already affiliated with Fox; as a result, these stations usually scheduled PTEN programming around Fox's then five-night [[prime time]] schedule (although Fox would expand its schedule to seven nights with the addition of programming on Tuesdays and Wednesdays on January 19, 1993, the day before PTEN launched). PTEN launched on January 20, 1993, with two series: the science fiction series ''[[Time Trax]]'' and the action drama ''[[Kung Fu: The Legend Continues]]''.&lt;ref name=vty/&gt;

===Demise===
PTEN faced two obstacles created by its parent companies, that would affect the network. On November 2, 1993, the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner announced that it would form its own fifth network, [[The WB|The WB Television Network]], as a joint venture with the [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22543783.html Time Warner TV Network to Cover 40% of Nation], ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', November 2, 1993. Retrieved May 28, 2013 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Six days earlier, on October 27, [[Chris-Craft Industries]] announced the launch of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]), in a programming partnership with [[Paramount Television]] (which would become part-owner of the network in 1996). As a result, the core Chris-Craft independent stations (as well as those owned by [[Paramount Stations Group|Paramount]]) would serve as charter stations of the new network; Chris-Craft also chose to pull out of the partnership to focus on operating UPN.

The network also faced issues from some PTEN-affiliated stations that took issue with the network's barter split, which gave nine minutes of advertising time per hour to the syndicator, leaving only five minutes for the stations to sell and program locally. PTEN also ran into difficulty when the studio was forced to let stations out of their back-end commitments for several series. PTEN adopted a variable schedule for the 1995-96 season, for affiliates to schedule around The WB and UPN's programming on the night of their choosing. With Chris-Craft pulling out of the venture, PTEN essentially became a syndication service for its remaining shows. The network ceased operations in 1997. One of the two series that aired during the service's final year of operation, the [[science fiction]] [[drama]] ''[[Babylon 5]]'', would later be revived by [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], where it aired for a fifth and final season beginning in 1998.

'''Prodigy Finance''' is a fintech platform that enables [[Student loan|financing]] for international postgraduate students who attend a participating business school or postgraduate institution.

Prodigy Finance's loans are collectively funded by a community of alumni, institutional investors and qualified private investors who receive a financial and social return; while the borrower gains access to higher education that they might not otherwise be able to finance.

This borderless credit model enables educational loan financing to international students, whilst using predicted post-degree affordability rather than present-day salary. Since 2007, Prodigy Finance has disbursed over US$410 million through the platform to fund over 9,400 students from 118 nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prodigyfinance.com/|title=Prodigy Finance Website|website=Prodigy Finance Website|publisher=Prodigy Finance|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offering competitive interest rates and requiring no collateral or co-signer, Prodigy Finance is focused on making education accessible. Prodigy Finance is registered in London&lt;ref name="Numbers crunch for MBAs2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/b74fa2cc-21cb-11e1-a19f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1mun9C5Ld|title=Numbers crunch for MBAs|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Della|website=www.ft.com/|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; with offices in London, Cape Town and New York.

== Overview ==
Three INSEAD MBA graduates conceptualised Prodigy Finance during their studies in 2006, as their experience highlighted an opportunity to bridge the financing gap often experienced by high-potential international postgraduate students looking to attend a top school. Prodigy Finance was founded in 2007&lt;ref name="The Crowdsourced B-School Loan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323635504578213830493449440#articleTabs%3Darticle|title=The Crowdsourced B-School Loan|last1=Korn|first1=Melissa|website=online.wsj.com|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the intention of addressing this challenge, as Prodigy Finance Founder Cameron Stevens experienced himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/09/29/business-school-tuition-leadership-careers-education.html|title=How Can Anyone Afford B-School Now?|last1=Symonds|first1=Matt|website=www.forbes.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prodigy Finance concept was recognised at the 2006 International Venture Capital Investment Competition at INSEAD, resulting in the initial seed money for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/alumni/newsletter/July2006/Businessventurecompetition.htm|title=12th INSEAD Business Venture Competition|website=INSEAD.edu|publisher=INSEAD Alumni|accessdate=12 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711022027/http://www.insead.edu/alumni/newsletter/July2006/Businessventurecompetition.htm|archivedate=11 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Prodigy Finance started with a peer-to-peer funding programme for INSEAD students.&lt;ref name="Would you invest in a business student?"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/expat-money/6271844/Would-you-invest-in-a-business-student.html|title=Would you invest in a business student?|last1=Liew|first1=Jonathan|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alumni invested in bonds which enabled students to study their MBA at that institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/article/cash-strapped-mba-students-look-money-new-places|title=Cash-strapped MBA students look for money in new places|last1=Barber|first1=Timothy|website=www.cityam.com|publisher=City AM|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leveraging this peer-to-peer lending, Prodigy Finance began offering loans to MBA candidates enrolled at other leading business schools.

In 2014, Prodigy Finance announced the launch of a US$25 million Education Note in partnership with the [[Credit Suisse]] Impact Investing and Microfinance team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2014/10/53710-prodigy-finance-credit-suisse-launch-worlds-first-education-note/|title=Prodigy Finance &amp; Credit Suisse Launch World’s First Education Note|last1=Hobey|first1=Erin|website=Crowdfund Insider|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Education Note has a focus on students from emerging markets, enabling them to study at top postgraduate programmes.

In 2015, Prodigy Finance announced a $12.5 million equity investment from [[Balderton Capital]] and various angel investors, and $110 million in loan capital from Credit Suisse, [[Deutsche Bank]] and other private investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b3960ec4-3c33-11e5-bbd1-b37bc06f590c.html#axzz3j3izBV1P|title=Crowdfunder raises £100m for African and Asian MBA students|last1=Moules|first1=Jonathan|website=Financial Times|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Prodigy Finance announced a $240 million fundraise. This included a $40 million Series C equity round led by international venture capital firm [[Index Ventures]], with participation from Balderton Capital and [[Rand Merchant Investment Holdings|AlphaCode]]; and a $200 million debt facility led by a global investment bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/business/dealbook/prodigy-finance-international-college-students.html?smid=tw-share|title=Lender to foreign students raises $40 million in financing|last1=Merced|first1=Michael|website=The New York Times|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


== Loans for international students ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2018}}
Prodigy Finance supports postgraduate programmes in the fields of business, engineering, public policy, law and health sciences. 

This includes the [[Financial Times]] Top 100 ranked business schools, such as [[INSEAD]], [[Wharton Business School|Wharton]], [[Chicago Booth]], [[Columbia Business School]], [[London Business School]], [[NUS Business School|NUS]], [[Saïd Business School|University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School]], [[Stanford Business School|Stanford]], and [[Yale School of Management]].

To be eligible for a loan, students must be studying outside of their home country, or country of residence. One exception is in the United Kingdom, as Prodigy Finance can lend to domestic students. Applicants must already be accepted at a participating institution to qualify.

[[File:Rayon synthesis.webm|thumb|When a solution of cellulose in cuprammonium hydroxide comes into contact with sulfuric acid, the cellulose begins to precipitate from the solution. The sulfuric acid reacts with a complex compound of copper and dissolves it. Thin blue fibers of rayon are formed. After some time, sulfuric acid reacts with the complex compound and washes out the copper salts from the fibers. The fibers become colorless.]]

'''Rayon''' is a manufactured [[fiber]] made from regenerated [[cellulose fiber]]. The many types and grades of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of [[natural fiber]]s such as [[silk]], [[wool]], [[cotton]], and [[linen]]. The types that resemble silk are often called [[art silk|artificial silk]]. 

Rayon is made from purified [[cellulose]], primarily from [[dissolving pulp|wood pulp]], which is chemically converted into a soluble compound. It is then dissolved and forced through a [[spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]] to produce filaments which are chemically solidified, resulting in fibers of nearly pure cellulose.&lt;ref name="fibersource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afma.org/f-tutor/rayon.htm |title=Rayon Fiber (Viscose) |work=afma.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406101953/http://www.afma.org/f-tutor/rayon.htm |archivedate=April 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring [[polymer]]s, it is considered a [[semisynthesis|semisynthetic]] fiber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ed070p887|bibcode=1993JChEd..70..887K |title=Rayon: the first semi-synthetic fiber product |year= 1993 |last1= Kauffman |first1= George B. |journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 70 |issue= 11 |page= 887}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in precise [[usage]] the term [[synthetic fiber]] is sometimes reserved for [[total synthesis|fully synthetic]] fibers. Specific types of rayon include [[viscose]], [[Modal (textile)|modal]] and [[lyocell]], each of which differs in manufacturing process and properties of the finished product.

==Rayon and its variations==

===Nitrocellulose===
The solubility of [[nitrocellulose]] in [[organic solvents]] such as [[ether]] and [[acetone]] was the basis for the first "[[artificial silk]]" by Georges Audemars in about 1855. Although it is chemically distinct from rayon, cellulose was successfully solubilized albeit with chemical modification.  Commercial production started in 1891, but the result was [[flammable]] and more expensive than cellulose acetate or [[cuprammonium]] rayon. Because of this expense, production ceased early in the 1900s.  Nitrocellulose was briefly known as "mother-in-law silk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Editors|first = Time-Life|title = Inventive Genius|publisher = Time-Life Books|location = New York|year = 1991|isbn = 0-8094-7699-1|page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Hastings Griffin]] invented the double-godet, a special stretch-spinning process that changed artificial silk to rayon, rendering it usable in many industrial products such as tire cords and clothing. Nathan Rosenstein invented the "spunize process" by which he turned rayon from a hard fiber to a fabric. This allowed rayon to become a popular raw material in textiles.

===Acetate ===
Rayon should not be confused with acetate ([[cellulose acetate]]) or [[triacetate]]. These terms have often been used interchangeably in the past but are now distinct. While rayon reconstitutes the natural cellulose polymer, the older acetate process reacts cellulose with [[acetic anhydride]] to form [[cellulose acetate]]. Furthermore, rayon production requires carbon disulfide as a solvent while acetate uses considerably safer solvents such as [[acetone]]. However, rayon is a more robust fiber than the otherwise similar acetate, and has come to dominate.

===Cuprammonium method===
Swiss [[chemist]] [[Matthias Eduard Schweizer]] (1818–1860) discovered that cellulose dissolved in [[Schweizer's reagent|tetraaminecopper dihydroxide]]. [[Max Fremery]] and [[Johann Urban]] developed a method to produce [[Carbon (fiber)|carbon fiber]]s for use in [[light bulb]]s in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090322020858/http://www.industriepark-oberbruch.de/publish/en/location/history/historie.html Over 100 years old and still going strong From Glanzstoff (artificial silk) factory to industry park]. industriepark-oberbruch.de&lt;/ref&gt; Production of [[cuprammonium rayon]] for [[textiles]] started in 1899 in the [[Vereinigte Glanzstoff Fabriken AG]] in [[Oberbruch Industry Park|Oberbruch]] near [[Aachen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Verinigte Glanstoff Fabriken'' merged with the ''Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabrieken'' in 1929 to form the ''Algemene Kunstzijde Unie'', [[AkzoNobel]]'s predecessor&lt;/ref&gt; Improvement by the [[J. P. Bemberg AG]] in 1904 made the artificial silk a product comparable to [[silk|real silk]].&lt;ref name=r7&gt;''J. P. Bemberg AG'' was one of the ''[[Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken]]'' which merged into the Dutch based ''Algemene Kunstzijde Unie'' (AKU)--[[AkzoNobel]] today&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viscose method===
{{merge from|viscose|discuss=Talk:Viscose#viscose and rayon are not the same|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Viscose Rayon spinning machine.JPG|thumb|right|A device for spinning Viscose Rayon dating from 1901]]
English chemist [[Charles Frederick Cross]] and his collaborators, [[Edward John Bevan]] and Clayton Beadle, patented their artificial silk in 1894. They named their material "[[viscose]]", because its production involved the intermediacy of a highly viscous solution. The process built on the reaction of [[cellulose]] with a strong base, followed by treatment of that solution with [[carbon disulfide]] to give a [[xanthate]] derivative. The xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step. The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the U.K. company [[Courtaulds|Courtaulds Fibres]] in 1905. Courtaulds formed an American division, [[American Viscose Corporation|American Viscose]], (later known as Avtex Fibers) to produce their formulation in the United States in 1910.&lt;ref name="Owen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Owen|title=The Rise and Fall of Great Companies: Courtaulds and the Reshaping of the Man-Made Fibres Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=coEnAQAAMAAJ|date=9 September 2010|publisher=OUP/Pasold Research Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "rayon" was adopted in 1924, with "viscose" being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and [[cellophane]]. In Europe, though, the fabric itself became known as "viscose", which has been ruled an acceptable alternative term for rayon by the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The viscose method can use wood as a source of cellulose, whereas other routes to rayon require lignin-free cellulose as starting material. The use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper, so it was used on a larger scale than the other methods. On the other hand, the viscose process affords large amounts of contaminated waste water. Rayon was produced only as a filament fiber until the 1930s, when methods were developed to utilize "broken waste rayon" as [[Staple (textiles)|staple]] fiber.

The physical properties of rayon remain unchanged until the development of high-tenacity rayon in the 1940s. Further research and development led to high-wet-modulus rayon (HWM rayon) in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Kadolph"&gt;{{cite book|title=Textiles |edition=9 |author1=Kadolph, Sara J. |author2=Langford, Anna L. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-025443-6|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in the UK was centred on the government-funded [[British Rayon Research Association]].

Industrial applications of rayon emerged around 1935. Substituting cotton fiber in tires and belts, industrial types of rayon developed a totally different set of properties, amongst which tensile strength (elasticity)&lt;!-- tensile strength and elasticity are different properties, the author is confused --&gt; was paramount.

===Lyocell===
{{main|Lyocell}}
The [[Lyocell]] process relies on dissolution of cellulose products in a solvent, [[N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide|N-methylmorpholine N-oxide]]. The process starts with woody sources of cellulose and involves dry jet-wet spinning. It was developed at the now defunct American Enka and Courtaulds Fibres. As of 2013, Lenzing's Tencel brand is perhaps the most widely known lyocell fiber producer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Modal ===
Modal is a type of rayon, a semi-synthetic [[cellulose fiber]] made by [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] reconstituted [[cellulose]], in this case often from [[beech]] trees. Modal is used alone or with other fibers (often cotton or [[spandex]]) in clothing and household items such as pajamas, underwear, bathrobes, towels, and bedsheets. 

Modal is processed under different conditions to produce a fiber that is stronger and more stable when it is wet than standard rayon, yet has a soft feel, similar to cotton. It can be [[Clothes dryer|tumble dried]] without damage due to its increased molecular alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.undershirts.co.uk/blogs/research/viscose-vs-modal-vs-lyocell|title=Viscose vs. Modal vs. Lyocell - Difference?|work=Robert Owen Undershirts Co|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabric has been known to [[Pill (textile)|pill]] less than cotton due to fiber properties and lower surface friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-wash-modal-clothes-2145794|title=How to Wash Modal Clothes|work=The Spruce|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-Modal is a variant of Modal textiles. The material is softer than cotton and has desirable properties that include higher resistance to shrinking and moisture wicking.

==Major fiber properties==
Rayon is a versatile fiber and is widely claimed to have the same comfort properties as natural fibers, although the drape and slipperiness of rayon textiles are often more like nylon. It can imitate the feel and texture of [[silk]], [[wool]], [[cotton]] and [[linen]]. The fibers are easily [[Dyeing|dyed]] in a wide range of colors. Rayon fabrics are soft, smooth, cool, comfortable, and highly absorbent, but they do not insulate body heat, making them ideal for use in hot and humid climates, although also making their "hand" (feel) cool and sometimes almost slimy to the touch.&lt;ref name="LaBat"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classifications &amp; Analysis of Textiles: A Handbook|author1=Karen L. LaBat  |author2=Carol J. Salusso |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=University of Minnesota|year= 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The durability and appearance retention of regular viscose rayon are low, especially when wet; also, rayon has the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber. However, HWM rayon (high-wet-modulus rayon) is much stronger and exhibits higher durability and appearance retention. Recommended care for regular viscose rayon is dry-cleaning only. HWM rayon can be machine-washed.&lt;ref name="Kadolph"/&gt;

Rayon industrial yarns outperform polyester and are produced for belts in high performance tires (e.g. Cordenka, Germany).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Physical structure==
Regular rayon has lengthwise lines called [[:wikt:striation|striation]]s and its cross-section is an indented circular shape. The cross-sections of HWM and cupra rayon are rounder. [[wiktionary:filament|Filament]] rayon [[yarn]]s vary from 80 to 980 [[wiktionary:filament|filaments]] per [[yarn]] and vary in size from 40 to 5000 [[Denier (unit)|denier]]. [[Staple (textiles)|Staple fibers]] range from 1.5 to 15 denier and are mechanically or chemically crimped. Rayon fibers are naturally very bright, but the addition of delustering [[pigments]] cuts down on this natural brightness.&lt;ref name="Kadolph"/&gt;

==Production method==
[[File:Cellulose Haworth.svg|thumb|Cellulose]]

''Regular rayon'' (or ''viscose'') is the most widely produced form of rayon. This method of rayon production has been used since the early 1900s and it has the ability to produce either filament or staple fibers. The process is as follows:

===The steps===
#'''''Cellulose.''''' Production begins with processed cellulose (obtained from wood pulp and plant fibers). The cellulose content in the pulp should be around 87% to 95%.
#'''''Immersion.''''' The cellulose is dissolved in [[caustic soda]]:&lt;br&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}NaOH → (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ONa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;br&gt; is the chemical reaction. The reaction converts cellulose to alkali cellulose and removes impurities.
#'''''Pressing.''''' The solution is then pressed between rollers to remove excess liquid. The pressing is done in accordance with the press-weight ratio. Press weight ratio is the ratio between the pressed alkali cellulose sheet weight to the weight of air dried pulp. It is adjusted to 2.7-3.&lt;ref&gt;VB Gupta, VK Kothari, AK Sengupta, MANUFACTURED FIBRE TECHNOLOGY, published in 1997 by chapman &amp; hall, London.{{rp|484}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''"White Crumb."''''' The pressed sheets are crumbled or shredded to produce what is known as "white crumb."
#'''''Ageing.''''' The "white crumb" is aged through exposure to [[oxygen]]. This is a depolymerization step and is avoided in case of polynosics.
#'''''"Xanthation."''''' The aged "white crumb" is mixed with [[carbon disulfide]] in a process known as "Xanthation," in which the aged alkali cellulose crumbs are placed in vats and are allowed to react with carbon disulfide under controlled temperature (20 to 30&amp;nbsp;°C) to form cellulose xanthate:
#:(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ONa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;minus;SC&amp;minus;SNa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;is the reaction.
#'''''"Orange-Yellow Crumb."''''' The Xanthation changes the chemical makeup of the cellulose mixture, and the resulting product is now called "yellow crumb." This orange coloration is due to the formation  of sodium trithiocarbonate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;.VB Gupta, VK Kothari, AK Sengupta, MANUFACTURED FIBRE TECHNOLOGY, published in 1997 by chapman &amp; hall, London{{rp|485}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''Viscose.''''' The "yellow crumb" is dissolved in a caustic solution to form viscose.
#'''''Ripening.''''' The viscose is set to stand for a period of time, allowing it to ripen:
#:(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;minus;SC&amp;minus;SNa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}NaOH&lt;br&gt; is the reaction.
#'''''Filtering.''''' After ripening, the viscose is filtered to remove any undissolved particles.
#'''''Degassing.''''' Any bubbles of air are pressed from the viscose in a degassing process.
#'''''Extruding.''''' The viscose solution is extruded through a [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]], which resembles a shower head with many small holes.
#'''''Acid Bath.''''' As the viscose exits the spinneret, it lands in a bath of [[sulfuric acid]], resulting in the formation of rayon filaments. The acid is used as a regenerating agent. It converts cellulose xanthate back to cellulose. The regeneration step is rapid which doesn't allow proper orientation of cellulose molecules. So to delay the process of regeneration, zinc sulphate is used in the bath which converts cellulose xanthate to zinc cellulose xanthate thus providing time for proper orientation to take place before regeneration.  
#:(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;minus;SC&amp;minus;SNa)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{mvar|n}}H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sub&gt; + {{mvar|n}}CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1|2}}{{mvar|n}}Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt; is the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;VB Gupta, VK Kothari, AK Sengupta, MANUFACTURED FIBRE TECHNOLOGY, published in 1997 by chapman &amp; hall, London.{{rp|487}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''Spinning.''''' The spinning of viscose rayon fibre is done using wet spinning process. The filaments are allowed to pass through a coagulation bath after extrusion from the spinneret holes. Two-way mass transfer takes place.
#'''''Drawing.''''' The rayon filaments are stretched, in a procedure known as drawing, to straighten out the fibers.
#'''''Washing.''''' The fibers are then washed to remove any residual chemicals from them.
#'''''Cutting.''''' If filament fibers are desired, then the process ends here. The filaments are cut down when producing staple fibers.&lt;ref name="fibersource"/&gt;

''High wet modulus rayon (HWM)'' is a modified version of viscose that has a greater strength when wet. It also has the ability to be [[mercerized]] like cotton. HWM rayons are also known as "polynosic." Polynosic fibers are dimensionally stable, and do not shrink or get pulled out of shape when wet like many rayons. They are also wear resistant and strong while maintaining a soft, silky feel. They are sometimes identified by the trade name [[Modal (textile)|Modal]].&lt;ref name="Ohio"&gt;Joyce A. Smith. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100331124255/http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/5000/5538.html Rayon – The Multi-Faceted Fiber]. Ohio State University Rayon Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

''High-tenacity rayon'' is another modified version of viscose that has almost twice the strength of HWM. This type of rayon is typically used for industrial purposes such as tire cord.&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

''Cuprammonium rayon'' has properties similar to viscose; however, during its production, the cellulose is combined with [[copper]] and [[ammonia]] ([[Schweizer's reagent]]). Due to the detrimental environmental effects of this production method, cuprammonium rayon is no longer produced in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Ohio"/&gt;

==Manufacturing health hazards==
''See also [[Viscose#Pollution and harm to workers]]''

Highly toxic [[carbon disulfide]] is used in the production of viscose, leading to many incidents and legal cases.&lt;ref name=court&gt;Supreme Court of Alabama. [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/al-supreme-court/1023084.html COURTAULDS FIBERS, INC. v. Horace L. LONG, Jr., et al.&lt;br&gt; Horace L. Long, Jr., et al. v. Courtaulds Fibers, Inc.]
1971996 and 1972028.&lt;br&gt;Decided: September 15, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, the volatile carbon disulfide is lost before the rayon gets to the consumer; the rayon itself is basically pure cellulose.&lt;ref name=blancbook/&gt; Studies from the 1930s show that 30% of American rayon workers suffered severe effects. Rates of disability in modern factories (mainly in China, Indonesia and India) are unknown.&lt;ref name="Monosson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.aak9834|title=Toxic textiles|year= 2016 |last1= Monosson |first1= Emily |journal= Science|volume= 354|issue= 6315 |page=977|bibcode= 2016Sci...354..977M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scientificamerican.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=bamboo-boom|title=Bamboo Boom: Is This Material for You?|author=Michelle Nijhuis|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal and biodegradability==
{{see also|Microplastics}}
The biodegradability of various fibers in soil burial and sewage sludge was evaluated by Korean researchers. Rayon was found to be more biodegradable than cotton, and cotton more than acetate. The more water-repellent the rayon-based fabric, the more slowly it will decompose.&lt;ref name="biodegrade1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/app.20879|title=Biodegradability of cellulose fabrics|year=2004|last1=Park|first1=Chung Hee|last2=Kang|first2=Yun Kyung|last3=Im|first3=Seung Soon|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|volume=94|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silverfish]] can eat rayon.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} 

A recent ocean survey found that rayon contributed to 56.9% of the total fibers found in [[deep sea|deep ocean]] areas, the rest being [[polyester]], [[polyamides]], [[acetate]] and [[acrylic fiber|acrylic]].&lt;ref name="biodegrade2"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/12/141216212253.htm Abundance of microplastics in the world's deep seas] (2014-12-16). Retrieved on 2014-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative to cotton==
Rising cotton prices in 2010 led clothing makers to begin replacing [[cotton]] with rayon in their fabrics. As demand for rayon increases, companies such as [[Fortress Paper]] have been investing in [[pulp mill]]s to increase production. Rayon now sells for as much as $2.70 per pound, which has led to an increase in the retail price of clothing made with rayon, yet rayon has a price advantage over cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Wirz, Matt (January 7, 2011) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703730704576066291209981236 "The Touch, The Feel – Of Rayon,"] ''Wall Street Journal'', Money and Investment section, p. c1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mislabelling===
''See also [[Bamboo textile]]''

In 2010, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued letters informing over 100 companies that they were mislabeling products made of rayon  as being made from [[bamboo]], deceiving environmentally conscious consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Lipka |first=Mitch |date=2010-02-03 |url= https://www.aol.com/2010/02/03/bamboo-zled-ftc-says-retailers-fibbed-about-bamboo-product-clai/ |title= Bamboo-zled: FTC Says Retailers Fibbed about Bamboo Product Claims |publisher=AOL.com |accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the FTC filed complaints against Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Nordstrom, J.C. Penney, Backcountry.com, and their subsidiaries, for continuing to deceptively sell rayon mislabeled as bamboo. The four companies were required to pay civil penalties totaling {{USD|1.3 million}} for violating the "Textile Act and the Textile Rules" and Section 5(m)(1)(B) of the FTC Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2015-12-09 |url= https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/12/nordstrom-bed-bath-beyond-backcountrycom-jc-penney-pay-penalties |title= Nordstrom, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Backcountry.com, and J.C.

===Impact on U.S. textile industry===
Rayon contributed partly to the decline of the US [[textile industry]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="edexcel"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waugh |first1=Steve |authorlink1=Steve Waugh |last2=Wright |first2=John  |date=2009 |title=The USA 1919-1941, GCSE Modern World History for Edexcel |publisher=Hodder Education |page=24 |isbn=978-0-340-98441-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is far cheaper to produce than wool, cotton, or silk. It also requires less processing and hence fewer workers.  In addition, it was 50% cheaper than silk during the 1920s in the US.&lt;ref name="edexcel"/&gt;  Then, it was used initially for men's socks but later for [[lingerie]] and women's [[stockings]].&lt;ref name="edexcel"/&gt;

==Producers==
[[Trade name]]s are used within the rayon industry to label the type of rayon in the product. Viscose Rayon was first produced in Coventry England in 1905 by Courtaulds.

''Bemberg'' is a trade name for [[cuprammonium rayon|cupramonium rayon]] developed by [[Bemberg|J. P. Bemberg]]. Bemberg performs much like viscose but has a smaller diameter and comes closest to silk in feel. Bemberg is no longer produced in [[Italy]], but is still produced in Japan, due to [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] regulations in the US. The fibers are finer than viscose rayon.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt;

''[[Modal (textile)|Modal]]'' and ''[[Tencel]]'' are widely used forms of rayon produced by [[Lenzing AG]]. Tencel, generic name ''lyocell'', is made by a slightly different solvent recovery process, and is considered a different fiber by the US FTC. Tencel lyocell was first produced commercially by [[Courtaulds, Grimsby|Courtaulds' Grimsby plant]] in England. The process, which dissolves cellulose without a chemical reaction, was developed by Courtaulds Research.

[[AkzoNobel#Fibres|Accordis]] was a major manufacturer of cellulose based fibers and yarns. Production facilities can be found throughout Europe, the U.S. and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090923204603/http://www.colbond.us/history.htm Colbond History]. colbond.us. Acordis was a spinoff by [[AkzoNobel]] in 2000 after it had acquired [[Courtaulds]].  It was through [[AkzoNobel]]'s original parent company's, the ''Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek'' (ENKA), joint venture with ''Rento Hofstede Crull'' 's ''De Vijf'', named ''De Internationale Spinpot Exploitatie Maatschappij'' (''ISEM'') that the commercial production of rayon was made viable.  Hofstede Crull had supplied the solution for the problem of manufacturing rayon with his ''Driving Device For A Centrifugal Spinning Machine'' in 1925 (1931 {{US Patent|1798312}}).  The ''ISEM'' was fully integrated with the ''Algemene Kunstzijde Unie'', the Nederlandse Kunstzijdefabriek's successor, with the death of Hofstede Crull in 1938. (See [[AkzoNobel]], [[American Enka Company]], and also [[:nl:Rento Hofstede Crull|Rento Hofstede Crull]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Visil rayon'' is a [[flame retardant]] form of viscose which has [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] embedded in the fiber during manufacturing.

[[North American Rayon Corporation]] of [[Tennessee]] produced viscose rayon until its closure in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="Tennessee encyclopedia"&gt;"[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=1005 North American Rayon Corporation and American Bemberg Corporation]" in the Tennessee Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North American Rayon Corporation of Tennessee was an American subsidiary of ''J. P. Bemburg A.G.'' which was part of the ''Vereinigte Glanstoff Fabriken'' that were absorbed into the Dutch ''AKU'', [[AkzoNobel]] today&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grasim]] of [[India]] is the largest producer of rayon in the world (claiming 24% market share). It has plants in [[Nagda]], [[Kharach]] and [[Harihar]] – all in India, as well as joint ventures in Canada, Laos and China.&lt;ref name="Grasim"&gt;[http://www.grasim.com/products/birla_viscose.htm Grasim].

A '''tax lien'''  is a  [[lien]] imposed by law upon a property to secure the payment of taxes. A tax lien may be imposed for delinquent [[tax]]es owed on [[real property]] or [[personal property]], or as a result of failure to pay income taxes or other taxes.

==Federal tax lien in the United States==
In the United States, a federal tax lien may arise in connection with any kind of federal tax, including but not limited to [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]], [[gift tax]], or [[Inheritance tax|estate tax]].

===Federal tax lien basics===
[[Internal Revenue Code]] section 6321 provides:

::Sec. 6321. LIEN FOR TAXES.

::If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belong to such person.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|6321}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal Revenue Code section 6322 provides:

::Sec. 6322. PERIOD OF Tax Lien

::Unless another date is specifically fixed by law, the lien imposed by section 6321 shall arise at the time the assessment is made and shall continue until the liability for the amount so assessed (or a judgment against the taxpayer arising out of such liability) is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6322}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "assessment" refers to the statutory assessment made by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) under {{usc|26|6201}} (that is, the formal recording of the tax in the official books and records at the office of the Secretary of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]]&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6203}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). Generally, the "person liable to pay any tax" described in section 6321 must pay the tax within ten days of the written ''notice and demand''.&lt;ref&gt;See 26 C.F.R. section 601.103(a).&lt;/ref&gt; If the taxpayer fails to pay the tax within the ten-day period, the tax lien arises automatically (i.e., by operation of law), and is ''effective retroactively to (i.e., arises at) the date of the assessment'', even though the ten-day period necessarily expires after the assessment date.

Under the doctrine of ''[[Glass City Bank v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;326 U.S. 265 (1945).&lt;/ref&gt; the tax lien applies not only to property and rights to property owned by the taxpayer at the time of the assessment, but also to [[after-acquired property]] (i.e., to any property owned by the taxpayer during the life of the lien).

The statute of limitations under which a federal tax lien may become "unenforceable by reason of lapse of time" is found at {{usc|26|6502}}. For taxes assessed on or after November 6, 1990, the lien generally becomes unenforceable ten years after the date of assessment. For taxes assessed on or before November 5, 1990, a prior version of section 6502 provides for a limitations period of six years after the date of assessment. Various exceptions may extend the time periods.

===Perfection of federal tax liens against third parties (the Notice of Federal Tax Lien)===
A federal tax lien arising by law as described above is valid against the taxpayer without any further action by the government.

The general rule is that where two or more creditors have competing liens against the same property, the creditor whose lien was perfected at the earlier time takes priority over the creditor whose lien was perfected at a later time (there are exceptions to this rule). Thus, if the government (which is treated as a "''creditor''" with respect to unpaid taxes) properly files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) before another creditor can perfect its own lien, the tax lien will often take priority over the other lien.

To "perfect" the tax lien (to create a priority right) against persons other than the taxpayer (such as competing creditors), the government generally must file the NFTL&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the records of the county or state where the property is located, with the rules varying from state to state. At the time the notice is filed, public notice is deemed to have been given to the third parties (especially the taxpayer's other creditors, etc.) that the Internal Revenue Service has a claim against all property owned by the taxpayer as of the assessment date (which is generally prior to the date the NFTL is filed), and to all property acquired by the taxpayer after the assessment date (as noted above, the lien attaches to all of a taxpayer's property such as homes, land and vehicles and to all of a taxpayer's rights to property such as promissory notes or accounts receivable). Although the federal tax lien is effective against the taxpayer on the assessment date, the ''priority'' right against third party creditors arises at a later time: the date the NFTL is filed. The form and content of the notice of federal tax lien is governed only by federal law, regardless of any requirements of state or local law.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constit., art. VI, cl. 2; And this: "The form and content of the notice referred to in subsection (a) shall be prescribed by the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate]. Such notice shall be valid notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the form or content of a notice of lien" (see {{usc|26|6323(f)(3)}}). And, from the U.S. Treasury regulations: "(d) [. . . ] (1) In general. —The notice referred to in §301.6323(a)-1 shall be filed on Form 668, 'Notice of Federal Tax Lien under Internal Revenue Laws'. Such notice is valid notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the form or content of a notice of lien. For example, omission from the notice of lien of a description of the property subject to the lien does not affect the validity thereof even though State law may require that the notice contain a description of the property subject to the lien." See 26 C.F.R. sec. 301.6323(f)-1(d)(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

::The NFTL is merely a device which gives notice to interested parties of the existence of the federal tax lien. Thus, the NFTL's function is to perfect and obtain priority for the federal tax lien. The filing or refiling of the NFTL has no effect on the expiration date of collection statute of limitations provided in [Internal Revenue Code] §6502. Accordingly, even if the NFTL is refiled, if no event extends the collection statute of limitations, the IRS cannot take any further administrative collection action. Conversely, the IRS's failure to refile the NFTL does not affect the existence of an otherwise valid underlying federal tax lien, i.e., the underlying lien remains valid but loses its priority.&lt;ref&gt;Steven R. Mather, J.D., CPA &amp; Paul H. Weisman, J.D., ''Federal Tax Collection Procedure – Liens, Levies, Suits and Third Party Liability'', U.S. Income Portfolios, Vol. 637 (1st ed. 2012), Bloomberg BNA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent liens taking priority over previously filed federal tax liens===
In certain cases, the lien of another creditor (or the interest of an owner) may take priority over a federal tax lien even if the NFTL was filed before the other creditor's lien was perfected (or before the owner's interest was acquired). Some examples include the liens of certain purchasers of securities, liens on certain motor vehicles, and the interest held by a retail purchaser of certain personal property.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|6323(b)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal law also allows a state—if the state legislature so elects by statute—to enjoy a higher priority than the federal tax lien with respect to certain state tax liens on property where the related tax is based on the ''value of that property''. For example, the lien based on the annual real estate property tax in Texas takes priority over the federal tax lien, even where an NFTL for the federal lien was recorded prior to the time the Texas tax lien arose,&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6323(b)(6)}} and Tex. Tax Code sections 32.04 and 32.05(b).&lt;/ref&gt; and even though no notice of the Texas tax lien is required to be filed or recorded at all.

===Certificate of release of federal tax lien===
In order to have the record of a lien released a taxpayer must obtain a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the IRS will not issue a certificate of release of lien until the tax has either been paid in full or the IRS no longer has a legal interest in collecting the tax. The IRS has standardized procedures for lien releases, discharges and subordination. In situations that qualify for the removal of a lien, the IRS will generally remove the lien within 30 days and the taxpayer may receive a copy of the Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien. The current form of the Notice of Federal Tax Lien utilized by the IRS contains a provision that provides that the NFTL is released by its own terms at the conclusion of the statute of limitations period described above provided that the NFTL has not been refiled by the date indicated on the form. The effect of this provision is that the NFTL operates as a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien on the day after the date indicated in the form by its own terms.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===The difference between a federal tax lien and an administrative levy===
The creation of a tax lien, and the subsequent issuance of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien, should not be confused with the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Levy under {{usc|26|6331(d)}}, or with the actual act of levy under {{usc|26|6331(a)}}. The term "levy" in this narrow technical sense denotes an ''administrative action'' by the Internal Revenue Service (i.e., without going to court) to seize property to satisfy a tax liability. The levy "includes the power of [[distraint]] and seizure ''by any means''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|7701(a)(21)}} and {{usc|26|6331(b)}} (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt; The general rule is that no court permission is required for the IRS to execute a section 6331 levy.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Rodgers'', 461 U.S. 677, 103 S. Ct. 2132, 83-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9374 (1983) (''dicta''); see also ''Brian v. Gugin'', 853 F. Supp. 358, 94-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,278 (D. Idaho 1994), ''aff'd'', 95-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,067 (9th Cir. 1995). The IRS may, however, be required to obtain court permission in the case of bankruptcy; see {{usc|11|362}}. Also, an IRS levy on a principal residence must be approved in writing by a federal district court judge or magistrate. See Internal Revenue Code sections 6334(a)(13)(B) and 6334(e)(1). Section 6334 also provides that certain assets are not subject to an IRS levy, such as certain wearing apparel, fuel, furniture and household effects, certain books and tools of trade of the taxpayer's profession, undelivered mail, the portion of salary, wages, etc., needed to support minor children, and certain other assets.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the federal tax lien is the government's statutory right that encumbers property to secure the ultimate payment of a tax. The notice of levy is an IRS notice that the IRS intends to seize property in the near future. The levy is the actual act of seizure of the property.

In general, a Notice of Intent to Levy must be issued by the IRS at least thirty days prior to the actual levy. Thus, while a Notice of Federal Tax Lien generally is issued ''after'' the tax lien arises, a Notice of Intent to Levy (sometimes misleadingly called simply a "notice of levy") generally must be issued ''before'' the actual levy is made.

Also, while the federal tax lien applies to all property and rights to property of the taxpayer, the power to levy is subject to certain restrictions. That is, certain property covered by the lien may be ''exempt'' from an administrative levy&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (property covered by the lien that is exempt from administrative levy may, however, be taken by the IRS if the IRS obtains a court judgment).

A detailed discussion of the administrative levy, and the related Notice, is beyond the scope of this article.

In connection with federal taxes in the United States, the term "levy" also has a separate, more general sense of "imposed." That is, when a tax law is enacted by the Congress, the tax is said to be "imposed" or "levied."

===The effect of an offer in compromise on the tax lien===
A properly submitted [[offer in compromise]] does not affect a tax lien, which remains effective until the offer is accepted and the offered amount is fully paid. Once the compromised amount is paid, the taxpayer should request removal of the lien.

==County level tax liens in the United States==
{{further information|Tax sale}}
In the United States, a tax lien may be placed on a house or any other real property on which property tax is due (such as an empty tract of land, a boat dock, or even a parking place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wickedlocalhomes.com/homes/real-estate/2015/04/tax-lien-sales-tips-for-leveraging-a-home-buying-opportunity/|title=Real Estate - Wicked Local|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each county has varying rules and regulations regarding what tax is due, and when it is due. The related forms may be tax lien certificates or tax deed certificates.

===Tax lien certificates===
Tax lien certificates are issued immediately upon the failure of the property owner to pay. These forms describe a lien on the property. The liens are generally in first position over every other encumbrance on the property, including liens secured by loans against the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedthomas.com/faq/|title=FAQ - Tax Lien Certificates - TedThomas.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax lien states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The District of Columbia is also a tax lien jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/states-allow-sale-tax-lien-certificates-58547.html|title=What States Allow the Sale of Tax Lien Certificates?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax deeds===
Tax deeds are issued after the owner of the property has failed to pay the taxes. Tax deeds are issued in connection with auctions in which the property is sold outright. The starting bid is often only for the back taxes owed, although the situation may vary from one county to another.

Tax deed states are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reiclub.com/forums/index.php?topic=45764.0|title=List of Tax Certificate &amp; Tax Deed States -|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax lien investing===
Tax liens and tax deeds can be purchased by an individual investor.

In the case of tax liens, interest can be earned. If the property is redeemed then the investor would recover invested money, plus interest due after the lien was purchased. If the property is not redeemed, the deed holder or lien holder has first position to own the property after any other taxes or fees are due.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleverdude.com/content/tax-lien-investing-in-the-united-states-how-hard-work-reaps-major-rewards/|title=Tax Lien Investing in the United States: How Hard Work Reaps Major...|first=|last=James|date=17 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">'''Thomas Michael Burke''', [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (30 June 1870 &amp;ndash; 16 February 1949) was an Australian businessman and philanthropist.

Burke was born at Norval, near [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to [[Dublin]]-born miner William Marcus Burke and [[Aberdeen]]-born Mary Ann, ''née'' Florence. He attended Norval State School and Ararat High School before becoming a railway clerk in 1887, overseeing first [[Southern Cross railway station|Spencer Street station]] and then [[Ararat railway station|Ararat]] from 1892. On 25 July 1898 he married Margaret Duggan Brady at St Mary's Catholic Church at Ararat. He was involved in the later stages of the [[Australian Federation|Federation]] movement as president of the local branch of the Australian Natives' Association (ANA) and vice-president (1900&amp;ndash;01) and chief president (1902&amp;ndash;03) of the Victorian ANA.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Cite web

Burke was appointed secretary of the Civil Service Co-operative Society of Victoria in March 1902 and was involved in the railway workers' clash with the [[William Irvine (Australian politician)|Irvine]] government; later that year he resigned from the railways and founded the Civil Service Co-operative Store in [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]]. An ardent [[protectionist]], he contested the [[Australian federal election, 1914|1914 federal election]] as the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] candidate for [[Division of Corangamite|Corangamite]] but was defeated. He sold the Co-operative Store in 1915 and entered the real estate business, and by 1924 was also involved in finance and investment, with offices in [[Sydney]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and various country centres.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Burke survived the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and during the 1930s his company, T. M. Burke Pty Ltd, had established branches in [[Auckland]], [[Singapore]] and [[London]]. He retired from everyday management of the business in May 1936, but remained chairman of directors. He held several other positions in addition to his business interests, serving as president of the Breeders, Owners and Trainers' Association of Victoria (as an avid [[horse racing|horse racer]]), member (1931&amp;ndash;49) and chairman (1936&amp;ndash;39, 1944&amp;ndash;45) of the Victorian Hospitals and Charities Board, member of the Victorian Council of the [[Australian Red Cross]], and consul for [[Poland]] (1933&amp;ndash;49). He also gave financial support to the Melbourne University Conservatorium Symphony Orchestra, and donated both land and money to the [[Catholic Church]]; he was inaugural national chairman of the Knights of the Southern Cross, accepted a chalice from [[Pope Pius XI]] on behalf of Australian Catholic businessman, and lobbied for state aid to Catholic schools.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Appointed [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] in 1942, Burke retired to [[Armadale, Victoria|Armadale]]. He died of [[cancer]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1765">An '''undue hardship''' is special or specified circumstances that partially or fully exempt a person or organization from performance of a legal obligation so as to avoid an unreasonable or disproportionate burden or obstacle.&lt;ref&gt;http://adata.org/faq/what-considered-undue-hardship-reasonable-accommodation &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/U/UndueHardship.aspx|title=Undue Hardship Definition|website=www.duhaime.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], Article 2&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, employers are required to provide a [[reasonable accommodation]] to qualified individuals with disabilities, but when an accommodation becomes too taxing on the organization it is classified as an undue hardship and is no longer required.  
These hardships include the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size, resources, nature, and structure of the employer's operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1003">The '''World Bank residual model''', in [[economics]], refers to a widely used model by [[economists]] to measure [[illicit financial flows]].  The data sources for this analysis are the large-scale [[macroeconomic]] databases maintained by the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]].  

In order to estimate illicit financial flows, this method measures a country's source of funds (inflows of capital) against its recorded use (outflows and/or expenditures of capital).  Source of funds includes increases in net external indebtedness of the public sector and the net inflow of foreign direct investment.  Use of funds includes the current account deficit that is financed by the capital account flows and additions to central bank reserves.  An excess source of funds over the recorded use (or expenditures) points to a loss of unaccounted-for capital, and, as such, indicates illicit financial outflow.
