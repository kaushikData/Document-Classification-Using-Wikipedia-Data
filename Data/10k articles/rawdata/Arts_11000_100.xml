'''Anthony Stephen Mathew''' (1734–1824&lt;ref name = LondonSurvey/&gt;) was a cleric the [[Church of England]]. He and his wife [[Harriet Mathew]] are most notable for their friendship and support of [[John Flaxman]] and [[William Blake]] and their gathering of intellectuals and artists salon in their house at [[Rathborne Place]]. Importantly, he was one of the original supporters of Blake's first collection of work ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'' (1783).&lt;ref name = BlakeDict&gt;{{cite dictionary |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HOxpOMQ_Pa8C&amp;pg=PA330| title = Poetical Sketches| work=A Blake Dictionary: The Ideas and Symbols of William Blake | pages= 330–331 |first= S.

At the age of 17, Mathew entered the college [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]] at [[Cambridge University]], subsequently entering the Church of England. Anthony Stephen Mathew was the first incumbent of [[Percy Chapel, Charlotte Street]], London starting in 1766 through 1804. He was succeeded by [[Thomas Beaseley]].Throughout his career in the church, he was rector of [[Glooston]], Leicestershire from 1781 and the [[Duke of Buccleuch]] gave him the rectorship of [[Broughton, Northamptonshire]] in 1790 which he held until he died. While in London, he was also a joint lecturer at [[St. Martin-in-the-Fields, London]].&lt;ref name = LondonSurvey&gt;{{cite book| work = Survey of London: volume 21: The parish of St Pancras part 3: Tottenham Court Road &amp; neighbourhood| url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65155| pages = 13–26| editor = J.

'''Architectural reprography''', the [[reprography]] of [[architectural drawing]]s, covers a variety of technologies, media, and supports typically used to make multiple copies of original [[technical drawing]]s and related records created by [[architects]], [[landscape architect]]s, [[engineers]], [[surveying|surveyors]], [[cartography|mapmakers]] and other professionals in building and engineering trades.

Within the context of [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|archival preservation]], the custodians of architectural records must consider many aspects of identification and care when managing the artifactual nature of these materials. Storage containers, handling, paper and chemical compositions and interactions, ultraviolet light exposure, humidity, mold, and other agents of potential harm all interact to determine the longevity of these documents. As well, architectural reprographic drawings are often in very large formats, making storage and handling decisions especially complex.

==History==
With the rise of the professionalized practice of western [[architecture]] in the second half of the 19th century, the field of architectural reprography—and the corresponding developments of [[photography]] and mass-produced wood-pulp [[paper]]—saw significant experiments and advances in technology. Beginning with major refinements in blueprinting processes in the 1840s, through the widespread adoption of diazotype printing after World War II, the design profession turned to analog architectural reprography to create accurate, to-scale reproductions of original drawings created on tracing paper, vellum, and linen supports. These copies were typically used throughout the architect’s own design process and also for distribution to clients, contractors, governmental agencies, and other interested parties. However, the integration of CAD—or [[Computer-Aided Design]]—over the last twenty-five years of design practice has made analog reprography far less common in the profession and more ephemeral in nature. For archivists, curators, librarians and other custodians of architectural records, traditional reprographic formats are now often seen as historic documents, with attendant needs for long-term care and conservation.

==Major processes==
Both the underlying support—paper or plastic—and the image type are used to identify the specific processes used in architectural reprography. Between the late 19th century and the late 20th century, several processes emerged as the preferred methods, used for decades, while other less common processes were employed for shorter periods of time.

===Blueprints===
First developed in 1725, blueprinting uses a wet process to produce an image of white lines on a [[cyan]] or [[Prussian blue]] ground. To make a blueprint, a heavy paper (or more rarely [[drafting linen]]) support is impregnated with [[potassium ferricyanide]] and ferric ammonium, placed under a translucent original drawing, weighted with glass, and exposed to ultraviolet light. After sufficient light exposure, the glass and original drawing are removed and the blueprint paper is washed to reveal a negative image. This same process, using an intermediary reprographic drawing, could also be used to produce a positive blueprint—blue lines on a white ground—however, this more expensive and time-intensive method was far less commonly employed.

The major disadvantages of the blueprint process, however, included paper distortions caused by the wet process which might render scale drawings less accurately, as well as the inability to make further copies from the blueprints. Nonetheless, for its efficiency and low cost, the blueprint process, further simplified and mechanized by the turn of the 20th century, became the most widely used reprographic process from the mid-19th century through the first half of the 20th century.

In archival settings, because the process involves [[ammonium]], the resulting prints should not be stored in contact with other papers that have a buffered reserve, nor should blueprints be de-acidified, as the resulting chemical interactions can cause irreversible image loss. Blueprints are also highly light-sensitive and should not be exposed to [[ultraviolet light]] for long periods of time.

===Pellet prints===
Invented in 1887 by Henry Pellet, the Pellet process uses a wet process to produce an image of cyan or Prussian blue lines on a white ground. Essentially, this process produces a positive image, while a blueprint produces a negative one. To make a Pellet print, a paper (or more rarely drafting linen) support is coated with [[ferric]] salts suspended in a gelatin emulsion, placed under a translucent original drawing, weighted with glass, and exposed to ultraviolet light. As with the blueprint process, after sufficient light exposure, the original drawing is removed, the paper washed in a [[ferrocyanide]] bath, and then rinsed in an acidic bath to reveal a positive image. This process required fewer steps than creating a positive blueprint, and was thus more widely employed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In an archival setting, Pellet prints should be treated and stored under the same conditions as blueprints.

===Van Dyke prints===
The Van Dyke process, invented by F. R. Van Dyke in 1901, created an intermediary print—a white line on a dark brown ground—that could used in any of several other processes, such as blueprinting, to create a positive print, i.e. a dark line on a light ground. 

Using a translucent vellum support, the paper was prepared with a coating of silver salts. The vellum was then united with the original drawing, exposed to ultraviolet light, and later washed in a [[sodium thiosulfate]] bath.

In an archival setting, Van Dyke prints are relatively rare, as they were created for temporary purposes and often discarded after the final positive prints were made. Because of the [[nitrates]] used in preparing the paper and the preferred thin paper itself, Van Dyke prints are often extremely brittle and susceptible to damage. Van Dyke prints should be stored separately and, when possible reformatted before the image degrades unacceptably.

===Diazotypes===
By the middle of the 20th century, wet-process reprographic techniques such as blueprinting, Pellet, and Van Dyke printing were largely superseded by various dry-printing processes. The most common of these is the Diazotype process, refined in the 1920s, which used paper supports sensitized with [[Diazonium compound|diazonium salts]], a coupling agent, and an acid stabilizer to produce a dark line on a white ground. The Diazo positive print was considered more readable than a negative blueprint, and the dry process eliminated the image distortion of wet paper.

As with other earlier reprographic processes, a translucent original drawing was placed over a sheet of the sensitized paper and exposed to light. However, the next step exposed the paper to an [[ammonia]] gas. This alkaline gas catalyzed a reaction between the diazo salts and the coupling agent to produce an image that fixed in the paper over several days. Typically these prints have blue or dark purple lines on a mottled cream-colored background, although line and ground colors can vary.

A related process is the sepia Diazo print, which produced either a positive or negative print in dark brown and light tones. The negative versions of these prints were most often produced as intermediaries, like the earlier Van Dyke process, to allow corrections and revisions without disturbing the original drawing. In the negative printing process, additional resins and oils were sometimes added to the paper support to increase translucency. Positive sepia prints, generally made on opaque paper, were typically used as an alternative to positive blueline Diazo prints.

Both blueline and sepia prints were often poorly and cheaply processed, resulting in undesirable residual chemical content. Off-gassing of sulfurous compounds, image fading, and yellowing of the paper support are common signs of degradation and are not reversible. Diazo prints are also highly light-sensitive and can fade to illegibility within a short period of exposure to ultraviolet light.

In archival practice, Diazo prints are the most common reprographic format encountered in late 20th-century architectural collections. However, their inherent fragility and fugitive images, as compared with blueprints and earlier processes, makes their care problematic. Diazos—particularly sepia prints, which readily transfer color to adjacent papers—should be physically segregated from all other types of media. Exposure to light and pollutants in air should be minimized, and wherever possible, original drawings or reformatted prints should be kept for reference.

==Other processes==
* [[Hectograph|Hectographic prints]]
* Ferrogallic prints
* Gel-lithographs
* Photostatic prints
* Wash-Off prints
* Silver halide prints
* Electrostatic prints

==Cleaning, flattening, and repairing==
For large collections of architectural materials, conservation work can address several areas of concern. Consultation with a professional conservator is recommended, although some minor treatments can be accomplished by general caretakers with training. Rolled and folded reprography, once cleaned, can be flattened through humidification. Cleaning may be done with white vinyl erasers, using great care in areas of friable media, such as graphite and colored pencil. Tears, losses, and other surface damage should be treated by a professional conservator. For particularly fragile or frequently-handled prints, sheets may be encapsulated in polyester or polypropylene film for additional support and protection. This is not recommended, however, for reprographic prints with annotations in friable media.

==Storage==

===Rolled storage===
The most common form of storage for architectural drawings—both for drawings in active professional use and in archival environments—has traditionally been in rolls. While this allows for efficiency in the use of space and ease of retrieval, potentially damaging situations can arise from a casual approach to roll storage. For reprographic drawings on paper supports, rolling can stress paper fibers and make unrolling for examination more difficult. Small rolls can be easily crushed and ends can be creased and torn without additional protective wrapping and support.

===Flat storage===
In circumstances where fragile, rigid, or otherwise atypical media makes rolled storage unfeasible, storage in flat boxes or flatfile drawers can be the best choice. Acid-free and lignin-free portfolio boxes, ideally no more than four inches deep, can be cost-effective and allow more flexibility in arrangement on shelving. Flatfile furniture should meet the minimum requirements of archivally-sound construction—powder- or enamel-coated steel units with no rust or sharp edges that could damage materials while stored or moved in and out of the drawers.

Drawings should be grouped and identified for ease in retrieval, preferably within folders that are cut to fit the full dimensions of the corresponding container. As with rolled materials, the potentially damaging chemical interactions of print processes should be considered when grouping drawings in folders. Wherever possible, for example, blueprints should be segregated from diazotypes, and sepia diazo prints should be stored alone to the extent possible.

==Reformatting==
For most drawings, especially those that are oversized or significantly damaged, photographic reproduction remains the best method of accurately reproducing the fine details of a drawing. For drawings that are not significantly damaged or that are encapsulated in a polyester film, digital flat-bed scanning or other mechanical methods may be used.

==Professional resources==
The [[Society of American Archivists]] supports many architectural archivists in their professional responsibilities. In particular, the SAA's Architectural Records Roundtable is a primary forum for discussion of issues of acquisition, identification, description, conservation, and digital preservation of a wide variety of architectural documentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5761">A '''blind audition''' is a method of evaluating the job skills [[Test (assessment)|being tested]], while the candidate performs from behind a wall or screen. The purpose is to ensure that the decision-makers do not make snap judgements and are evaluating the person solely on performance, with no consideration of appearance, name, gender, educational background, previous work experience or other implicit [[bias]].

==History==
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
Research published in ''[[American Economic Review]]'' suggests the use of blind auditions also changed the role that gender apparently plays during auditions. According to a 2001 study by [[Cecilia Rouse]] of Princeton and [[Claudia Goldin]] of Harvard, the introduction of blind auditions to American symphony orchestras increased the probability that a woman would advance from preliminary rounds by 50 percent. According to the study, among those symphonies,  "about 10 percent of orchestra members were female around 1970, compared to about 35 percent in the mid-1990s. Rouse and Goldin attribute about 30 percent of this gain to the advent of blind auditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Blind auditions key to hiring musicians|  first=Marilyn|last= Marks | url= http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/01/0212/7b.shtml | date= February 12, 2001 | work = Princeton Weekly Bulletin | accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jazz bassist and clinical psychologist [[Art Davis]] is known for launching a legal case which led to the current system of blind auditions for orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003822287_davisobit05.html |title=Art Davis, renowned bassist, dies at 73 |date=August 5, 2007 |publisher=Seattle Times |first=Jocelyn Y. |last=Stewart |work=''Los Angeles Times'' obituary |accessdate=2012-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921072824/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003822287_davisobit05.html |archivedate=2011-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Osborne |first=William |url= http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/blind.htm |title=Blind Auditions and Moral Myopia| publisher=osborne-conant.org| accessdate= 2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the competitive [[talent show]] ''[[The Voice of Holland]]'' introduced the use of blind auditions to televised [[talent show]]s; the format was then quickly franchised to [[The Voice (TV series)#National series|dozens of other countries]].

Inspired by ''[[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/where-the-puck-is-going/they-dont-call-it-colorblind-for-nothing-2327264f9811"They don't call it colorblind for nothing"], January 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; technology company [[GapJumpers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Make optimal talent decisions by interrupting implicit bias|url=https://www.gapjumpers.me|publisher=GapJumpers, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; is using blind auditions to help tech companies evaluate job candidates based on their actual performance. This approach also allows employers in [[Silicon Valley]] to bridge their diversity gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why companies are using 'blind auditions' to hire top talent|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/companies-are-using-blind-auditions-to-hire-top-talent-2015-5|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blind performance auditions, much research has proven, often results in the hiring of more women and minorities because it eliminates the opportunities for bias to influence who makes the cut.

Blind auditions, also termed 'Blind hiring'&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times Magazine. [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/is-blind-hiring-the-best-hiring.html "Is Blind Hiring the Best Hiring?"], February 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; is a solution used by large enterprises in Silicon Valley to make objective talent decisions by interrupting [[cognitive bias]].

[[Dolby Laboratories]] said it recently hired an engineering intern who probably would have otherwise been passed over due to a lack of experience and academic pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;SF Chronicle. [http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/For-some-startups-tech-s-lack-of-diversity-is-6052546.php "For some startups, tech’s lack of diversity is a goldmine"], January 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Editor-in-Chief at [[VentureBeat]] announced Blind Auditions for his publication to hire new tech journalists. Based in the center of the Silicon Valley tech startup scene, VentureBeat's leader is hoping that his new approach will lead to more women journalists covering tech, but even he admits that only time will tell.&lt;ref&gt;Huff Post Tech.

[[File:Halloween-card-mirror-2.jpg|thumb|[[Divination]] rituals such as the one depicted on this early 20th century [[Halloween]] [[greeting card]], where a woman stares into a mirror in a darkened room to catch a glimpse of the face of her future husband, while a witch lurks in the shadows, may be one origin of the Bloody Mary legend.]]
'''Bloody Mary''' is a [[folklore]] legend consisting of a [[ghost]], phantom, or spirit [[Conjuration|conjured]] to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is chanted repeatedly. The Bloody Mary [[Apparitional experience|apparition]] may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend.  Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation play.

==Ritual==
Historically, the [[Necromancy|ritual]] encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backward holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink= | first=Bill| last=Ellis| title=Lucifer Ascending: The Occult in Folklore and Popular Culture| publisher=[[University of Kentucky]] Press| year=2004| isbn=978-0-8131-2289-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, a chance that they would see a [[Human skull symbolism|skull]] (or the face of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]) instead, indicating that they were going to die before they would have the chance to marry.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ronald Hutton| first=Ronald| last=Hutton| title=Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| year=2001| isbn=978-0-19-285448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups who ritualistically invoke her name in an act of [[catoptromancy]]. This is done by repeatedly chanting her name into a mirror placed in a dimly-lit or candle-lit room. In some traditions the name must be repeated thirteen times (or some other specified number of times).&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, witch or ghost, can be friendly or evil, and is sometimes "seen" covered in blood. The lore surrounding the ritual states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/bloody_mary.htm Bloody Mary at Urban Legends]&lt;/ref&gt; or scratching their eyes out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halloween-website.com/bloody_mary.htm ''Bloody Mary'']; www.Halloween–Website.com; retrieved November 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Some variations of the ritual call Bloody Mary by a different name—"Hell Mary" and "Mary Worth" are popular examples.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The [[Urban legend|modern legend]] of [[Hanako-san]] in Japan strongly parallels the Bloody Mary mythology.&lt;ref&gt;de Vos, Gail (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6HJwCRAlpioC&amp;pg=PA155 What Happens Next? Contemporary Urban Legends and Popular Culture]''. ABC-CLIO. p. 155. {{ISBN|1598846345}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern addition of taunting Bloody Mary regarding her baby indicates the legendary figure's conflation with the historic figure [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], also known as "Bloody Mary", whose life was marked by a number of [[miscarriage]]s or [[False pregnancy|false pregnancies]]&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/bloodymary.asp|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Bloody Mary|publisher=[[Snopes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is remembered for her [[Mary I of England#Religious policy|violent religious reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp. 207–208; Waller, p. 65; Whitelock, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenomenon explained==
Staring into a mirror in a dimly-lit room for a prolonged period can cause one to hallucinate.&lt;ref name="Caputo"/&gt; Facial features may appear to "melt", distort, disappear, and rotate, while other hallucinatory elements, such as animal or strange faces, may appear. Giovanni Caputo of the University of Urbino, writes that this phenomenon, which he calls the "strange-face illusion", is believed to be a consequence of a "dissociative identity effect", which causes the brain's facial-recognition system to misfire in a currently unidentified way.&lt;ref name="Caputo"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Caputo| first1=Giovanni B| year=2010| title=Strange-face-in-the-mirror illusion| journal=[[Perception Magazine]]| volume=39| issue=7| pages=1007–1008| doi=10.1068/p6466| url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466| accessdate=October 18, 2012| pmid=20842976| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025085513/http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466#| archive-date=2012-10-25| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible explanations for the phenomenon include illusions attributed, at least partially, to the perceptual effects of ''[[Troxler's fading]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5906432/an-optical-illusion-that-explains-the-origins-of-imaginary-monsters ''An Optical Illusion that Explains the Origins of Imaginary Monsters'']; accessed December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo"/&gt; and possibly [[Hypnosis|self-hypnosis]].

'''''Céline and Julie Go Boating''''' ({{lang-fr|Céline et Julie vont en bateau}}) is a 1974 French film directed by [[Jacques Rivette]]. The film stars [[Dominique Labourier]] as Julie and [[Juliet Berto]] as Céline.

It won the Special Prize of the Jury at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in 1974 and was an Official Selection at the 1974 [[New York Film Festival]]. [[Marilù Parolini]] worked as the set photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=di Laurea |first=Tesi |title=L'amica delle rondini. Marilù Parolini dalla scena al ricordo.

==Plot summary==
The film begins with Julie sitting on a park bench reading a book of [[magic (paranormal)|magic spells]] when a woman (Céline) walks past, and begins dropping (à la [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[White Rabbit]]) various possessions. Julie begins picking them up, and tries to follow Céline around [[Paris]], sometimes at a great pace (for instance, sprinting up [[Montmartre]] to keep pace with Céline's tram). After adventures following Céline around the Parisian streets &amp;mdash; at one point it looks as if they have gone their separate ways, never to meet up again &amp;mdash; Céline finally decides to move in with Julie. There are incidents of identity swapping, with Céline pretending to be Julie to meet the latter's childhood sweetheart, for example, and Julie attempting to fill in for Céline at a cabaret audition.

The second half of the film centers around the duo's individual visits to 7 bis, rue du Nadir-aux-Pommes, the address of a mansion in a quiet, walled off grounds in Paris. While seemingly empty and closed in the present day, the house is yet where Céline realizes she knows as the place where she works as a nanny for a family &amp;mdash; two jealous sisters, one widower, and a sickly child. Soon, a repetitive pattern emerges: Céline or Julie enters the house, disappears for a time, and then is suddenly ejected by unseen hands back to present day Paris later that same day. Each time either Céline or Julie is exhausted, having forgotten everything that has happened during their time in the house. However, each time upon returning via a taxi the women discover a candy mysteriously lodged in their mouth. It seems to be important, so each makes sure to carefully save the candy. At one point, they realize that the candy is a key to the other place and time; sucking on the sweet transports them back to the house's alternate reality (in this case a double reference to both Lewis Carroll and to [[Marcel Proust]]'s [[In Search of Lost Time|madeleine]]) of the day's events.

The remainder of the film consists of the two women attempting to solve the central mystery of the house: amidst the jealous conniving of women of the house over the attentions of the widower, a young child is mysteriously murdered. But this narrative is one that repeats like a stage play, with exact phrases they soon learn well enough to start joking about. Each time they repeat eating the candy, they remember more of the day's events. Just as if reading a favorite novel, or again watching a beloved movie, they find that they can enter the narrative itself, with each twist and turn memorized. Far from being the passive viewers/readers that they were at first &amp;mdash; and most movie viewers always are &amp;mdash; the women come to realize that they can seize hold of the story, changing it as they wish.

Now, even as the plot continues to unfold in its clockwork fashion, the women begin to take control, making it "interactive" by adding alterations to their dialogues and inserting different actions into the events unreeling in the house. Finally, in a true act of authorship, they change the ending, and rescue the young girl who was originally murdered. Both realities are fully conjoined when, after their rescue of the girl from the House of Fiction, the two not only discover themselves transported back in Julie's apartment, but this time it isn't another "waking dream" for the young girl, Madlyn, has joined them, safely back in 1970s Paris.

To relax, Céline, Julie, and Madlyn take a rowboat on a placid river, rowing and gliding happily along. But something isn't quite right. They go silent upon seeing another boat quickly coming to pass them on the water. On that boat we see the three main protagonists from the house-of-another-time: that alternate reality has followed them back to their world. But Céline, Julie, and Madlyn see them as the antique props they are, frozen in place.

The film ends as we watch Céline this time, half nodding off on a park bench, who catches sight of Julie hurrying past her, who in her White Rabbit way, drops her magic book. Picking it up, she calls and runs after Julie.

==Themes==
[[Magic (fantasy)|Magic]] is one of the themes of the film. Céline, the stage magician, does her magic tricks in a nightclub performance. Magic seems to come too from Julie's [[Tarot card]] readings. Finally, "real" magic comes from the design of a potion, which enables both women to enter the house and take charge of the narrative.

At the start, the two women are leading relatively conventional lives, each having jobs (Julie, a librarian, is more conservative and sensible than Céline, a [[stage magician]], with her [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle). As the film develops, Céline and Julie separate from the world by leaving their jobs, moving in together, and gradually becoming obsessed with the mysterious and magical events in the old house.

In one scene, according to critic Irina Janakievska, Julie is playing Tarot cards, with one of the cards interpreted as signifying that Julie's future is behind her &amp;mdash; exactly when we see Céline, wearing a disguise, observing Julie from one of the library desks. As Céline draws an outline of her hand in one of the books, Julie echoes that as she plays with a red ink pad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturewars.org.uk/2006-01/celine.htm Culture Wars website: Céline and Julie Go Boating, author: Irina Janakievska]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noticeable aspect of the film is its use of [[pun]]s. For instance, the title of the film, ''Céline et Julie vont en bateau'', has other meanings from that of taking a boat ride: "aller en bateau" also means "to get caught up in a story that someone is telling you", or, in [[English language|English]], getting taken up in a "[[shaggy dog story]]".

A '''comb over''' or '''combover''' is a [[hairstyle]] commonly worn by [[bald]] or balding men in which the [[hair]] is grown long and [[comb]]ed over the bald area to minimize the appearance of baldness. Sometimes the part is lowered so that more hair can be used to cover the balding area.

In Japan, men with comb overs are called "bar code men" (バーコー"人), referring to the similarity between the striations caused by the comb and the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] on products. The "barcode style" is called "bākōdo na kamigata" (バーコードな髪型).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|location=Tokyo |author= Yonekawa, Akihiko (Editor)|title= Slang Dictionary |edition=3rd | date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Russia this hairstyle is often humorously referred to as "internal loan" (внутренний заём) for resemblance to the corresponding [[Internal debt|economic practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=В.С. Елистратов|title=Словарь русского арго (Dictionary of Russian slang)|date=2002|url=http://gramota.ru/slovari/argo/53_1713}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Combover patent.jpg|thumb|upright|A variant of the comb over was [[patent]]ed in 1977.]]
==Patent==
On May 10 1977, Donald J. Smith and his father, Frank J. Smith, of [[Orlando, Florida]], were awarded a patent ({{US patent|4022227}}) for their variation of the comb over that conceals baldness by combing long hair in three separate directions.

It’s a classic ducktail. It’s such a classic that I have only seen it in movies set in the 1950s. .... In between the comb-over  and the ducktail, between the two follicular spaces representing the modernistic and the atavistic, the fantastical and the nostalgic, there is a third tranche. Even in person you have to look closely to catch sight of it. It bulges, slightly but only slightly. It is the real part of the hair, the human part, the actual hair".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com_2016-02-24"&gt;{{Citation| url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/white-man-pathology-bernie-sanders-donald-trump| title=The white man pathology: inside the fandom of Sanders and Trump| newspaper=Theguardian.com| date=| author=| accessdate=24 February 2016| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234656/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/10/white-man-pathology-bernie-sanders-donald-trump| archivedate=3 March 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm is known for its pioneering work in sustainable design and social design agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.designcurial.com/news/generation-game-the-influence-of-feilden-clegg-bradley-studios-5866101|title=Generation game: the influence of Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios - DesignCurial|website=www.designcurial.com|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Accordia]], which was also designed by [[Alison Brooks|Alison Brooks Architects]] and Maccreanor Lavington, became the first housing development to win the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)]] [[Stirling Prize]].

==Background==
The company was formed in 1978 by architects [[Richard Feilden]] (1950–2005) and Peter Clegg, operating from small premises in Bath, [[Somerset]]. The company designed and constructed low-energy houses.&lt;ref name="Feilden obit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sunand Prasad |title=Richard Feilden: Champion of sustainable building design |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/richard-feilden-495665.html|work=[[The Independent]] |date=8 January 2005 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two decades the company won awards for a number of school design projects and gained "a formidable reputation in the education sector".&lt;ref name="Feilden obit" /&gt; With over 100 staff the firm developed an "unusually democratic" way of operating.&lt;ref name="Feilden obit" /&gt;

Feilden was accidentally killed by a falling tree in 2005&lt;ref name="Feilden obit" /&gt; and the practice continued under Peter Clegg and senior partner Keith Bradley.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Stirling"&gt;{{cite news|author=Roya Nikkhah |title=Cambridge high-density homes scoop RIBA Stirling Prize for architecture |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3179334/Cambridge-high-density-homes-scoop-RIBA-Stirling-Prize-for-architecture.html |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] |date=11 October 2008 |accessdate=27 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008 the practice won the [[RIBA]] [[Stirling Prize]], with fellow designers [[Alison Brooks|Alison Brooks Architects]] and Macreanor Lavington, for their [[Cambridge]] high-density housing development, [[Accordia]]. Bradley picked up a cheque for £20,000.&lt;ref name="Telegraph Stirling" /&gt;

Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios currently has offices in Bath, London, Manchester and Belfast and works across a wide range of sectors including Education, Housing and Urban Design, and has developed expertise in creative reuse.

'''Frederic Will''' is a Midwestern American writer.  Will has been active in many genres: poetry, fiction, [[cultural history]], philosophy, translation, travel memoir.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
The American poet/novelist/critic/translator Frederic Will was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] in 1928. His parents, Samuel and Constance, moved the family to the [[Midwest]] in 1930; Will's father was for the next 25 years a professor of French at the [[University of Illinois]] and at [[Indiana University]]. His mother was a bilingual (English/French) housewife. The house in which he was brought up was lined with bookshelves of French literary classics—Montaigne and Rabelais featured, in leather bindings cut for them on the Left Bank. Will was raised on the campus of the University of Illinois, where—except during two years of [[asthma]] recovery in [[Arizona]]—he remained until going to [[Phillips Andover]] for his senior year of high school. His subsequent education was at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1946), Laval University in Quebec, and at Indiana University (B.A. in Classics, 1949), and [[Yale University]] (PhD Comparative Literature, 1954). Laval, with its pre-modern Thomist atmosphere, was the deepest of these forays into learning from others.

===Personal life===
Will is married, has six children, and lives both in [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]] and in [[Delta State]], Nigeria. He has traveled widely, both in Asia and Africa, and has only two more locations on his must-visit list: Russia and Zaire. Writing and traveling seem to him activities that call on one another, as though the appetite of the world to be named accompanied the writing instrument of the seeing traveler.

===Career===
Will has taught Comparative Literature, Classics, and Translation Workshops at various Universities in the United States and abroad: [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] (1951–54), [[Penn State]] (1955–60), [[University of Texas]] (1960–65), [[University of Iowa]] (1965–70, 1983–85), [[University of Wisconsin]] (1967), [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (1970–83), [[University of Colorado]] (1978), [[Deep Springs College]] (2004–06), Instituto de Estudios Criticos (2007). He was Co-Director of the University of Iowa International Writing Program (1983-1985). He was Overseer and President of [[Mellen University]] (1990–1999). Abroad he has taught at the Universities of Tuebingen, Tunis, Ivory Coast, Chad, Mizoram (India), Chang'sha China (Hunan Normal). He currently teaches for the Humanities University (humanitiesuniversity.org or humanitiesinstitute.org) where he is Vice President for Research.

===Editorial work===
Founding editor (with [[William Arrowsmith]]) of ''Arion, A Journal of Classical Culture'' (1962--) University of Texas. Founder and editor of ''Micromegas, A Journal of Poetry in Translation'' (1965–75). Arion marked a turning point in Anglo-American classical studies, replacing positivist 'contribution studies' by more imaginative and daring efforts to open the classical tradition into its blazing richness. Micromegas, like Robert Bly's ''The Sixties'', was a single-handed effort to enrich American poetry with the bloodstreams of at first contemporary Latin-American poetry, and then, in subsequent issues, of a wide variety of national issues—French, German, Hungarian, Greek, Icelandic.

===Archival material===
Will's literary and editorial papers (1962–) are in the Humanities Research Center, University of Texas.The collection includes hundreds of pages of manuscripts of both published and unpublished materials, in addition to an extensive correspondence dating back to the University of Texas Renaissance, under HRC Director, Harry Ransom.

'''''Hannah Arendt''''' is a 2012 German-Luxembourgish-French [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Margarethe von Trotta]] and starring [[Barbara Sukowa]]. The film centers in the life of German-Jewish philosopher and political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hannah Arendt on Zeitgeist Films' Website|url=http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/film.php?directoryname=hannaharendt&amp;mode=synopsis|accessdate=13 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201193358/http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/film.php?directoryname=hannaharendt&amp;mode=synopsis|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distributed by [[Zeitgeist Films]] in the [[United States]], where it opened theatrically on 29 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zeitgeist's Acquisition of Hannah Arendt / US Release Date on IMDb news|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni44993215/|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hannah Arendt release date info in the Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/zeitgeist-films-picks-up-margarethe-412643|accessdate=26 March 2013 | work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German director von Trotta's film centers on Arendt's response to the [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|1961 trial]] of [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Adolf Eichmann]], which she covered for ''[[The New Yorker]]''. Her writing on the trial became controversial for its depiction of both Eichmann and the Jewish councils, and for its introduction of Arendt's now-famous concept of "[[the banality of evil]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/opinion/hannah-arendt-jerusalem.html |title=Hannah Arendt in Jerusalem |publisher=[[El País (Uruguay)|EL PAIS]] |date=9 December 2013 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Plot summary==
As the film opens Eichmann has been captured in South America. It is revealed that he escaped there via the "[[Ratlines (World War II aftermath)|rat line]]" and with forged papers. Arendt, now a professor in New York, volunteers to write about the trial for ''The New Yorker'' and is given the assignment. Observing the trial, she is impressed by how ordinary and mediocre Eichmann appears. She had expected someone scary, a monster, and he does not seem to be that. In a cafe conversation in which the [[Faust]] story is raised it is mentioned that Eichmann is not in any way a [[Mephistopheles|Mephisto]] (the devil). Returning to New York, Arendt has massive piles of transcripts to go through. Her husband has a brain aneurysm, almost dying, and causing her further delay. She continues to struggle with how Eichmann rationalized his behavior through platitudes about bureaucratic loyalty, and that he was just doing his job. When her material is finally published, it immediately creates enormous controversy, resulting in angry phone calls and a falling out with her old friend, [[Hans Jonas]].

In a night out on the town with her friend, novelist [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], she insists that she is being misunderstood, and her critics who accuse her of "defending" Eichmann have not read her work. McCarthy broaches the subject of Arendt's love relationship many years ago with philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] who had collaborated with the Nazis. Arendt finds herself shunned by many colleagues and former friends. The film closes with a final speech she gives before a group of students, in which she says this trial was about a new type of crime which did not previously exist. A court had to define Eichmann as a man on trial for his deeds. It was not a system or an ideology that was on trial, only a man. But Eichmann was a man who renounced all qualities of personhood, thus showing that great evil is committed by "nobodies" without motives or intentions. This is what she calls "the banality of evil".

The film, which captures Arendt at one of the pivotal moments of her life and career, also features portrayals of other prominent intellectuals, including philosopher Martin Heidegger, novelist Mary McCarthy and ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' editor [[William Shawn]].

==Production==
''Hannah Arendt'' makes use of original film footage from the 1961 Eichmann trial, in black &amp; white, as well as the real testimony of survivors and the prosecutor, Gideon Hausner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Movie Perpetuates the Pernicious Myth of Hannah Arendt|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/113317/hannah-arendt-film|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
''Hannah Arendt'' received mostly positive reviews from critics. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] classified the film as "fresh" giving a 88% approval rating among 66 reviews, with a [[weighted average]] of 6.8/10. The site's consensus reads, "Led by a powerful performance from Barbara Sukowa, ''Hannah Arendt'' does a commendable job of dramatizing the life of a complex public figure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hannah_arendt/|title=''Hannah Arendt'' (2014)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 69%, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hannah-arendt|title=''Hannah Arendt''|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"''Hannah Arendt'' conveys the glamour, charisma and difficulty of a certain kind of German thought. Ms. Sukowa, compact and energetic and not overly concerned with impersonation, captures Arendt’s fearsome cerebral power, as well as her warmth and, above all, the essential, unappeasable curiosity that drove her.... Its climax, in which Arendt defends herself against critics, matches some of the great courtroom scenes in cinema and provides a stirring reminder that the labor of figuring out the world is necessary, difficult and sometimes genuinely heroic."
-[[A. O. Scott]], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.O.|title=How It Looks to Think: Watch Her, ‘Hannah Arendt,’ With Barbara Sukowa and Janet McTeer|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/movies/hannah-arendt-with-barbara-sukowa-and-janet-mcteer.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 December 2013|date=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"To make a film about a thinker is a challenge; to do so in a way that is accessible and gripping is a triumph. Hannah Arendt herself might have been surprised to learn that after fifty years of deadening controversy, it is a film that promises to provoke the serious public debate she sought in publishing her book.

'''Henry Thomas Alken''' (12 October 1785 – 7 April 1851) was an [[England|English]] painter and [[engraver]] chiefly known as a caricaturist and illustrator of sporting subjects and coaching scenes.&lt;ref name="tatlock"&gt;R. R. Tatlock. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/861124 Henry Alken] (The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 37, No. 212, - Nov 1920) pp. 247-254.&lt;/ref&gt; His most prolific period of painting and drawing occurred between 1816 and 1831.

==Life==
Alken was born on 12 October 1785 in [[Soho]], [[Westminster]], and baptised on 6 November at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]]. He was the third son of [[Samuel Alken]], a sporting artist. Two of his brothers were George and Samuel Alken the Younger, also an artist. In 1789, the Alken family moved from Soho to 2, Francis Street East, [[Bedford Square]].

Young Henry first studied under his father and then with the miniature painter [[John Thomas Barber Beaumont]] (1774–1841), also known as J. T. Barber.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=6462914 Henry Thomas Alken]  (Painting in England: 1700-1850, Collection of Mr and Mrs. Paul Mellon)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, Alken sent a miniature portrait of Miss Gubbins to the Royal Academy Exhibition. He exhibited a second miniature at the Royal Academy before abandoning miniature painting and taking on painting and illustrating. Early in his career, he painted sporting subjects under the name of "Ben Tally-O".&lt;ref name="neville"&gt;Ralph Neville,[https://archive.org/details/oldsportingprint00nevi Old Sporting Prints] in ''The Connoisseur magazine'', 1908&lt;/ref&gt; Alken married Maria Gordon on 14 October 1809 at St Clement’s Church, Ipswich. On 22 August of the following year later the couple's first son was baptised. Alken went on to father five children, of whom two were artists, Samuel Henry, also a sporting artist, known as Henry Alken junior, and Sefferien junior.

From about 1816 onwards Alken "produced an unending stream of paintings, drawings and engravings of every type of field and other sporting activity,"&lt;ref&gt;See text at [http://www.donaldheald.com/books/books_text_01.php?cat=Colour-Plate%20%26%20Illustrated Donald A. Heald (antique books)] under Alken, Henry Thomas, "Illustrations to popular songs".&lt;/ref&gt; and his soft-ground etchings were often colored by hand.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Arthur M. Hind.[https://books.google.com/books?id=bxFb8nN_wUQC&amp;pg=PA237 A History of Engraving From the 15th Century to the Year 1914].&lt;/ref&gt; When Alken was 26, he and his young family lived over a shop in [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]] that belonged to print publisher Thomas McLean of the "Repository of Wit and Humour."&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  McLean paid Alken a daily wage of thirty shillings, considered a good income at the time.&lt;ref name="tatlock" /&gt;

Alken died in April 1851 and was buried in [[Highgate cemetery]]. Although fairly affluent for most of his career, he fell on hard times towards the end of his life and was buried at his daughter's expense.&lt;ref name="neville" /&gt;

==Work==
Alken worked in both [[oil painting|oil]] and [[watercolor]] and was a skilled [[etcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childsgallery.com/pub_pdf/11.pdf Child's Gallery: Painting Annual]&lt;/ref&gt; His earliest productions were published anonymously under the signature of "Ben Tallyho", but in 1816 he issued ''The Beauties &amp; Defects in the Figure of the Horse comparatively delineated'' under his own name. From this date until about 1831, he produced many sets of etchings of sporting subjects mostly coloured and sometimes humorous in character, the principal of which were: ''Humorous Specimens of Riding'' 1821, ''Symptoms of being amazed'' 1822, ''Symptoms of being amused'' 1822, ''Flowers from Nature'' 1823, ''A Touch at the Fine Arts'' 1824, and ''Ideas'' 1830. Besides these he published a series of books:  ''Illustrations for Landscape Scenery and Scraps from the Sketch Book of Henry Alken'' in 1823, ''New Sketch Book'' in 1824, ''Sporting Scrap Book'' and ''Shakespeare's Seven Ages'' in 1827, ''Sporting Sketches'' and in 1831 Illustrations to Popular Songs and Illustrations of Don Quixote, the latter engraved by John Christian Zeitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Alken, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alken provided the plates picturing [[hunting]], coaching, [[racing]] and [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]] for ''The National Sports of Great Britain'' (London, 1821).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Thomas Alken. [https://archive.org/details/nationalsportsof00alke The National Sports of Great Britain] (New York: D. Appleton, 1903).&lt;/ref&gt; Alken, known as an avid sportsman,is best remembered for his hunting prints, many of which he engraved himself until the late 1830s. (Charles Lane British Racing Prints pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76). He created prints for the leading sporting printsellers such as S. and J. Fuller, Thomas McLean, and [[Rudolph Ackermann]], and often collaborated with his friend the sporting journalist [[Charles James Apperley]] (1779–1843), also known as Nimrod.&lt;ref&gt;Alken, Henry. "Military Duties, Occurrences etc. etc." (London: Thomas McLean, c. 1820-30).&lt;/ref&gt; Nimrod's ''Life of a Sportsman'', with 32 etchings by Alken, was published by Ackermann in 1842.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In many of his etchings, Alken explored the comic side of riding and satirized the foibles of aristocrats, much in the tradition of other early 19th century omthe oldest of the great foxhound packs in [[Leicestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/fox-hunting-and-the-ban/what-next/places-to-go Fox Hunting and the Ban] (icons.org.uk)&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of his illustrations can be seen in the print department of the [[British Museum]].

Once there, the song ended up 9th.  Magnus Johansson also appeared as a [[trumpet]]er. The song lyrics describes the dream of friendship and peace all across [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poplight.zitiz.se/artist/christer-sjoegren|title=Christer Sjögren|publisher=Poplight|year=2008|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compares the nations with one big [[family]].

'''Jacques Rancière''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɑ̃sjɛʁ|lang}}; born 1940) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], Professor of Philosophy at [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]]  and Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis]] who came to prominence when he co-authored ''[[Reading Capital]]'' (1968), with the [[Structural Marxism|structuralist Marxist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jacques-ranciere/biography/ Jacques Rancière Faculty Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417061517/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jacques-ranciere/biography/ |date=2010-04-17 }} at [[European Graduate School]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Rancière contributed to the influential volume ''[[Reading Capital]]'' before publicly breaking with Althusser over his attitude toward the May 1968 [[French May|student uprising in Paris]]; Rancière felt Althusser's theoretical stance did not leave enough room for spontaneous popular uprising.&lt;ref name="rancieredavis"&gt;Ben Davis. [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/books/davis/davis8-17-06.asp Rancière, For Dummies.] The Politics of Aesthetics. Book Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Rancière has departed from the path set by his teacher and published a series of works probing the concepts that make up our understanding of political discourse, such as [[ideology]] and [[proletariat]]. He sought to address whether the working class in fact exists, and how the masses of workers that thinkers like Althusser referred to continuously enter into a relationship with [[knowledge]], particularly the limits of philosophers' knowledge with respect to the proletariat. An example of this line of thinking is Rancière's book entitled ''Le philosophe et ses pauvres'' (''The Philosopher and His Poor'', 1983), a book about the role of the poor in the intellectual lives of philosophers.

More recently Rancière has written on the topic of human rights and specifically the role of international human rights organizations in asserting the authority to determine which groups of people, again the problem of masses, justify [[human rights]] interventions and even war.

Rancière's book, ''[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation]]'' (original title ''Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l'émancipation intellectuelle'', published in 1987) was written for educators and educators-to-be.  Through the story of [[Joseph Jacotot]], Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality as a starting point rather than a destination.  In doing so, he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends, Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything (and may be ignorant). Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach ''themselves'' whatever it is they want to know. Furthermore, anyone can lead, and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.

Jacotot advocated the 'equality of intelligence' and claimed that an ignorant person could teach another ignorant person. Rancière developed this idea in ''The Ignorant Schoolmaster'', saying that “there is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to another ... whoever teaches without emancipating stultifies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation]]|author=Jacques Ranciere |pages=13, 18|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Epistemologies of Ignorance in Education |author=Molly Quinn |chapter=Committing (to) Ignorance |pages=31–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In 2006, it was reported that Rancière's [[aesthetic]] theory had become a point of reference in the [[visual arts]], and Rancière has lectured at such art world events as the Frieze Art Fair.&lt;ref name="rancieredavis"/&gt; Former French presidential candidate [[Ségolène Royal]] described Rancière as her favourite philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Translation: Jacques Rancière, the philosopher who inspires Ségolène Royal|url=http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/5508-translation-sl-royals-favorite-philosopher.html|work=United for Peace of Pierce County, WA|publisher=[[Paris Match]]|accessdate=9 December 2013|author=Patrice Bollon|author2=Mark K. Jensen|page=34|date=December 2006|quote=Scoop: we've found out where the Socialist candidate got her ideas! From this intellectual sensitive to political alienation. Jacques Rancière.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those intellectuals influenced by his work, [[Gabriel Rockhill]] has developed a new paradigm for thinking the historical relation between aesthetics and politics in close dialogue with Rancière's writings.

Shuster was involved in a number of legal battles over ownership of the Superman character. His comic book career after Superman was relatively unsuccessful, and by the mid-1970s Shuster had left the field completely due to partial blindness.

He and Siegel were inducted into both the comic book industry's [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]] in 1992 and the [[List of Harvey Award winners#The Jack Kirby Hall of Fame|Jack Kirby Hall of Fame]] in 1993. In 2005, the [[Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards Association]] instituted the [[Joe Shuster Awards]], named to honor the Canada-born artist.

==Early life and career==
Joseph Shuster was born in [[Toronto]], to a [[Jew]]ish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Blair Kramer|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/superman.html|title=Superman|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Rafael Medoff|url=http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2013/6/10/superman-saving-his-jewish-creators|title=Superman: Saving his Jewish creators|publisher= |date= June 10, 2013 |accessdate=August 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oil&gt;{{cite book|last=Norwood|first=Stephen Harlan|authorlink=|author2=Eunice G.

[https://www.webcitation.org/5xFnvxqEd?url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE WebCitation archive].&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a brother named Frank.

As a youngster, Shuster worked as a [[Paperboy (newspaper delivery)|newspaper boy]] for the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]''.&lt;ref name=torontostar1992 /&gt; The family barely made ends meet, and the budding young artist would scrounge for paper, which the family could not afford. He recalled in 1992,

{{quote|I would go from store to store in Toronto and pick up whatever they threw out. One day, I was lucky enough to find a bunch of wallpaper rolls that were unused and left over from some job. The backs were blank, naturally. So it was a goldmine for me, and I went home with every roll I could carry. I kept using that wallpaper for a long time.&lt;ref name=torontostar1992 /&gt;}}

Sometime in 1924,&lt;ref name=torontostar1992 /&gt; when Shuster was 9&lt;ref name=canadianencyclopedia /&gt; or 10,&lt;ref name=humble /&gt; his family moved to [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=canadianencyclopedia /&gt; There Shuster attended [[Glenville High School]] and befriended his later collaborator, writer [[Jerry Siegel]], with whom he began publishing a [[science fiction fanzine]] called ''Science Fiction''. Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: "When Joe and I first met, it was like the right chemicals coming together."&lt;ref name=SundayClassics/&gt;

The duo broke into comics at Major [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]]'s [[National Allied Publications]], the future [[DC Comics]], working on the landmark ''[[New Fun]]''—the first comic-book series to consist solely of original material rather than using any reprinted newspaper [[comic strips]]—debuting with the [[musketeer]] swashbuckler "Henri Duval" and the [[supernatural]] crime-fighter strip [[Doctor Occult]], both in ''New Fun'' #6 (Oct. 1935). In a 1992 interview, in which he used the fledgling publisher's future name, he said the two sample strips were not the ones eventually published:

{{quote|One was drawn on brown wrapping paper and the other was drawn on the back of wallpaper from Toronto. And DC approved them, just like that! It's incredible! But DC did say, 'We like your ideas, we like your scripts and we like your drawings. But please, copy over the stories in pen and ink on good paper.' So I got my mother and father to lend me the money to go out and buy some decent paper, the first drawing paper I ever had, in order to submit these stories properly to DC Comics.&lt;ref name=torontostar1992 /&gt;}}

==Creation of Superman==
Siegel and Shuster created a bald [[Telepathy|telepathic]] [[villain]], bent on dominating the world, as the title character in the short story "[[The Reign of the Superman]]", published in Siegel's 1933 [[fanzine]] ''Science Fiction'' #3.&lt;ref name="TCS14"&gt;{{cite book | last=Daniels | first=Les | authorlink=Les Daniels | year=1998| title=Superman: The Complete History: The Life and Times of the Man of Steel | publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] | isbn=978-0-8118-2162-9|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=qdh86WRtzuUC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22the+reign+of+the+superman+is+set%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u1tJT5XPB6bg0QHTvYn4DQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20reign%20of%20the%20superman%20is%20set%22&amp;f=false 14]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was not successful, and Siegel eventually devised the more familiar version of the character. Shuster modeled the hero on [[Douglas Fairbanks Sr.]], and his bespectacled alter ego, [[Clark Kent]], on a combination of [[Harold Lloyd]]&lt;ref name=SundayClassics/&gt;&lt;ref name=BookTimes&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Gross | title=Books of the Times | date=December 15, 1987 | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1F38F936A25751C1A961948260 |accessdate=January 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Shuster himself, with the name "Clark Kent" derived from movie stars [[Clark Gable]] and [[Kent Taylor]].&lt;ref name=torontostar1992 /&gt; [[Lois Lane]] was modelled on Joanne Carter, who was Joe's girlfriend before she became Siegel's wife.&lt;ref name=torontostar1992 /&gt;

Siegel and Shuster then began a 6-year quest to find a publisher. Titling it ''The Superman'', Siegel and Shuster offered it to Consolidated Book Publishing, who had published a 48-page [[black-and-white]] comic book entitled ''[[Dan Dunn|Detective Dan: Secret Operative]]'' #48. Although the duo received an encouraging letter, Consolidated never again published comic books. Shuster took this to heart and, by varying accounts, either burned every page of the story, with the cover surviving only because Siegel saved it from the fire,&lt;ref name="TCS17"&gt;Daniels (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qdh86WRtzuUC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22superman%22+%22consolidated%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f1dJT4Mqyd3RAbuqyY8O&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22superman%22%20%22consolidated%22&amp;f=false p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt; or he tore the story to shreds, with only two cover sketches remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Bob|title=Who Drew the Superman? Joe Shuster!|url=http://dccomicsartists.com/superart/JOE_SHUSTER.htm|publisher= DCComicsArtists.com (fan site)|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siegel and Shuster each compared this character to [[Slam Bradley]], an adventurer the pair had created for ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #1 (March 1937).&lt;ref name="TCS18"&gt;Daniels (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qdh86WRtzuUC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22superman%22+%22slam+bradley%22+%22two-fisted%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=klpJT5-zEsHX0QH05L2gBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22superman%22%20%22slam%20bradley%22%20%22two-fisted%22&amp;f=false p. 18].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, after that proposal had languished among others at ''More Fun Comics'' — published by [[National Allied Publications]], the primary precursor of [[DC Comics]]{{efn|National Allied Publications was founded in 1934 by [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]]. Due to financial difficulties, Wheeler-Nicholson formed a corporation with [[Harry Donenfeld]] and [[Jack Liebowitz]] called Detective Comics, Inc. It was under the DC label that [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' #1]] ([[cover-date]]d June 1938) was published. In 1937, Wheeler-Nicholson sold his stake in National Allied Publications to Donenfeld and Liebowitz as part of a bankruptcy settlement. On September 30, 1946, these two companies merged to become National Comics Publications. In 1961, the company become known as National Periodical Publications. In 1967 National Periodical Publications was purchased by [[Kinney National Company]], which later purchased [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] and became [[Warner Communications]]. In 1977, National Periodical Publications changed its name to DC Comics, which had been its nickname since 1940.|group=dccomicshistory}} — editor [[Vin Sullivan]] chose it as the cover feature for National's ''Action Comics'' #1 (June 1938). The following year, Siegel &amp; Shuster initiated the [[print syndication|syndicated]] [[Superman (comic strip)|''Superman'' comic strip]].&lt;ref name=SundayClassics/&gt;

As part of the deal which saw Superman published in ''[[Action Comics]]'', Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to the company in return for $130 and a contract to supply the publisher with material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/entertainment-us-usa-superman-idUSBRE83G02F20120417 | title=Check that bought Superman rights for $130 sells for $160,000 | work=Reuters | date=April 16, 2012 | accessdate=June 29, 2012 | author=Goldberg, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0h2K2Esun4sC&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%24130&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q=%24130&amp;f=false | title=Superman: The High-Flying History of America's Most Enduring Hero | publisher=Random House Digital | year=2012 | accessdate=June 29, 2012 | author=Tye, Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidi"&gt;{{cite news|author=MacDonald, Heidi |title=Inside the Superboy Copyright Decision |date=April 11, 2006 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6323787.html |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=December 8, 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5eX4MYcBN?url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6323787.html |archivedate=February 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel and Shuster's status as children of Jewish immigrants is also thought to have influenced their work. Timothy Aaron Pevey has argued that they crafted "an immigrant figure whose desire was to fit into American culture as an American", something which Pevey feels taps into an important aspect of American identity.&lt;ref name="Pevey"&gt;Pevey, Timothy Aaron "{{cite web|url=http://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04172007-133407/unrestricted/Pevey_Aaron_200705_MA.pdf |title="From Superman to Superbland: The Man of Steel's Popular Decline Among Postmodern Youth" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115004514/http://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04172007-133407/unrestricted/Pevey_Aaron_200705_MA.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2009 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;(3.14 Mb).

When ''Superman'' first appeared, Superman's alter ego [[Clark Kent]] worked for the ''Daily Star'' newspaper, named by Shuster after the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'', his old employer in Toronto. Shuster said he modeled the cityscape of Superman's home city, Metropolis, on that of his old hometown.&lt;ref name=canadianencyclopedia /&gt; When the [[Superman (comic strip)|comic strip]] received international distribution, the company permanently changed the name to the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.

==Legal issues==
In 1946, near the end of their 10-year contract to produce Superman stories, Siegel and Shuster sued [[Detective Comics, Inc.]] to have their contract annulled and regain their rights to Superman. The following year, the [[New York State Supreme Court]] ruled the publisher had validly purchased the rights to Superman when it bought the first Superman story, saying the duo had "transferred to Detective Comics, Inc., all of their rights in and to the comic strip Superman, including the title, names, characters and conception. ... " A subsequent [[interlocutory]] judgment found that rights to Superboy, however, belonged to Siegel. Detective Comics Inc. subsequently paid Siegel and Shuster $94,000 for the rights to Superboy and the duo's written agreement acknowledging the rights to Superman belonged to the publisher. Afterward, the company removed Shuster and Siegel's byline from Superman stories.&lt;ref name=tcj263&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tcj.com/263/n_marketable.html | title=An Extraordinarily Marketable Man: The Ongoing Struggle for Ownership of Superman and Superboy | publisher= (excerpt) ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' | issue= 263|date=November 2004|first= Michael |last=Dean | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080919180208/http://www.tcj.com/263/n_marketable.html | archivedate= September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2903"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ciepley| first= Michael| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/business/media/29comics.html| title=Ruling Gives Heirs a Share of Superman Copyright| work=[[The New York Times]]| date= March 29, 2008| accessdate=March 29, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090309235008/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/business/media/29comics.html |archivedate = March 9, 2009 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
In 1947, the team rejoined editor Sullivan, by then the founder and publisher of the comic-book company [[Magazine Enterprises]] where they created the short-lived comical crime-fighter [[Funnyman (comics)|Funnyman]]. Shuster continued to draw comics after the failure of ''Funnyman'', although exactly what he drew is uncertain. Comic historian Ted White wrote that Shuster continued to draw horror stories into the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;White, Ted. "The Spawn of M.C. Gaines" in Lupoff, Dick &amp; Don Thompson, eds., ''All in Color For a Dime'' (Ace Books, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, comics historian Craig Yoe said Shuster was the anonymous illustrator for ''[[Nights of Horror]]'', an underground [[BDSM|sadomasochistic]] [[Fetish art|fetish]] paperback book series. This was based on character similarities, and comparison of the artistic style between the illustrations and those of the cast of the Superman comics.&lt;ref name="M1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/scene/article/203662 |title=Book Unveils Superman Co-creator's Dark Side |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro Halifax]] |date=March 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wNCdhd3d?url=http://www.metronews.ca/halifax/scene/article/203662 |archivedate=February 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yoe| first= Craig | title =Secret Identity: The Fetish Art of Superman's Co-Creator Joe Shuster | publisher= [[Harry N.

In 1964, when Shuster was living on [[Long Island]] with his elderly mother, he was reported to be earning his living as a freelance cartoonist; he was also "trying to paint pop art – serious comic strips – and hope[d] eventually to promote a one-man show in some chic Manhattan gallery".&lt;ref&gt;Richler, Mordecai.

In 1967, when the Superman copyright came up for renewal, Siegel launched a second lawsuit, which also proved unsuccessful.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1975, Siegel launched a publicity campaign, in which Shuster participated, protesting [[DC Comics]]' treatment of him and Shuster.
The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists president, [[Jerry Robinson]] was involved in the campaign along with comic-book artist [[Neal Adams]]. In the face of a great deal of negative publicity over their handling of the affair (and due to the upcoming [[Superman (1978 film)|Superman movie]]), DC's parent company [[Warner Communications]] reinstated the byline dropped more than thirty years earlier and granted the pair a lifetime pension of $20,000 a year, later increased to $30,000, plus health benefits.&lt;ref name=humble&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060628/superman_returns_cdn_060628/20060628?hub=Entertainment|title=Superman co-creator has humble Canadian roots|last=Associated Press|publisher=CTV|date=June 28, 2006|accessdate=August 12, 2008 | archivedate=June 4, 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145745/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20060628/superman_returns_cdn_060628/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D71330F930A3575BC0A964958260 |title=Joseph Shuster, Cartoonist, Dies; Co-Creator of 'Superman' Was 78 |last=Lambert |first=Bruce |date=August 3, 1992 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5a1pxTNKz?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D71330F930A3575BC0A964958260 |archivedate=August 12, 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947632,00.html |title=Man and Superman |date=January 5, 1976 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=August 12, 2008 |archivedate=October 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023075925/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C947632%2C00.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue with the restored credit was ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #302 (Aug. 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 170 |quote = For the first time since 1947, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's names were back in ''Superman'' comics, and listed as the Man of Steel's co-creators.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Shuster was now supported by a lifetime stipend from DC Comics, he fell into debt – close to $20,000 by the time of his death. After he died, DC Comics agreed to pay off his unpaid debts in exchange for an agreement from his heirs to not challenge ownership over Superman.&lt;ref&gt;From a 2010 lawsuit filed by DC Comics against Shuster's heirs (''DC Comics v. Pacific Pictures Corp. et al'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Shuster died July 30, 1992 at his West Los Angeles home of congestive heart failure and [[hypertension]].

'''Lisa Fowler''' (also '''Shaw''') is a fictional character from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Lucy Benjamin]]. The character was introduced as a "home-wrecking blonde" by executive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] on 7 December 1998. Show scriptwriters and BBC controller of drama, [[Mal Young]], doubted Benjamin's casting in the role. Lisa is characterised as "a loyal, romantic Earth Mother" who is "feisty, independent and ambitious". However, after a volatile relationship with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), Lisa became an "eternal victim". The characters became instrumental in one of ''EastEnders'' most highly publicised and anticipated storylines, dubbed [[Who Shot Phil?]] in 2001, where an unknown assailant guns down Phil. An estimated 22 million viewers watched Lisa confess to Phil's attempted murder, causing the third-largest power surge on record.

Lisa became pregnant with Phil's child although opted not to tell him and claimed that her partner, [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]), is the father. Lisa gives birth to [[Louise Fowler (EastEnders)|Louise Fowler]] (Rachel Cox, Brittany Papple, [[Tilly Keeper]]) and in the show's Christmas 2001 episodes, Louise's parentage is revealed. Benjamin was written out of the serial in 2002 by executive producer [[Louise Berridge]] and Lisa departed in October 2002. Berridge later reintroduced the character on two occasions in 2003. Despite several reports stating she would return, Benjamin did not reprise the role until 2010 when [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] brought the character back for a single episode on 5 August 2010. The actress reprised the role again in 2017 for a brief stint, returning on 21 July 2017 and departing on 3 August 2017.

==Storylines==
===1998–2010===
Lisa makes friends with [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]) and moves in with [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]). Although Mark has feelings for her, Lisa does not notice, having a fling with [[Gianni di Marco]] ([[Marc Bannerman]]) and a relationship with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), resulting in Lisa's pregnancy. Phil asks her to have an abortion but she refuses so he asks her to move in after coming round to the idea but she miscarries and blames Phil. Lisa loses her job when [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) reports her for being absent, so she becomes dependent on Phil. He is happy with the situation but she loses her confidence and becomes jealous of Phil's former wife, [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Mitchell]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) and son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Morgan Whittle), hiding letters and a video from them. This irritates Phil and he has sex with Mel when she is upset, following a fight with Lisa on Christmas Day. Regretting this, Mel agrees not to tell Lisa but does when Lisa says she intends to get pregnant again. Devastated, Lisa ends her relationship with Phil and moves in with Mark but she is already pregnant. She keeps this secret as Phil keeps belittling her, and on Mel and [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]]'s ([[Martin Kemp]]) wedding night, Phil says that he never loved her and suggests Mel give her tips in the bedroom. In revenge, Lisa steals a gun from the [[R&amp;R (EastEnders)#e20|e20]] nightclub and shoots Phil. He survives and confronts her after leaving hospital but realises that he drove her to it and frames his enemy [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]) instead. Wanting to keep Phil away from her child, Lisa and Mark marry, claiming that he is the baby's father. Everyone believes it and their romance becomes real. Lisa gives birth to baby [[Louise Mitchell|Louise]], and Lisa tells [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), that Phil is Louise's father. Sharon, however, tells Phil that Louise is his daughter and he forces them to accept he will be part of Louise's life. Despite initial animosity, when Lisa sees Phil with Louise, old feelings resurface and they eventually reconcile. However, Phil wants Louise, not Lisa, and when she realises, she and Louise emigrate to [[Portugal]]. Phil finds her and brings Louise home after blackmailing Lisa about shooting him and making her think she is unstable and an unfit mother.  Phil leaves her standing on the edge of a cliff, and she is presumed dead. On Phil's wedding day to [[Kate Mitchell|Kate Morton]] ([[Jill Halfpenny]]), Lisa returns to reclaim her daughter. He is difficult, leading her to plan to shoot him again but [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) persuades her to let him do it. He and his son, [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), frame Phil for armed robbery and Lisa reclaims custody when he is imprisoned. She leaves the Square with Louise.

Several years later, [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), a formerpoliceman, tells Phil that Lisa and Louise are living in South East London. After seeing Louise call another man "daddy", Phil decides that she is better off with Lisa. Two years later, Louise arrives alone in Walford, saying that Lisa has gone on holiday but not returned. Louise is taken into care but when Phil discovers this, he has a DNA test to prove Louise is his daughter and gains custody of her. Later that year, Phil is visited by a social worker, [[Derek Evans (EastEnders)|Derek Evans]] ([[Simon Lowe]]), who says that Lisa has made an application to see Louise. Phil does not want Lisa to have contact with Louise, but Phil's mother [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) takes her to see Lisa on Louise's request. Peggy slaps Lisa for abandoning her daughter, and Lisa reveals she had a breakdown and thought Louise might be better off without her, but the neighbour she left Louise with promised to look after her. Lisa worries that Phil might hurt Louise physically after Phil has hit Peggy.  Peggy is unable to assure her that this will not happen. Peggy allows Louise to stay with Lisa permanently as long as Phil can visit her. Phil steals the social worker's bag to get Lisa's address, and drives there to confront her but finds the house abandoned and empty.

=== 2017 ===
Seven years later, Louise (now [[Tilly Keeper]]) is burnt by bullies [[Madison Drake]] (Seraphina Beh) and [[Alexandra D'Costa]] (Sydney Craven), and Lisa visits her in hospital. Lisa and Sharon argue but Sharon allows Lisa to stay. She tells Sharon that Louise wanted to live with Phil when she got a new boyfriend, which she admits was a relief. Lisa tells Phil she has had help with her life and has changed, but he ejects her from the hospital, telling her to stay away from Louise. She then stands up to Phil and he allows her to visit Louise. Lisa then starts talking strangely. She sees her therapist and lies that she has been doing fun things with Louise. Lisa takes keys to Phil's house and lets herself in, talking to and smashing photos, but cuts herself on glass. A doctor allows Lisa to take Louise outside of the hospital, but Lisa tells Louise she has been discharged, and takes her to a train station. Phil and Sharon inform the police that Louise is missing, and they trace Lisa through a cash withdrawal. Phil then discovers that Lisa has a mental health team. Lisa takes Louise to a hotel and prevents her from using the phone by cutting the cord, despite her being in agony. Louise realises that Lisa is not taking her medication. When Lisa allows Louise to go, she chooses to stay and comforts Lisa when she is distressed. Phil tracks them down but Lisa hits him over the head with a phone while Louise passes out. Sharon realises that Lisa's problems are all Phil's fault and Lisa tells Louise they will go to the hospital together. Later, Louise blames herself for Lisa's condition, telling Phil she left her knowing she was ill.

==Creation and development==

===Casting===
The character's arrival was announced by the press in November 1998. She was one of Executive Producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]]'s introductions, and was described as a "home-wrecking blonde".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19981101/ai_n14484005/?tag=content;col1|title=Home-wrecking blonde to join EastEnders'|first=Ian|last=Hyland|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|date=1 November 1998|accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to actress [[Lucy Benjamin]] who played Lisa, the scriptwriters had doubts about casting her in the role: "I just knew in my heart that I'd be able to do it well. And I desperately wanted the security of a regular income. But after the audition they kept me hanging on for such a long time. They tortured me by saying yes then saying no. It's the only job I've ever cried about when I thought I didn't have it."&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19990829/ai_n14493911/?tag=content;col1|title=Lucy Benjamin&amp;nbsp;— I'm so moody it takes a saint to put up with me|first=Sharon|last=Feinstein|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|date=29 August 1999|accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Benjamin said that she was overjoyed when she was eventually given the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/communicate/archive/lucy_b/page2.shtml|title=Ask Lucy Benjamin transcript|work=[[BBC]]|date=7 August 2000|accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Matthew Robinson discussed Lisa's introduction with ''Walford Web'', suggesting that Lisa and several other new characters introduced were an attempt to fill in character gaps in the soap resulting from a large number of axings. Lisa was conceptualised as a "totty" contingent. He indicated that the casting of Benjamin had been awkward as BBC controller of drama, [[Mal Young]], was hesitant about her hiring. He eventually relented and, according to Robinson, admitted after seeing her in the role that "she was, after all, a great asset to the show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/item.php?id=2315 |title=Spotlight: Matthew Robinson |work=Walford Web |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420093441/http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/item.php?id=2315 |archivedate=20 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
[[File:Lisa Shaw 1990s.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Lisa Shaw as she appeared in the 1990s.]]
Prior to the 2000s, Lucy Benjamin described  Lisa Shaw, as "feisty, independent and ambitious".&lt;ref name="int"/&gt; Later she described her as "a loyal, romantic Earth Mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/walford_hotspot/lucy_benjamin2.shtml|title=Lucy Benjamin Interview|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=4 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031009112004/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/walford_hotspot/lucy_benjamin2.shtml|archivedate=9 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed through dialogue on-screen that Lisa had nursed her mother through terminal cancer, and that she had not lost her virginity until the age of 28, when she came to Walford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-55178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character's demeanour altered somewhat circa 2000. Due to her romantic pairing with Phil Mitchell, she became "mentally battered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/mar/28/television.artsfeatures|title=Primal screams|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 March 2003|accessdate=26 June 2009 | location=London | first=Nancy | last=Banks-Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert Smith, author of ''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square'', classified the character as an "eternal victim": one who endures misfortune and misery, an endless sufferer.&lt;ref name="20years"&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0-563-52165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, "She was intelligent, beautiful and young&amp;nbsp;— and so, of course, Lisa had to lie  down and let men walk all over her [...] a snivelling, suicidal wreck."&lt;ref name="20years"/&gt; Benjamin has noted that her character was "constantly crying".&lt;ref name="panto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/content/articles/2004/11/16/stevenage_panto_lucy_benjamin_feature.shtml|title=Lucy’s laughing now!|work=[[BBC]]|date=12 December 2004|accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Phil Mitchell===
Lisa became more prominently featured in 1999 when she was paired romantically with [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). Phil and Lisa's relationship started in 1999. The relationship was scripted as problematic and included storylines about miscarriage, emotional and mental abuse, and infidelity when Phil slept with Lisa's best friend, Mel, ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]).

One of ''EastEnders''' most highly anticipated storylines involved the couple and has been dubbed "[[Who Shot Phil?]]". The plot saw Phil Mitchell gunned down outside his home in March 2001 in a ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''-style [[whodunnit]] mystery. Various key characters were in the frame for the deed and viewers were left guessing for weeks as to which was the real culprit. Several outcomes were allegedly filmed&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20010218/ai_n14523699 Stagehand fires fateful shot to keep EastEnders in dark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924121610/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20010218/ai_n14523699 |date=24 September 2015 }}", ''[[Sunday Mirror]]''.

Lucy Benjamin told the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' that keeping the secret that her character was responsible for the attempted murder had been the "worst two months of her life".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1261527.stm Cost of foot-and-mouth leads papers]", ''[[BBC News]]''. Retrieved 26 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She commented to ''The Mirror'', "For two months I've carried this secret and it's been tough, really hard. I've had to lie to my colleagues&amp;nbsp;— all the suspects were told to say it wasn't us. I've become very good at lying! The lies went on and on. The first person I told that it wasn't me was [[Todd Carty]], who plays Mark [Fowler]. I thought he was a good chap to try my lies on to see if he believed it! And he did. I was delighted that it was me.

Subsequent storylines involved in Lisa and Phil's narratives surrounded Lisa's pregnancy. In the storyline, Lisa, secretly expecting Phil's baby, married [[Mark Fowler]] (Todd Carty), and claimed the baby was his. This secret was blown in the Christmas Day 2001 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1717056.stm|title=EastEnd girls promise fireworks|work=[[BBC]]|date=25 December 2001|accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure===
In June 2002, it was reported that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa. She commented, "I’ve had a wonderful five years and I’m terribly excited by the [exit] storyline.” ''EastEnders''' executive producer Louise Berridge added, “This is going to be a very demanding story to play but I know Lucy will do a fabulous job. She’s an actress with a terrific future.”&lt;ref name="axing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/151091/EastEnders-Lucy-quits.html|title=EastEnders Lucy quits|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=29 June 2002|accessdate=26 June 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/life/188455/Trials-brought-us-closer.html|title=Trials brought us closer|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=18 February 2003|accessdate=4 July 2009|location=London}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud of the fact that she was good enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on ''EastEnders'' in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on ''EastEnders'' you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor."&lt;ref name="axing"/&gt;

Lisa's departing storyline revolved around rekindling of her romance with Phil. After beginning an affair, she left Mark taking her daughter to live with the Mitchells. Benjamin discussed her character's motive: "There has always been a spark between her and Phil and it’s never been put out. Lisa has tried to love Mark and in her own way, she does&amp;nbsp;— but it’s not passionate between them. She knows it’s wrong. She chose Mark, but Phil is her weakness. She wants him, and there’s nothing she can do about it. Phil knows she loves the danger and for once, Lisa’s being impulsive. She’s a wife and mother and, although she loves her daughter and doesn’t want to hurt Mark, being with Phil is an escape. It gives her something she doesn’t have with Mark&amp;nbsp;— passion. You’d think she’d learn not to get involved again. But Lisa is a victim of her love for Phil. It led her astray last time, and it’s happening again. She’s playing with fire, but it’s exciting.”&lt;ref name="affair"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/article185337.ece|title=EastEnders|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=13 July 2002|accessdate=4 July 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining his interpretation of Phil's motive, Steve McFadden added, "He likes the new, spirited Lisa. She’s very different from the girl who let him walk all over her. She was just living to please him and he didn’t like that [...] Lisa isn’t the woman she used to be. She fought to keep her family together. She stood up to Phil. She even shot him! He wants a family, and he’s also attracted to her.”&lt;ref name="affair"/&gt;

However, in the storyline, Lisa realised she had made a mistake when Phil and his family began excluding her from her daughter's life; she absconded with the baby in October 2002. In a subsequent plot, Phil retrieved his daughter off-screen, chasing Lisa to Portugal; returning with Lisa and Louise's passport, prompting a storyline that suggested to viewers that Phil had killed Lisa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-154510/Lucy-returns-EastEnders.html|title=Lucy returns to EastEnders|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=4 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Returns (2003, 2010)===
In January 2003, the BBC announced that Lucy Benjamin would reprise the role of Lisa for a special set of episodes that revealed Lisa's fate in flashbacks. The episodes were filmed on-location in and around [[Albufeira]] on the Portuguese Algarve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/behind_the_scenes/portugal3.shtml|title=Location Manager's Report|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=4 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030818111042/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/behind_the_scenes/portugal3.shtml|archivedate=18 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was claimed that several endings to the episodes had been filmed and that the outcome was a "closely guarded secret".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2644947.stm|title=Benjamin returns to EastEnders|work=[[BBC]]|date=10 January 2003|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial claims that Lisa would be killed off in the episodes, this did not occur;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a10025/lisa-eastenders-storyline-to-be-resolved.html|title=Lisa 'EastEnders' storyline to be resolved|work=Digital Spy|date=10 January 2003|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, Lisa gave Phil custody of Louise after he  convinced her she was unstable and threatened to tell the police that she had once shot him if she returned to England.&lt;ref name="june return"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2962370.stm|title=EastEnders return for Lisa|work=[[BBC]]|date=4 June 2003|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in June 2003, it was confirmed that Lisa would once again be returning to the serial. Benjamin said, "I couldn't believe it when I got the call a few months ago to ask if I would return to Walford. I didn't think Lisa would give up baby Lou without one last fight."&lt;ref name="june return"/&gt; The return storyline was temporary, allowing Lisa to usurp Phil and once again take custody of her daughter, with the help of Den Watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a11185/lisa-fowler-returns-to-the-square.html|title=Lisa Fowler returns to the Square|work=Digital Spy|date=4 June 2003|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character then disappeared, exiting in November 2003.

Since this exit, numerous press reports have suggested that the character would be returning to the serial again; these turned out to be false, with an ''EastEnders'' spokesperson saying in 2006 and 2007 that there were no current plans to bring the character back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a36134/how-many-more-times.html|title=How many more times?|work=Digital Spy|date=22 August 2006|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a41240/two-days-in-and-lucy-benjamins-staring-back-at-me.html|title=Two days in and Lucy Benjamin's staring back at me|work=Digital Spy|date=2 January 2007|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked if she would return in 2004, Benjamin said, "I loved Lisa. She was a great character and I loved playing all those story lines. It was a wonderful opportunity for me but all that angst and that drama can sometimes get to you. She hasn't been killed off. Loads of characters are revived and brought back but I don't know if it's something I'd want to do again at the moment. It still feels like only yesterday I was there and it's good to kind of recharge your batteries and get out there and do other things. But I love the show and I’d never say never! And I liked playing Lisa. I thought she was a great character so you just don’t know."&lt;ref name="panto"/&gt;

[[File:Lisa Fowler.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Lisa Fowler as she appeared in her 2010 appearance.]]
In April 2010, it was reported that Lisa would return for a single episode later in the year in a bid to retrieve Louise from Phil, who gained custody of her earlier in the year. Benjamin said of her return: "I'm really looking forward to returning to ''EastEnders'' for this episode. It will be great to see some familiar faces and work alongside old friends again."&lt;ref name="oneoff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a214993/lucy-benjamin-to-make-one-off-enders-return.html|title=Lucy Benjamin to make one-off 'Enders return|last=Green|first=Kris|date=18 April 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] commented "Lucy's character Lisa was responsible for one of the biggest cliffhanger episodes in ''EastEnders'', so it's a real treat to have her back on screen," while a spokesperson for the show added "Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life&amp;nbsp;– she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline is going to be an explosive episode in the Mitchells' history."&lt;ref name="oneoff"/&gt; The episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a239089/peggy-takes-louise-to-see-lisa.html|title=Peggy takes Louise to see Lisa|last=Green|first=Kris|author2=Kilkelly, Daniel |date=July 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=27 July 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing her brief return, Benjamin said, "What I liked about doing this storyline was that it did explain where Lisa had been. When I was watching it, I was thinking 'Where's her mother? Where is Lisa? It's just ridiculous'. But it does make sense. She is mentally unstable and she does have times like that and the little girl is old enough to make her own decisions and say, 'I want to live with my dad now'. So she had to let her go. I liked that I was able to come back and defend myself because Lisa was kind of being slaughtered in the Square for being a rubbish mum!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2010/0804/eastenders.html|title=Benjamin excited about EastEnders return|date=4 August 2010|publisher=RTÉ|accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return (2017)===
It was reported on 20 July 2017 that Benjamin had reprised the role for a "surprise" appearance and is expected to be onscreen until August. Lisa returns to care for Louise after she is seriously injured, arriving at the hospital in the closing moments of the episode. McFadden will also return to the serial in the episodes following Lisa's return and a show insider commented, "When that hospital door starts to open, [the audience will] be on tenterhooks to see who has rushed to help Louise. When it turns out to be Lisa, rather than Phil, there will be gasps of shock. It’s such a brilliant surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Methven|first1=Nicola|title=Former EastEnders star Lucy Benjamin will make a surprise return to Albert Square on Friday night|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/former-eastenders-star-lucy-benjamin-10840169|accessdate=22 July 2017|work=[[The Daily Mirror]]|date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show released no official confirmation on the reports, although Lisa returned in the episode broadcast in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017.&lt;ref name="Dainty"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dainty|first1=Sophie|title=EastEnders brings back Lisa Fowler in the aftermath of Louise Mitchell's horror incident|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a833704/eastenders-lisa-fowler-return-lucy-benjamin-cast-changes/|accessdate=22 July 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently confirmed that Lisa would be returning for a "brief stint" and would share scenes with Phil following his return. On her return, Benjamin commented, "It was great to be back at EastEnders as it has been such a long time since I had been there. I loved being back in Elstree for the few weeks I was there, seeing old friends again and working with really talented people. I loved every minute of it."&lt;ref name="Dainty"/&gt;

Benjamin's agent was approached by the show with a potential return for Lisa, which intrigued Benjamin, who had reservations about returning, as she felt the character was "a chapter that was closed".&lt;ref name="kilkelly"/&gt; Benjamin was later contacted personally by Liza Mellody, the show's story producer, who explained a possible storyline that appealed to Benjamin. She found the storyline "too good an offer to refuse" and agreed to the return, safe in the knowledge that "it was absolutely worth coming back for".&lt;ref name="kilkelly"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kilkelly|first1=Daniel|title=EastEnders star Lucy Benjamin on Lisa Fowler's return: 'Expect lots of drama'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/interviews/a833731/eastenders-spoilers-lucy-benjamin-lisa-fowler-return/|accessdate=22 July 2017|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress struggled to keep her return a secret and only informed her mother and husband. She called the secret "all very cloak and dagger" at the studios and revealed that she was told to enter through a separate entrance and wear oversized sunglasses. On show scripts, Lisa's lines were listed under the character 'Sam' and, whenever Benjamin was filming, monitors that relay what is being filmed to sets are switched off.&lt;ref name="kilkelly"/&gt;

Benjamin felt "a little apprehensive" on her first day back filming with the serial, but settled back in after 20 minutes and enjoyed working with McFadden, [[Letitia Dean]] ([[Sharon Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sharon Mitchell]]), [[Natalie Cassidy]] ([[Sonia Fowler]]), and [[Dean Gaffney]] ([[Robbie Jackson]]) again, which compared to "being with old friends". She teased "great" scenes between Lisa and Sharon, Phil and Sonia, opining that it is "reminiscent of historical stuff".&lt;ref name="kilkelly"/&gt; The actress also stated that she missed the workload associated with filming the serial and commented, "It was great to get my teeth back into doing what I do, really."&lt;ref name="kilkelly"/&gt; Benjamin developed "a really lovely connection" with [[Tilly Keeper]], who portrays [[Louise Mitchell]], and found her "marvellous" to work with, calling her a "professional". They had never met before working together on ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref name="kilkelly"/&gt; The actress hoped her return has "a great impact" as she felt a "sense of responsibility" with portraying the storyline. She called the storyline dramatic and explained, "you'll see a lot of old Lisa being played out".&lt;ref name="kilkelly"/&gt;

Benjamin explained the reasons for Lisa's return and she is back because Sonia contacted her, who "feels Louise needs her [Lisa] to be there" and Louise asks for Lisa in "a state of upset" where "she’s a bit delirious". This allows Lisa the "choice about whether or not she wants to be involved."&lt;ref name=Showdown&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/07/23/eastenders-spoilers-lucy-benjamin-reveals-details-on-lisa-fowler-and-phil-mitchells-dramatic-showdown-6799903/|title=EastEnders spoilers: Lucy Benjamin reveals details on Lisa Fowler and Phil Mitchell’s dramatic showdown|work=Metro|last=Lindsay|first=Duncan|date=23 July 2017|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa will not get "a great reception", believing that Lisa has "been a bad mum", but defended Lisa "not being there for Louise" as she "hasn't been informed about what's going on [...] and if things were going terribly wrong she'd know about it."&lt;ref name=Showdown/&gt; Lisa has been absent from Louise's life due to "her own personal issues" and Lisa "thinks it’s in Louise’s best interest to have stayed away."&lt;ref name=Showdown/&gt; Sharon will not "be particularly keen to see her for her own reasons" and Lisa staying away is seen as the best for Phil and his side of the family.&lt;ref name=Showdown/&gt;

Benjamin said when it comes to Lisa and Phil, "there's always going to be drama [...] there's going to be fireworks" as Phil "isn't Lisa’s favourite person" and "in true Lisa and Phil fashion, it will be quite explosive."&lt;ref name=Showdown/&gt; Lisa sees Phil as the person that "triggers episodes of things going wrong for her" and the one who has "caused all of the problems going on her life", caused by him taking Louise away from her, that leads to her wariness around him as she knows "what he’s capable of doing."&lt;ref name=Showdown/&gt; Benjamin believes Lisa and Phil will never "be the best of friends or see eye-to-eye", but Louise should be the person they put first and be adults for. Lisa sees Sharon as "the right woman for Phil" and regards her as "lovely", so she needs Sharon as an "ally" in order to help her relationship with Louise, but knows Sharon is "no fool", who "will stand her ground."&lt;ref name=Showdown/&gt; Benjamin added Lisa "feels very guilty" about leaving Louise and being excluded from her life, but her "driving force is her unconditional love for her child", but has "hard times ahead with Louise, explaining why she hasn’t been there. I think she just hopes her daughter will need her and see she’s better off having her mum in her life."&lt;ref name=Showdown/&gt;

==Reception==
In 2002, a survey done by Whitaker's revealed that 11% of British people questioned could not name a single world leader, but nearly half could list five characters in ''EastEnders''. Most named was Phil Mitchell (44%), followed by Mark Fowler (40%), [[Pauline Fowler]] (30%), [[Peggy Mitchell]] (28%) and Lisa Fowler (24%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/21/uk.dumbing/index.html|title=

Television critic for the ''Daily Mirror'', Ian Hyland, has described Lisa as miserable, suggesting in 2002 that she was "red-hot favourite to take over [Pauline Fowler's] misery mantle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20020929/ai_n12848621/?tag=content;col1|title=

This was the latest in a string of gripping dilemmas, including Should I Date Phil?, Should I Shag Phil? and Should I Give Birth To A Descendant Of Phil? For one who spends so much time deliberating, that girl makes a lot of duff decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/apr/07/tvandradio.television3|title=

[[File:Ausschnitt aus der Tabula Peutingeriana.jpg|thumb|Southern section of the Lower Germanic Limes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;(between VLPIA NOVIOMAGVS BATAVORVM und RIGOMAGVS)&lt;/small&gt; on the Tabula Peutingeriana]]
The '''Lower Germanic Limes'''&lt;!--(in Antiquity called the ''limes ad Germaniam inferiorem'' &lt;ref&gt;Nach Margot Klee: ''Grenzen des Imperiums. Leben am Limes''. Konrad Theiss Verlag, Stuttgart, 2006, ISBN 3-8053-3429-X, p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;)--&gt; ({{lang-de|Niedergermanischer Limes}}) is the former frontier between the [[Roman province]] of ''[[Germania inferior]]'' and ''[[Germania Magna]]''. The Lower Germanic Limes separated that part of the [[Rhineland]] left of the [[Rhine]] as well as the [[Netherlands]], which was part of the [[Roman Empire]], from the less tightly controlled regions east of the Rhine.

The route of the ''[[limes]]'' started near the estuary of the [[Oude Rijn (Utrecht and South Holland)|Oude Rijn]] on the [[North Sea]]. It then followed the course of the Rhine and ended at the [[Vinxtbach]] in present-day [[Niederbreisig]], a quarter in the town of [[Bad Breisig]], the border with the province of [[Germania superior]]. The [[Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes]] then started on the opposite, right-hand, side of the Rhine with the [[Roman camp]] of [[Rheinbrohl]].

The Lower Germanic Limes was not a fortified ''limes'' with [[rampart (fortification)|ramparts]], [[ditch (fortification)|ditches]], [[palisade]]s or [[wall]]s and [[watchtowers]], but a river border (Lat.: ''ripa''), similary to the ''limites'' on the [[Danube]] and [[Euphrates]].
The Rhine Line was guarded by a chain of [[Roman camp|castra]] for [[auxiliary troops]]. It was laid out partly by [[Augustus]] and his stepson and military commander, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], who began to strengthen the natural boundary of the Rhine from the year 15&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;D. The decision not to conquer the regions east of the Rhine in 16&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;D. made the Rhine into a fixed frontier of the Roman Empire. For its protection, a large number of estates ([[Villa rustica|villae rusticae]]) and settlements ([[Vicus|vici]]) were established. The names and locations of several sites have been handed down, mainly through the ‘’[[Tabula Peutingeriana]] and [[Itinerarium Antonini]].&lt;ref&gt;Tilmann Bechert, Willem J. H. Willems: ''Die römische Reichsgrenze von der Mosel bis zur Nordseeküste.'' Stuttgart, 1995, {{ISBN|3-8062-1189-2}}; Margot Klee: ''Grenzen des Imperiums. Leben am römischen Limes.'' Konrad Theiss Verlag, Stuttgart, 2006, {{ISBN|3-8053-3429-X}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;33–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[Upper Germanic-Rhaetian Limes]], the Lower Germanic Limes forms part of the ''[[Limes Germanicus]]''

== Topography ==
[[File:Rivieren 4.46933E 51.88083N.jpg|thumb|The Rhine-Meuse delta with the Lower Rhine in the background]]
As it runs along the Rhine the Lower Germanic Limes passes four landscapes with different topography and natural character. The southernmost and smallest portion, between the Vinxtbach and the area around Bonn still belongs to the [[Rhenish Massif]], through which the river passes in a relatively narrow valley between the heights of the [[Westerwald]] and the [[Eifel Mountains]]. From roughly the area of Bonn, the Rhine valley opens into the [[Cologne Bay]], which is bounded by the [[Bergisches Land]], which hugs the river on the right-hand side, and the Eifel and [[High Fens]] to the southeast and east. The Cologne Bay has fertile [[loess]] soils and is characterized by a very mild climate. It is therefore little wonder that most of the rural ''vici'' and ''villae rusticae'' (farm estates) in Lower Germania were established in this area in Roman times. In the vicinity of the military camp of [[Novaesium]], the Cologne Bay expands further into the [[Lower Rhine Plain]], a [[river terrace]] landscape. Only a little west of today's German-Dutch border, roughly in the area of the [[legion camp]] of [[Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum|Noviomagus]], the Lower Rhine Plain transitions into the watery [[marshland]] formed by the Rhine and Meuse and which finally ends at the North Sea in the [[Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta]].&lt;ref&gt;Ariw J.

'''Lux Helsinki''' is an annual light art event. It is arranged in the beginning of January in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. The event introduces a wide array of light artworks by both international and Finnish artists. The event is arranged by the City of Helsinki. The entry is free of charge. The Artistic Director of Lux Helsinki is Markku Uimonen, Professor in Lighting Design at the [[Theatre Academy Helsinki|Theatre Academy]] of the [[University of the Arts Helsinki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mac Dougall|first=David|title=Finnish capital lights up in winter dark|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130108/eu-finland-winter-lights|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davey|first=Alexandra|title=New Northern Lights|url=http://www.cntraveller.com/news/2013/january/lux-helsinki|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=Condé Nast Traveller|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lux Helsinki was held for the first time in 2009.

== 2014 ==
The sixth Lux Helsinki was arranged between 4 and 8 January 2014. Light installations were seen at 11 sites. An exhibition of light art ''Lux IN'' was held for the first time in Merikaapelihalli at the [[Kaapelitehdas|Cable Factory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pantzar|first=Katja|title=Lux lights up Helsinki|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/lux_lights_up_helsinki/7012511|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Yle News|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 light installations were seen at the centre of Helsinki, 19 installations at the Cable Factory and almost 150 lanterns at the ''Lantern Park'' of the Hesperia Park. In addition to the Cable Factory and Hesperia Park, the event venues of 2014 were [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]], the [[New Student House, Helsinki|New Student House]], Kansalaistori, the [[Helsinki Music Centre]], Hakasalmi Villa, the [[National Museum of Finland]], the [[VR Warehouses]] and the [[Finnish National Opera|National Opera]] Amphitheatre.

=== Corazón ===
The installation of the Senate Square was ''Corazón'' by the Spanish fashion designer [[Agatha Ruiz de la Prada]] in collaboration with the production and design company D-Facto. The installation consisted of a huge heart placed at the top of the steps of [[Helsinki Cathedral]]. Also the Cathedral backdrop, with its own lighting, merged into the installation. The installation was previously seen in the 2012 [[Fête des Lumières]] in [[Lyon]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karila|first=Juhani|title=Lux Helsinki tuo Senaatintorille valoja sykkivän alumiinisydämen|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/Lux+Helsinki+tuo+Senaatintorille+valoja+sykkiv%C3%A4n+alumiinisyd%C3%A4men/a1388644251645|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Самодельный магнитофон 1970ых.jpg|thumb|right|Tape recorder "Tembr" (1964) without casing (From museum of political history of Russia)]]
'''''Magnitizdat''''' ({{lang-rus|магнитизда́т|p=məɡnʲɪtʲɪzˈdat}}, from the Russian words for "tape recorder" магнитофо́н {{IPA|[məɡnʲɪtɐˈfon]}}, and "publishing" изда́тельство {{IPA|[ɪˈzdatʲɪlʲstvə]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Garey|2011|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the process of re-copying and self-distributing live [[Magnetic tape sound recording|audio tape]] recordings in the [[Soviet Union]] that were not available commercially. It is similar to [[bootleg recording]]s, except it was often sanctioned by the performers (who did not expect to make money from these recordings anyway) for the purpose of circumventing [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|Soviet political censorship]] and making their work as well known as possible.

The process of ''magnitizdat'' was less risky than publishing literature via [[samizdat]], since any person in the USSR was permitted to own a private [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape recorder, while paper duplication equipment was under control of the state.

''Magnitizdat'' was the main method by which the songs of [[Bard (Soviet Union)|Russian bards]] such as [[Bulat Okudzhava]], [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]] or [[punk bands]] like [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]] made their way around the Soviet Union and abroad. Magnitizdat was also used to distribute lectures with anti-Soviet content.

According to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[poetry|poet]] [[Jean Bodel]], the '''Matter of Rome''' was the [[literature cycle|literary cycle]] made up of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], together with episodes from the history of [[classical antiquity]], focusing on military heroes like [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]].  Bodel divided all the literary cycles he knew best into the [[Matter of Britain]], the [[Matter of France]] and the Matter of Rome (although "non-cyclical" [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] also existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Laura A | last = Hibbard | title = Medieval Romance in England | place = New York | publisher = Burt Franklin | year = 1963 | page = iii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Matter of Rome also included what is referred to as the Matter of Troy, consisting of romances and other texts based on the [[Trojan War]] and its after-effects, including the adventures of [[Aeneas]].&lt;ref name=Fowler&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Robert|title=The Cambridge Companion To Homer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K5WQRBvMp18C&amp;pg=PA364|accessdate=21 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge UP|isbn=9780521012461|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject matter==
Classical topics were the subjects of a good deal of [[Old French]] literature, which in the case of Trojan subject matter ultimately deriving from [[Homer]] was built on scant sources; since the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' were unknown, medieval Western poets had to make do with two short prose narratives based on Homer, ascribed to [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]]. The paucity of original text did not prevent the 12th century Norman poet [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]] from writing a lengthy adaptation, ''Le Roman de Troie'', running 40,000 lines.&lt;ref name=Fowler/&gt; The poems that were written on these topics were called the ''romans d'antiquité'', the "romances of antiquity."  This name presages the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] approach the medieval poets used in dealing with these subjects.  For example, in the [[Epic poetry| epic]] poems ''[[Roman d'Alixandre]]'' and the ''[[Roman de Troie]]'', Alexander the Great, and [[Achilles]] and his fellow heroes of the [[Trojan War]] were treated as knights of [[chivalry]], not much different from the heroes of the ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. P. Ker, ''Epic And Romance: Essays on Medieval Literature'' p 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements of [[courtly love]] were introduced into the poems; in the ''[[Roman de Thèbes]]'', a romantic relationship absent from the [[Greek language|Greek]] sources is introduced into the tale of [[Parthenopeus| Parthenopæus]] and [[Antigone]].  Military episodes in these tales were also multiplied, and used to introduce scenes of [[knight-errant]]ry and [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].  

Another example of French medieval poetry in this genre is the [[Roman d'Enéas|''Eneas'']], a treatment of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' that comes across as being a sort of burlesque of [[Virgil]]'s poem.  Sentimental and fantasy elements in the source material were multiplied, and incidents from [[Ovid]], the most popular Latin poet of the Middle Ages, were mixed into the [[pastiche]].  The ''Philomela'' attributed to [[Chrétien de Troyes]], a retelling of the story of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] and [[Procne]], also takes its source from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' is an English example, with Chaucer adding many elements to emphasize its connection with the matter.&lt;ref name = "Lewis"&gt;{{Citation | authorlink = C. S. Lewis | first = Clive Staples | last = Lewis | title = Selected Literary Essays | publisher = University Press | place = Cambridge, ENG, UK | year = 1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |30–1}}  He also brought the story into line with the precepts of [[courtly love]].&lt;ref name = "Lewis" /&gt;{{rp |35–6}}

This anachronistic treatment of elements from Greek mythology is similar to that of the [[Middle English]] [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] "[[Sir Orfeo]]", where the Greek [[Orpheus]] becomes the knight Sir Orfeo who rescues his wife Heurodis (i.e. [[Eurydice]]) from the [[fairy]] king.

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}
'''Medieval stained glass''' is the coloured and painted glass of [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] from the 10th century to the 16th century. For much of this period [[stained glass]] windows were the major pictorial art form, particularly in [[France in the Middle Ages|northern France]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] and [[England in the Middle Ages|England]], where windows tended to be larger than in southern Europe (in [[Italy]], for example, [[fresco]]s were more common).

Stained glass windows were used predominantly in churches, but were also found in wealthy domestic settings and public buildings such as town halls, though surviving examples of secular glass are very rare indeed.  The purpose of stained glass windows in a church was both to enhance the beauty of their setting and to inform the viewer through narrative or symbolism. The subject matter was generally religious in churches, though "portraits" and [[heraldry]] are often included, and many narrative scenes give valuable insights into the medieval world.

==History ==
[[File:Süddeutscher Glasmaler 001.jpg|thumb|upright|The prophet Daniel from Augsburg Cathedral (c. 1065)]]

=== Early stained glass ===
Window glass was in use from at least the 1st century AD and colored and painted window glass for use in religious buildings was also manufactured at an early date. The earliest extant example of ecclesiastical stained glass is possibly that from San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy. A clear glass roundel with a depiction of Christ in Majesty, thought to be the 6th century, was discovered here.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975, 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest known examples of colored window glass, datable to c. 800–820, were recovered in excavations at the Abbey of San Vicenzo in Volturno, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Glass of the same colour ranges and similar date is also found in England, at the monastic sites of [[Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey|Jarrow and Monkwearmouth]], and at other sites in the north of England.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 1992, 175&lt;/ref&gt; These examples are not painted. However, it was not until the advent of the monumental cathedral and church building campaigns in the 11th and 12th centuries that the demand for colored glass began to increase significantly, reaching its highest level in the 14th and 15th centuries. The oldest surviving stained glass windows still ''in situ'' are thought to be the Prophet Windows in [[Augsburg Cathedral]], of c. 1065.

A useful 12th-century source on medieval glass manufacture is the ''De Divers Artibus'' of [[Theophilus Presbyter]]. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk, believed by some scholars to be [[Roger of Helmarshausen]], a metal glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley et al 1998, 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 739&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Divers Artibus'' describes a number of craft processes including glassmaking and glassworking.

In the 9th century, CE or earlier (books 1 and 2 of a 3-vol Mss. completed by another in the 12th, Eraclius, in ''De coloribus et artibus Romanorum'', also gives an account of methods for producing colored glass, although he may have copied much of his text from the ''Naturalis Historia'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] of c. 77AD.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Encyclopedia of the arts, separately CS Smith and JG Hawthorne, translation of the Mappe Clavicula – introduction p4, Transactions of the American Phil. Soc., VOL 64 PT.4 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Now considered 'Inaccurate' date on works of Eraclius&lt;ref&gt;Heyworth 1992, 169&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the medieval period  the son of Anthony of Pisa, artist and instructor [[Cennino Cennini]], and, in 1556, Georgius Agricola&lt;ref&gt;1st ed De Re Metallica, as translated by (President) Herbert C. and (1st Lady) Lou Henry Hoover, The Mining Magazine, London, 1912, reprinted 1950 by the Dover Press, NY&lt;/ref&gt; also contributed texts with aspects of glassmaking and glassworking.

==Composition, manufacture and distribution ==

Prior to c. 1000, most coloured glass was of a soda-lime-silica composition. In Northern Europe soda glass was eventually almost totally superseded by potash-lime-silica glass ([[Forest glass]]). Forest glass continued to be used in stained glass for the duration of the medieval period&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 739&lt;/ref&gt; until soda glass again began to be used in the 16th century.

The potash (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) found in [[Forest Glass]] was derived from wood ash. In ''De Divers Artibus'', Theophilus describes the use of beech wood as the preferred source of ash.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne ''et al'' (eds.) 1979, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Other plant matter, such as bracken, was also used.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 57&lt;/ref&gt; As well as containing potash, beech ash comprises an assortment of compounds including iron and manganese oxides, which are particularly important for generating colour in glass.

Medieval stained glass panels could be created either by the [[cylinder blown sheet]] or [[crown glass (window)]] method.

Forest glass was manufactured in Burgundy and Lorraine near the Rhein; in Flanders; and in Normandy, in the Seine and Loire Valleys. It was distributed throughout mainland north-west Europe and Britain in the form of ready-made sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 266&lt;/ref&gt; The application of painted decoration to and final shaping of the sheets was carried out at glass working centres close by the final destination of the glass.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour===
{{main|Glass colour}}
The colour of glass could be affected by many factors. Sources of silica were often impure, with [[iron oxide]] being one of the most common impurities. The greenish hue of uncoloured glass is usually owing to the presence of a mixture of ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and ferric (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions in the glass matrix. It is also possible that ‘impurities’ could be introduced at the fritting stage within the glass furnace, leading to the addition of further alumina, [[silica]] and iron oxides.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley et al 1998, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inherent colour====

Inherent colour refers to the colours that may be formed in the molten glass by manipulating the furnace environment. Theophilus describes molten glass changing to a ‘saffron yellow colour’ which will eventually transform to a reddish yellow on further heating, he also refers to a ‘tawny colour, like flesh’ which, upon further heating will become ‘a light purple’ and later ‘a reddish purple, and exquisite’.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne et al (eds.) 1979, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

These colour changes are the result of the behaviour, under redox conditions, of the iron and [[manganese oxide]]s which are naturally present in beech wood ash.

In the glass melt the iron and manganese behave as follows:

In an oxidising environment metal (and some non-metal) ions will lose electrons. In iron oxides, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (ferrous) ions will become Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (ferric) ions. In molten glass this will result in a change in glass colour from pale blue to yellow/brown. In a reducing environment the iron will gain electrons and colour will change from yellow/brown to pale blue. Similarly manganese will change in colour depending on its oxidation state. The lower oxidation state of manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is yellow in common glass while the higher oxidation states (Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or higher) is purple. A combination of the two states will give a pink glass.

As the manganese and iron may each be in different states of oxidation, the combination of the two can result in a broad range of attractive colours. Manganese in its fully oxidised state, if not present in too great a mass, will also act as a decolourant of glass if the iron is in its yellow, ferric form. The two colours in effect cancel each other out to produce a clear glass.

Experimental manufacture of potash glass emulating Theophilus’ recipes has resulted in colours ranging from colourless to yellow, amber, brown, green, blue, pink and purple.&lt;ref&gt;Stern et al 2004, 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton 1978, 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Variation in colour hue and depth would also probably be affected by the source of the beech wood ash, depending on the soil chemistry where the beech tree grew, the age of the tree and the climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Royce-Roll 1994, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern et al 2004, 143&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some of the stronger reds, blues and greens that are a feature of medieval stained glass rely on the addition of [[Copper oxide (disambiguation)|copper oxide]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;.

====Deliberately added colourants====

[[File:Vitrail Chartres 210209 07.jpg|thumb|Detail of a panel from [[Chartres Cathedral]]]]
[[File:England YorkMinster JesseTree c1170.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Jesse Tree panel from [[York Minster]]]]

Eraclius’ ''De Coloribus et Artibus'' includes instructions for creating green and red glass by adding copper (probably in the form of ore or copper filings) to the batch, a method practiced since ancient times.  (The chapters on how to make red, green and blue glass are missing from ''De Divers Artibus''.)
As with the iron/manganese colours, the colours formed by the addition of copper oxide to the glass are dependent on the different oxidation states of the added copper. In an oxidising environment blue cupric (Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions are formed, in a strongly reducing environment red colloidal cuprous (Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) oxide is formed and if reoxidised then green cuprous (Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) oxide results.

The production of bright reds and blues in particular was straightforward, as the addition of copper to the mix resulted in the reliable creation of red, blue and green. The dominance of red and blue in Romanesque and Gothic glass is obvious. However, at York Minster, for example, it was demonstrated that 90% of the medieval glass was coloured by means of iron/manganese content.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 740&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval blue soda glass====

Early medieval glass was soda-based, and although the use of soda glass in Northern Europe was almost wholly superseded by [[forest glass]] after c. 1000, there are some examples of a richly coloured blue glass (identified through [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] analysis) that was produced in the medieval period using soda as the alkali.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, a considerable quantity of blue soda glass has been identified in stained glass from York Minster, and in excavations at Old Sarum and Winchester. In France, in Chartres Cathedral and St Denis in Paris, soda glass has also been found,&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 58&lt;/ref&gt; and no doubt there must be many other examples.

Evidence of recycling [[Roman glass|Roman]] [[Mosaic|tesserae]] to produce window glass in the 9th century has been identified at the Benedictine Monastery of San Vincenzo, Molise, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 743&lt;/ref&gt; Theophilus, in the 12th century, was also aware of such practice. He states that mosaic tesserae: ‘little square stones’ from ‘ancient pagan buildings’ along with ‘various small vessels in the same colours’ could be used to produce glass: ‘they even melt the blue in their furnaces, adding a little of the clear white to it, and they make from it blue glass sheets which are costly and very useful in windows.’&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne et al (eds.) 1979, 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theophilus, the French were particularly skilled at this process.

Cox suggests that the examples analysed at York could indeed be ‘Roman, or slightly later, glass re-melted in France and imported into England’.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flashing====
Glass comprising multiple layers of clear and (usually) red glass was known to exist in the 12th and 13th centuries. The manufacturing process is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Flashing was developed in the 15th century, and refers to the superimposition of a thin layer of coloured glass onto another coloured or uncoloured glass sheet. The procedure may have involved dipping a small sphere of molten glass into a molten uncoloured glass and blowing this into a cylinder form (the [[cylinder blown sheet]] process) which was then cut into sections and flattened in an annealing oven.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Red, or ruby, copper-based glass, is usually flashed as the colour is too dense to be used alone. Other glass colours may also be flashed. These techniques could be remarkably sophisticated as demonstrated by 15thc. glass from the Carthusian Monastery of Pavia, where layered glasses of blue and violet; green and uncoloured; and red and uncoloured have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Azzoni et al 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied paint and silver stain===
[[Image:silver stain.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail showing use of applied paint and silver stain.]]

====Paint====
The paint applied to glass was a type of enamel, usually dark brown or black, formed from a mixture of: ground copper or iron oxide; powdered glass; wine, urine or vinegar; and gum arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 273&lt;/ref&gt; other recipes could include sugar, treacle or vegetable oil.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 132&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘paint’ was applied in a series of washes, with fine details added last. Both the external and internal faces of the glass could be painted, adding depth to the overall composition. The enamel was fixed by ‘firing’ the glass in an annealing oven.

====Silver stain====
Producing a strong clear yellow could be difficult in early stained glass as it relied upon the careful control of furnace conditions in order to create the appropriate reducing or oxidising environment.&lt;ref&gt;Royce-Roll 1994, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of silver stain in the early 14th century not only provided a solution to this difficulty, but also allowed greater flexibility in the way in which colour could be used. The first datable example of the use of silver stain is in the parish church of Le Mesnil-Villeman, Manche, France (1313).&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Silver stain was a combination of [[silver nitrate]] or [[silver sulphide]] blended with pipe clay and applied to (usually) clear glass.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 133&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique enabled a more flexible approach to glass painting, allowing, for example, the hair of a figure to be painted on the same piece of glass as the head. It was also used to highlight details of canopywork or grisaille, and later it was added to the surface of coloured glass, to create a wider variety of glass hues.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miller Richardson''' (1917 &amp;ndash; May 25, 2012) was an American visual artist, stage and costume designer, scenographer and modern dance choreographer best known for his collaborations with [[Flower Hujer]] in the Flower Hujer Dance Theater company.

==Life and career==

William Miller Richardson, known professionally as Miller Richardson, was born  in El Paso, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.silive.com/obituaries/index.ssf/2012/08/william_miller_richardson_95.html | Obituary&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied architecture at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. At 19 he was awarded a scholarship to study art at the [[Art Students League]] under [[William Charles McNulty]]. He also studied at the [[Museum of Design Atlanta]] during 1938.

In 1953 he met choreographer and dancer [[Flower Hujer]], who is described in his obituary as his "longtime companion".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luckyrabbitestatesales.com/apps/blog/show/26940257-the-antique-estate-sale-of-the-decade-&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 they bought a neo-Gothic house together in New Brighton, Pendleton Place, which he restored. According to the New York Times: "His garden is exquisite, with shaped fir trees that give it an Italian air."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/21/realestate/streetscapes-pendleton-place-3-houses-that-recall-19th-century-staten-island.html&lt;/ref&gt; They lived there the rest of their lives. He collaborated with Hujer as artistic director of the Flower Hujer Dance Theatre, where he worked on choreography, costume and lighting design and sometimes performed. Richardson and Hujer were known for their exotic costumes and creative choreography. In 1984 he did a demonstration of costume design at [[Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Dance, New York Magazine, October 29, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Their dances, based on religious and nature themes and praised for their dignity and simplicity, were presented in [[Trinity Wall Street]], [[St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church (Manhattan)|St. Bartholomew's]],&lt;ref&gt;Dance, New York Magazine, December 5, 1988, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of the Intercession (Manhattan)]], Choreospace and other venues. Their best known piece was "[[Le Jongleur de Notre Dame|The Juggler of Our Lady]]", based on a medieval legend turned into a story by [[Anatole France]]. It was broadcast on television in 1965, performed in Kennebunk, Maine, in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;https://newspaperarchive.com/us/maine/biddeford/biddeford-journal/1967/08-14/page-2| Interfaith Service Ends Arts Festival, Biddeford Journal: Monday, August 14, 1967 - Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; and had revivals in 1981, 1988 and 1990.

Richardson worked as a multi-media artist. In addition to working in the theater, painting settings, backdrops and decor, he also executed commissions like portraits, murals, and decorative projects. He did not retire until he was nearly 90.

'''muf''' is a [[Artist cooperative|collaborative of artists]], [[architect]]s and [[urban design]]ers based in [[London]], [[England]], specialising in the design of the urban public realm to facilitate appropriation by users.

==History==
muf were formed in 1994 when they were loaned office space for 6-months in Great Sutton Street, London. They were committed to working in the public realm, at the same time critiqueing the private realm (where 'care' and 'feeling' had been confined). muf were strong supporters of flexible working practices, which allowed childcare responsibilities and external teaching commitments to continue.&lt;ref name="Altering Practices"&gt;Doina Petrescu, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_sUaI0mM-J4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=muf+architects&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ryAzT5yoBoqi0QWhtvCXBw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=muf%20architects&amp;f=false ''Altering practices: feminist politics and poetics of space''], Routledge (2007), pp. 57-68. {{ISBN|978-0-415-35785-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 muf consisted of two architects, Juliet Bidgood and [[Liza Fior]] and an artist, Katharine Clarke, in regular collaboration with urban theorist, Katharine Shonfield.&lt;ref name="Altering Practices" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10646">'''No Peace Without Spain''' was a popular British political slogan of the early eighteenth century. It referred to the ongoing [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714) which Britain was leading participant in. It implied that no peace treaty could be agreed with Britain's principal enemy [[Louis XIV of France]] that allowed [[Philip V of Spain|Philip]], the French candidate, to retain the Spanish crown. The term became a rallying cry for opposition to the [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] government of [[Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford]] and the terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]].

==Origin==
[[File:John Churchill in his thirties.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Duke of Marlborough]] was closely associated with Britain's war effort until his dismissal in 1711. He then joined with [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians to oppose the [[Peace of Utrecht]].]]
The phrase was first popularly used by the [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] politician [[Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham|Lord Nottingham]] in [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] in December 1711.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce p.54&lt;/ref&gt; However it was soon adopted by the rival [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] movement, who were increasingly regarded as the "war party" opposed to the "peace party" of the Tories. The Whigs were buoyed by the campaigns in the [[Low Countries]] where the British commander, the [[John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], led the Allies to a series of victories. The Whigs demanded that King Louis be made to abandon his expansionist policies, and renounce any attempts to make Spain a [[satellite state]].

While the term originated in London, it also spread to several Allied capitals as a statement of intent. However, this represented an extension of the war aims the Allies had originally agreed upon, potentially extending the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish War==
{{Further|War of the Spanish Succession}}[[File:Vendome-and-PhilipV.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Victory at Villaviciosa in December 1710 settled the war in favour of Philip V]] The intervention in Spain started well, with the capture of [[Siege of Gibraltar (1704)|Gibraltar]] in 1704 and [[Siege of Barcelona (1705)|Barcelona]] in 1705 and securing the support of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and the [[Catalans]]. However, it soon became clear the Bourbon candidate [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] was far more popular in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] than the Austrian [[Archduke Charles]]. The Allies were forced to evacuate Madrid in 1706 and soundly beaten at the [[Battle of Almanza]] in 1707.&lt;ref&gt;Hugill p.244-270&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1708 the new British commander [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]] took the island of [[Capture of Minorca (1708)|Minorca]], a possession of more use to the British than Charles' prospects of becoming King of Spain. Philip's forces recaptured [[Alicante]] in April 1709 and defeated an Anglo-Portuguese army at [[Battle of La Gudina|La Gudiña]] in May. The Portuguese now declared an informal truce, allowing trade and agriculture to recommence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falkner|first1=James|title=The War of the Spanish Succession 1701-1714|date=2015|publisher=Pen and Sword Military|location=3445|isbn=978-1781590317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A renewed Allied effort in 1710 led to victories at [[Battle of Almenar|Almenar]] and [[Battle of Saragossa|Saragossa]] in July and August and the capture of Madrid in September. However, lack of support from the local population meant Charles entered an almost deserted city and the Allies were effectively isolated when Portuguese forces were prevented from crossing into Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Carla|title=e Allied Occupation of Madrid in 1710: A Turning Point in the War of the Spanish Succession|journal=Journal of the Association for Spanish and Portuguese Historical Studies|date=2011|volume=35|issue=1|pages=21–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, they left Madrid for [[Catalonia]] in two separate detachments, Stanhope's division of 5,000 and one of 12,000 under the Austrian [[Starhemberg]]. At [[Battle of Brihuega|Brihuega]] on 9 December 1710, Stanhope was taken by surprise and forced to surrender to an army led by [[Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme]].&lt;ref&gt;Falkner p.182-90&lt;/ref&gt; Vendôme followed this up the next day by defeating Starhemberg at [[Battle of Villaviciosa|Villaviciosa]]; these defeats were a devastating setback to Allied ambitions in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes p.356-357&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1711, [[Emperor Joseph I]] died and his brother Archduke Charles succeeded him as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Charles VI; an Austrian union with Spain was as unwelcome to Britain as a French one, which meant there seemed little point in continuing the war.

==Peace Treaty==
{{Further|Treaty of Utrecht}}
[[File:RobertHarley1710.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], the leader of the [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] government which negotiated the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. His concessions over Spain were fiercely attacked by the opposition.]]
A new [[Harley Ministry|Tory Government]], led by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], came to power in 1710. Committed to ending Britain's involvement in the European War, which had been costly in lives and money, they took steps to disengage. This eventually resulted in the dismissal of hawkish Marlborough, who was replaced by the Irish Tory commander [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes. ''British Politics in the Age of Anne''. p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasingly struggling France was eager to discuss terms. A major stumbling block had been an earlier demand that Louis XIV assist, by force if necessary, to drive his own grandson from the throne of Spain. After lengthy negotiations an agreement was established, which included a compromise peace in Spain. This allowed Philip to keep the throne, while granting Britain possession of [[Gibraltar]] and [[Minorca]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Britain then withdrew from the war effort in both [[Flanders]] and Spain.

The terms of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], were bitterly contested by the Whigs once they became clear. [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[The Conduct of the Allies]]'' was published as a defence of the Tory government.&lt;ref&gt;Monod p.119&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrated [[Hamilton-Mohun Duel]] was fought between [[Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun|Lord Mohun]], a Whig partisan, and the [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] who had just been appointed [[List of ambassadors of Great Britain to France|Ambassador to France]]. Tories portrayed the duel, in which both men were killed, as a Whig plot to derail the peace agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Banks p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

Whigs remained furious about what they regarded as the abandonment of Spain. The slogan became a popular rallying cry against the Treaty, and the Tory government in general. Nonetheless Parliament voted in favour of the Utrecht terms.

Still using the slogan of "No Peace Without Spain", Britain's former allies such as the Austria and the Dutch Republic tried to fight on, but suffered defeats without the financial and military support previously provided by London. The Allies reluctantly agreed terms with France. While these represented a successful outcome of the war, they were less than had been hoped for a few years before.

Philip was acknowledged as [[King of Spain]], but was forced to give up significant territories to the Emperor in Austria. The Allies then withdrew their last forces from the [[Iberian Peninsular]]. The final fighting in Spain took place when the remaining anti-French stronghold Barcelona fell after a [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–14)|lengthy siege]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugill p.352&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Further|Hanoverian Succession|War of the Quadruple Alliance}}
In 1714 [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] the ruler of [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], one of the Allies who had opposed the withdrawal from Spain, succeeded to the British throne. George dismissed the Tories who had pushed through the compromise peace. He rewarded the opponents of Utrecht with places in government. These were mostly Whigs, although the new cabinet included the Tory Nottingham who had originally moved the "No Peace Without Spain" amendement. Marlborough was reinstalled as head of the Army with [[William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan|William Cadogan]] as his deputy. General Stanhope, a Whig, who had commanded in Spain and vigorously opposed the peace became chief minister and the architecht of Britain's post-war foreign policy.

However, in an ironic turn of events, Britain soon agreed an [[Anglo-French Alliance (1716–1731)|Alliance with France]]. Before long the two countries were fighting together against a revived Spain under Philip, who was trying to overturn the Treaty of Utrecht and recover lost territories abroad. [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|This war]] ended in defeat for Spain, although Philip kept his throne. Tories used this as evidence of the success of their policy. However, some younger [[Patriot Whigs]] such as [[William Pitt the Elder|William Pitt]] saw the compromise peace as leading to the later [[Bourbon Family Compact|Franco-Spanish Alliance]] which caused Britain many problems throughout the 18th century.

Despite the prominence at the time the "No Peace Without Spain" debate, the war in the [[Iberian Peninsular]] has largely been neglected by historians who have chosen to focus on Marlborough's Flanders campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons p.10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2844">[[File:Nolan Amphora Munich Amazone 5.JPG|right|thumb|393x393px|A red-figure Nolan amphora.]]
The '''Nolan amphora''' is a variant style of the [[amphora]] jar, a common artifact of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman pottery|Roman]] pottery. Nolan amphorae are characterized by a neck that is longer and narrower than in traditional neck amphorae, along with ribbed handles or straps that join the piece at the base of the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0004:id=nolan-amphora|title = nolan amphora|date = |accessdate = |website = Perseus Encyclopedia|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
They are named for the archaeological site at [[Nola]], Italy, where an abundance of these vessels have been unearthed.

== Historical origins ==
The distinct shape and style of the Nolan amphora is thought to have emerged from two styles of older Attic black-figure pottery: the black-figure [[panel amphora]] and the [[red-bodied amphora]]. It has been theorized that the former is the closest predecessor of the Nolan shape, given that it has both the elongated neck of the red-bodied amphora and the smaller size associated with Nolan amphorae. Nolan vessels, however, do not always have decorated palmettes characteristic of black-figure panel amphora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 497320|title = The Origin of the Shape of the "Nolan" Amphora|last = Bleecker Luce Jr.|first = Stephen|date = 1916|journal = American Journal of Archaeology|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] and [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] neck amphorae were first created in [[Athens]], with roots in Protoattic vases. Nolan amphorae feature almost exclusively red-figure ornamentation. The style would have been disseminated throughout Greece, Italy, and later the Roman Empire via trade with Greek, particularly Athenian, artisans. Early examples of such vases were known to have been created for trade in Etruscan markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/tools/pottery/shapes/neck.htm|title = Neck-amphora|date = |accessdate = |website = Classical Art Research Centre and the Beazley Archive|publisher = University of Oxford|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-vegetarian''' is an [[Indian English]] word that is used to refer to a person who is not a [[vegetarian]] i.e. someone who consumes meat, especially as a major source of protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVYZAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=non-vegetarian|title=Cohesion|date=1970|publisher=Nehru Institute of National Integration.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnvEu8ss4h8C&amp;pg=PA29|title=Nutrition And Health: The Vegetarian Way|last=Staff|first=Institute Of Naturopathy|last2=(Bangalore)|first2=Institute of Naturopathy and Yogic Sciences|date=2002-12-01|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd|isbn=9788120724242|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the meaning is readily understood, this term is not common parlance in most English-speaking countries where meat consumption is the norm and vegetarianism or veganism is rare.

A related word is [[Eggetarian]], that refers to a vegetarian who consume [[Egg as food|egg]]-based products but not meat.

== In popular usage ==
* In India, it is mandatory that [[Convenience food|packaged food products]] be marked with [[Vegetarian and non-vegetarian marks]], which are green and reddish-brown symbols that clearly indicate whether they are suitable for vegetarians or non-vegetarians respectively.
[[File:India vegetarian labels.svg|thumb|In India, labeling of packaged food products is mandatory to distinguish between ''non-vegetarian'' (reddish-brown) and ''vegetarian'' (green) products]]
* 
* In India and Pakistan, non-vegetarian cuisine has been heavily influenced by the coastal, trading as well as immigrant cultures including Arabic, Turkic, Mughal, [[Iranian cuisine|Persian]] as well as Portuguese, French and British leading to various indigenous forms of cuisine such as [[Mughlai cuisine|Mughlai]], [[Hyderabadi cuisine|Hyderabadi]], [[Awadhi cuisine|Awadhi]], [[Maharashtrian cuisine|Kolhapuri]], [[Malvani cuisine|Malvani]], [[Chettinad cuisine|Chettinad]] and [[Thalassery cuisine|Malabari]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr3GUyWe3O0C|title=Curry: A Tale of Cooks and Conquerors|last=Collingham|first=Lizzie|date=2006-02-06|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199883813|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ljFDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22non-vegetarian%22|title=Rare Gems: A Non-vegetarian Gourmet Collection from Maharashtra|last=Mehendale|first=Āditya|date=2015|publisher=Om Books International|isbn=9789384625214|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.While coming to non-veg, chettinad restaurants plays an important role&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anjappar.com/|title=Anjappar Restaurants - Global Ambassadors of Chettinad Cuisine|website=www.anjappar.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In India, most restaurants serving meat publicly and explicitly display the title 'non-vegetarian restaurant' or 'non-vegetarian hotel' (In India, the term ''hotel'' may colloquially refer to a restaurant or a hotel).

The '''Plimpton ''Sieve Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I''''' is an [[oil painting]] by English painter [[George Gower]] dated 1579, and now in the collection of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] It is one of three near-identical [[Portraiture of Elizabeth I of England|portraits of Elizabeth I]] by Gower that represent the queen holding a symbolic [[sieve]].&lt;ref name="Strong 1963"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strong|first1=Roy|title=Portraits of Queen Elizabeth I|date=1963|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by [[George Arthur Plimpton]] in 1930, hence the name. His son, [[Francis T. P. Plimpton]], willed it to the Folger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Plimpton "Sieve" portrait of Queen Elizabeth I|url=http://folgerpedia.folger.edu/The_Plimpton_%22Sieve%22_portrait_of_Queen_Elizabeth_I|website=Folgerpedia|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconographic description==
Three-quarter length portrait of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] holding a sieve, with a globe in the left background and the royal [[coat of arms]] on the right. The sieve represents her self-identification as the "Virgin Queen" by association with [[Tuccia]], the Roman [[Vestal Virgin]] who proved her virginity by carrying water in a sieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pressly|first1=William|title=A catalogue of paintings in the Folger Shakespeare Library: "as imagination bodies forth"|date=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=330-331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Inscriptions==
The painting has three areas of text in yellow uppercase letters: 
* "TVTTO VEDO &amp; MOLTO MANCHA" at upper left, on two lines, with the last two letters joined; Italian for "I see everything and much is lacking." 
* "E R" at upper right, with a gap between the letters; abbreviation for the Latin "Elizabeth Regina" meaning "Elizabeth the Queen."
* "STANCHO RIPOSO &amp; RIPOSATO AFFANO 1579" near the upper right, on three lines, with the second and third letters superimposed to form one character; a line from [[Petrarch|Petrach's]] ''Trionfo D'Amore'', IV, 1.145, followed by the year the painting was executed; Italian for "Weary, I have rested, and having rested, am breathless." 

==Other versions==
There are at least two other versions of Gower's ''Sieve Portrait''. One is known only through an 18th-century description by [[George Vertue]].&lt;ref name="Strong 1963" /&gt; The other measures 34 x 24 inches and is now in a private collection in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strong|first1=Roy|title=Gloriana: the portraits of Queen Elizabeth I|date=1987|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Plimpton "Sieve" portrait of Queen Elizabeth I|url=http://hamnet.folger.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=128729|website=Hamnet: Folger Shakespeare Library Online Catalog|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art and archaeology, in sculpture as well as in painting, a '''register''' is a horizontal level in a work that consists of several levels arranged one above the other, especially where the levels are clearly separated by lines.  Modern [[comic books]] typically use similar conventions. It is thus comparable to a row, or a line in modern texts. In the study of ancient writing, such as [[cuneiform]] and Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]s, "register" may be used of vertical compartments like columns containing writing that are arranged side by side and separated by lines, especially in [[cylinder seal]]s, which often mix text and images.  Normally, when dealing with images it only refers to row compartments stacked vertically.  

Among many other cultures, the use of registers is common in [[Ancient Egyptian art]], from the [[Narmer Palette]] onwards, and in [[medieval art]] in large [[fresco]]s and [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  [[Narrative art]], especially covering the lives of sacred figures, is often presented as a sequence of small scenes arranged in registers.  

Sculpted [[Luwian language hieroglyphs]] were also usually arranged in registers one above the other. The direction of reading ran from one of the top corners, and reversed direction in each lower register, so that the reader did not have to start at the other end of each new row.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, Peter T., ''The World's Writing Systems'', pp. 120-121, 1996, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0195079930}}, 9780195079937, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ospMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples, in the [[art of Mesopotamia]], are [[Kudurru]], or boundary stones, which often had registers of [[god]]s on the upper registers of the scenes.

A '''standard illuminant''' is a theoretical source of [[visible light]] with a profile (its [[spectral power distribution]]) which is published. Standard illuminants provide a basis for comparing images or colors recorded under different lighting.

==CIE illuminants==
The [[International Commission on Illumination]] (usually abbreviated '''CIE''' for its French name) is the body responsible for publishing all of the well-known standard illuminants. Each of these is known by a letter or by a letter-number combination.

Illuminants A, B, and C were introduced in 1931, with the intention of respectively representing average incandescent light, direct sunlight, and average daylight. Illuminants D represent phases of daylight, Illuminant E is the equal-energy illuminant, while Illuminants F represent fluorescent lamps of various composition.

There are instructions on how to experimentally produce light sources ("standard sources") corresponding to the older illuminants. For the relatively newer ones (such as series D), experimenters are left to measure to profiles of their sources and compare them to the published spectra:&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;
{{quote|At present no artificial source is recommended to realize CIE standard illuminant D65 or any other illuminant D of different CCT. It is hoped that new developments in light sources and filters will eventually offer sufficient basis for a CIE recommendation.|CIE|Technical Report (2004) Colorimetry, 3rd ed., Publication 15:2004, CIE Central Bureau, Vienna}}

Nevertheless, they do provide a measure, called the [[Metamerism Index]], to assess the quality of daylight simulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=CIE Technical Report|year=1999|isbn=92-9034-051-7|title=A Method for Assessing the Quality of Daylight Simulators for Colorimetry|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/51-2-99.html|series=51.2-1999 (including Supplement 1-1999)|quote=A method is provided for evaluating the suitability of a test source as a simulator of CIE Standard Illuminants D55, D65, or D75. The Supplement, prepared in 1999, adds the CIE Illuminant D50 to the line of illuminants where the method can be applied to. For each of these standard illuminants, spectral radiance factor data are supplied for five pairs of nonfluorescent samples that are metameric matches. The colorimetric differences of the five pairs are computed for the test illuminant; the average of these differences is taken as the visible range metamerism index and is used as a measure of the quality of the test illuminant as a simulator for nonfluorescent samples. For fluorescent samples, the quality is further assessed in terms of an ultraviolet range metamerism index, defined as the average of the colorimetric differences computed with the test illuminant for three further pairs of samples, each pair consisting of a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent sample which are metameric under the standard illuminant.|publisher=Bureau central de la CIE|location=Paris|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416151749/http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/51-2-99.html|archivedate=2008-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=CIE Standard|title=Standard Method of Assessing the Spectral Quality of Daylight Simulators for Visual Appraisal and Measurement of Colour|series=S012/E:2004|year=2004|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/s012.html}} Prepared by TC 1-53 "A Standard Method for Assessing the Quality of Daylight Simulators".

In a manner similar to the [[color rendering index]], the average difference between the metamers is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of the quality of different D65 simulators for visual assessment|first=Yuk-Ming|last=Lam|author2=Xin, John H. |date=August 2002|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|volume=27|issue=4|pages=243–251|doi=10.1002/col.10061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminant A===
The CIE defines illuminant A in these terms:
{{quote|CIE standard illuminant A is intended to represent typical, domestic, tungsten-filament lighting. Its relative spectral power distribution is that of a Planckian radiator at a temperature of approximately 2856&amp;nbsp;K. CIE standard illuminant A should be used in all applications of colorimetry involving the use of incandescent lighting, unless there are specific reasons for using a different illuminant.|CIE|[http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/s005.html CIE Standard Illuminants for Colorimetry]}}

The [[spectral radiant exitance]] of a [[black body]] follows [[Planck's law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;M_{e,\lambda}(\lambda, T) = \frac{c_1 \lambda^{-5}}{\exp\left(\frac{c_2}{\lambda T}\right) - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

At the time of standardizing illuminant A, both &lt;math&gt;c_1=2\pi \cdot h \cdot c^2&lt;/math&gt; (which does not affect the relative SPD) and &lt;math&gt;c_2=h \cdot c/k&lt;/math&gt; were different. In 1968, the estimate of c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was revised from 0.01438&amp;nbsp;m·K to 0.014388&amp;nbsp;m·K (and before that, it was 0.01435 m·K when illuminant A was standardized). This difference shifted the [[Planckian locus]], changing the color temperature of the illuminant from its nominal 2848&amp;nbsp;K to 2856&amp;nbsp;K:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{new} = T_{old} \times \frac{1.438,8}{1.435} = 2,848\ \text{K} \times 1.002,648 = 2,855.54\ \text{K}.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to avoid further possible changes in the color temperature, the CIE now specifies the SPD directly, based on the original (1931) value of c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;

The coefficients have been selected to achieve a normalized SPD of {{nowrap|100}} at {{nowrap|560 nm}}. The tristimulus values are {{nowrap|1=(''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'') = (109.85, 100.00, 35.58)}}, and the chromaticity coordinates using the standard observer are {{nowrap|1=(''x'', ''y'') = (0.447,58, 0.407,45)}}.

===Illuminants B and C===
Illuminants B and C are easily achieved daylight simulations. They modify Illuminant A by using liquid filters. B served as a representative of noon sunlight, with a [[correlated color temperature]] (CCT) of 4874&amp;nbsp;K, while C represented average day light with a CCT of 6774&amp;nbsp;K. Unfortunately, they are poor approximations of any phase of natural daylight, particularly in the short-wave visible and in the ultraviolet spectral ranges. Once more realistic simulations were achievable, Illuminants B &amp; C were deprecated in favor of the D series:&lt;ref name=schanda&gt;{{cite book|title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|first=János|last=Schanda|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|year=2007|chapter=3: CIE Colorimetry|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|pages=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Lighting cabinets, such as the Spectralight III, that use filtered incandescent lamps have better fits to the D illuminants in the {{nowrap|400 nm}} to {{nowrap|700 nm}} range than do the fluorescent daylight simulators.&lt;ref name=Wyszecki&gt;{{cite journal|title=Development of New CIE Sources for Colorimetry|first=Gunter|last=Wyszecki|publisher= |date=1970|journal=Die Farbe|volume=19|pages=43-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquid filters, designed by [[Raymond Davis, Jr.]] and Kasson S. Gibson in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Raymond|last=Davis|author2=Gibson, Kasson S. |title=Filters for the reproduction of sunlight and daylight and the determination of color temperature|publisher=[[National Bureau of Standards]]|date=January 21, 1931|journal=Precision Measurement and Calibration|volume=10|pages=641–805}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a relatively high absorbance at the red end of the spectrum, effectively increasing the CCT of the [[incandescent lamp]] to daylight levels. This is similar in function to a CTO [[color gel]] that photographers and cinematographers use today, albeit much less convenient.

Each filter uses a pair of solutions, comprising specific amounts of distilled water, [[copper sulfate]], [[mannite]], [[pyridine]], [[sulfuric acid]], [[cobalt]], and [[ammonium sulfate]]. The solutions are separated by a sheet of uncolored glass. The amounts of the ingredients are carefully chosen so that their combination yields a color temperature conversion filter; that is, the filtered light is still white.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; had independently measured the spectral power distribution (SPD) of daylight from {{nowrap|330 nm}} to {{nowrap|700 nm}}, totaling among them 622 samples. Judd ''et al.'' analyzed these samples and found that the (''x'', ''y'') chromaticity coordinates had a simple, [[quadratic function|quadratic]] relation:
:&lt;math&gt;y = 2.870 x - 3.000 x^2 - 0.275.&lt;/math&gt;

Simonds supervised the [[characteristic vector analysis]] of the SPDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[JOSA]]|first=John L.|last=Simonds|title=Application of Characteristic Vector Analysis to Photographic and Optical Response Data|volume=53|issue=8|pages=968–974|date=August 1963| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-53-8-968|doi=10.1364/JOSA.53.000968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A review of principal component analysis and its applications to color technology|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|first=Di-Yuan|last=Tzeng|author2=Berns, Roy S. |volume=30|issue=2|pages=84–98|date=April 2005|doi=10.1002/col.20086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Application of his method revealed that the SPDs could be satisfactorily approximated by using the mean (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and first two characteristic vectors (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;S(\lambda) = S_0(\lambda) + M_1 S_1(\lambda) + M_2 S_2(\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

In simpler terms, the SPD of the studied daylight samples can be expressed as the [[linear combination]] of three, fixed SPDs. The first vector (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is the mean of all the SPD samples, which is the best reconstituted SPD that can be formed with only a fixed vector. The second vector (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) corresponds to yellow–blue variation, accounting for changes in the correlated color temperature due to presence or absence of clouds or direct sunlight.&lt;ref name=jmw/&gt; The third vector (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) corresponds to pink–green variation caused by the presence of water in the form of vapor and haze.&lt;ref name=jmw/&gt;

To construct a daylight simulator of a particular correlated color temperature one merely needs to know the coefficients M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the characteristic vectors S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[File:CIE illuminants D components.svg|right|thumb|250px|Characteristic vectors of illuminant D; component SPDs S0 (blue), S1 (green), S2 (red).]]

Expressing the chromaticities x and y as:
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{X_0 + M_1 X_1 + M_2 X_2}{S_0 + M_1 S_1 + M_2 S_2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{Y_0 + M_1 Y_1 + M_2 Y_2}{S_0 + M_1 S_1 + M_2 S_2}&lt;/math&gt;
and making use of known tristimulus values for the mean vectors, they were able to express M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:

[[File:Planckian-locus.png|thumb|Kelly's figures depicted the lines of constant correlated color temperature on the CIE 1960 UCS, as shown here, as well as the familiar xy diagram.]]

:&lt;math&gt;M_1 = \frac{-1.351,5 - 1.770,3 x + 5.911,4 y}{0.024,1 + 0.256,2 x - 0.734,1 y},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2 = \frac{0.030,0 - 31.442,4 x + 30.071,7 y}{0.024,1 + 0.256,2 x - 0.734,1 y}.&lt;/math&gt;

The only problem is that this left unsolved the computation of the coordinate &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; for a particular phase of daylight. Judd ''et al.'' simply tabulated the values of certain chromaticity coordinates, corresponding to commonly used correlated color temperatures, such as 5500&amp;nbsp;K, 6500&amp;nbsp;K, and 7500&amp;nbsp;K. For other color temperatures, one could consult figures made by Kelly.&lt;ref name=kelly&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Kenneth L.|date=August 1963|title=Lines of Constant Correlated Color Temperature Based on MacAdam's (u,v) Uniform Chromaticity Transformation of the CIE Diagram|journal=JOSA|volume=53|issue=8|pages=999–1002| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-53-8-999|doi=10.1364/JOSA.53.000999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was addressed in the CIE report that formalized illuminant D, with an approximation of the x coordinate in terms of the reciprocal color temperature, valid from 4000&amp;nbsp;K to 25,000&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Proceedings of the 15th Session, Vienna|author=Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The y coordinate trivially followed from Judd's quadratic relation.

Judd ''et al.'' then extended the reconstituted SPDs to {{nowrap|300 nm}}–{{nowrap|330 nm}} and {{nowrap|700 nm}}–{{nowrap|830 nm}} by using Moon's spectral absorbance data of the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Proposed standard solar-radiation curves for engineering use| first=Parry|last=Moon|date=November 1940|volume=230|issue=5|pages=583–617|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|doi=10.1016/S0016-0032(40)90364-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tabulated SPDs presented by the CIE today are derived by [[linear interpolation]] of the {{nowrap|10 nm}} data set down to {{nowrap|5 nm}}. &lt;ref&gt;[http://files.cie.co.at/204.xls CIE 1931 and 1964 Standard Colorimetric Observers] from {{nowrap|380 nm}} to {{nowrap|780 nm}} in increments of {{nowrap|5 nm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar studies have been undertaken in other parts of the world, or repeating Judd ''et al.'''s analysis with modern computational methods. In several of these studies, the daylight locus is notably closer to the Planckian locus than in Judd ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Studies from the 1960s and 1970s include:

; Computation:
The relative [[spectral power distribution]] (SPD) &lt;math&gt;S_D (\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; of a D series illuminant can be derived from its [[chromaticity coordinate]]s in the [[CIE 1931 color space]], &lt;math&gt;(x_D,y_D)&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=bruce&gt;The coefficients differ from those in the original paper due to the change in the constants in [[Planck's law]]. See [http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_DIlluminant.html Lindbloom] for the current version, and [[Planckian locus]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt;

x_D = \begin{cases}
0.244,063 + 0.09911 \frac{10^3}{T} + 2.967,8 \frac{10^6}{T^2} - 4.607,0 \frac{10^9}{T^3} &amp; 4,000\ \mathrm{K} \leq T \leq 7,000\ \ \mathrm{K} \\

\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y_D = -3.000 x_D^2 + 2.870 x_D - 0.275&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' is the illuminant's CCT. The chromaticity coordinates of the Illuminants D are said to form the ''CIE Daylight Locus''. The relative SPD is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;S_D(\lambda) = S_0(\lambda) + M_1 S_1(\lambda) + M_2 S_2(\lambda),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_1 = (-1.351,5 - 1.770,3 x_D + 5.911,4 y_D)/M,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2 = (0.030,00 - 31.442,4 x_D + 30.071,7 y_D)/M,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M = 0.024,1 + 0.256,2 x_D - 0.734,1 y_D&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S_0(\lambda), S_1(\lambda), S_2(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; are the mean and first two [[eigenvector]] SPDs, depicted above.&lt;ref name=bruce/&gt; The characteristic vectors both have a zero at {{nowrap|560 nm}}, since all the relative SPDs have been normalized about this point.

The CCTs of the canonical illuminants, D&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;65&lt;/sub&gt;, and D&lt;sub&gt;75&lt;/sub&gt;, differ slightly from what their names suggest. For example, D50 has a CCT of 5003&amp;nbsp;K ("horizon" light), while [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] has a CCT of 6504&amp;nbsp;K (noon light). As explained in a previous section, this is because the value of the constants in Planck's law have been slightly changed since the definition of these canonical illuminants, whose SPDs are based on the original values in Planck's law. In order to match all significant digits of the published data of the canonical illuminants the values of M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have to be rounded to three decimal places before calculation of ''S&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;.''&lt;ref name="schanda" /&gt;

===Illuminant E===
Illuminant E is an equal-energy radiator; it has a constant SPD inside the [[visible spectrum]]. It is useful as a theoretical reference; an illuminant that gives equal weight to all wavelengths, presenting an even color. It also has equal [[CIE XYZ]] tristimulus values, thus its chromaticity coordinates are (x,y)=(1/3,1/3). This is by design; the XYZ color matching functions are normalized such that their integrals over the visible spectrum are the same.&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt;

[[File:Planckian-locus.png|thumb|right|Illuminant E is beneath the Planckian locus, and roughly isothermal with D&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

Illuminant E is not a black body, so it does not have a color temperature, but it can be approximated by a D series illuminant with a CCT of 5455&amp;nbsp;K. (Of the canonical illuminants, D&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt; is the closest.) Manufacturers sometimes compare light sources against Illuminant E to calculate the [[colorfulness#Excitation purity|excitation purity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Philips|title=Optical Testing for SuperFlux, SnapLED and LUXEON Emitters|url=http://www.philipslumileds.com/pdfs/AB08.pdf|quote=CIE has defined the color coordinates of several different white Illuminants, but within Lumileds, CIE Illuminant E is used for all color calculations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminant series F===
The '''F''' series of illuminants represent various types of [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]].

F1–F6 "standard" fluorescent lamps consist of two semi-broadband emissions of [[antimony]] and [[manganese]] activations in calcium halophosphate [[phosphor]].&lt;ref&gt;For commercial examples of calcium halophosphate fluorescents, see for example {{patent|US|5447660|Method for making a calcium halophosphate phosphor}} or {{patent|US|6666993|Single component calcium halophosphate phosphor}}&lt;/ref&gt; F4 is of particular interest since it was used for calibrating the CIE [[color rendering index]] (the CRI formula was chosen such that F4 would have a CRI of 51). F7–F9 are "broadband" ([[full-spectrum light]]) fluorescent lamps with multiple phosphors, and higher CRIs. Finally, F10–F12 are narrow triband illuminants consisting of three "narrowband" emissions (caused by ternary compositions of rare-earth phosphors) in the R,G,B regions of the visible spectrum. The phosphor weights can be tuned to achieve the desired CCT.

The spectra of these illuminants are published in Publication 15:2004.&lt;ref name=cie2004&gt;{{cite book|author=CIE Technical Report|year=2004|title=Colorimetry|edition=3rd|series=Publication 15:2004|publisher=CIE Central Bureau, Vienna|isbn=3-901906-33-9|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213035758/http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html|archivedate=2008-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/CIE/Fluorescents.htm Spectral power distribution of Illuminants Series F] ([http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/CIE/Fluorescents.xls Excel]), in {{nowrap|5 nm}} increments from {{nowrap|380 nm}} to {{nowrap|780 nm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminant series L===
Publication of an '''L''' series of illuminants is expected mid-2018. It will represent various types of [[LED lamp|LED lighting]].

==White point==
{{main|White point}}
The spectrum of a standard illuminant, like any other profile of light, can be converted into [[tristimulus value]]s. The set of three tristimulus coordinates of an illuminant is called a ''white point''. If the profile is [[Normalizing constant|normalized]], then the white point can equivalently be expressed as a pair of [[chromaticity coordinate]]s.

If an image is recorded in tristimulus coordinates (or in values which can be converted to and from them), then the white point of the illuminant used gives the maximum value of the tristimulus coordinates that will be recorded at any point in the image, in the absence of [[fluorescence]]. It is called the white point of the image.

The process of calculating the white point discards a great deal of information about the profile of the illuminant, and so although it is true that for every illuminant the exact white point can be calculated, it is not the case that knowing the white point of an image alone tells you a great deal about the illuminant that was used to record it.

'''''The Opening of the First Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia by H.R.H. The Duke of Cornwall and York (later H.M. King George V), May&amp;nbsp;9, 1901''''', more commonly known in [[Australia]] as '''''The Big Picture''''', is a [[1903 in art|1903]] painting by the Australian artist [[Tom Roberts]]. The painting, measuring {{convert|304.5|x|509.2|cm|in}}, or roughly 10 by 17 feet, depicts the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia]] at the [[Royal Exhibition Building]] in Melbourne on 9 May 1901.

The painting is part of the [[Royal Collection]] but has been on permanent loan to the [[Parliament of Australia]] since 1957. The work, currently on display in [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]], [[Canberra]], has been described as "undoubtedly the principal work of art recording Australia's Parliamentary History."&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistsfootsteps.com/html/Roberts_picturehistory.htm|title=The history of "The Big Picture" to 2001|last=Mackenzie|first=Andrew|year=2000|work=Artists Footsteps|publisher=Countrytowns Productions Pty Ltd|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
On 1 January 1901, after years of debate, the various colonies in Australia joined in a [[Federation of Australia|federation]]. While the new [[Constitution of Australia]] called for a new capital to be constructed, away from the major cities, until that time [[Melbourne]] would act as the seat of government of the new nation. Elections were held for the first [[Parliament of Australia]] and on 9 May 1901, the new parliament was sworn in at the [[Royal Exhibition Building]] in Melbourne.&lt;ref name="Victoria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/education/tom_roberts_the_big_picture.htm |title=Tom Roberts’ The Big Picture: Icon of Federation |date=17 July 2002 |publisher=Parliament of Victoria |accessdate=2009-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611183254/http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/education/Tom_Roberts_The_Big_Picture.htm |archivedate=11 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the new parliament was seen as a historic and momentous occasion with [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]'s son, the [[George V of the United Kingdom|Duke of Cornwall and York]] (later George V) coming to Australia to officially open the new parliament on behalf of the King.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; To appropriately capture the occasion, the "Australian Art Association", a consortium of private benefactors, sought to commission a painting of the event as a "gift to the nation".&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Their motives were not entirely altruistic; the consortium hoped to profit by selling prints.&lt;ref name="Return"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s313550.htm|title=Bracks calls for Aus to own painting, not Queen|last=Saccotelli|first=Luisa|date=15 June 2001|work=PM - ABC Radio|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts was not the consortium's first choice, with [[James Clarke Waite|J. C. Waite]] initially preferred.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt;

==Composition==
Although not commissioned on the day of the opening, Roberts had received an approach from the consortium and so attended the ceremony to take photographs and sketches. Two weeks after the event, after the consortium were turned down by Waite, Roberts was formally commissioned to produce the painting.&lt;ref name="McQueen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialpainter.com.au/commercial-painter-articles/1996/2/24/tom-roberts-bailed-up/|title=Tom Roberts Bailed Up|last=Hawley|first=Janet|date=24 February 1996|work=from the Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Commercial Painter|accessdate=2009-08-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706102913/http://www.commercialpainter.com.au/commercial-painter-articles/1996/2/24/tom-roberts-bailed-up/|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract initially was for 650 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]] but this was increased to 1000 guineas when the scope of the work was realised. Roberts was also paid one guinea for each subject's sketch plus expenses; in all he received over 2000 guineas for the work.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt; The contract required Roberts to include at least 250 recognisable likenesses in the finished work, including the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, the [[Governor General of Australia|Governor General]], each State Governor, Members of the new Commonwealth Parliament and other distinguished guests.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt;{{quote|When the great day came your mother and I went to the hall of the Exhibition Building, and without getting seats, walked quietly at the very back, and climbing up some rails, I was able to see that immense gathering of people from Australia, and from so many parts of the world.

The heads on the floor looked like a landscape.|Tom Roberts, writing to his son, Caleb|&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nga.gov.au/federation/Detail.cfm?WorkID=46996|title=Opening of the first Parliament of the Australian Commonwealth, 9th May 1901 - with remarque of Edward VII|work=Federation: Australian art and society|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Roberts started to work on the painting in a room provided at the Royal Exhibition Building. The painting was made in three [[flax]] panels to enable it to be folded for transportation.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt; He travelled to Sydney and many other places to make sketches of the attendees as well as working from photographs. He asked his subjects for "measurements" to ensure accuracy&amp;mdash;age, height, weight, [[hat size]] and even place of birth.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt; In all, the picture included 269 separate portraits.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt;  Rumours spread that Roberts was paid by some of these dignitaries to ensure they were placed in a more prominent location.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt; 

Most of the delegates at the ceremony wore black, still observing a period of mourning after the recent death of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. To balance this Roberts gave some emphasis to the choir, who were dressed in white. A shaft of light focused on the Duke reading the King's proclamation also provides some colour; this phenomenon was remarked upon by contemporary newspaper reports.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Artistic licence was taken with the dais shown as much higher that it actually was and some other architectural features of the building either downplayed or ignored. Roberts also honoured the "Father of Federation", [[Henry Parkes]], who had died five years previous. He added a portrait of Parkes in the form of a painting above the dais, this painting was not there on the day.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt;

Roberts took the painting to London&amp;mdash;where many of the attendees lived&amp;mdash;to complete, using the South African Room of the [[Imperial Institute]] as his workspace.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The painting was finished on 16 November 1903; in all, it took Roberts two and a half years to complete.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt; It was then taken to Paris where [[photogravure]] reproductions were made for sale to the public, with Roberts signing 500 of them. Roberts did not sign the actual painting.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

==History==
The painting was first exhibited in the [[Royal Academy]] in [[London]] before being presented to King Edward VII by the Commonwealth Government in 1904. It was then moved to  [[St. James's Palace]] where it remained on display until 1957.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; That year, [[Robert Menzies]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] requested the permanent loan of the painting from  [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The Queen consented and the picture returned to Australia in 1958.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The picture was to be exhibited in the King's Hall of the then [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] with the other historic records of events as the opening of the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927 and the Royal opening of Parliament in 1954, however it was too big for the available space.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The decision was made to store the painting at the [[Australian War Memorial]] after a tour of the various state galleries. In 1969, the painting was moved to the Parliament House basement where it remained until 1980.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

As a result of its travels, the picture had deteriorated considerably and required major restoration work.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;{{quote|The picture had long been unprotected from changes in temperature and humidity, it had been constantly rolled and unrolled and untacked from its stretcher frame. At one stage it was even folded in half for transport. All this seriously affected the canvas. It gradually sagged, undulated and malformed and was in danger of becoming completely dilapidated.|Katrina Rumley|quoted in Mackenzie.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;}} The School of Materials Conservation at the [[University of Canberra|Canberra College of Advanced Education]] started restoration work in 1980. The work included infra-red and ultra-violet photography to determine the condition of the painting followed by removal of old varnish and grime, repairs to the tacking margin and restoration of some small areas of paint. The work was completed in time for it to be taken to the new [[High Court of Australia]] building for its official opening by the Queen in 1981.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The designers of the new [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] were mindful of the need to provide an appropriate space to display ''The Big Picture'' in the new building. The Joint Standing Committee responsible for the new building made the decision to place the painting in the Main Committee Room Foyer.  The architects worked to ensure that major design elements in the room such as the skylight and balustrade around the work allowed for the integration of the painting with the available space.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Because the fragile state of the picture prevented it from being rolled, moving the painting from the High Court to Parliament House was a major logistical exercise. The move required removal of some windows at the High Court, the construction of a special carrying frame and scaffolding and a system of winches to support the picture in place.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The painting remains in this specially designed location to this day.

On the occasion of the centenary of Federation in 2001, the [[Premier of Victoria]] [[Steve Bracks]] led a call for ownership of the painting to be formally transferred from the British Royal Collection to the [[Monarchy of Australia|Australian Crown]]. This was opposed as being both impracticable and unnecessary, as the Queen or her successors were unlikely to request its return.&lt;ref name="Return"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:TomRobertsUnfinished.jpg|thumb|Roberts working on the painting at the [[Royal Exhibition Building]]]]
The effort of creating such a monumental picture&amp;mdash;Roberts nicknamed it "The Big Picture"&amp;mdash;took its toll on the artist. Nicknamed "Bulldog", he drew a picture of a bulldog escaping a collar and chain in a letter he wrote informing that the picture was near completion.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt; He described the painting once as his "Frankenstein of 17 feet."&lt;ref name="730report"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s293414.htm|title=Legacy of Federation fathers lives on|last=O'Brien|first=Kerry|date=9 May 2001|work=7:30 Report|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts's eyesight was weakened by the strain in representing so many likenesses accurately and the importance that he placed on the task sapped his strength.&lt;ref name ="ADB"&gt;{{cite web  | first=Helen | last=Topliss| title =Roberts, Thomas William (Tom) (1856 - 1931)| publisher =[[Australian National University]]|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]| url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110419b.htm| accessdate = 2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biographer [[Humphrey McQueen]] claims the picture gave Roberts "an inflated idea of [his] own importance".{{quote|[P]oliticians called at his studio to pose for their portraits, royalty dropped in, and he became personal friends with [[Alfred Deakin|Deakin]]. He thought fame and more commissions would now come his way in England.|Humphrey McQueen|&lt;ref name="McQueen"/&gt;}} However, Roberts never established himself as an artist in England and slipped into [[major depressive disorder|depression]]. The completion of the painting is generally seen as a turning point in his artistic career, after which his work never again reached the same heights.&lt;ref name="McQueen" /&gt; Roberts family reject this consensus as a "myth", with his great-granddaughter, artist [[Lisa Roberts (artist)|Lisa Roberts]], stating "His son, my grandfather, Caleb, documented that for a year he was depressed which isn't surprising after a huge commission like that that took him away from the thing he loved most which was the landscape. But after that, he went back to it. He continued to paint but not with the desire to be rich and famous."&lt;ref name="730report"/&gt;

The work itself was considered a worthy record of the event but not a masterpiece.&lt;ref name="McQueen" /&gt; It has, however, become the best known pictorial record of the historic occasion, and a national icon.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt;  The cartoonist [[Bill Leak]]'s homage, ''The big picture.... with apologies to Tom Roberts'', won the 1997 [[Walkley Award]] for best artwork.&lt;ref name="Walkley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkleys.com/component/option,com_dbquery/Itemid,29/task,ExecuteQuery/qid,3/previousQuery,2/|title=Walkley Award Winners|work=The Walkley Awards|publisher=The Walkley Foundation|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-an13655838|title=The big picture.... with apologies to Tom Roberts|last=Leak|first=Bill|work=Digital Collections|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hannaford]] was commissioned to create a companion piece to celebrate the centenary of Federation in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.unisa.edu.au/BHPML/Biogs/hannaford.asp|title=Robert Hannaford|date=30 October 2008|work=The Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Library UniSA home|publisher=University of South Australia|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Crossing of the Red Sea''''' is a painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], produced between 1633 and 1634. It depicts the [[Crossing the Red Sea|crossing of the Red Sea]] by the Israelites, from chapter 14 of the [[book of Exodus]]. It was made as part of a pair of paintings (the other being ''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'') commissioned by Amadeo dal Pozzo, Marchese di Voghera of Turin, a cousin to [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], Poussin's main sponsor in Rome. By 1685 the pair had passed to the Chevalier de Lorraine and in 1710 they were bought by Benigne de Ragois de Bretonvillers. 

In 1741 the pair was bought from Samuel by [[Jacob Bouverie, 1st Viscount Folkestone|Sir Jacob Bouverie]], whose son [[William Bouverie, 1st Earl of Radnor|William]] became the first [[Earl of Radnor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/1532/the-adoration-of-the-golden-calf |title=The Adoration of the Golden Calf |publisher=Art Fund |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earls of Radnor owned the pair from then until 1945, when it was split for the first time and ''The Adoration of the Golden Calf'' was sold to the [[National Gallery]] in London. ''The Crossing of the Red Sea'' was acquired by [[Kenneth Clark]] for the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in 1948&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:56Gk4l8Y5aQJ:arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/anderson-on-burke.pdf+%22Crossing+of+the+Red+Sea%22+felton+1945&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj9-tN92cMt1IYQFw8l5oUVNfaOoLdSD9mCkJkrkrIXqRzZ__hH5otEHoUOSefvNu43wXBW7rlQViazQ6thM0z1ttSSpXPdBQck_SEEsv5C4gU5KtP_TVPj_-n_qxuPfvAIL8EK&amp;sig=AHIEtbQAwvv9Z1hJ9gGYWhalpNmp2ZtV6w Poussin Paintings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/ngv-collection/search?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cubmd2LnZpYy5nb3YuYXUlMkZjb2xhcHAlMkZwdWIlMkZhcnR3b3JrcyUyRjQyNzElMkZkZXRhaWxzJmFsbD0x NGV catalogue entry]&lt;/ref&gt; using money from the [[Alfred Felton#Felton Bequest|Felton Bequest]], a fund originally left to the gallery in 1904 by the industrialist [[Alfred Felton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/11/1073769451690.html |title=The bequest of a century |publisher=www.theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it underwent a major conservation project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/essay/the-poussin-project/ NGV conservation project on the painting]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Merchant of Venice''''' is a 16th-century play written by [[William Shakespeare]] in which a merchant in Venice (Antonio) must default on a large loan provided by a Jewish moneylender, [[Shylock]]. It is believed to have been written between 1596 and 1599. Though classified as a [[Shakespearean comedy|comedy]] in the [[First Folio]] and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]], the play is  most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and it is best known for [[Shylock]] and the famous "Hath not a Jew eyes?" speech on humanity. Also notable is [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]]'s speech about "[[The quality of mercy (Shakespeare quote)|the quality of mercy]]". Critic [[Harold Bloom]] listed it among Shakespeare's great comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vftwsGjRSNMC|title=William Shakespeare: Comedies|page=1|editor-last=Bloom|editor-first=Harold|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=2009|isbn=1604136316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==
[[File:Gilbert-Shylock.jpg|thumb|Gilbert's ''[[Shylock]] After the Trial'', an illustration to The ''Merchant of Venice''.]]
Bassanio, a young [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] of noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] of Belmont. Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000 [[ducats]] to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friend [[Antonio (Merchant of Venice)|Antonio]], a wealthy merchant of Venice who has previously and repeatedly bailed him out. Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor – his ships and merchandise are busy at sea to [[Tripoli]]s, [[the Indies]], [[New Spain|Mexico]] and [[England]] – he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor.

Antonio has already antagonized Shylock through his outspoken [[antisemitism]] and because Antonio's habit of lending money without interest forces Shylock to charge lower rates.  Shylock is at first reluctant to grant the loan, citing abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand. He finally agrees to lend the sum to Bassanio without interest upon one condition: if Antonio is unable to repay it at the specified date, Shylock may take a [[pound (mass)|pound]] of Antonio's flesh. Bassanio does not want Antonio to accept such a risky condition; Antonio is surprised by what he sees as the moneylender's generosity (no "usance" – interest – is asked for), and he signs the contract. With money at hand, Bassanio leaves for Belmont with his friend Gratiano, who has asked to accompany him. Gratiano is a likeable young man, but he is often flippant, overly talkative, and tactless. Bassanio warns his companion to exercise self-control, and the two leave for Belmont.

Meanwhile, in Belmont, Portia is awash with suitors. Her father left a [[Will and testament|will]] stipulating each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets – made of gold, silver and lead respectively. Whoever picks the right casket wins Portia's hand. The first suitor, the Prince of Morocco, chooses the gold casket, interpreting its slogan, "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire", as referring to Portia. The second suitor, the conceited Prince of Arragon, chooses the silver casket, which proclaims, "Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves", as he believes he is full of merit. Both suitors leave empty-handed, having rejected the lead casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan, "Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath". The last suitor is Bassanio, whom Portia wishes to succeed, having met him before. As Bassanio ponders his choice, members of Portia's household sing a song that says that "fancy" (not true love) is "engend'red in the eyes, / With gazing fed";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/merchant/MerchantText32.html#67|title=The Merchant of Venice: Act 3, Scene 2|website=www.shakespeare-navigators.com|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassanio chooses the lead casket and wins Portia's hand.

[[File:Shakespeare's Heroines - Jessica.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of Jessica, from ''The Graphic Gallery of Shakespeare's Heroines'']]
At Venice, Antonio's ships are reported lost at sea, so the merchant cannot repay the bond. Shylock has become more determined to exact revenge from Christians because his daughter Jessica eloped with the Christian Lorenzo and converted. She took a substantial amount of Shylock's wealth with her, as well as a turquoise ring which Shylock had been given by his late wife, Leah. Shylock has Antonio brought before court.

At Belmont, Bassanio receives a letter telling him that Antonio has been unable to repay the loan from Shylock. Portia and Bassanio marry, as do Gratiano and Portia's handmaid Nerissa. Bassanio and Gratiano leave for [[Venice]], with money from Portia, to save Antonio's life by offering the money to Shylock. Unknown to Bassanio and Gratiano, Portia sent her servant, Balthazar, to seek the counsel of Portia's cousin, Bellario, a lawyer, at [[Padua]].

The climax of the play takes place in the court of the [[Doges of Venice|Duke of Venice]]. Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of 6,000 ducats, twice the amount of the loan. He demands his pound of flesh from Antonio. The Duke, wishing to save Antonio but unable to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor. He identifies himself as Balthasar, a young male "doctor of the law", bearing a letter of recommendation to the Duke from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is Portia in disguise, and the law clerk who accompanies her is Nerissa, also disguised as a man. As Balthasar, Portia repeatedly asks Shylock to show mercy in a [[The quality of mercy (Shakespeare quote)|famous speech]], advising him that mercy "is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes" (IV, i, 185). However, Shylock adamantly refuses any compensations and insists on the pound of flesh.

As the court grants Shylock his bond and Antonio prepares for Shylock's knife, Portia deftly appropriates Shylock's argument for "specific performance". She says that the contract allows Shylock to remove only the ''flesh'', not the "blood", of Antonio (see [[Quibble (plot device)|quibble]]). Thus, if Shylock were to shed any drop of Antonio's blood, his "lands and goods" would be forfeited under Venetian laws. She tells him that he must cut precisely one pound of flesh, no more, no less; she advises him that "if the scale do turn, But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate."

Defeated, Shylock concedes to accepting Bassanio's offer of money for the defaulted bond, first his offer to pay "the bond thrice", which Portia rebuffs, telling him to take his bond, and then merely the principal, which Portia also prevents him from doing on the ground that he has already refused it "in the open court". She cites a law under which Shylock, as a Jew and therefore an "alien", having attempted to take the life of a citizen, has forfeited his property, half to [[Venetian Republic|the government]] and half to Antonio, leaving his life at the mercy of the Duke. The Duke pardons Shylock's life. Antonio asks for his share "in use" until Shylock's death, when the principal will be given to Lorenzo and Jessica. At Antonio's request, the Duke grants remission of the state's half of forfeiture, but on the condition that Shylock convert to Christianity and bequeath his entire estate to Lorenzo and Jessica (IV,i).

Bassanio does not recognise his disguised wife, but offers to give a present to the supposed lawyer. First she declines, but after he insists, Portia requests his ring and Antonio's gloves. Antonio parts with his gloves without a second thought, but Bassanio gives the ring only after much persuasion from Antonio, as earlier in the play he promised his wife never to lose, sell or give it. Nerissa, as the lawyer's clerk, succeeds in likewise retrieving her ring from Gratiano, who does not see through her disguise.

At Belmont, Portia and Nerissa taunt and pretend to accuse their husbands before revealing they were really the lawyer and his clerk in disguise (V). After all the other characters make amends, Antonio learns from Portia that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all.

== Date and text ==

The date of composition for ''The Merchant of Venice'' is believed to be between 1596 and 1598. The play was mentioned by [[Francis Meres]] in 1598, so it must have been familiar on the stage by that date. The title page of the first edition in 1600 states that it had been performed "divers times" by that date. Salerino's reference to his ship the ''Andrew'' (I,i,27) is thought to be an allusion to the Spanish ship ''St. Andrew,'' captured by the English at [[Cádiz]] in 1596. A date of 1596–97 is considered consistent with the play's style.

The play was entered in the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]], the method at that time of obtaining [[copyright]] for a new play, by [[James Roberts (printer)|James Roberts]] on 22 July 1598 under the title ''The Merchant of Venice'', otherwise called ''The Jew of Venice''. On 28 October 1600 Roberts transferred his right to the play to the stationer [[Thomas Heyes]]; Heyes published the first [[book size|quarto]] before the end of the year. It was printed again in 1619, as part of William Jaggard's so-called [[False Folio]]. (Afterward, Thomas Heyes' son and heir Laurence Heyes asked for and was granted a confirmation of his right to the play, on 8 July 1619.) The 1600 edition is generally regarded as being accurate and reliable. It is the basis of the text published in the 1623 [[First Folio]], which adds a number of stage directions, mainly musical cues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Wells]] and Michael Dobson, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2001, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Shylock and the antisemitism debate ===
The play is frequently staged today, but is potentially troubling to modern audiences because of its central themes, which can easily appear [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]. Critics today still continue to argue over the play's stance on the Jews and Judaism.
[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Shylock e jessica.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Shylock and Jessica'' (1876) by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]].]]

==== Shylock as a villain ====
English society in the Elizabethan era has been described as "judeophobic".&lt;ref&gt;Philipe Burrin, ''Nazi Anti-Semitism: From Prejudice to Holocaust''. The New Press, 2005, p. 17. {{ISBN|1-56584-969-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Jews in England|English Jews]] had been [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled]] under [[King Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1290 and were not permitted to return until 1656 under the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. In Venice and in some other places, Jews were required to wear a red hat at all times in public to make sure that they were easily identified, and had to live in a ghetto protected by Christian guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Venice.html|title=Venice, Italy Jewish History Tour|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's play may be seen as a continuation of this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hales, John W. [https://archive.org/stream/englishhistorica09londuoft#page/652/mode/2up "Shakespeare and the Jews"], ''The English Review'', Vol. IX, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; The title page of the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Quarto]] indicates that the play was sometimes known as ''The Jew of Venice'' in its day, which suggests that it was seen as similar to Marlowe's ''[[The Jew of Malta]]''. One interpretation of the play's structure is that Shakespeare meant to contrast the mercy of the main Christian characters with the vengefulness of a Jew, who lacks the religious [[divine grace|grace]] to comprehend mercy. Similarly, it is possible that Shakespeare meant Shylock's [[forced conversion]] to Christianity to be a "[[happy ending]]" for the character, as, to a Christian audience, it saves his soul and allows him to enter Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Gorman | last=Beauchamp | date=2011 | title=Shylock's Conversion | work=[[Humanitas]] | volume=24 | pages=55–92 | url=http://www.nhinet.org/beauchamp24-1.pdf | access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of what Shakespeare's [[authorial intent]] may have been, the play has been made use of by antisemites throughout the play's history. The [[Nazis]] used the usurious Shylock for their propaganda. Shortly after [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, ''The Merchant of Venice'' was broadcast for propagandistic ends over the German airwaves. Productions of the play followed in [[Lübeck]] (1938), [[Berlin]] (1940), and elsewhere within the Nazi territory.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture by James Shapiro: "Shakespeare and the Jews".&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles called ''Observer'', first published in 1785, British playwright [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] created a character named Abraham Abrahams, who is quoted as saying, "I verily believe the odious character of Shylock has brought little less persecution upon us, poor scattered sons of [[Abraham]], than the [[Inquisition]] itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Louis I.|title=Richard Cumberland: Critic and Friend of the Jews (Classic Reprint)|year=2012|publisher=Forgotten Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland later wrote a successful play, ''[[The Jew]]'' (1794), in which his title character, [[The Jew|Sheva]], is portrayed sympathetically, as both a kindhearted and generous man. This was the first known attempt by a dramatist to reverse the negative stereotype that Shylock personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armin|first=Robert|title=Sheva, the Benevolent|year=2012|publisher=Moreclacke Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stereotypes of Jews in literature|depiction of Jews in literature]] throughout the centuries bears the close imprint of Shylock. With slight variations much of English literature up until the 20th century depicts the Jew as "a monied, cruel, lecherous, avaricious outsider tolerated only because of his golden hoard".&lt;ref&gt;David Mirsky, "The Fictive Jew in the Literature of England 1890–1920", in the ''Samuel K. Mirsky Memorial Volume''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shylock as a sympathetic character ====
[[File:Portia and Shylock.jpg|thumb|right|''Shylock and Portia'' (1835) by [[Thomas Sully]].]]
Many modern readers  and theatregoers have read the play as a plea for tolerance, noting that Shylock is a sympathetic character. They cite as evidence that Shylock's "trial" at the end of the play is a mockery of justice, with Portia acting as a judge when she has no right to do so. The characters who berated Shylock for dishonesty resort to trickery in order to win. In addition, Shakespeare gives Shylock one of his most eloquent speeches:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''Salerio.'' Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh. What's that good for?
''Shylock.'' To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies – and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.&lt;/poem&gt;|Act III, scene I}}

It is difficult to know whether the sympathetic reading of Shylock is entirely due to changing sensibilities among readers—or whether Shakespeare, a writer who created complex, multi-faceted characters, deliberately intended this reading.

One of the reasons for this interpretation is that Shylock's painful status in Venetian society is emphasised. To some critics, Shylock's celebrated "Hath not a Jew eyes?" speech redeems him and even makes him into something of a tragic figure; in the speech, Shylock argues that he is no different from the Christian characters.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors note that Shylock ends the speech with a tone of revenge: "if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?" Those who see the speech as sympathetic point out that Shylock says he learned the desire for revenge from the Christian characters: "If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction."

Even if Shakespeare did not intend the play to be read this way, the fact that it retains its power on stage for audiences who may perceive its central conflicts in radically different terms is an illustration of the subtlety of Shakespeare's characterisations.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2007), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the trial Shylock represents what Elizabethan Christians believed to be the Jewish desire for "justice", contrasted with their obviously superior Christian value of mercy. The Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to love his enemies, although they themselves have failed in the past. Jewish critic [[Harold Bloom]] suggests that, although the play gives merit to both cases, the portraits are not even-handed: "Shylock's shrewd indictment of Christian hypocrisy delights us, but … Shakespeare’s intimations do not alleviate the savagery of his portrait of the Jew…"&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2007), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antonio, Bassanio ===
Antonio's unexplained depression – "In sooth I know not why I am so sad" – and utter devotion to Bassanio has led some critics to theorise that he is suffering from [[unrequited love]] for Bassanio and is depressed because Bassanio is coming to an age where he will marry a woman. In his plays and poetry Shakespeare often depicted strong male bonds of varying [[homosociality]], which has led some critics to infer that Bassanio returns Antonio's affections despite his obligation to marry:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=Interpretations: William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice|year=2010|publisher=Infobase|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60413-885-6|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;ANTONIO: Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end,
Say how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.

BASSANIO: But life itself, my wife, and all the world
Are not with me esteemed above thy life;
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you. (IV,i)&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In his essay "Brothers and Others", published in ''The Dyer's Hand,'' [[W. H. Auden]] describes Antonio as "a man whose emotional life, though his conduct may be chaste, is concentrated upon a member of his own sex." Antonio's feelings for Bassanio are likened to a couplet from Shakespeare's ''Sonnets'': "But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,/ Mine be thy love, and my love's use their treasure." Antonio, says Auden, embodies the words on Portia's leaden casket: "Who chooseth me, must give and hazard all he hath." Antonio has taken this potentially fatal turn because he despairs, not only over the loss of Bassanio in marriage but also because Bassanio cannot requite what Antonio feels for him. Antonio's frustrated devotion is a form of idolatry: the right to live is yielded for the sake of the loved one. There is one other such idolator in the play: Shylock himself. "Shylock, however unintentionally, did, in fact, hazard all for the sake of destroying the enemy he hated, and Antonio, however unthinkingly he signed the bond, hazarded all to secure the happiness of the man he loved." Both Antonio and Shylock, agreeing to put Antonio's life at a forfeit, stand outside the normal bounds of society. There was, states Auden, a traditional "association of sodomy with usury", reaching back at least as far as [[Dante]], with which Shakespeare was likely familiar. (Auden sees the theme of [[usury]] in the play as a comment on human relations in a mercantile society.)

Other interpreters of the play regard Auden's conception of Antonio's sexual desire for Bassanio as questionable. Michael Radford, director of the 2004 film version starring [[Al Pacino]], explained that, although the film contains a scene where Antonio and Bassanio actually kiss, the friendship between the two is platonic, in line with the prevailing view of male friendship at the time. [[Jeremy Irons]], in an interview, concurs with the director's view and states that he did not "play Antonio as gay". [[Joseph Fiennes]], however, who plays Bassanio, encouraged a homoerotic interpretation and, in fact, surprised Irons with the kiss on set, which was filmed in one take. Fiennes defended his choice, saying "I would never invent something before doing my detective work in the text. If you look at the choice of language … you'll read very sensuous language. That's the key for me in the relationship. The great thing about Shakespeare and why he's so difficult to pin down is his ambiguity. He's not saying they're gay or they're straight, he's leaving it up to his actors. I feel there has to be a great love between the two characters … there's great attraction. I don't think they have slept together but that's for the audience to decide."&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.

== Performance history ==

The earliest performance of which a record has survived was held at the court of [[James I of England|King James]] in the spring of 1605, followed by a second performance a few days later, but there is no record of any further performances in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Boyce, ''Encyclopaedia of Shakespeare'', New York, Roundtable Press, 1990, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, [[George Granville]] staged a successful adaptation, titled ''The Jew of Venice'', with [[Thomas Betterton]] as Bassanio. This version (which featured a [[masque]]) was popular, and was acted for the next forty years. Granville cut the clownish [[#Characters|Gobbos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warde|first1=Frederick|title=The Fools of Shakespeare; an interpretation of their wit, wisdom and personalities|date=1915|publisher=McBride, Nast &amp; Company|location=London|pages=103–120|url=http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/characters/merchantgobbo.html|accessdate=28 April 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/foolsshakespear00wardgoog|archivedate=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[decorum]]; he added a jail scene between Shylock and Antonio, and a more extended scene of toasting at a banquet scene. [[Thomas Doggett]] was Shylock, playing the role comically, perhaps even farcically. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Rowe]] expressed doubts about this interpretation as early as 1709; Doggett's success in the role meant that later productions would feature the troupe clown as Shylock.

In 1741, [[Charles Macklin]] returned to the original text in a very successful production at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], paving the way for [[Edmund Kean]] seventy years later (see below).&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Halliday, ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 261, 311–12. In 2004, the film was released.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Sullivan]] wrote [[incidental music]] for the play in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/venice/index.html Information about Sullivan's incidental music to the play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125144749/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/venice/index.html |date=25 November 2009 }} at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 31 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edmund Kean as Shylock.jpg|thumb|left|A print of [[Edmund Kean]] as Shylock in an early 19th-century performance.]]

=== Shylock on stage ===
{{See also|Shylock}}

Jewish actor [[Jacob Pavlovitch Adler|Jacob Adler]] and others report that the tradition of playing Shylock sympathetically began in the first half of the 19th century with [[Edmund Kean]],&lt;ref&gt;Adler erroneously dates this from 1847 (at which time Kean was already dead); the ''Cambridge Student Guide to The Merchant of Venice'' dates Kean's performance to a more likely 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; and that previously the role had been played "by a comedian as a repulsive [[clown]] or, alternatively, as a monster of unrelieved evil." Kean's Shylock established his reputation as an actor.&lt;ref&gt;Adler (1999), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kean's time forward, all of the actors who have famously played the role, with the exception of [[Edwin Booth]], who played Shylock as a simple villain, have chosen a sympathetic approach to the character; even Booth's father, [[Junius Brutus Booth]], played the role sympathetically. [[Henry Irving]]'s portrayal of an aristocratic, proud Shylock (first seen at the Lyceum in 1879, with Portia played by [[Ellen Terry]]) has been called "the summit of his career".&lt;ref&gt;Wells and Dobson, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Adler was the most notable of the early 20th century: Adler played the role in [[Yiddish theatre|Yiddish]]-language translation, first in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Yiddish Theater District]] in the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], and later on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where, to great acclaim, he performed the role in [[Yiddish]] in an otherwise English-language production.&lt;ref&gt;Adler (1999), pp. 342–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kean and Irving presented a Shylock justified in wanting his [[revenge]]; Adler's Shylock evolved over the years he played the role, first as a stock Shakespearean villain, then as a man whose better nature was overcome by a desire for revenge, and finally as a man who operated not from revenge but from [[pride]]. In a 1902 interview with ''Theater'' magazine, Adler pointed out that Shylock is a wealthy man, "rich enough to forgo the interest on three thousand ducats" and that Antonio is "far from the chivalrous gentleman he is made to appear. He has insulted the Jew and spat on him, yet he comes with hypocritical politeness to borrow money of him." Shylock's fatal flaw is to depend on the law, but "would he not walk out of that courtroom head erect, the very apotheosis of defiant hatred and scorn?"&lt;ref&gt;Adler (1999), pp. 344–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern productions take further pains to show the sources of Shylock's thirst for vengeance. For instance, in the [[The Merchant of Venice (2004 film)|2004 film adaptation]] directed by [[Michael Radford]] and starring [[Al Pacino]] as Shylock, the film begins with text and a montage of how [[Venice Ghetto|Venetian Jews]] are cruelly abused by bigoted Christians. One of the last shots of the film also brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish community in Venice, no longer allowed to live in the ghetto. Another interpretation of Shylock and a vision of how "must he be acted" appears at the conclusion of the autobiography of [[Alexander Granach]], a noted Jewish stage and film actor in Weimar Germany (and later in Hollywood and on Broadway).&lt;ref&gt;Granach (1945; 2010), pp. 275–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Paper Chase''''' is a 1971 novel written by [[John Jay Osborn, Jr.]], a 1970 graduate of [[Harvard Law School]]. The book tells the story of Hart, a first-year [[Law school|law student]] at Harvard, and his experiences with Professor Charles Kingsfield, the brilliant, demanding [[contract]]s instructor whom he both idolizes and finds incredibly intimidating.

The novel inspired an eponymous 1973 film and then a television series, which ran from 1978 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1986.

Osborn wrote the novel as a third-year student at Harvard Law School. [[William Alfred]], a Harvard humanities professor and playwright, coached him in writing the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Professor, Playwright Alfred Dies|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/5/24/former-professor-playwright-alfred-dies-pthe/|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=The Harvard Crimson|date=May 24, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story centers on Hart, a young law student from Minnesota who attends Harvard Law School and becomes obsessed with one of his teachers, Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. Hart becomes an expert on Kingsfield's subject, contracts; he reads everything about the subject, including all of Kingsfield's papers, most of which are not on the reading list. He goes so far as to break into the law library to read Kingsfield's original law school notes. Hart becomes such an expert that Kingsfield asks him to contribute to a paper.

At the same time, he begins a relationship with Susan Field, who turns out to be Kingsfield's daughter. Susan stands aloof from the law-school rat-race and dismisses all the things Hart cares about most.

After much effort preparing for the final exam, Hart's grade is delivered to him, but he simply makes a paper airplane out of his final report card, and sends it sailing into the Atlantic Ocean without looking at it.

==Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr==
Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. is one of the key characters in the novel, film and television series. Kingsfield is an imperious, highly respected (and feared) professor of contracts at Harvard Law School, known for his unrelenting use of the [[Socratic method]] on his students.

Kingsfield himself was a law student at Harvard, as shown by the presence of his own class notes in the institution's archives. Kingsfield has a daughter with a fiercely independent personality.

During an event at Harvard Law School to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the book's release, the author said that the character was a composite of several of his professors at Harvard Law School, saying, "It wasn’t like it was hard to find role models."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Colleen|title=‘The Paper Chase’ at 40|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/10/the-paper-chase-at-40/|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt_lzEjqj0c 'The Paper Chase' at 40: A conversation with author John Jay Osborn Jr. '70]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Harvard Law graduates believe the character to be a composite of Contracts professor Clark Byse &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesecretplot.com/downloadables/Clark_Byse.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202134059/http://www.thesecretplot.com/downloadables/Clark_Byse.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2008/winter/mem-byse.php&lt;/ref&gt; and Property Law  professor A.J.

Warren, who taught a first-year property-law course, was famous at the school for his sarcastic comments during lectures and intimidating manner. Houseman's performance was also based on his experience as a professor and director of the drama department at the [[Juilliard School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Houseman|first=John|title=Tyrannical?

==Structure==
The novel is divided into three sections: Fall (chapters 1–15), Winter (chapters 16–33), and Spring (chapters 34–58). Chapters 1, 3, 13, 27, and 35 begin with quotes that set the tone for those chapters.

==40th anniversary edition==

In 2010, a 40th-anniversary edition of ''The Paper Chase'' was released by Peninsula Road Press, which contains a new preface. This edition is the only one prepared by the author.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
{{Main article|The Paper Chase (film)}}
According to Osborn, the 1973 film is based "almost word for word" on the novel. It starred [[John Houseman]] as Kingsfield and [[Timothy Bottoms]] as Hart.

===Television series===
{{Main article|The Paper Chase (TV series)}}
[[CBS]] aired a one-hour drama series in the 1978–1979 season based on the movie. [[John Houseman]] reprised his movie role, and [[James Stephens (actor)|James Stephens]] played Hart. In 1983, pay-[[cable television|cable]] network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] brought back the show with both Houseman and Stephens. At the end of three seasons on Showtime, Hart finally graduated.

'''''The Sex Monster''''' is a 1999 American [[comedy film]] directed and written by [[Mike Binder]].

== Plot ==

Martin "Marty" Barnes, a [[neuroticism|neurotic]] [[businessman]] (director-writer [[Mike Binder]]) who works as a building contractor in Los Angeles, tries to improve his [[sex life]] with his wife Laura ([[Mariel Hemingway]]) by encouraging her to have a [[Ménage à trois|threesome]] involving another woman. Though Marty is fortunate enough to find that Laura likes the idea, he does not count on her decision that she not only has no need of her husband for enjoyment with ladies but also ends up actually preferring them to men. Nor does he anticipate her becoming a sexual tigress who seduces every female she encounters, including even Marty's own secretary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20988">'''U.S. standard clothing sizes''' for women were originally developed from statistical data in the 1940s and 1950s. At that time, they were similar in concept to the [[EN 13402]] European clothing size standard, although individual manufacturers have always deviated from them, sometimes significantly.

However, as a result of various cultural pressures, most notably [[vanity sizing]], North American clothing sizes have drifted substantially away from this standard over time, and now have very little connection to it. Instead, they now follow the more loosely defined standards known as [[US standard clothing size#Conversion from catalog sizes|U.S. catalog sizes]].

Body measurements below are given in inches.

==History==

Men's standard sizes were probably developed first during the [[American Revolutionary War]], and they were in regular use by the American army during the [[War of 1812]] for ready-made uniforms {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. These were based on the chest measurement, with other measurements being assumed to be either proportional (the circumference of the neck, waist, hips, and thighs) or easily altered (length of the inseam) {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}.

As this was largely successful in men, the same approach was attempted in the early 20th century for women using the bust as the sole measurement {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. However, this proved unsuccessful because women's bodies have far more variety in shape. The [[hourglass figure]] is frequently used as an industry standard, but only 8% of women have this body shape {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. A woman with an hourglass figure and a woman with an apple-shaped figure who have the same bust size will not have the same waist or hip sizes.

This was a significant problem for mail-order companies, and several attempts at predictable, standard sizing were made {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. In the 1940s, the statisticians Ruth O'Brien and William Shelton received a [[Works Progress Administration]] grant to conduct the most ambitious effort to solve this problem. Their team measured almost 15,000 women across the US. After discovering the complex diversity of women's actual sizes, which produced five to seven different body shapes, they proposed a three-part sizing system. Each size would be the combination of a single number, representing an upper body measurement, plus an indicator for height (short, regular, and long) and an indication for girth (slim, regular, and stout).  The various combinations of height and girth resulted in nine different sizes for each numerical upper-body measurement, which was highly impractical for manufacturing {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}.

As a result, O'Brien and Shelton's work was rejected. In 1958, the [[National Bureau of Standards]] invented a new sizing system, based on the hourglass figure and using only the bust size to create an arbitrary standard of sizes ranging from 8 to 38, with an indication for height (short, regular, and tall) and lower-body girth (plus or minus). The resulting commercial standard was not widely popular, and was declared voluntary in 1970 and withdrawn entirely in 1983. In 1995, [[ASTM International]] published its own voluntary standard, which has been revised since then {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. It has not been widely adopted.

==Women's sizes==
Women's sizes are divided into various types, depending on height. These charts give an indication of size only and are by no means exact as they vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, sometimes by a full inch up and down.

=== Overview ===
There are multiple size types, designed to fit somewhat different body shapes.  Variations include the height of the person's [[torso]] (known as ''back length''), whether the bust, waist, and hips are straighter (characteristic of teenagers) or curvier (like many adult women), and whether the bust is higher or lower (characteristic of younger and older women, respectively). These categories include:

;Misses sizes:  The most common size category.  For women of about average height (5'4") with an average bust height and an hourglass figure.  Dress sizes may be given as girth at the bust in inches (e.g., 36), but even-numbered sizes from 2 to 16 are more common.  Categorical sizes range from XS (extra-small) to XL (extra-large).
;Junior sizes: For short women with higher busts and fairly straight bodies.  Junior sizes are commonly given as odd-numbered sizes from 1 to 15, which correspond to the next number up in misses' sizes.
;Women's sizes '''or''' plus sizes:  For larger women of average height, sometimes with lower bust lines.  Like misses' sizes, the sizes may be given as a dress size based on the bust measurement, but they are usually given as even-numbered sizes from 18 up.  Categorical sizes usually range from 1X (similar to extra-large, but with slightly different proportions compared to the misses' size) up.
;Misses petite: For short women with average busts and more hourglass body shapes.  Sizes follow the misses' standard and are marked with a P, as in 10P.
;Junior petite: For very short women with average busts and fairly straight bodies.  Size may be denoted as "5JP" or as "5P".
;Women's petite:  For larger, shorter women, sometimes with lower bust lines.  Sizes are marked the same as women's with a P, as in 20P.
;Young junior: For short women with high busts and fairly straight bodies.
;Tall sizes:  For taller women (usually 5'8" or above), usually with a proportionately average bust height and an hourglass figure.  Sizes are usually written with the corresponding misses' size and a T to indicate tall, as in "10T".
;Half sizes: For short women with lower busts and more hourglass body shapes.  Sizes are written with a ½, as in "10½".

Please compare to your favorite fit charts. These measurements conflict with many other size charts. These charts are significantly smaller than many current US clothing companies.

With the average American woman's height (20 years and older) at about 63.8" or approximately 5'4" (162.1&amp;nbsp;cm) {{harv|Department of Health|2012}}, both standard and catalog size ranges attempt to address a variety of weights / builds as well as providing for the "shorter-than-average" height woman with "petite" and "half-sizes". However "taller-than-average" women may find their size-height addressed by manufacturers less frequently, and may often find themselves facing issues of slightly too short pant legs and sleeve cuffs, as well as waist lengths.

'''Vannes Cathedral''' ({{lang-fr|Cathédrale Saint-Pierre de Vannes}}) is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[church architecture|church]] dedicated to [[Saint Peter]] in [[Vannes]], [[Brittany]], [[France]]. The [[cathedral]] is the seat of the [[Bishop of Vannes]].

The present [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church was erected on the site of the former [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] cathedral. Its construction lasted from the 15th to the 19th centuries; if the length of the existence of the 13th century Romanesque [[bell tower]] is included, a total of seven centuries of construction.

The cathedral was declared a [[basilica minor]] by [[Pope Pius IX]] on 5 June 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cathedrale-vannes.fr/index.php/cathedrale-exterieur/3-exterieur/detail/2-cathe02exthd?tmpl=component#3 Vannes Cathedral website: basilica] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first building was erected around 1020 in Romanesque style. Built out of [[granite]] and continuously modified by adding new structures, the cathedral is an extremely composite building. The rebuilding in Gothic style dates mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries. In this period the [[nave]] and the ornate gateway at the northern end of the north transept &amp;ndash; whose twelve niches, according to Breton custom, were supposed to accommodate the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] &amp;ndash; were built high. The northern tower is the main remnant of the former Romanesque building, while the [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s and the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] were built between 1771 and 1774.

==Architecture==
[[File:VannesGroundPlan.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Floor plan|Ground plan]] of the cathedral itself.]]

===Dimensions===
The horizontal dimensions of the building can be derived from the [[floor plan|ground plan]]. (Data on the heights are not available for the moment). The building is one of the largest on the French Atlantic coast.

===Exterior===
The [[facade|façade]] was carved in 1857 in a neo-Gothic style. Outside, in front of the central pillar of the large gate, stands a statue of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monk [[Vincent Ferrer|St. Vincent Ferrer]], from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. His activities in the 15th century greatly influenced [[Christianity]] in Vannes. The northern façade opens onto the garden of the [[cloister]] (ruins from the 16th century) and the ''Rue des chanoines'' ("Street of the Canons") through the beautiful portal at the top of the north [[transept]], built in a [[Flamboyant]] late Gothic style (1514), and decorated with twelve niches designed to house statues of the twelve apostles. The cross, visible close to the northern façade, dates back to the 15th century and was brought from the [[cemetery]].

===Interior===

During the [[Middle Ages]], the floor of the cathedral had been covered by [[tombstone]]s. For hygienic reasons, only the tradition of burying the [[bishop]]s in their episcopal church has been preserved. However, some tombstones have been returned and can be seen today. The cathedral has only retained [[tomb]]s dating back to the 17th century. Two bishops' tombs can be found in the [[crypt]] under the choir.

The building contains the following features:
*''Chapel of the Ancient Baptismal Fonts'' (pos. 1 ground plan): this chapel is too small for actual [[baptism|baptizing]] to take place, but carries the spirit of baptism. The feeling is further enhanced by the [[stained glass]] window, displaying motifs of baptism.
*''St. Anne's Chapel'' (pos. 2): [[Saint Anne]] is the patron saint of Brittany. Here, as in [[Nantes Cathedral]], she enjoys special attention, especially with her statue. The stained glass window shows the [[pilgrimage]] of Saint [[Anne d'Auray]], other important events of her life, and one of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Blessed Virgin]].
*''Chapel of the Rosary of the Saints Hearts'' (pos. 3): the stained glass window is one of the first showing the Sacred Heart of [[Paray-le-Monial|Paray]]. It is related to the window above the choir.
*''Chapel of the Blessed Pierre René Roque'' (pos. 4): Blessed [[Pierre René Roque]] (1758-1796) [http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=375] was a [[priest]], born in Vannes, known for his strong devotion to religion. He was condemned to death and [[guillotine]]d for bringing [[Eucharist|communion]] to a dying man; he was beatified in 1934. He is buried under the altar.

[[File:Bretagne Morbihan Vannes8 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Chapel of St. Mériadec and St. Patern]]

*''St. Gwenaël's Chapel'', south entrance (pos. 5): [[Saint Gwenaël]][http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=3615] took part in the [[evangelism|evangelization]] of the [[List of Ancien Régime dioceses of France|West Diocese]] in the 6th century. In the stained glass window he is represented in the company of Blessed [[Françoise d'Amboise]], [[Peter II, Duke of Brittany|duchess of Brittany]] and the founder of the first [[convent]] of the [[Carmelites]] in Vannes.
*''The Liturgical Choir'': the three [[Davide Antonio Fossati|Fossati]] altars date back to the 18th century. The statues of [[Simon Peter|Saints Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are placed above the two small altars.
*''Our Lady of Lourdes' Chapel'', south [[transept]] (pos. 6): this is the place of the old door of the [[Dukes of Brittany]]. The stained glass window shows the [[First Communion]] of Françoise d'Amboise. Above the window is Saint Peter, to the left a painting of the ascent of [[Saint Petronilla]] [http://www.stpetschurch.org/patroness.htm] [http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1034] to Heaven. Before the [[French Revolution]], this was the site of the tomb of St. Gwenaël. To the right of the altar Mme. Francheville is buried, a local mystic.
*''Ambulatory'' (pos. 7): the [[ambulatory]] is very large to accommodate the [[pilgrim]]s  that used to pray at the tomb of St. Vincent Ferrer in the Middle Ages. A marble tablet indicates the affiliation of the cathedral to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. The cathedral in Vannes also carries the title of Basilica.
*''The Treasury'' (pos. 8): this room was constructed in about 1782 in a part of the Romanesque choir. The walls are covered with beautiful woodwork and panelling. The shelves contain books on [[theology]] and religious history. The most remarkable item is a box made of wood and covered with painted [[parchment]] of southern origin. It dates back to the 12th century and is decorated with scenes of daily life. Among the other notable objects of the treasury are a gold cross and two ivory sticks&lt;!--?candlesticks?--&gt;.
[[File:VannesStAnn.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Anne's Chapel in Vannes Cathedral (December 2006)]]
*''Portal of the Canons'', north transept (pos. 13): [[Vincent Ferrer|St. Vincent Ferrer]]'s tomb was located here until 1956. There is still a stained glass window depicting him. There are also two paintings, one by Gosse (1945) and one by Mauzaise (1831). The former shows the death of the saint and the latter depicts him preaching to [[infidel]]s. This is the place where baptism is currently celebrated.
*''Our Lady of Mercy Chapel'' (pos. 14): here there is a painting of the [[Virgin and child]] by Delaval (1836). There is also a stained glass window showing [[Ivo of Kermartin|Saint Yves]]. He enjoys a special position in all Breton churches, as a patron saint of the Breton [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]]s, and also as the main defender of the independence of the Breton churches against the royal power.
*''St. Vincent Ferrer's Chapel'' (pos. 15): this was formerly the chapel of the [[Holy Sacrament]], but since 1956 it has housed the [[relic]]s of Saint Vincent Ferrer, including his [[human skull|skull]].
*''St. Anthony's Chapel'', north entrance (pos. 16): here there is a painting by Vincent from 1830 depicting [[Jesus Christ]] on the Cross, [[John the Apostle|Saint John]], the Holy Virgin and Saint [[Mary Magdalene]].
*''Chapel of St. Mériadec and St. Patern'' (pos. 18): the stained glass window here represents [[Saint Meriadec]] [http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5092] and [[Saint Patern]], the first [[Bishop of Vannes]]. There are also paintings, one by Rivoulon from 1846, "Litanies of the Holy Virgin", and one by Destouches from 1819 of the [[Resurrection]] of Saint [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]].
*''Romanesque tower'' (pos. 19): this is the only structure left from the Romanesque cathedral. It accommodates the four bells of the church.

Positions 9, 10, 11, 13 and 17 are the Blessed Sacrament Chapel (closed to visitors), the Chapel of Our Lady ''de Pitié'', the Chapel in the [[apse]], the [[Calvary]] and the Chapel of St. Louis respectively.

==In literature==
In the novels of [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]], the [[musketeer]] [[Aramis]] appears at one point as Bishop of Vannes and logically must have served in this very cathedral.

==Burials==
*[[Isabella of Scotland, Duchess of Brittany]]
* St. [[Vincent Ferrer]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6832">'''''Vasilissa ergo gaude''''' ("''Therefore rejoice, [[basilissa|princess]]''") is an [[isorhythm]]ic [[motet]] by the [[Renaissance]] composer [[Guillaume Dufay]]. In terms of its subject matter, it is sometimes grouped together with ''[[Lamentatio sanctae matris ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae]]'', ''[[Apostolus gloriosus]]'' and ''[[Balsamus et munda cera]]'' which are generically called Dufay's ''Byzantine motets''.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Vardell Sandresky, "The Golden Section in Three Byzantine Motets of Dufay", ''Journal of Music Theory'', Vol. 25, No. 2 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 291&amp;ndash;306&lt;/ref&gt; Its composition was occasioned by the marriage on 21 January 1421 of [[Cleofa Malatesta]], daughter of Malatesta di Pandolfo, to [[Theodore II Palaiologos]] son of the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel II]] and [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] of the [[Despotate of Morea|Morea]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Allsen, "Intertextuality and Compositional Process in Two Cantilena Motets by Hugo de Lantins", ''The Journal of Musicology'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (Spring, 1993), p. 176, footnote 6&lt;/ref&gt; It has been surmised that the actual motet was composed in 1420 and is perhaps the earliest example of this choral form if not the earliest work attributed to Dufay.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Mayer Brown, "Guillaume Dufay and the Early Renaissance", ''Early Music'', Vol. 2, No. 4 (Oct., 1974), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier scholarship it was assumed that the motet's first performance had taken place on May 19, 1419 during the festivities prior to the marriage &lt;ref&gt;Johannes Wolf, "Der niederlandische Einfluss in der mehrstimmigen gemessenen Musik bis zum Jahre 1480. Eine bibliographische Skizze", ''Tijdschrift der Vereeniging voor Noord-Nederlands Muziekgeschiedenis'', D. 6de, 4de Stuk (1900), p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasilissa, ergo gaude,
Quia es digna omni laude,
Cleophe, clara gestis
A tuis de Malatestis,

Therefore rejoice, [[basilissa|princess]],
for you are worthy of all praise,
Cleofe, glorious from the deeds
of your [[House of Malatesta|Malatesta]] kin,
leading men in Italy,
great and noble,

More glorious from your husband,
for he is nobler than all;
he is [[Despot (court title)|Despot]] of the [[Rhomaioi]],
he whom all the world reveres;
he was [[Porphyrogenitos|born in the purple]],
sent by god from heaven

''Tenor''
Concupivit rex decorem tuum
Quoniam ipse est dominus tuus
&lt;/poem&gt;
|&lt;poem&gt;
''Tenor''
The king hath conceived desire for thy beauty,
for he is thy Lord.&lt;ref&gt;The translated text is based almost entirely on Leofranc Holford-Strevens, "Du Fay the Poet? Problems in the Texts of His Motets", ''Early Music History'', Vol. 16, (1997), pp. 102&amp;ndash;103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

The tenor line is taken from [[Psalm]] 45:11 (44:11 in the traditional Catholic numbering), whose theme is royal marriage. The verse chosen for the motet occurs in Catholic liturgy in the [[Gradual]] of various feasts of [[the Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gregorien.info/php/all-about-a-title.php?keyTitle=337&amp;lang=en&amp;template=gregorien-info Académie de Chant grégorien]&lt;/ref&gt; The motet is preserved in the contemporary music manuscript Codex Bologna, [[International museum and library of music]], MS Q15.
In terms of structure the composition has been compared with the mature work of [[Johannes Ciconia]], a Franco-Flemish composer also active in Italy. Of the four voices used, the two upper voices bearing the melody often imitate each other and move faster than the two lower voices. The [[Isorhythm|talea]] is repeated only once. An additional device independent from the motet's purely isorhythmic design is the canonic introit (a short [[Canon (music)|canon]] used as a prelude) appearing at the beginning of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Mayer Brown, "Guillaume Dufay and the Early Renaissance", ''Early Music'', Vol. 2, No. 4 (Oct., 1974), p. 222&amp;ndash;3&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even though numerological mysticism which is often encountered in the [[Ars Antiqua]] seems to have been of minor importance in musical composition from the 14th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acc.umu.se/~akadkor/early/IID.html Umeå Akademiska Kör] Early Vocal Music Map&lt;/ref&gt; there have been attempts to interpret the motet's texture and design from a symbolic-mystical viewpoint. Dufay is known to have utilised similar devices such as [[gematria]] (a system of number symbolism drawn from the Pythagorean corpus) in other nuptial compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Allan W. Atlas , "Gematria, Marriage Numbers, and Golden Sections in Dufay's 'Resvellies vous'",'' Acta Musicologica'', Vol. 59, Fasc. 2 (May &amp;ndash; August, 1987), pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The tenor line singing the [[Cantus firmus]] in ''Vasilissa ergo gaude'' consists of a total of 2x49 notes plus the two closing notes which add to a total of 100 notes. It has been suggested that this number implies the medieval symbolism for repentance which leads to absolute unity. It has further been proposed that the number 100 should be related to the total of 700 or else 7x100 notes of the remaining three voices, alluding thus to the sacred number 7. The sum total of notes in the motet is 800 and this has been interpreted as an allusion to the number 8. In medieval numerology, 8 signified eternity, understood in the context of Dufay's motet as eternal stability. 

All these numerical symbolisms must have had a particular significance in view of the politically motivated marriage between Cleofa Malatesta and Theodore Palaiologos. The marriage was arranged as part of a series of diplomatic gestures between Cleofa's uncle [[Pope Martin V]]  and the Byzantine emperor. It was hoped that it would facilitate reunification between the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Church (cf. [[Council of Florence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Review by Jaap van Benthem, Reviewed work: ''Dufay by David Fallows'', in ''Tijdschrift van de Vereniging voor Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis'', D. 33ste, Afl. 1ste/2de (1983), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;
