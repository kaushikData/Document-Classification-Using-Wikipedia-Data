'''''A Secret Institution''''', a 19th-century woman's [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] narrative, is the [[autobiography]] of [[Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop]]. Published in 1890 after she had regained her freedom, it details Lathrop's institutionalization at [[Utica Lunatic Asylum]] for voicing suspicions that someone was trying to poison her. Written novelistically, book reviews of the time suggested that it was poorly written and fell short of its object, while 21st-century reviewers praise the exposing of 19th-century mental institutions, which confined outspoken women.{{sfn|Jelinek|2004|p=113}}{{sfn|Belford, Clarke &amp; Company|1891|p=82-83}}

''A Secret Institution'' (New York: Bryant Publishing Co.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lathrop|first1=Clarissa Caldwell|title=A secret institution|url=https://archive.org/details/39002086348324.med.yale.edu?q=A+Secret+Institution|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|accessdate=11 September 2017|location=New York|date=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the external appearance of a novel, but was intended as a statement of facts concerning the way things were managed in the Utica Lunatic Asylum. The author, Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop, said that in 1880, at the instance of her mother and sister, she was confined in that establishment and remained there for two years, although she was confident of her sanity during that entire period. She was finally brought out on a [[writ]] of ''habeas corpus'' applied for by [[James Bailey Silkman]]. She stated that, like herself, he had been incarcerated at Utica asylum under a false charge of [[Lunatic|lunacy]], trumped up by relatives, and that on regaining his freedom, he published an announcement that he would "help any sane person out of an asylum who would communicate with him, giving his office address at New York City." After Lathrop found a way to notify Silkman, he applied for a writ, on which she was taken to [[Hudson River State Hospital]] at [[Poughkeepsie]], where her sanity was established and she was freed by Judge [[George G. Barnard]].{{sfn|Paulist Fathers|1891|p=133-34}}

==Criticism==
The ''[[Catholic World]]'' book review of 1891 commented that:{{sfn|Paulist Fathers|1891|p=133-34}} 
{{Quote|text=Lathrop described some horrible stories, which may or may not be true, concerning atrocities practised upon herself, and known by her to have been inflicted upon others equally helpless. Her narrative was written in a way which was strongly suggestive of long standing delusions in her own mind. We suppose that the temptation to put away from home such a person as she describes herself to have been, especially when it can be done at the expense of the general public, may now and then be overpoweringly strong in the case of relatives whose purses are not long and whose natural affections are not strong. Miss Clarissa, with her singular whims about a married lover, and her suspicions of being poisoned by his divorced wife, must have been a tolerably uncomfortable person to have about. But she was harmless, and that her delusions were such as to make her a proper denizen of a madhouse for an indefinite time at the public expense is palpably untrue. If every one of us who has "a bee in his bonnet" were to be locked up, how empty the streets would be! She says that county patients, such as she was, form by far the most reliable source of income for the institution, and that county commitments are apt to be "preferred for sane people who are to be confined in the Utica Asylum indefinitely. The advantage is this: What is called a 'pay patient' can be taken out of an asylum at any time his friends see fit to do so, whether in accordance with the doctor's permission or not, whereas a county patient is entirely at the mercy of the superintendent as to the length of time he may choose to detain him, as the county allows him to keep a patient two years, a privilege which a mercenary superintendent like Dr. Grey was able to appreciate and take care not to lose sight of, for the county is sure pay, and the greater the number of patients the larger the revenue to the asylum; and any relative or friend wishing to remove a wife, child, or ward, believing them to be wrongfully detained, must have recourse to a writ of habeas corpus, or be forced to give bonds for the safe-keeping of the patient before allowed to remove him from the superintendent's custody, a fact which often prevented patients from being removed when their friends were most anxious to do so, believing them perfectly cured, and detrimental to their interests to remain longer, and also desiring to protect the patient from cruelties to which they might be subjected."}}

The ''Belford's Magazine'' book review of 1891 commented that,{{sfn|Belford, Clarke &amp; Company|1891|p=82-83}}
{{Quote|text=... this book, although possibly written with the best intention, must, for various reasons, be taken ''cum grano'' ("with a grain of salt"). The authoress, who assumes to be a person of education, without giving us any evidence of the latter, assails in a very high-banded way one of the most important institutions in this State—the Insane Asylum at Utica—and takes its management to task upon issues which do not seem to be well-founded, although they purport to be based upon the personal experience of the writer.

Miss Lathrop, who is a native of Rochester, New York, and the daughter of Gen. Win. E. Lathrop, graduated at seventeen from some educational establishment, apparently without a name. Her ambition is to become a public teacher and a member of a Shakespeare Club. This ambition she gratifies, but, seemingly, with no flattering results. The soft pulp of her heart, however, being sensitive to the slightest touch of the finger of Cupid, she becomes doeply enamoured of a certain Mr. Zell, and is engaged to him; but, for some reason, the engagement is broken off, and she sees no more of her fickle swain, until she gets an accidental glimpse of him in a church, and subsequently, in the impenetrable disguise of a "face pitted by small-pox," after he had married and become a widower, and had, besides, divorced another wife—one Miss Hamlo, it was thought. Miss Lathrop and this latter person, having been thrown into boarding-house relations, our authoress began to entertain the idea that some one was attempting to poison her, and, becoming suspicious of Miss Hamlo, she began to retail those suspicions so widely and pertinaciously that all her friends and family set her down as of unsound mind, and commenced to speak of sending her to an asylum. Of their intention in this relation she had become thoroughly aware, and stood hourly in dread of its consummation. And it is just here where she unconsciously bears witness against herself, and in favor of the correctness of their impression; for when, without any adequate explanation, she was hurried into a carriage with two policemen, and was driven to the depot to take the train for Utica, she did not appear to have any idea of the seriousness of the situation, or to view with any suspicion the presence of the doctor who accompanied her on the cars. In addition, she did not seem to comprehend the significance of the great, long stone building into which she was ushered on their arrival at her destination, until she had already entered it.

Here, in view of what had been previously communicated to her, was positive evidence of her unsound state of mind. She did not appear to entertain any sense of her danger, although the probability of her being sent to some institution had been frequently indicated to her in the plainest possible manner. Besides, there seemed to be no motive whatever for her incarceration, beyond the one alleged. She was treated with consideration during her restraint; and all her friends and family, including her mother and sisters, concurred in the justness of the certificate of committal, signed by two responsible medical men. That her insanity was not demonstrative is no evidence that it did not exist. Frequently, seemingly unobtrusive monomaniacs are very cunning and troublesome, and of this she must have made Dr. Grey and the other medical attendants at the asylum thoroughly aware. As she was not a dangerous inmate, but, on the contrary, perfectly harmless, and in some measure sane, her release was to be expected, as the two-years' term of incarceration for such patients in the asylum was about to close. Her conduct subsequently, however, in writing to this Mr. Zell and clinging to him like a burr, when he evidently did not desire to continue his acquaintance with her, as well as other phases of her behavior, would seem to indicate that she was liberated too soon.

This book, which is very badly written, will fall far short of its object. Nor will its bald egotism, which was to be expected, pass unnoticed, especially where the authoress gives us to understand that her personal charms are most captivating.}}

'''Alcoholic ketoacidosis''' is a common reason for admission of alcohol dependent persons in hospitals emergency rooms. The term refers to a [[metabolic acidosis]] syndrome caused by increased [[ketone]] levels in [[Serum (blood)|serum]]. [[Glucose]] concentration is usually normal or a little lower.

In 1940, Drs Edward S. Dillon, W. Wallace, and Leon S. Smelo, first described alcoholic ketoacidosis as a distinct [[syndrome]]. They stated that "because of the many and complex factors, both [[Physiology|physiologic]] and [[Pathology|pathologic]], which influence the acid-base balance of the body, a  multitude of processes may bring about the state of acidosis as an end result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dillon|first1=E.|last2=Dyer|first2=W. Wallace|last3=Smelo|first3=L. S.|title=Ketone Acidosis in Nondiabetic Adults|journal=[[Medical Clinics of North America]]|date=November 1940|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1813–1822|doi=10.1016/S0025-7125(16)36653-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, David W. Jenkins and colleagues described cases of three non‐diabetic patients with a history of chronic heavy [[alcohol]] misuse and recurrent episodes of [[ketoacidosis]]. This group also proposed a possible underlying mechanism for this [[Metabolism|metabolic]] disturbance, naming it alcoholic ketoacidosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=David W.|last2=Eckel|first2=Robert E.|last3=Craig|first3=James W.|title=Alcoholic Ketoacidosis|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=12 July 1971|volume=217|issue=2|pages=177|doi=10.1001/jama.1971.03190020037007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients regularly report [[nausea]], vomiting, and pain in abdomen which are the most commonly observed complaints. This syndrome is rapidly reversible and, if taken care of has a low mortality. Other patients present [[tachypnoea]], [[tachycardia]], and [[hypotension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wrenn|first1=KD|last2=Slovis|first2=CM|last3=Minion|first3=GE|last4=Rutkowski|first4=R|title=The syndrome of alcoholic ketoacidosis.|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=August 1991|volume=91|issue=2|pages=119–28|pmid=1867237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main differences between patients with diabetic ketoacidosis is that patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis are usually alert and lucid despite the severity of the acidosis and marked ketonaemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGuire|first1=L C|title=Alcoholic ketoacidosis|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|date=1 June 2006|volume=23|issue=6|pages=417–420|doi=10.1136/emj.2004.017590|pmc=2564331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are cases where alcoholic ketoacidosis can cause death of the patient if not treated with administration of [[dextrose]] and saline solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brutsaert|first1=Erika F.|title=Alcoholic Ketoacidosis|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/diabetes-mellitus-dm-and-disorders-of-blood-sugar-metabolism/alcoholic-ketoacidosis|website=Merck Manual|publisher=Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp.|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arizona cap canal.jpg|thumb|The [[Central Arizona Project]] allows passage of water from the [[Colorado River]] to central and southern Arizona. At {{convert|336|mi|km}}, it is the largest aqueduct ever constructed in the United States.]]
An '''aqueduct''' is a watercourse constructed to carry water from a source to a distribution point far away. In modern engineering, the term aqueduct is used for any system of pipes, ditches, canals, tunnels, and other structures used for this purpose.&lt;ref name= "Brit"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |contribution= Aqueduct |title= Britannica |edition= CD |year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term aqueduct also often refers specifically to a [[aqueduct (bridge)|bridge]] on an artificial watercourse.&lt;ref name= "Brit" /&gt; The word is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''{{lang |la|aqua}}'' ("water") and ''{{lang|la|ducere}}'' ("to lead").&lt;ref name= "Brit" /&gt; Aqueducts were used in [[ancient Greece]], [[ancient Egypt]], and [[ancient Rome]]. In modern times, the largest aqueducts of all have been built in the United States to supply the country's biggest cities. The simplest aqueducts are small [[ditch]]es cut into the earth. Much larger channels may be used in modern aqueducts. Aqueducts sometimes run for some or all of their path through tunnels constructed underground. Modern aqueducts may also use pipelines. Historically, agricultural societies have constructed aqueducts to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and supply large cities with drinking water.

==Ancient aqueducts==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Although particularly associated with the [[ancient Rome|Romans]], aqueducts were devised much earlier in Greece and the [[Near East]] and [[Indian subcontinent]], where peoples such as the [[ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]] built sophisticated [[irrigation]] systems. Roman-style aqueducts were used as early as the 7th century BC, when the [[Assyria]]ns built an 80&amp;nbsp;km long limestone aqueduct, which included a 10 m high section to cross a 300 m wide valley, to carry water to their capital city, [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip24.pdf |first1= Thorkild |last1= Jacobsen |first2= Seton |last2= Lloyd |title= Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan |id= Oriental Institute Publication 24 |publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]] |year= 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[File:Hampi aqueduct.JPG|thumb|Ancient Indian aqueduct in [[Hampi]]]]
The Indian subcontinent is believed to have some of the earliest aqueducts. Evidence can be found at the sites of present-day [[Hampi, Karnataka]]. The massive aqueducts near river Tungabhadra supplying irrigation water were once {{convert |15|mi|km}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_kc3LKI_slEC |title= A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India |format= Google Books|isbn= 9788120601253 |author1= Sewell |first1= Robert |year= 1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The waterways supplied water to royal bath tubs.

===Oman===
{{Main|Falaj}}
In [[Oman]] from the [[Iron Age]], in Salut, Bat, and other sites, a system of underground aqueducts called [[falaj]] or qanāts were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently sloping horizontal tunnels.

There are three types of falaj:
*Daudi (داوودية) with underground aqueducts
*Ghaili (الغيلية ) requiring a dam to collect the water
*Aini (العينية ) whose source is a water spring

These enabled large scale agriculture to flourish in a dry land environment.

===Persia===
{{Main|Qanat}}
In [[Iran|Persia]] from early times {{Vague|Starting when? Finishing when?|date=December 2008}} a system of underground aqueducts called [[qanāt]]s were constructed, a series of well-like vertical shafts, connected by gently sloping tunnels. This technique:
*taps into subterranean water in a manner that delivers water to the surface without need for pumping. The water drains relying on gravity, with the destination lower than the source, which is typically an upland aquifer.
*allows water to be transported long distances in hot dry climates without losing a large proportion of the source water to seepage and evaporation.

===Petra, Jordan===
[[File:PetraAqueduct.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] aqueduct in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]]]]
Throughout [[Petra]], [[Jordan]], the [[Nabataean]] engineers took advantage of every natural spring and every winter downpour to channel water where it was needed. They constructed aqueducts and piping systems that allowed water to flow across mountains, through gorges and into the temples, homes, and gardens of Petra's citizens. Walking through the [[Siq]], one can easily spot the remains of channels that directed water to the city center, as well as durable retention dams that kept powerful flood waters at bay.

===Greece===
On the island of [[Samos]], the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]] was built during the reign of [[Polycrates]] (538-522 BC). It is considered an underground aqueduct and brought fresh water to [[Pythagoreion]] for roughly a thousand years.

===Roman===
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|right|The multiple arches of the [[Pont du Gard]], in [[Roman Gaul]]. Its lower tiers carry a road across the river, and the upper tiers support an aqueduct conduit that carried water to [[Nimes]]]]
{{Main |Roman aqueduct}}
Roman aqueducts were built in all parts of the [[Roman Empire]], from Germany to Africa, and especially in the city of Rome, where they totaled over {{convert|415|km|mi}}. The aqueducts supplied fresh water to public baths and for drinking water, in large cities across the empire, and set a standard of engineering that was not surpassed for more than a thousand years. Bridges, built in stone with multiple arches, were a distinctive feature of Roman aqueducts and hence the term ''aqueduct'' is often applied specifically to a [[Aqueduct (bridge)|bridge for carrying water]].&lt;ref name= "Brit" /&gt;

===South America===
[[File:Acueductos subterráneos de Cantalloc, Nazca, Perú, 2015-07-29, DD 01.JPG|thumbnail|[[Cantalloc Aqueducts|Underground aqueducts of Cantalloc]], Nazca, Peru]]
Near the [[Peru]]vian town of Nazca, an ancient pre-Columbian system of aqueducts called [[Puquios]] were built and are still in use today. They were made of intricately placed stones, a construction material widely used by the Nazca culture. The time period in which they were constructed is still debated, but some evidence supports circa A.D. 540–552, in response to [[drought]] periods in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~proulx/online_pubs/Zurich_Puquios_revised_small.pdf |publisher= U Mass |format= PDF |title= Zurich Puquios revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Guayabo National Monument]] of Costa Rica, a park covering the largest archaeological site in the country, contains a system of aqueducts. The complex network of uncovered and covered aqueducts still functions well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=Beatrice|title=The New Key to Costa Rica|date=2009|publisher=Ulysses Press|isbn=9781569756966|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qHrEKXpPXEsC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=costa+rica+ancient+aqueducts#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aqueducts are constructed from rounded river stones, which are mostly made of [[volcanic rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alvarado|first1=Guillermo E.|last2=Soto|first2=Gerardo J.|title=Volcanoes in the pre-Columbian life, legend, and archaeology of Costa Rica (Central America)|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=1 October 2008|volume=176|issue=3|pages=356–362|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027308001868|accessdate=22 October 2014|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2008.01.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; The civilization that constructed the aqueduct system remains a mystery to archaeologists; it is suspected that Guayabo's aqueducts sat at a point of ancient cultural confluence between Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas.

===North America===
When Europeans saw the [[Aztec]] capital [[Tenochtitlán]], early in the 16th century, the city was watered by two aqueducts. One of these, [[Chapultepec Aqueduct]], built circa 1420, was rebuilt by the Spanish almost three hundred years later. Originally tracing part of its path over now-gone [[Lake Texcoco]], only a fragment remains in [[Mexico City]] today.

===Sri Lanka===
Extensive usage of elaborate aqueducts have been found to have been used in ancient [[Sri Lanka]].The best example is the Yoda Ela or Jaya Ganga, an {{convert|87|km|mi}} long water canal carrying excess water between two artificial reservoirs with a [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] of 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;cm per kilometer during the fifth century AD. However, the ancient engineering methods in calculating the exact elevation between the two reservoirs and the exact gradient of the canal to such fine precision had been lost with the fall of the civilization in 13th Century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srilanka.travel/yoda-ela&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern aqueducts==
{{globalize/US|date=July 2012}}
In modern times, the largest aqueducts of all have been built in the United States to supply the country's biggest cities. The [[Catskill Aqueduct]] carries water to New York City over a distance of 120 miles (190&amp;nbsp;km), but is dwarfed by aqueducts in the [[Western United States|far west]] of the country, most notably the [[Colorado River Aqueduct]], which supplies the Los Angeles area with water from the [[Colorado River]] nearly 400&amp;nbsp;km to the east and the 701.5&amp;nbsp;mi (1,129&amp;nbsp;km) [[California Aqueduct]], which runs from the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]] to [[Lake Perris]]. The [[Central Arizona Project]] is the largest and most expensive aqueduct constructed in the United States. It stretches 336 miles from its source near [[Parker, Arizona]] to the metropolitan areas of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. An aqueduct in New Zealand, "the Oamaru Borough Race" was constructed in the late 19th century to deliver water (and water-power) about 50&amp;nbsp;km from the Waitaki River at Kurow to the coastal town of [[Oamaru]].

In Spain, the [[Tagus-Segura Water Transfer]] system of aqueducts opened in 1979 and transports water {{convert|286|km}} from north to south.&lt;ref name="claver-20151027"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/10/13/opinion/1444756539_080642.html|title=El río que nos une|work=El Pais|format=Opinion|first=José Manuel|last=Claver|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the [[South–North Water Transfer Project]] aims to connect the [[Yangtze]] River basin to Beijing through three separate systems. The project will reuse part of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal of China]].

==Design==

===Open channels===
The simplest aqueducts are small [[ditch]]es cut into the earth. Much larger channels may be used in modern aqueducts, for instance the [[Central Arizona Project]] uses {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} wide channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=Central%20Arizona%20Project&amp;pageType=ProjectDataPage | title=Request Rejected}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major factor in the design of all open channels is its gradient. A higher gradient allows a smaller channel to carry the same amount of water as a larger channel with a lower gradient, but increases the potential of the water to damage the aqueduct's structure. A typical Roman aqueduct had a gradient of about 1:4800.&lt;ref&gt;Mays, L. (Editor), ''Ancient Water Technologies'', Springer, 2010. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

====Artificial rills====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}

[[File:Freiburg Baechle Rills.jpg|thumb|Artificial Rills, known locally as [[Freiburg Bächle]], run through the old-town district of the German city of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]].]]

[[File:Falaj at al ain.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|right|225px|An artificial '''rill''', part of the ''Falaj'' [[water transportation]] system, at [[Al Ain]] [[Oasis]], in the [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi Emirate]].]]A constructed functional '''rill''' is a small [[canal]] or [[:aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] of [[stone]], [[brick]], [[concrete]], or other lining material; usually [[wikt:rectilinear|rectilinear]] in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]; for [[water transportation]] from a source such as a [[river]]-[[stream|creek]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]], [[reservoir]], [[qanat]], or aqueduct; for [[Domestic market|domestic]] consumption or [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[irrigation]] of [[Arable land|crop land]] uses.

Rills were traditionally used in [[Middle East]]ern and [[Mediterranean climate]] cultures of ancient and historical eras; and other climates and continents worldwide. They are distinguished from a 'water [[ditch]]' by being lined to reduce absorption losses and to increase durability. The ''Falaj'' irrigation system at the [[Al Ain]] [[Oasis]], in present-day [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi Emirate]], uses rills as part of its [[qanat]] water system. Sometimes in the [[Spanish language]] they are called ''[[Acequia]]s''.

Rills are also used for aesthetic purposes in landscape design. Rills are used as narrow channels of water inset into the pavement of a [[garden]], as linear [[water feature]]s, and often [[tile]]d and part of a [[fountain]] design.

The historical origins are from [[paradise garden]] religious images that first translated into ancient [[Persian Gardens]]. Rills were later exceptionally developed in the [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] [[Spanish garden|(Spanish) Gardens]] of [[Al-andalus]], such as at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]]; and also in other [[Islam]]ic gardens, cultures, and countries. Early 20th century examples are in the [[Plaza de España (Seville)|Maria Louisa Park]] gardens in [[Seville]], [[Spain]]; and at the [[Casa del Herrero]] gardens in [[Montecito, California]].

===Underground tunnels===
Aqueducts sometimes run for some or all of their path through tunnels constructed underground. A version of this common in North Africa and Central Asia that has vertical wells at regular intervals is called a [[qanat]]. One historic example found in Syria, the Qanat Firaun, extends over 100 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/rome-s-tremendous-tunnel-the-ancient-world-s-longest-underground-aqueduct-a-612718.html | title=Rome's Tremendous Tunnel: The Ancient World's Longest Underground Aqueduct| newspaper=Spiegel Online| date=2009-03-11| last1=Schulz| first1=Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pipes===
[[File:LA Aqueduct Antelope Valley.jpg|thumb|The [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]]]]
{{see also|Pipeline transport#Water}}
Modern aqueducts may also make extensive use of pipelines. Pipelines are useful for transporting water over long distances when it needs to move over hills, or where open channels are poor choices due to considerations of [[evaporation]], freezing, [[pollution]], or environmental impact. They can also be used to carry [[Water treatment|treated water]].

==Uses==
Historically, agricultural societies have constructed aqueducts to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops. [[Archimedes]] invented the [[Archimedes' screw|water screw]] to raise water for use in irrigation of croplands.

Another use for aqueducts is to supply large cities with drinking water. It also help drought prone areas with water supplies. Some of the Roman aqueducts still supply water to Rome today. In [[California]], United States, three large aqueducts supply water over hundreds of miles to the Los Angeles area. Two are from the [[Owens River]] area, and a third is from the Colorado River.

In modern [[civil engineering]] projects, detailed study and analysis of [[open-channel flow]] is commonly required to support flood control, irrigation systems, and large water supply systems when an aqueduct rather than a pipeline is the preferred solution.

In the past, aqueducts often had channels made of earth or other porous materials but significant amounts of water are lost through such unlined aqueducts. As water gets increasingly scarce, these canals are being lined with [[concrete]], [[polymer]]s, or impermeable soil. In some cases, a new aqueduct is built alongside the old one because it cannot be shut down during construction.

[[Laser ablation|Laser Ablation]] works by heating up a substance enough to allow gaseous material to eject, either through [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] (solid to gas) or [[vaporization]] (liquid to gas). For most asteroids this process occurs between temperatures in the range of 2700-3000 Kelvin. The ejecting material creates a [[thrust]], which over an extended period of time can change the [[trajectory]] of the asteroid.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PDC-2015-Lubin-e.pdf|title = Effective Planetary Defense using Directed Energy|last = Lubin|first = Philip|date = April 2015|journal = 4th IAA Planetary Defense Conference|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a proof of concept on a small scale, Travis Brashears, a researcher at UC Santa Barbara's Experimental Cosmology Lab, led by Dr. Philip Lubin, has already experimentally verified that laser ablation can de-spin and spin-up an asteroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = De-Spinning and Spinning Up Disc-like Asteroid|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=54&amp;v=YscEPdnvuC8|date = 2015-07-31|accessdate = 2016-01-29|last = UCSB Experimental Cosmology Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further testing and development of this method are being done by groups at [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[NASA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Impact Imperative: Laser Ablation for Deflecting Asteroids, Meteoroids, and Comets from Impacting the Earth|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/proceeding/aipcp/10.1063/1.1582138|publisher = AIP Publishing|journal = AIP Conference Proceedings|date = 2003-05-14|pages = 509–522|volume = 664|doi = 10.1063/1.1582138|first = Jonathan W.|last = Campbell|first2 = Claude|last2 = Phipps|first3 = Larry|last3 = Smalley|first4 = James|last4 = Reilly|first5 = Dona|last5 = Boccio}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the  [[University of Strathclyde]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260097641_On_Testing_Laser_Ablation_Processes_for_Asteroid_Deflection|title = On Testing Laser Ablation Processes for Asteroid Deflection|last = Gibbings|first = Alison|date = May 9, 2011|journal = 2011 IAA Planetary Defense Conference|doi = |pmid = |access-date = February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Necessity for asteroid deflection  ==
Modern humans, or [[Homo sapiens]], have existed for approximately 200,000 years. By comparison, the [[dinosaur]]s survived on Earth for over 100 million years before the  [[Chicxulub impactor|Chixculub asteroid]] wiped them out. Despite the advancements in technology made by humans over the past hundred years there are still no viable defense mechanisms against an asteroid impact. Asteroids could still potentially pose a serious threat to every major city on earth and even to our whole species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars - Wait But Why|url = http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html|website = waitbutwhy.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chelyabinsk meteor ===
February, 2013, the [[Chelyabinsk meteor|Chelyabinsk Meteor]] exploded at a height of 30 kilometers over western Russia. The meteor, which weighed around 15 million pounds, was estimated to be traveling 40,000 miles per hour and entered Earth's atmosphere at an angle of 20 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Russian meteor, a 'death rock from space,' stars on 'Nova'|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/27/science/la-sci-sn-russian-meteor-chelyabinsk-nova-20130327|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 2013-03-27|access-date = 2016-02-01|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = Karen|last = Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion was between 20-30 times stronger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima; the resulting shock wave broke windows on the ground and injured around 1,500 people. Due to the meteor's relatively shallow angle it exploded high in Earth atmosphere. However, had the meteor reached Earth's surface or exploded lower in the atmosphere the results could have been catastrophic.

=== Detection ===
Despite NASA's efforts to detect [[Near-Earth object|Near Earth Objects]] (NEO's), the Chelyabinsk Meteor went undetected. In recent years, [[NASA]], in partnership with the [[European Space Agency]], have been increasing their efforts to track all NEO's with the potential to cross Earth's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASA Office to Coordinate Asteroid Detection, Hazard Mitigation|url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4816|website = NASA/JPL|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their website, NASA has a public list of all known NEO's which present a potential impact risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Current Impact Risks |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/ |website=neo.jpl.nasa.gov |access-date=2016-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231154154/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/ |archivedate=December 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the list remains incomplete and the question of what to do in the event of an imminent impact remains unanswered.

=== Politics of deflection ===
{{disputed|date=May 2016}}
Laser Ablation is a promising method because it allows an asteroid to be redirected without breaking the asteroid into smaller pieces, each of which may pose its own threat to Earth. The [[Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle|nuclear impactor]] is another proposed method for deflecting asteroids, but is less promising than laser ablation for both political and technical reasons:  
* Blowing up an asteroid could create multiple smaller asteroid fragments, which could each be as destructive as the larger asteroid.{{dubious|date=May 2016}}  
* Detonating an atomic bomb high up in Earth's atmosphere could produce unforeseen repercussions.{{dubious|date=May 2016}}   
* The [[Outer Space Treaty]] is a cold war treaty signed in 1967 which prohibits weapons{{relevence|date=May 2016}} of mass destruction from being placed in space. It effectively{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} blocks any research group from experimentally verifying the nuclear impactor method.{{dubious|date=May 2016}}   
Laser ablation is already being experimentally tested in labs as a method for asteroid deflection and there are plans to begin testing on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), and in [[Low Earth orbit|low earth orbit]].

=== Asteroid impact avoidance ===
{{Main|Asteroid impact avoidance}}
Short acting laser ablation is used, to verify and explore, the effectiveness of the powerful [[soft x-ray|thermal X-ray]] pulse that would be emitted upon the detonation of an asteroid stand-off nuclear explosive device. Investigations to this end were conducted in 2015 by exposing common [[meteorite]] fragments to tuned laser pulses, provided by [[Sandia National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2015/march/15-how-to-stop-a-killer-asteroid How to Stop a Killer Asteroid When a civilization-ending space rock bears down on us, this nuclear option might just save our species. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In operation ==
# A laser array is focused on the target asteroid.
# The laser heats the surface of the asteroid to extremely high temperatures (2700-3000 Kelvin).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PDC-2015-Lubin-e.pdf|title = Effective Planetary Defense using Directed Energy|last = Lubin|first = Philip|date = April 2015|journal = 4th IAA Planetary Defense Conference|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Material on the surface of the asteroid begins to [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] (the rock and/or metal transitions from solid to gas) and ejects away from the asteroid. 
# [[Newton's Third Law|Newton's third law]] states that for any action there is an equal and opposite reaction. As the material becomes a gas it is pushed away from the asteroid and by Newton's third law, it also pushes back on the asteroid with an equal force, called a [[thrust]]. 
# [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's second law]] states that force is equal to mass times acceleration, or F=ma. Although the thrust on the asteroid is tiny in comparison to the asteroid's mass, by Newton's second law there will still be some small acceleration. 
# Over time the small acceleration on the asteroid significantly alters its [[trajectory]]. Once the asteroid is no longer on course to collide with Earth the laser can be removed.  
# Deflecting an asteroid using laser ablation will likely take between 1 and 10 years, depending on a number of [[#Important Factors|factors]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Proposed systems ==
There are two types of proposed asteroid laser ablation systems, a stand-on system and a stand-off system. The main difference is the size and position of the laser array used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Planteary-Defense-SPIE-Aug-2013-Lubin-8876-101-final.pdf|title = Directed Energy Planetary Defense|last = Lubin|first = Philip|date = August 2013|journal = SPIE Optics + Photonics, San Diego|doi = |pmid = |access-date = February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stand-on system ===
A stand-on system consists of a small laser array which is sent to the target asteroid. The system would be limited to small or medium size asteroids and would require detection relatively far in advance. For a short notice threat a stand-on system would be ineffective, due to the time required to build and send the system to the target. Additionally, a new system would be required for each target. In the short term a stand-on system could be affordable and feasible; however, in the long term a larger system able to deflect asteroids of all sizes is more practical.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Stand-off system ===
A stand-off system is a large laser array which would orbit the Earth or possibly the moon. It would range from approximately the size of the ISS to around 10 times larger. The system would be able to deflect even the largest asteroids, which can be hundreds of kilometers across,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Asteroids – Facts and Information about Asteroids|url = http://www.space.com/51-asteroids-formation-discovery-and-exploration.html|website = Space.com|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also ideally be able to target multiple asteroids at once if necessary. Although this system would be the most effective against a wide variety of threats, its size, and consequentially its cost, make it an unrealistic option for the near future. The implementation of this type of system would likely require the cooperation and collaboration of multiple governments and agencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Important factors ==
There are many factors which contribute to the effectiveness of an asteroid laser ablation system. Researchers have been looking at the strength of the [[laser]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as, the shape and [[Asteroid spectral types|composition of the target asteroid]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as two of the most important factors.

=== Laser strength ===
A stronger laser can create a greater thrust on an asteroid. Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have experimentally simulated the time it would take to redirect a moderately sized asteroid using different strength lasers. The strongest lasers tested could hypothetically require under a year to redirect an asteroid a safe distance from the Earth, while the weakest lasers could take up to 10 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  
* The advantage of a weak laser is that requires less energy to power and, as a result, costs less than a higher powered laser.  
* The benefit of a strong laser is that it doesn't depend upon our ability to predict impacts years in advance. Asteroids are difficult to track and impacts are even more difficult to predict; a strong laser ensures greater protection. 
Choosing the optimal laser strength is a question of balancing the cost, energy use, and desired level of protection.

=== Power source===
Typically such systems require substantial amounts of power.  For space-based systems, this might require either some form of nuclear power, or power from a [[Space-based solar power|Space-Based Solar Power]] satellite.  Many proponents of [[Space-based solar power|Space-Based Solar Power]] imagine one of the benefits of such an infrastructure includes the ability to divert asteroids and comets are alter their trajectory for exploitation via [[asteroid mining]], as well as for [[laser-sail]] based [[Interstellar travel|interstellar propulsion]].

=== Asteroid composition ===
Asteroids vary greatly in their composition and shape. An asteroid's composition can range from entirely metallic, to entirely rocky, to a mix of rock and metals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The composition must be taken into account since each material behaves differently when ablated. Initial trials at the University of Strathclyde have shown that laser ablation could be more effective on dense metallic asteroids, because of the shape made by the ejecting material.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Asteroid shape ===
In simulations asteroids have been assumed to be spherical; however, in reality most asteroids are irregularly shaped. One of the next steps for research on laser ablation is simulating how a thrust may affect the trajectory of irregularly shaped asteroids.

The '''Bandim Health Project''' works with population based health research in one of the world's poorest countries, [[Guinea-Bissau]] in West Africa.

The core of the project is a health and [[Demography|demographic surveillance]] system which registers more than 100,000 people in six suburbs of the capital [[Bissau]]. Furthermore, 182 representative clusters of 100 women and their children are followed in the rural areas. Information on health, diseases, immunisations, breast-feeding, etc. is collected, primarily focusing on women and children. Admissions to the country's sole [[Pediatrics|pediatric ward]] in the capital are recorded.

The Bandim Health Project is member of the INDEPTH Network of health and demographic surveillance sites in Africa, Asia and Oceania.

==History==
The Bandim Health Project was initiated in 1978 by Peter Aaby. The project is currently based on collaboration between the [[Ministry of Health]] in Guinea-Bissau, [[Statens Serum Institut]] in Denmark, and researchers affiliated to The [[University of Southern Denmark]], as well as the [[University of Aarhus]], Denmark.

In 2012, the Danish National Research Foundation funded the establishment of the Center of Excellence, The Research Center for Vitamins and Vaccines (CVIVA) based on the Bandim Health Project and its research into [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects of vaccines]].

==Fields of research==
The Bandim Health Project works with population based health research, focusing on women and children. The project's fields of research include:
* '''[[Vaccine]]s''', both their specific effects on the targeted diseases, and in particular their potential [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects]] on [[incidence (epidemiology)|morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]].
* '''Other [[health intervention]]s''', including assessment of the total impact on mortality of new interventions or changes in existing policies.
* '''[[Infectious disease]]s''', e.g. [[measles]], [[diarrhoea]], [[rotavirus]], [[respiratory infection]]s, [[malaria]], HIV, [[HTLV]], and [[Tuberculosis]].
* '''Nutrition''', including [[micronutrient]]s such as [[vitamin A]] supplementation, and [[breast-feeding]].
* '''[[Humanitarian aid]].

==Important results==
One of the most important findings was that a new [[measles vaccine]] used in [[Developing country|low-income countries]] was associated with a two-fold increase in mortality among girls. This discovery led to the withdrawal of the vaccine.&lt;ref name=WHO92&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Expanded programme on immunization (EPI). Safety of high titre measles vaccines.|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|volume=67|pages=1992|pmid=1449986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had it not been withdrawn, it could have cost at least ½ million additional female deaths per year in Africa alone.&lt;ref&gt;Aaby, P., et al. "Differences in female-male mortality after high-titre measles vaccine and association with subsequent vaccination with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and inactivated poliovirus: reanalysis of West African studies." Lancet 361.9376 (2003): 2183–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaby, P. "Being wrong in the right direction?" Lancet 364.9438 (2004): 984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The organization==
The Bandim Health Project is led by Peter Aaby. The National Research Coordinator is Amabelia Rodrigues. Since the project's foundation in 1978, more than 700 [[scientific article]]s have been published, and more than 40 PhD or [[doctoral degree]]s and 13 [[Master's degree|Masters]] of International Health degrees have been obtained by researchers employed by the project.

===Affiliations===
Bandim Health Project is placed in Guinea-Bissau and also has a small department at [[Statens Serum Institut]] in Denmark. Bandim Health Project is also affiliated with [[University of Southern Denmark]], where Peter Aaby is an [[adjunct professor]] and Christine Benn holds a professorship in Global Health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21137">A '''blind''' or '''blinded'''-'''experiment''' is an [[experiment]] in which information about the test is masked (kept) from the participant, to reduce or eliminate bias, until after a trial outcome is known.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It is understood that [[bias]] may be intentional or subconscious, thus no dishonesty is implied by blinding. If both tester and subject are blinded, the trial is called a '''double-blind''' experiment.

Blind testing is used wherever items are to be compared without influences from testers' preferences or expectations, for example in [[clinical trials]] to evaluate the effectiveness of medicinal drugs and procedures without [[placebo]] effect, [[observer bias]], or conscious deception; and comparative testing of commercial products to objectively assess user preferences without being influenced by branding and other properties not being tested.

Blinding can be imposed on researchers, technicians, or subjects.  The opposite of a blind trial is an [[open-label trial|open trial]]. Blind experiments are an important tool of the [[scientific method]], in many fields of research—[[medicine]], [[psychology]] and the [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]] such as [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[applied science]]s such as [[market research]], and many others. In some disciplines, such as medicinal drug testing, blind experiments are considered essential.

In some cases, while blind experiments would be useful, they are impractical or unethical; an example is in the field of [[developmental psychology]]: although it would be informative to raise children under arbitrary experimental conditions, such as on a remote island with a fabricated enculturation, it is a violation of [[ethics]] and human rights.

The terms '''blind''' ([[adjective]]) or '''to blind''' ([[transitive verb]]) when used in this sense are figurative extensions of the literal idea of [[blindfold]]ing someone. The terms '''masked''' or '''to mask''' may be used for the same concept; this is commonly the case in [[ophthalmology]], where the word 'blind' is often used in the literal sense.

Some{{who|date=March 2018}}{{or inline|date=September 2018}} argue that the use of the term "blind" for academic review or experiments is offensive and prefer the alternative term "masked" or "anonymous".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Double-blind study - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095728138|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320061110/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095728138|archivedate=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fnjICgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78|title=Blinding as a Solution to Bias: Strengthening Biomedical Science, Forensic Science, and Law|last=Robertson|first=Christopher T.|last2=Kesselheim|first2=Aaron S.|date=2016-01-30|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780128026335|location=|pages=78|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[French Academy of Sciences]] originated the first recorded blind experiments in 1784: the Academy set up a commission to investigate the claims of [[animal magnetism]] proposed by [[Franz Mesmer]]. Headed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the commission carried out experiments asking [[mesmerism|mesmerists]] to identify objects that had previously been filled with "vital fluid", including trees and flasks of water. The subjects were unable to do so. The commission went on to examine claims involving the curing of "mesmerized" patients. These patients showed signs of improved health, but the commission attributed this to the fact that these patients believed they would get better—the first scientific suggestion of the now well-known [[placebo]] effect.&lt;ref name=Holmes2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Richard|title=The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science|year=2009}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1799, the British chemist [[Humphry Davy]] performed another early blind experiment. In studying the effects of [[nitrous oxide]] (laughing gas) on human physiology, Davy deliberately did not tell his subjects what concentration of the gas they were breathing, or whether they were breathing ordinary air.&lt;ref name=Holmes2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmaclinicalresearch.com/|title=pharmaclinicalresearch.com|author=|date=|website=www.pharmaclinicalresearch.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320202349/http://pharmaclinicalresearch.com/|archivedate=20 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blind experiments went on to be used outside of purely scientific settings. In 1817, a committee of scientists and musicians compared a [[Stradivarius]] violin to one with a guitar-like design made by the naval engineer François Chanot. A well-known violinist played each instrument while the committee listened in the next room to avoid prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Fétis|first=François-Joseph|year=1868|title=Biographie Universelle des Musiciens et Bibliographie Générale de la Musique, Tome 1|place=Paris|publisher=Firmin Didot Frères, Fils, et Cie|edition=Second|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEMQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA249|accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubourg|first=George|year=1852|title=The Violin: Some Account of That Leading Instrument and its Most Eminent Professors...|edition=Fourth|place=London|publisher=Robert Cocks and Co|pages=356–357|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybY3AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA356|accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first essays advocating a blinded approach to experiments in general came from [[Claude Bernard]] in the latter half of the 19th century, who recommended splitting any scientific experiment between the theorist who conceives the experiment and a naive (and preferably uneducated) observer who registers the results without foreknowledge of the theory or hypothesis being tested. This suggestion contrasted starkly with the prevalent [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist.&lt;ref&gt;

Double-blind methods came into especial prominence in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Alder|first=Ken|title=A Companion to Western Historical Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpPWwBS1C60C|year=2006|quote=Shortly after the start of the Cold War [...] double-blind reviews became the norm for conducting scientific medical research, as well as the means by which peers evaluated scholarship, both in science and in history.|author-link=|series=Blackwell Companions to History|work=The History of Science, Or, an Oxymoronic Theory of Relativistic Objectivity|page=307|contribution=|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|editor-last=Kramer|editor2-last=Maza|editor-first=Lloyd S.|editor2-first=Sarah C.|isbn=978-1-4051-4961-7|accessdate=2012-02-11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single-blind trials==
'''Single-blind''' describes [[experiment]]s where information that could introduce bias or otherwise skew the result is withheld from the participants, but the experimenter will be in full possession of the facts.

In a single-blind experiment, the individual subjects do not know whether they are so-called "test" subjects or members of an "[[randomized controlled trial|experimental control]]" group. Single-blind experimental design is used where the experimenters either must know the full facts (for example, when comparing sham to real surgery) and so the experimenters cannot themselves be blind, or where the experimenters will not introduce further bias and so the experimenters need not be blind. However, there is a risk that subjects are influenced by interaction with the researchers – known as the [[experimenter's bias]]. Single-blind trials are especially risky in psychology and social science research, where the experimenter has an [[observer-expectancy effect|expectation]] of what the outcome should be, and may consciously or subconsciously influence the behavior of the subject.

A classic example of a single-blind test is the [[Pepsi Challenge]]. A tester, often a marketing person, prepares two sets of cups of cola labeled "A" and "B". One set of cups is filled with Pepsi, while the other is filled with Coca-Cola. The tester knows which soda is in which cup but is not supposed to reveal that information to the subjects. Volunteer subjects are encouraged to try the two cups of soda and polled for which ones they prefer. One of the problems with a single-blind test like this is that the tester can unintentionally give subconscious cues which influence the subjects. In addition, it is possible the tester could intentionally introduce bias by preparing the separate sodas differently (e.g., by putting more ice in one cup or by pushing one cup closer to the subject). If the tester is a marketing person employed by the company which is producing the challenge, there's always the possibility of a [[conflict of interest]] where the marketing person is aware that future income will be based on the results of the test.

==Double-blind trials==
{{Distinguish-redirect|Double blind|double bind}}
'''Double-blind''' describes an especially stringent way of conducting an [[experiment]] which attempts to eliminate subjective, unrecognized biases carried by an experiment's subjects (usually human) ''and'' conductors. Double-blind studies were first used in 1907 by [[W. H. R. Rivers]] and H. N. Webber in the investigation of the effects of caffeine.&lt;ref&gt;Rivers WHR and Webber HN. “The action of caffeine on the capacity for muscular work” Journal of Physiology 36: 33-47: 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, double-blind experiments are regarded to achieve a higher standard of scientific rigor than single-blind or non-blind experiments.

In these double-blind experiments, neither the participants nor the researchers know which participants belong to the [[control group]], nor the test group. Only after all data have been recorded (and, in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which participants were which. Performing an experiment in double-blind fashion can greatly lessen the power of preconceived notions or physical cues (e.g., [[placebo]] effect, [[observer effect (psychology)|observer bias]], [[experimenter's bias]]) to distort the results (by making researchers or participants behave differently from in everyday life). [[Random sample|Random assignment]] of test subjects to the experimental and control groups is a critical part of any double-blind research design. The key that identifies the subjects and which group they belonged to is kept by a third party, and is not revealed to the researchers until the study is over.

Double-blind methods can be applied to any experimental situation in which there is a possibility that the results will be affected by conscious or unconscious [[bias]] on the part of researchers, participants, or both. For example, in animal studies, both the carer of the animals and the assessor of the results have to be blinded; otherwise the carer might treat control subjects differently and alter the results.&lt;ref name="PetrieWatson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aviva Petrie|author2=Paul Watson|title=Statistics for Veterinary and Animal Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hp9p_nmvGUC&amp;pg=PT130|date=28 February 2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-56740-1|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer-controlled experiments are sometimes also erroneously referred to as double-blind experiments, since software may not cause the type of direct bias between researcher and subject. Development of surveys presented to subjects through computers shows that bias can easily be built into the process. Voting systems are also examples where bias can easily be constructed into an apparently simple machine based system. In analogy to the human researcher described above, the part of the software that provides interaction with the human is presented to the subject as the blinded researcher, while the part of the software that defines the key is the third party. An example is the [[ABX test]], where the human subject has to identify an unknown stimulus X as being either A or B.

==Triple-blind trials==
A '''triple-blind study''' is an extension of the double-blind design; the committee monitoring response variables is not told the identity of the groups. The committee is simply given data for groups A and B. A triple-blind study has the theoretical advantage of allowing the monitoring committee to evaluate the response variable results more objectively. This assumes that appraisal of efficacy and harm, as well as requests for special analyses, may be biased if group identity is known. However, in a trial where the monitoring committee has an ethical responsibility to ensure participant safety, such a design may be counterproductive since in this case monitoring is often guided by the constellation of trends and their directions. In addition, by the time many monitoring committees receive data, often any emergency situation has long passed.&lt;ref name="Friedman, Furberg &amp; DeMets (2010)"&gt;Friedman, L.M., Furberg, C.D., DeMets, D.L.

==Use==

===In medicine===
Double-blinding is relatively easy to achieve in drug studies, by formulating the investigational drug and the control (either a [[placebo]] or an established drug) to have identical appearance (color, taste, etc.). Patients are randomly assigned to the control or experimental group and given random numbers by a study coordinator, who also encodes the drugs with matching random numbers. Neither the patients nor the researchers monitoring the outcome know which patient is receiving which treatment, until the study is over and the random code is revealed.

Effective blinding can be difficult to achieve where the treatment is notably effective (indeed, studies have been suspended in cases where the tested drug combinations were so effective that it was deemed unethical to continue withholding the findings from the control group, and the general population),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6176209.stm |title=Male circumcision 'cuts' HIV risk |accessdate=2009-05-18 |format= |work=BBC News |date=2006-12-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324141638/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6176209.stm |archivedate=2009-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/health/13cnd-hiv.html?pagewanted=print |title=Circumcision Reduces Risk of AIDS, Study Finds |accessdate=2009-05-18 |format= |work=The New York Times |first=Donald G. |last=McNeil Jr |date=2006-12-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623064014/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/health/13cnd-hiv.html?pagewanted=print |archivedate=2015-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or where the treatment is very distinctive in taste or has unusual side-effects that allow the researcher and/or the subject to guess which group they were assigned to. It is also difficult to use the double blind method to compare surgical and non-surgical interventions (although [[sham surgery]], involving a simple incision, might be ethically permitted). A good [[clinical protocol]] will foresee these potential problems to ensure blinding is as effective as possible. It has also been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Skeptical Comment About Double-Blind Trials|work=The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine|doi=10.1089/acm.2009.0515}}&lt;/ref&gt; that even in a double-blind experiment, general attitudes of the experimenter such as skepticism or enthusiasm towards the tested procedure can be subconsciously transferred to the test subjects.

[[Evidence-based medicine]] practitioners prefer blinded [[randomized controlled trial|randomised controlled trials]] (RCTs), where that is a possible experimental design. These are high on the [[hierarchy of evidence]]; only a [[meta analysis]] of several well designed RCTs is considered more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cebm.net/oxford-centre-evidence-based-medicine-levels-evidence-march-2009/|title=Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine - Levels of Evidence (March 2009) - CEBM|author=|date=11 June 2009|website=cebm.net|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026195451/http://www.cebm.net/oxford-centre-evidence-based-medicine-levels-evidence-march-2009/|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In physics===
Modern [[nuclear physics]] and [[particle physics]] experiments often involve large numbers of data analysts working together to extract quantitative data from complex datasets. In particular, the analysts want to report accurate [[systematic error]] estimates for all of their measurements; this is difficult or impossible if one of the errors is [[observer bias]]. To remove this bias, the experimenters devise blind analysis techniques, where the experimental result is hidden from the analysts until they've agreed—based on properties of the data set ''other than'' the final value—that the analysis techniques are fixed.

One example of a blind analysis occurs in [[neutrino]] experiments, like the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]], where the experimenters wish to report the total number ''N'' of neutrinos seen. The experimenters have preexisting expectations about what this number should be, and these expectations must not be allowed to bias the analysis. Therefore, the experimenters are allowed to see an unknown fraction ''f'' of the dataset. They use these data to understand the backgrounds, signal-detection efficiencies, detector resolutions, etc.. However, since no one knows the "blinding fraction" ''f'', no one has preexisting expectations about the meaningless neutrino count ''N'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''f'' in the visible data; therefore, the analysis does not introduce any bias into the final number ''N'' which is reported. Another blinding scheme is used in [[B meson]] analyses in experiments like [[BaBar]] and [[Collider Detector at Fermilab|CDF]]; here, the crucial experimental parameter is a correlation between certain particle energies and decay times—which require an extremely complex and painstaking analysis—and particle charge signs, which are fairly trivial to measure. Analysts are allowed to work with all the energy and decay data, but are forbidden from seeing the sign of the charge, and thus are unable to see the correlation (if any). At the end of the experiment, the correct charge signs are revealed; the analysis software is run once (with no subjective human intervention), and the resulting numbers are published. Searches for rare events, like electron neutrinos in [[MiniBooNE]] or proton decay in [[Super-Kamiokande]], require a different class of blinding schemes.

The "hidden" part of the experiment—the fraction ''f'' for SNO, the charge-sign database for CDF—is usually called the "blindness box". At the end of the analysis period, one is allowed to "unblind the data" and "open the box".

===In forensics===
In a [[police lineup|police photo lineup]], an officer shows a group of photos to a witness or crime victim and asks him or her to pick out the suspect. This is basically a single-blind test of the witness's memory, and may be subject to subtle or overt influence by the officer. There is a growing movement in law enforcement to move to a double-blind procedure in which the officer who shows the photos to the witness does not know which photo is of the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug04/accuracy.html Psychological sleuths – Accuracy and the accused] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130042924/http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug04/accuracy.html |date=2005-11-30 }} on apa.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/July-August-2002/review_koerner_julaug2002.msp|title=Legal Affairs|author=|date=|website=www.legalaffairs.org|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
In recruiting musicians to perform in orchestras and so on, [[blind audition]]s are now routinely done: the musicians perform behind a screen so that their physical appearance and gender cannot prejudice the listener judging the performance.

The '''Bureau of Health Information''' is an independent, board-governed statutory authority responsible for reporting on the performance of the health system in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

It produces regular reports on health system accessibility, appropriateness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Corderoy, [http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/patients-feel-mostly-positive-about-public-hospital-experience-20140327-35lr7.html "Patients feel mostly positive about public hospital experience"], "Sydney Morning Herald", 28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABC, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-05/survival-rates-improve/5136306 "Bureau of Health Information report shows hospital survival rates improving across NSW"], 5 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
The reports are used to inform efforts to improve patient care and strengthen healthcare policy in NSW.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Health Information.

== Background ==

The Bureau was established in September 2009 by the [[NSW Government]] under the ''Health Services Act 1997'' following the [[Garling Report|“Final Report of the Special Commission of Inquiry into Acute Care Services in NSW Public Hospitals”]]  by [[Peter Garling|Peter Garling, SC]], which recommended that:

"a Bureau of Health Information be established to access, interpret and report on all data relating to safety and quality of patient care and facilitate its interpretation and re-issue to the unit level on a regular basis."&lt;ref&gt;Garling, Peter.

[[File:Care Not Killing logo.jpg|thumb|right|Care Not Killing logo]]

'''Care, Not Killing''' is an alliance of several organisations who are opposed to the legalisation of [[euthanasia]] or physician-[[assisted suicide]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Their goals include promoting more and better [[palliative care]], ensuring that existing laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide are not weakened or repealed during the lifetime of the current [[British Parliament|Parliament]], influencing the balance of public opinion against any weakening of the law. They are opposed in their efforts by pro-assisted dying groups such as [[Dignity in Dying]] and [[Humanists UK]].

==Alliance members==

The members of the alliance include:
* [[British Council of Disabled People]]
* [[Christian Medical Fellowship]]
* [[Church of England|The Church of England]]
* [[Church of Scotland|The Church of Scotland]]
* [[Royal_Association_for_Disability_Rights|RADAR (The Disability Network)]]

==2006 Petition==
Care, Not Killing launched a petition in opposition to a [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] put forward by [[Joel Joffe|Lord Joffe]]. This was signed by 102,363 people in four weeks, and presented to [[10 Downing Street]] on May 12, 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15144">[[File:Implanon 01.jpg|thumb|right|370px|Container/applicator for ''Implanon'', an example of an [[etonogestrel]]-based contraceptive implant.]]
A '''contraceptive implant''' is an [[Implant (medicine)|implantable]] [[medical device]] used for the purpose of [[birth control]]. The implant may depend on the timed release of [[hormone]]s to hinder [[ovulation]] or [[sperm]] development, the ability of [[copper]] to act as a natural [[spermicide]] within the [[uterus]], or it may work using a non-hormonal, physical blocking mechanism. As with other contraceptives, a contraceptive implant is designed to prevent [[pregnancy]], but it does not protect against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.

==Women==
[[File:Implanon implantation.webm|thumb|Insertion of a contraceptive implant into a woman's arm]][[File:Removal Implanon.webm|thumb|Removal of a contraceptive implant from a woman's arm]]
Several options exist for women, depending on the approval status of devices in their region.

===Implant===
{{main|Etonogestrel contraceptive implant}}
{{main|Levonorgestrel implant}}
The contraceptive implant is hormone-based and highly effective, approved in more than 60 countries and used by millions of women around the world. The typical implant is a small flexible tube measuring about 40mm in length and is inserted under the skin (typically in the upper arm) by a health care professional. After it is inserted it prevents pregnancy by releasing hormones that prevent [[Ovary|ovaries]] from releasing eggs and thicken [[cervical mucous]]. The two most common versions are the single-rod [[Etonogestrel contraceptive implant|etonogestrel implant]] and the two-rod [[levonorgestrel implant]].&lt;ref name="French"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQehCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |chapter=Chapter 9: Implantable Contraception |title=The Handbook of Contraception: A Guide for Practical Management |author1=French, V.A. |author2=Darney, P.D. |editor1=Shoupe, D. |editor2=Mishell Jr., D.R. |edition=2nd |publisher=Humana Press |pages=139–164 |year=2015 |isbn=9783319201856 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brands include:

* [[Norplant]] and [[Jadelle]] ([[Norplant II]])
* [[Nexplanon|Implanon/Nexplanon]]
* Sino-implant (II), marketed as Zarin, Femplant and Trust

Benefits of the implant include fewer, lighter periods; improved symptoms of [[premenstrual syndrome]]; long-lasting, up to three years; smoker- and breastfeeding-safe; and the convenience of not needing to remember to use it every day. In some cases, negative side effects do occur, the most common being irregular bleeding for the first six to 12 months. Less common symptoms include change in appetite, depression, moodiness, hormonal imbalance, sore breasts, weight gain, dizziness, pregnancy symptoms, and lethargy.&lt;ref name="Bedsider"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bedsider.org/methods/implant#side_effects_tab |title=Birth Control Methods - Implant |work=Bedsider.org |publisher=National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy |date=February 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrauterine device===
{{main|Intrauterine device}}
An intrauterine device (IUD) is a small contraceptive device, often 'T'-shaped and containing either copper or the hormone [[levonorgestrel]], which is [[Implant (medicine)|implanted]] into the uterus. They are long-acting, reversible, and the most effective types of reversible birth control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Winner, B |author2=Peipert, JF |author3=Zhao, Q |author4=Buckel, C |author5=Madden, T |author6=Allsworth, JE |author7=Secura, GM. | year = 2012 | title = Effectiveness of Long-Acting Reversible Contraception | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 21 | pages = 1998–2007 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1110855 | url =http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1110855 | pmid=22621627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure rates with the [[IUD with copper|copper IUD]] is about 0.8% while the [[IUD with progestogen|levonorgestrel IUD]] has a failure rate of 0.2% in the first year of use.&lt;ref name=Hopkins2010&gt;{{cite book |title=The Johns Hopkins Manual of Gynecology and Obstetrics |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1-60547-433-5 |page=232 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Sg5sXyiBvkC&amp;pg=PR232 |edition=4th |editor=Hurt, K.J. |author1=Hanson, S.J. |author2=Burke, A.E. |date=2012 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among types of birth control they, along with birth control implants, result in the greatest satisfaction among users.&lt;ref name=Comm2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Committee on Adolescent Health Care Long-Acting Reversible Contraception Working Group, The American College of Obstetricians and|first=Gynecologists|title=Committee opinion no. 539: adolescents and long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=October 2012|volume=120|issue=4|pages=983–8|pmid=22996129|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182723b7d}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, IUDs are the most widely used form of reversible contraception worldwide.&lt;ref name="UNTrends"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/popfacts/popfacts_2013-9.pdf |format=PDF |title=Trends in Contraceptive Methods Used Worldwide |author=U.N.

==Men==
Several barriers exist to expanding research into implantable and other contraceptive methods for men, including vague regulatory guidelines, long device development timelines, men's attitudes towards convenience, and a significant lack of funding.&lt;ref name="BaiBeyond11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beyond-condoms-the-long-quest-male-contraceptive/ |title=Beyond Condoms: The Long Quest for a Better Male Contraceptive |author=Bai, N. |work=Scientific American |publisher=Nature America, Inc |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FawcettTheFut15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2015/02/26/the-future-of-male-birth-control |title=The Future of Male Birth Control |author=Fawcett, K. |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report LP |date=26 February 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KhazanBlock15"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/block-that-sperm/384971/ |title=Block That Sperm! |author=Khazan, O. |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |date=March 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several implantable devices have been attempted, both hormonal and non-hormonal.

===Research===
In 2001, Dutch pharmaceutical company [[Organon]] announced clinical trials of its implantable [[etonogestrel]]-based male contraceptive would begin in Europe and the U.S., anticipating a marketable product as early as 2005.&lt;ref name="ABCMale01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117334&amp;page=1 |title=Male Contraceptive Implant Gets Trial Run |work=abcnews.go.com |publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures |date=11 July 2001 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesContra01"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1007-contraceptive-implant-for-men-in-trials/ |title=Contraceptive implant for men in trials |author=Jones, N. |work=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd |date=11 July 2001 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite promising results, research development stopped, with outside speculation that lack of marketability was a factor. Organon representative Monique Mols stated in 2007 that "[d]espite 20 years of research, the development of a [hormonal] method acceptable to a wide population of men is unlikely."&lt;ref name="GoodmanTheLong08"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1829107,00.html |title=The Long Wait for Male Birth Control |author=Goodman, A. |work=Time |publisher=Time, Inc |date=3 August 2008 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schering AG|Schering]]/[[Bayer]] had been working on a similar annual implant with quarterly injections but cancelled the research in 2006/2007,&lt;ref name="GoodmanTheLong08" /&gt; declaring that men would most likely view it as "not as convenient as a woman taking a pill once a day."&lt;ref name="KhazanBlock15" /&gt;

In 2005, a collaboratory project led by the [[Population Council]], the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] began researching a matchstick-sized implant that contains MENT (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone or [[Trestolone]]), a "synthetic steroid that resembles testosterone."&lt;ref name="PCMENT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popcouncil.org/research/ment-subdermal-implants-for-men |title=MENT: Subdermal Implants for Men |work=PopCouncil.org |publisher=The Population Council, Inc |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical trials were set to begin in 2011 or 2012,&lt;ref name="BaiBeyond11" /&gt; and the project was ongoing as of 2016, with hopes of gaining approval as the first reversible male contraceptive.&lt;ref name="PCMENT" /&gt;

In 2006, Shepherd Medical Company received FDA approval for a clinical trial of its non-hormonal implant called an [[Vas-occlusive contraception|intra vas device]] (IVD), which consists of two plugs that block sperm flow in the vas deferens. Working on the success of its pilot study and solid results from its clinical trials, the company announced it would expand its trials to three U.S. cities later that year. Questions remained about how reversible the procedure would be in the long-term; however, it was expected to be more reversible than a vesectomy. In 2008, the company disbanded due to the economic crisis but has stated it would restart its research with proper funding.&lt;ref name="EurekNew06"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-05/mcip-nmc050406.php |title=New male contraceptive targets sperm, not hormones |work=EurekAlert! |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=5 May 2006 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCMale06"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychcentral.com/news/archives/2006-10/mcip-mcs100506.html |title=Male contraceptive study expands to 4 US cities |work=Psych Central |publisher=Psych Central |date=October 2006 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CTIEShug15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pipeline.ctiexchange.org/fillpdf?fid=105&amp;nid=813 |format=PDF |title=Shug Product Report |work=Calliope, The Contraceptive Pipeline Database |publisher=Contraceptive Technology Innovation Exchange |date=21 May 2015 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 news broke of a non-hormonal, implantable valve — the Bimek SLV — with a switch that attaches to the [[vas deferens]], allowing the owner to stop and resume the flow of sperm on demand. A clinical trial of 25 participants was announced to further test the efficacy of the device.&lt;ref name="AtkinTheMale16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/the-male-contraception-that-makes-you-infertile-by-flicking-a-switch-a6802766.html |title=The male contraception that makes you infertile by flicking a switch |author=Atkin, C. |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Digital News and Media Limited |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BimekFAQResearch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bimek.com/faq-research/ |title=FAQ - Science and Research |publisher=PES Innovation AG |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
Implantable contraception is also an option for animals, particularly for animal managers at zoos and other captive animal facilities who require reversible contraception methods for managing population growth in limited captive habitat.&lt;ref name="AsaContra10"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1vev5hf7o8C&amp;pg=PA469 |chapter=Chapter 34: Contraception as a Management Tool for Controlling Surplus Animals |title=Wild Mammals in Captivity: Principles and Techniques for Zoo Management |edition=2nd |author1=Asa, C.S. |author2=Porton, I.J. |editor1=Kleiman, D.G. |editor2=Thompson, K.V. |editor3=Baer, C.K. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |year=2010 |pages=469–482 |isbn=9780226440118 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]' (AZA) Reproductive Management Center (formerly known as the AZA Wildlife Contraception Center) at the [[Saint Louis Zoo]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] has played a major role in researching and disseminating contraception information to hundreds of institutions around the world since 1999 via its Contraception Database, which houses over 30,000 records for hundreds of species.&lt;ref name="AsaContra10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AZARMC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stlzoo.org/animals/scienceresearch/reproductivemanagementcenter/ |title=AZA Reproductive Management Center |work=STLZoo.org |publisher=Saint Louis Zoo |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most popular contraceptive methods used by zoos (as well as in domestic animals) is the [[melengestrol acetate]] (MGA) implant, a [[progestin]]-based hormonal contraceptive developed in the mid-1970s. Other progestin-based implants that have been placed in animals include [[Norplant]], [[Jadelle]], and [[Nexplanon|Implanon]]. [[Androgen]]-based implants that use [[agonist]] (stimulating) [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) and, to a lesser degree, [[Intrauterine device|IUD]]s have also seen use in several domestic and exotic species. Whatever the implant, some care must be taken to minimize the risk of implant migration or loss&lt;ref name="AsaContra10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AZARMC_Methods"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stlzoo.org/animals/scienceresearch/reproductivemanagementcenter/contraceptionrecommendatio/contraceptionmethods/ |title=AZA Reproductive Management Center - Contraception Methods |work=STLZoo.org |publisher=Saint Louis Zoo |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BonaguraKirks13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlJKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2996 |chapter=Chapter 215: Estrus Suppression in the Bitch |title=Kirk's Current Veterinary Therapy XV |author=Concannon, P.W. |editor1=Bonagura, J.D. |editor2=Twedt, D.C. |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |year=2013 |pages=984–989 |isbn=9780323227629 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[dining]], a '''course''' is a specific set of [[food]] items that are served together during a [[meal]], all at the same time. A course may include multiple [[dish (food)|dishes]] or only one, and often includes items with some variety of [[flavor]]s. For instance, a [[hamburger]] served with [[French fry|fries]] would be considered a single course, and most likely the entire meal. Likewise, an extended [[banquet]] might include [[multicourse meal|many courses]], such as a course where a [[soup]] is served by itself, a course where [[cordon bleu (dish)|cordon bleu]] is served at the same time as its [[Garnish (food)|garnish]] and perhaps a [[side dish]], and later a [[dessert]] such as a [[pumpkin pie]]. Courses may vary in size as well as number depending on the culture where the meal takes place.&lt;ref name="GiobbiBone2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Giobbi|author2=Eugenia Giobbi Bone|title=Italian Family Dining: Recipes, Menus, and Memories of Meals with a Great American Food Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38uclKEFqaAC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=20 October 2005|publisher=Rodale|isbn=978-1-59486-126-0|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meals are composed of one or more courses,&lt;ref name="Smith2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew F. Smith|title=The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=1 May 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530796-2|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn are composed of one or more dishes.

When dishes are served mostly in a single course, this is called [[service à la française]]; when dishes are served mostly in separate courses, this is called [[service à la russe]].

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the French word ''cours'' (run), and came into English in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Morton2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Morton|title=Cupboard Love 2: A Dictionary of Culinary Curiosities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qn-DASgdhiAC&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=26 August 2013|year=2004|publisher=Insomniac Press|isbn=978-1-897415-93-1|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came to be used perhaps because the food in a banquet serving had to be brought at speed from a remote kitchen&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in the 1420 cookbook ''[[Du fait de cuisine]]'' the word "course" is used interchangeably with the word for serving.&lt;ref name="Scully1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terence Scully|title=The Art of Cookery in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i5h7_HXPHvwC&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=26 August 2013|year=1995|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-0-85115-430-5|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reliable information about '''disability in North Korea''', like other information about social conditions in the country, is difficult to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/briefing_note/join/2012/491441/EXPO-DROI_SP(2012)491441_EN.pdf |title=Policy Briefing - Human Rights in North Korea |author=Anete Bandone |publisher=Policy Department, Directorate-General for External Policies -European Union |year=2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, [[North Korea]] is a signatory to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korea to ratify disability convention: state media|url=https://www.nknews.org/2016/11/north-korea-to-ratify-disability-convention-state-media/|first=Hamish|last=Macdonald |work=NK News|date=25 November 2016|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Kim Il-sung]], disabled veterans enjoyed a high social status. A factory to employ disabled soldiers was established in 1970.&lt;ref name=rodong-20170510&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rodong.rep.kp/en/index.php?strPageID=SF01_02_01&amp;newsID=2017-05-10-0001 |title=Kim Jong Un Visits Rangnang Disabled Soldiers' Essential Plastic Goods Factory |newspaper=The Rodong Sinmun |date=10 May 2017 |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, life for the disabled is "sad, if not horrible", according to North Korea scholar Fyodor Tertitskiy.&lt;ref name="Tertitskiy2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korea and the Olympic Games|url=https://www.nknews.org/2016/08/north-korea-and-the-olympic-games|first=Fyodor|last=Tertitskiy|work=NK News|date=22 August 2016|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disability rights conventions==
As a state party to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), and the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (CRPD), North Korea has international obligations to refrain from discriminating against its people based on disability (among others). Under Article 2 of the CRC, "States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction ''without discrimination'' of any kind, irrespective of the child’s or their parent’s or legal guardian’s race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, ''disability'', birth or other status" (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=November 20, 1989|accessdate=August 18, 2016|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea [[ratified]] CRPD in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-un-idUSKBN17T19O|title=North Korea opens door a crack to welcome U.N. disability expert|date=April 27, 2017|access-date=April 26, 2017|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 the [[United Nations special rapporteur]] on the rights of people with disabilities made a first official visit of eight days to North Korea.&lt;ref name=ohchr-20170427&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21538&amp;LangID=E |title=UN disability rights expert announces first visit to North Korea |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |date=27 April 2017 |accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a news conference at the end of her visit the raporteur, [[Catalina Devandas Aguilar]], called for more attention to be given to disabled people in the country.&lt;ref name=nydailynews-20170508&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/news/world/official-calls-work-disabled-north-korea-article-1.3147069 |title=UN official calls for more work with disabled in North Korea |agency=Associated Press|newspaper=NYDailyNews.com |date=8 May 2017 |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged infanticide of babies with birth defects ==
In 2006, the [[Associated Press]] reported from South Korea that a North Korean doctor who defected, Ri Kwang-chol, has claimed that babies born with physical defects are rapidly put to death and buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Nation under a nuclear cloud: 'Racially not impure' children killed | work=The Times Online| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article600929.ece| accessdate=November 19, 2007 | location=London | date=October 15, 2006 | first=Michael | last=Sheridan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social services ==
The charity [[Handicap International]] reports that it has been operating in North Korea since 1999, assisting the Korean Federation for the Protection of Disabled People, including supporting orthopedic centers serving thousands of disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handicap-international.org.uk/where_we_work/asia/north_korea |title=North Korea |publisher=Handicap International |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702152154/http://www.handicap-international.org.uk/where_we_work/asia/north_korea |archivedate=July 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] reported in 2006 that it had assisted in setting up a rehabilitation center for disabled people in [[Pyongyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2009-and-earlier/north-korea-news-240406.htm |title=North Korea: ICRC inaugurates a second physical rehabilitation centre |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] reports that North Korea "has a comprehensive system for assisting persons with disabilities; however, this system is limited by the general economic situation of the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/publications/display?url=lm/2005/north_korea.html |title=Democratic People's Republic Of Korea – Mine Ban Policy |publisher=International Campaign to Ban Landmines |accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, [[Marzuki Darusman]], stated the following in his report before the [[UN Human Rights Council]]'s twenty-second session:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As early as 2003 the Commission on Human Rights expressed deep concern at the "mistreatment of and discrimination of disabled children". Since 2006 the General Assembly has consistently decried "continuing reports of violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities, especially on the use of collective camps and of coercive measures that target the rights of a person with disabilities to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children.” Whereas in 2006 the Special Rapporteur noted, "to date, the situation facing those with disabilities are sent away from the capital city, and particularly those with the mental disabilities are detained in areas or camps known as 'Ward 49' with harsh and subhuman conditions."&lt;ref&gt;A/HRC/22/57, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Marzuki Darusman, 26, para. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

North Korea adopted a law in 2003 to promote equal access for disabled people to public services and claimed in its second report on compliance with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that its handicapped citizens are protected. North Korea acceded to this covenant on September 14, 1981. However, its law has not been implemented, and North Korean refugees in the South testify that the handicapped are severely discriminated against unless they are wounded soldiers who say their wounds were the result of American aggression in the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marked for Life: Songbun, North Korea's Social Classification System|year=2012|publisher=Committee for Human Rights in North Korea|isbn=0985648007|page=83|url=http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_Songbun_Web.pdf|author=David Hawk|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, the United Nations reported that the government was "beginning to consider welfare for the disabled".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,RFA,,PRK,4562d8cf2,47de46d1c,0.html "North Korea begins to help disabled"], [[UNHCR]], March 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Separation in "camps" ==
The disabled, with the exception of veterans, have been relocated to places far away from cities since the rule of [[Kim Il-sung]].&lt;ref name="Tertitskiy2016"/&gt;

In the early 2000s, it was reported that persons with disabilities in North Korea were locked away in camps, and "subjected to harsh and sub-human conditions".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1532036/North-Korea-locks-up-disabled-in-subhuman-gulags-says-UN.html "North Korea locks up disabled in 'subhuman' gulags, says UN"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', October 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Vitit Muntarbhorn, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights, reported in 2006 that North Koreans with disabilities were excluded from the country's showcase capital, Pyongyang, and kept in camps where they were categorised by disability. Defectors reported the existence of "collective camps for [[midget]]s", whose inmates were forbidden from having children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/un-slams-korean-disabled-camps/2006/10/21/1160851184176.html "UN slams Korean 'disabled camps'"], ''The Age'', 22 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However the charity Handicap International reports that it has been operating in North Korea since 1999 assisting the Korean Federation for the Protection of Disabled People,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.handicap-international.org.uk/where_we_work/asia/north_korea |title=North Korea |publisher=Handicap International |accessdate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702152154/http://www.handicap-international.org.uk/where_we_work/asia/north_korea |archivedate=2 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Committee of the Red Cross reported in 2006 that it had assisted in setting up a rehabilitation centre for disabled people in Pyongyang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/north-korea-news-240406.htm |title=North Korea: ICRC inaugurates a second physical rehabilitation centre |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport ==
{{further|North Korea at the Paralympics}}
North Korea made its [[Paralympic Games]] début at the [[North Korea at the 2012 Summer Paralympics|2012 Summer Paralympics]] in [[London]], sending a single wildcard representative ([[Rim Ju-song]], a left arm and left leg amputee) to compete in [[Swimming at the 2012 Summer Paralympics – Men's 50 metre freestyle S6|swimming]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/swimming/swimmer-set-to-be-first-north-korean-competitor-at-the-paralympic-games-7917753.html "Swimmer set to be first North Korean competitor at the Paralympic Games"], ''The Independent'', 5 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yahoo!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10590">'''Drug diversion''' is a medical and legal concept involving the transfer of any legally prescribed [[controlled substance]] from the individual for whom it was prescribed to another person for any illicit use.&lt;ref name="pmid22766087"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berge KH, Dillon KR, Sikkink KM, Taylor TK, Lanier WL | title = Diversion of drugs within health care facilities, a multiple-victim crime: patterns of diversion, scope, consequences, detection, and prevention | journal = Mayo Clin.

In some jurisdictions, [[drug diversion program]]s are available to first time offenders of diversion drug laws, which "divert" offenders from the criminal justice system to a program of education and rehabilitation.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

*[[Benzodiazepines]]&amp;nbsp;– including [[diazepam]], [[temazepam]], [[clonazepam]], and [[alprazolam]]&amp;nbsp;– prescription [[anxiolytic]]s and [[sedative]]s
*[[Opioid]]s&amp;nbsp;– including [[morphine]], [[hydrocodone]], [[oxycodone]] and [[codeine]]&amp;nbsp;– prescription pain medications

According to the [[United States]] [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], "Most pharmaceuticals abused in the United States are diverted by doctor shopping, forged prescriptions, theft and, increasingly, via the Internet." &lt;ref name="US Department of Justice web site"&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs11/11449/diversion.htm US Department of Justice web site]&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the occurrence of pharmaceutical diversion by doctor shopping and prescription fraud, almost all states have established [[Prescription monitoring program|prescription monitoring programs (PMPs)]] that facilitate the collection, analysis, and reporting of information regarding pharmaceutical drug prescriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdmp/index.html|title=Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registration of drug suppliers ==
21 U.S.C. § 823 of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] provides for registration of manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances. The criteria for registering manufacturers of Schedule I and II drugs are particularly strict and call for "limiting the importation and bulk manufacture of such controlled substances to a number of establishments which can produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances under adequately competitive conditions for legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes." The [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] must make a positive determination that the registration would be "consistent with the public interest."{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

For manufacturers of other drugs, and for drug distributors, the regulations are substantially less strict: "The Attorney General shall register an applicant… unless he determines that the issuance of such registration is inconsistent with the public interest." The criteria for both manufacture and distribution is somewhat biased in favor of established industries, favoring "past experience" and a record of compliance with drug laws {{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The Controlled Substances Act also provides for the registration of medical practitioners (i.e., physicians, dentists, veterinarians, etc.), pharmacies and hospitals that prescribe, administer, or dispense controlled substances directly to patients, as well as individuals conducting approved research involving controlled substances.  This category also includes narcotic treatment programs that administer and dispense primarily [[Methadone]] for narcotic addiction treatment.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Examples ===
This activity can occur in many venues; 
{{quote|occurs in a variety of ways, by all segments of our population, in all neighborhoods, and in all workplaces. Its abuse is often overlooked by the thinking that if a doctor prescribes the drug, and a pharmacist dispenses the medication, it can’t be abused. Understanding that the top prescription drugs of abuse are every bit as addictive, abused, and valuable as illicit drugs, is sometimes difficult to comprehend.|[http://www.rxdiversion.com/ RxDiversion.com web page]}}

''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'' has reported on its frequency. John Burke, a leading expert on the issue, was quoted as saying, "Pharmaceutical diversion is kind of funny because it's going on in every community, but it appears not to exist unless you go after it purposely," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cincypost.com/2005/01/18/pharm011805.html|title=Police target prescription abuse|first=Shelly|last=Whitehead|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|publisher=[[E. W. Scripps Company]]|date=2005-01-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312065853/http://www.cincypost.com/2005/01/18/pharm011805.html|archivedate=2005-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DEA investigation into oxycodone diversion==
According to the US Justice Department, in 2011 CVS pharmacies in [[Sanford, Florida]], ordered enough painkillers to supply a population eight times its size. Sanford has a population of 53,000 but the supply would support 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-29/cardinal-health-blocked-from-shipping-painkiller-in-florida-1-.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Tom | last=Schoenberg | title=Cardinal Health Blocked From Shipping Painkiller in Florida | date=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), in 2010 a single CVS pharmacy in Sanford ordered 1.8 million oxycodone pills, an average of 137,994 pills a month. Other pharmacy customers in [[Florida]] averaged 5,364 oxycodone pills a month. DEA investigators serving a warrant to a CVS pharmacy in Sanford on October 18, 2011 noted that "approximately every third car that came through the drive-thru lane had prescriptions for oxycodone or hydrocodone."

According to the DEA, a pharmacist at that location stated to investigators that "her customers often requested certain brands of oxycodone using street slang," an indicator that the drugs were being diverted and not used for legitimate pain management. In response, CVS in a statement issued February 17 in response to opioid trafficking questions from ''[[USA Today]]'' said the company is committed to working with the DEA and had taken "significant actions to ensure appropriate dispensing of painkillers in Florida." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-02-27/painkiller-abuse-DEA/53275844/1 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]’s Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against [[Cardinal Health]]'s supply of [[oxycodone]] to suspected pill mills.&lt;ref name=WashPo16&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lenny Bernstein|last2=[[Scott Higham]]|title=Investigation: The DEA slowed enforcement while the opioid epidemic grew out of control|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/the-dea-slowed-enforcement-while-the-opioid-epidemic-grew-out-of-control/2016/10/22/aea2bf8e-7f71-11e6-8d13-d7c704ef9fd9_story.html|accessdate=17 March 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deputy Attorney General [[James M. Cole]] then called Rannazzisi to a meeting at Justice Department headquarters where Cole warned him “it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say”.&lt;ref name=WashPo16/&gt;  Rannazzisi was fired from the drug diversion office in August 2015.&lt;ref name=WashPo16/&gt;  Cardinal was never fined.&lt;ref name=WashPo16/&gt;

Cardinal, alongside [[McKesson Corporation]] and [[AmerisourceBergen]], spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman [[Tom Marino]]'s "Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act".&lt;ref name=WashPo16/&gt;  The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|114|S.|483}}, 114th Cong. (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16126">The '''history of early food regulation in the United States''' started with the 1906 [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], when the United States federal government began to intervene in the food and drug businesses. When that bill proved ineffective, the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] revised it into the Federal [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]] of 1937. This has set the stage for further government intervention in the food, drug and agricultural markets.

==The 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act (Wiley Act)==

===Origins===
Before the 1906 [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], most food oversight was mandated to state laws, which were enacted during the colonial days and served mainly trade interests.&lt;ref name="Janssen 24"&gt;Janssen 24&lt;/ref&gt; They set standards of weight, and "provided for inspections of exports like salt meats, fish and flour".&lt;ref name="Janssen 24"/&gt; In 1848, the first national law concerned with regulating food come out of the [[Mexican–American War]], and "banned the importation of adulterated drugs".&lt;ref name="Young 17"&gt;Young 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Food safety|Food inspection]] was largely thought to be the duty of the consumer, not the government.&lt;ref name="Young 21"&gt;Young 21&lt;/ref&gt;

====Changes in technology====
With the advent of modern machinery, food production (especially grain) moved forward at an alarming pace.&lt;ref name="Garraty 478"&gt;Garraty 478&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the “canning line” increased the efficiency of [[canning]] foods in an industrial setting.&lt;ref name="Garraty 478"/&gt; An 1886 report by the Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics claimed that “New machinery has displaced fully 50 percent of the muscular labor formerly required to do a given amount of work”.&lt;ref name="Garraty 478"/&gt; Because of these improvements to agriculture, packaged cereals and canned foods became popular.&lt;ref name="Garraty 478"/&gt; Synthetic medicines (made in labs instead of natural medicines) and chemicals that altered the growing and processing of food began to appear.&lt;ref name="Young 17"/&gt;

====Processed food====
Processed food was more easily transported, thanks to improvements in transportation.&lt;ref name="Young 18"&gt;Young 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Food additive|Chemical additives]] were used to "heighten color, modify flavor, soften texture, deter spoilage, and even transform ... apple scraps, [[glucose]], [[Aniline|coal-tar dye]], and [[timothy seed]]" into a "strawberry jam".&lt;ref name="Young 18"/&gt; However, for these new products, there was no regulation and manufacturers were able to put whatever ingredients they wanted in products like “tonics” without having to list them.&lt;ref&gt;Garraty 590&lt;/ref&gt; Products were often labeled and packaged to appear larger than they were, or packaged to appear to have a higher concentration of food.&lt;ref&gt;Junod 176&lt;/ref&gt;

This began to worry high-quality producers who worried that their products might be undermined by deceitful goods.&lt;ref name="Swann 10"&gt;Swann 10&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers felt threatened by unfair competition as shady producers adulterated "[[fertilizer]]s, deodorized rotten eggs, revived rancid butter, and substituted glucose for [[honey]]".&lt;ref name="Young 18"/&gt;  Real strawberry jam producers felt threatened by the bad strawberry “spread” substitutes, since consumers could not tell the difference while buying.&lt;ref name="Young 18"/&gt;

===Court response===
The first court case involving "adulterated" products was in 1886, in which farmers pitted quote “the reigning champion, [[butter]], against a challenger, [[Margarine|oleomargarine]]. Butter won and oleomargarine was taxed".&lt;ref name="Young 17"/&gt;  "Adulterated" products often used chemicals or additives to mask poor quality wheat, [[sour milk]], or meat gone bad.&lt;ref name="Swann 10"/&gt; In response, these "unethical" companies asserted that it was a consumer’s duty to protect themselves from shoddy products.&lt;ref name="Swann 10"/&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration|Division of Chemistry]] started looking into the adulteration of agricultural commodities around 1867, and in 1883 [[Harvey Washington Wiley]] was appointed chief chemist.

===Provisions of the act===
The law "forbade interstate and foreign commerce in adulterated and misbranded food and drugs".&lt;ref name="Young 21"/&gt; If a product was found to be in violation, it could be seized and condemned; if a seller was found violating they could be fined and jailed. The law did not define food standards by chemists, but it did prohibit the "adulteration of food by the removal of valuable constituents, the substitution of ingredients so as to reduce quality, the addition of deleterious ingredients and the use of spoiled animal and vegetable products".&lt;ref name="Young 21"/&gt;  Misleading or [[False advertising|false labeling]] was now considered misbranding and thus illegal.

===Effects of the act===
The 1906 US Pure Food and Drug Act “defined food adulterations as a danger to health and as consumer fraud”.&lt;ref&gt;Junod 167&lt;/ref&gt; The “[[Meat Inspection Act]],” which accompanied the law, made tax payers pay for the new regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Schesinger 205&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Chemistry was transformed into a regulatory body charged with regulating packaging, labeling and protecting the consumer. The jam industry was one of the first to be subject to regulation. If a jam did not fit a certain standard of fruit-to-sugar-to-pectin ratio, it bore a “Compound Jam” label. After World War One, these companies, like BRED-SPRED, started aggressive marketing campaigns and attractive packaging to promote themselves. Branded with ‘distinctive names’ like “Peanut Spread” and “Salad Bouquet,” they sold a weak product (like a low ratio of peanuts, or weak vinegar) as  high-quality substitutes. Similar deceptive labeling in canned foods prompted the [[McNary-Mapes Amendment]] in 1930 which “authorized standards of quality, condition, and/or fill-of-containers.” If a product was sub-standard, it had to display a ‘crepe label’ which read ‘below US standard, low quality, but not illegal’.&lt;ref&gt;Schesinger 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Chambers of Horrors===
Aided by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], the "American Chamber of Horrors" helped illuminate the deficiencies in the old 1906 Act. Launched in 1933 with the book ''[[100,000,000 Guinea Pigs]]'' by [[Arthur Kallet]] and [[Frederick J. Schlink]], the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) put on an exhibit to illustrate the need for a new law. Eleanor Roosevelt toured it to help elevate its status as a public relations tool. It showed jars with deceptive labeling and packaging which, in the case of jarred chicken, hid dark meat and was jarred in deceptive containers which seemed larger than they were.

Included were examples of harmful drugs, including Banbar, a “cure” for [[diabetes]], protected under the 1906 law, and Lash Lure, an [[mascara|eyelash dye]] that caused many of its women users to go blind.&lt;ref&gt;Swann 12&lt;/ref&gt; Also legal under the old law was Raditor, a “[[radium]]-containing tonic that sentenced users to a slow and painful death.” This, along with the above court cases, caused the FDA to focus on replacing the now outdated “Wiley Act” of 1906.

==The Pure Foods Movement==
The Pure Foods Movement of the 1870s was a [[grass-roots movement]] creating the "principal source of political support for the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906".&lt;ref name="Janssen 24"/&gt; It was a coalition of many different groups,  which is why it became so influential.&lt;ref name="Young 19"&gt;Young 19&lt;/ref&gt; The following explains the influential groups and individuals involved, as it was not an official coalition, rather a movement created by different individual interests.

===Impact of women's clubs===
The Ladies Health Association was the first women's group to join the pure foods movement.&lt;ref name="Goodwin 17"&gt;Goodwin 17&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1884, they began a campaign to rid [[New York City]] of unsanitary [[slaughter house]]s.&lt;ref name="Goodwin 17"/&gt; These women were "energized to take legal action almost as much by the attitude of the city bureaucrats [who were apathetic] was by the need to protect their families and the neighborhood".&lt;ref name="Goodwin 18"&gt;Goodwin 18&lt;/ref&gt; If the city agency in charge of regulating slaughterhouses had been willing to listen to the Association and clean up the slaughterhouses, the women would have never continued their crusade.&lt;ref name="Goodwin 18"/&gt; However, after a hearing, a slaughterhouse owner refused to clean up his property and this caused the women to pursue the execution of the penalty and continue a "constant vigilance" to keep it from happening again.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the Association, 11 other city health protective associations grew out of the need to clean up [[Feedlot|stockyards]] and slaughterhouses. In [[Louisiana]], Mrs. Richard Bloor took individual action and visited a packinghouse and afterwards "sent a description of the conditions to [[Upton Sinclair]] to use in his exposés of the meat industry".&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 22&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) was borne out of a need to protect communities from alcohol abuse and worked mostly on the local level.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Working mostly only on a local level, they set the tone for the Pure Food movement that would soon follow. Many club women were heavily involved in the [[temperance movement]] and began to associate adulterated foods as having the same consequences as [[alcohol abuse]]. This is because both inflicted harm on communities.  Both were common abuses prevalent in poor communities, and led to [[Malnutrition|malnourishment]], violence and other social problems. Women’s organizations began addressing these issues and broadened their activities beyond normal WCTU activities and more women who wanted to protect their communities joined their cause.&lt;ref name="Goodwin 35"&gt;Goodwin 35&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the WCTU, the [[Ladies Health Association]], and women's clubs laid the foundation for further "pure food, drink, and drug campaigns in the early 1880s, while their activities centered around study, self-improvement, and philanthropy".&lt;ref name="Goodwin 35"/&gt;

===Harvey W. Wiley===
[[Harvey W. Wiley]] became the leader of the pure foods crusade. When Wiley was appointed, he decidedly set the Division of Chemistry in a different direction.&lt;ref name="Swann 10"/&gt; He expanded the Division's research and conducted the Foods and Food Adulterants study, which demonstrated his concern about [[chemicals]] used in food. He also created the "Poison Squad" experiments, in which young, healthy men volunteered to ingest food additive chemicals to determine their impact on human health.&lt;ref name="Swann 10"/&gt; Wiley unified many different concerned groups, including state inspectors, the General Federation of Women's Clubs, journalists, reform wing of business, congress members and associations of physicians and pharmacists.&lt;ref name="Young 19"/&gt; As Wiley worked to bring awareness to the pure foods crusades, it gained momentum and legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Young 19"/&gt; His "poison squad" brought national awareness to the problem, whereas women's groups brought local attention to the cause.

===Upton Sinclair and ''The Jungle''===
In 1906, [[Upton Sinclair]] published ''[[The Jungle]]'', a book which exposed the filthy conditions of [[Chicago]] [[slaughterhouse]]s. Sinclair wrote the book while living in Chicago; he talked to workers and their families and his focus was the plight of the workers. However, the book turned people away from "tubercular beef" instead of turning them [[socialist]] like Sinclair wanted.&lt;ref name="Goodwin 250"&gt;Goodwin 250&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a best seller and the public outcry prompted President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to send officials to investigate.&lt;ref name="Goodwin 250"/&gt; Their “report was so shocking that its publication would ‘be well-nigh ruinous to our export trade in meat’”.&lt;ref&gt;Garraty 591&lt;/ref&gt; This report, Neill-Reynolds, underscored the terrible conditions illustrated by Sinclair.&lt;ref name="Goodwin 251"&gt;Goodwin 251&lt;/ref&gt; It indicated a need for "'a drastic and thorogooing [sic]' federal inspection of all stockyards, packinghouses and their products".&lt;ref name="Goodwin 251"/&gt; ''The Jungle'', combined with the shocking reports of the Neill-Reynolds Report (published June 1906) proved to be the final push to help the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] move quickly through congress.

==The Federal Food, Drug  and Cosmetic Act of 1938==
The Federal [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]] was signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on June 25, 1938.&lt;ref name="Janssen 28"&gt;Janssen 28&lt;/ref&gt; The first attempt at reform, The “Tugwell Bill” was a “legislative disaster”.&lt;ref name="Janssen 28"/&gt; Spurred by public outcry from the [[Elixir Sulfanilamide]] disaster (in which 100 people were killed because under the 1906 law, “premarketing toxicity testing was not required”), congress rushed to enact a new bill.&lt;ref&gt;Wax 1, Janssen 28&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the Elixar disaster, the bill itself was not subject to much public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Cavers 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provisions of the act===
This resulted in the 1938 [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]] which “pioneered policies designed to protect the pocketbooks of consumers and food standards were enacted to ensure the ‘value expected’ of consumers”.&lt;ref&gt;Junod 180&lt;/ref&gt; “It changed the drug focus of the Food and Drug Administration from that of a policing agency primarily concerned with the confiscation of adulterated drugs to a [[regulatory agency]] increasingly involved with overseeing the evaluation of new drugs”.&lt;ref&gt;Wax 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes from the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act===
The following is a list of substantial changes from the previous 1906 law&lt;ref&gt;Janssen 29&lt;/ref&gt;
* Drug manufacturers were required to provide scientific proof that new products could be safely used before putting them on the market.
* Cosmetics and therapeutic devices were regulated, for the first time.
* Proof of fraud was no longer required to stop false claims for drugs.
* Addition of poisonous substances to foods was prohibited except where unavoidable or required in production. Safe tolerances were authorized for residues of such substances, for example [[pesticide]]s.
* Specific authority was provided for factory inspections.
* Food standards were required to be set up when needed “to promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.”

The '''Factories Act,1948''' (Act No. 63 of 1948), as amended by the Factories (Amendment) Act, 1987 (Act 20 of 1987)), serves to assist in formulating national policies in India with respect to [[occupational safety and health]] in factories and docks in India. It deals with various problems concerning safety, health, efficiency and well-being of the persons at work places.

The Act is administered by the [[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)|Ministry of Labour and Employment]] in India through its Directorate General Factory Advice Service &amp; Labour Institutes (DGFASLI) and by the State Governments through their factory inspectorates. DGFASLI advises the Central and State Governments on administration of the Factories Act and coordinating the factory inspection services in the States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.india.gov.in/business/legal_aspects/factories_act.php]; archive.india.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The  Act is applicable to any factory using power &amp; employing 10 or more workers and if not using power, employing 20 or more workers on any day of the preceding twelve months, and in any part of which a manufacturing process is being carried on with the aid of power, or is ordinarily so carried on, or whereon twenty or more workers are working, or were working on any day of the preceding twelve months, and in any part of which a manufacturing process is being carried on without the aid of power, or is ordinarily so carried on; but this does not include a mine, or a mobile unit belonging to the armed forces of the union, a railway running shed or a hotel, restaurant or eating place.

'''Health technology''' is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as the "application of organized knowledge and skills in the form of devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology, Health|url=http://www.who.int/topics/technology_medical/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes pharmaceuticals, devices, procedures, and organizational systems used in the healthcare industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=INAHTA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment). | title=HTA glossary. | url=http://www.inahta.org/HTA/Glossary/#_Health_technology | date=June 8, 2009 | publisher=INAHTA | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526014500/http://www.inahta.org/HTA/Glossary/#_Health_technology | archivedate=May 26, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as computer-supported [[information system]]s. In the United States, these technologies involve standardized physical objects, as well as traditional and designed social means and methods to treat or care for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=United States Health Care Policymaking: Ideological, Social and Cultural Differences and Major Influences|last=Ubokudom|first=Sunday|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC|year=2012|isbn=9781461431688|location=New York|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical technology==
Medical technology, or "medtech", encompasses a wide range of [[health care|healthcare]] products and is used to treat diseases and medical conditions affecting [[human]]s. Such technologies are intended to improve the quality of healthcare delivered through earlier [[diagnosis]], less invasive [[Therapy|treatment]] options and reduction in [[hospital]] stays and [[physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=ADVAMED (Advanced Medical Technology Association). | title=What is Medical Technology? | url=http://www.advamed.org/MemberPortal/About/NewsRoom/MediaKits/whatismedtechnology.htm | date=January 7, 2009 | publisher=ADVAMED | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107054859/http://www.advamed.org/MemberPortal/About/NewsRoom/MediaKits/whatismedtechnology.htm | archivedate=January 7, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances in medical technology have also focused on cost reduction.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Medical technology may broadly include [[medical device]]s, [[information technology]], [[biotechnology|biotech]], and healthcare services.

The impacts of medical technology involve social and ethical issues. For example, physicians can seek objective information from technology rather than read subjective patient reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5978/570.1.short |title=The Impacts of Innovation |author=Richard S. Mathis |date=30 April 2010 |volume=328 |issue=5978  |work=Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major driver of the sector's growth is the consumerization of medtech. Supported by the widespread availability of smartphones and tablets, providers are able to reach a large audience at low cost, a trend that stands to be consolidated as wearable technologies spread throughout the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is driving the growth of medtech in the UK?|url = https://www.hottopics.ht/stories/health/what-is-driving-the-growth-of-medtech-in-the-uk/|website = Hot Topics|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 2010-2015, venture funding has grown&amp;nbsp;200%, allowing US$11.7 billion to flow into health tech businesses from&amp;nbsp;over 30,000&amp;nbsp;investors in the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hottopics.ht/stories/health/what-is-health-tech/|title=What is Health Tech and how will it evolve?|date=2016-06-30|publisher=Hot Topics|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
[[File:Razer OSVR Open-Source Virtual Reality for Gaming (16863422875).jpg|thumb|Virtual reality headset]]
Companies such as Surgical Theater, provide new technology capable of capturing 3D virtual images of patients' brains to use as practice for operations. [[3D printing]] allows medical companies to produce prototypes to practice on before an operation created with artificial tissue.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huotilainen|first=Eero|last2=Paloheimo|first2=Markku|displayauthors=et al.|date=|year=2014|title=Imaging requirements for medical applications of additive manufacturing|url=|journal=Acta Radiologica|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=55|issue=1|pages=78–85|doi=10.1177/0284185113494198|issn=0284-1851|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical [[virtual reality]] provides doctors multiple surgical scenarios that could happen and allows them to practice and prepare themselves for these situations. It also permits medical students a hands on experience of different procedures without the consequences of making potential mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/virtual-patient-simulation-market-analysis-and-trends--technology-haptic-technology3-dimensional-technology-and-virtual-reality-technology-product---forecast-to-2025-300380751.html|title=Virtual Patient Simulation Market Analysis and Trends- Technology (Haptic Technology,3 Dimensional Technology and Virtual Reality Technology), Product – Forecast to 2025|last=Reportlinker|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://oramavr.com ORamaVR] is one of the leading companies that employs such medical virtual reality technologies to transform medical education (knowledge) and training (skills) in order to improve patient outcomes, reduce surgical errors and training time and democratise medical education and training.

== Privacy of health data ==
Phones that can track one's whereabouts, steps and more can serve as medical devices, and medical devices have much the same effect as these phones. In the research article, ''Privacy Attitudes among Early Adopters of Emerging Health Technologies'' by Cynthia Cheung, Matthew Bietz, Kevin Patrick and Cinnamon Bloss discovered people were willing to share personal data for scientific advancements, although they still expressed uncertainty about who would have access to their data. People are naturally cautious about giving out sensitive personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheung|first=Cynthia|last2=Bietz|first2=Matthew J.|last3=Patrick|first3=Kevin|last4=Bloss|first4=Cinnamon S.|date=2016-11-10|title=Privacy Attitudes among Early Adopters of Emerging Health Technologies|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166389|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=11|issue=11|pages=e0166389|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0166389|issn=1932-6203|via=EBSChost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the [[Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015|Medical Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA)]] was passed which will be put into play in 2018 pushing towards electronic health records. ''Health Information Technology: Integration, Patient Empowerment, and Security'' by K. Marvin provided multiple different polls based on people's views on different types of technology entering the medical field most answers where responded with somewhat likely and very few completely disagreed on technology being used in medicine. Marvin discusses the maintenance required to protect medical data and technology against [[Cyberattack|cyber attacks]] as well as providing a proper data backup system for the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marvin|first=Kevin|year=2017|title=Health Information Technology: Integration, Patient Empowerment, and Security|journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy|volume=74|issue=2|pages=36–38|issn=1079-2082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ObamaCare|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) also known as Obamacare]] and health information technology health care is entering the digital era. Although with this development it needs to be protected. Both health information and financial information now made digital within the health industry might become a larger target for cybercrime. Even with multiple different types of safeguards hackers some how still find their way in so the security that is in place needs to constantly be updated to prevent these breaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kruse|first=Clemens Scott|last2=Frederick|first2=Benjamin|last3=Jacobson|first3=Taylor|last4=Monticone|first4=D. Kyle|date=2017-01-01|title=Cybersecurity in healthcare: A systematic review of modern threats and trends|url=http://www.medra.org/servlet/aliasResolver?alias=iospress&amp;doi=10.3233/THC-161263|journal=Technology and Health Care|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.3233/thc-161263|issn=0928-7329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allied professions==
The term medical technology may also refer to the duties performed by clinical [[laboratory]] professionals in various settings within the public and private sectors. The work of these professionals encompass clinical applications of [[chemistry]],  [[genetics]], [[hematology]], [[immunohaematology|immunohematology]] ([[blood bank]]ing), [[immunology]], [[microbiology]], [[serology]], [[urinalysis]] and miscellaneous [[body fluid]] analysis. Depending on location, educational level and certifying body, these professionals may be referred to as [[biomedical scientist]]s, [[medical laboratory scientist]]s (MLS),  [[Medical laboratory scientist|medical technologist]]s (MT), [[medical laboratory]] technologists and medical laboratory technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velezcollege.com/?page_id=97|title=Medical Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology testing ==
All medical equipment introduced commercially must meet both United States and international regulations. The devices are tested on their material, effects on the human body, all components including devices that have other devices included with them, and the mechanical aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Role of the Study Director in Nonclinical Studies: Pharmaceutical, Chemicals, Medical Devices, and Pesticides|last=Dooley|first=J.|last2=Kopia|first2=G.|year=2014|chapter=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of the Food and Drug Administration|Medical device user fee and modernization act]] of 2002 was created to make the [[FDA]] hurry up on their approval process of medical technology. By introducing sponsor user fees for a faster review time with predetermined performance target for review time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercatus.org/publication/effects-medical-device-user-fee-and-modernization-act-fda-review-times|title=Effects of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act on FDA Review Times for Medical Devices|date=2016-04-04|work=Mercatus Center|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

36 devices and apps were approved by the [[FDA]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Qahwaji |first1=Rami |title=Data-Driven Healthcare |date=2018 |publisher=Institution of Engineering and Technology |location=London |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of technology ==
Medical technology has evolved into smaller portable devices, for instance smartphones, touchscreens, tablets, laptops, [[Electronic paper|digital ink]], voice and [[Facial recognition system|face recognition]] and more. With this technology, innovations like [[Electronic health record|electronic health records (EHR)]], [[health information exchange (HIE)]], [[Nationwide Health Information Network|Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN)]], [[Personal health record|personal health records (PHRs)]], [[patient portal]]s, [[nanomedicine]], genome-based personalized medicine, [[Global Positioning System|Geographical Positioning System (GPS)]], [[radio frequency identification]] (RFID), [[telemedicine]], [[clinical decision support]] (CDS), mobile home health care and [[cloud computing]] came to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pjms.com.pk/index.php/pjms/article/view/5211|title=Emerging 21st Century Medical Technologies|last=Bajwa|first=Mohammad|date=2014-05-31|website=Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences|pages=649–655|language=en|doi=10.12669/pjms.303.5211|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3D printing can be used to produce specialized [[Splint (medicine)|splints]], [[Prosthesis|prostheses]], parts for medical devices and inert implants. The end goal of 3D printing is being able to print out customized replaceable body parts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Assessment ==
The concept of health technology assessment (HTA) was first coined in 1967 by the U.S. Congress in response to the increasing need to address the unintended and potential consequences of health technology, along with its prominent role in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Health Technology Assessment and Health Policy-making in Europe: Current Status, Challenges and Potential|last=Garrido|first=Marcial|last2=Kristensen|first2=Finn|last3=Nielsen|first3=Camilla|last4=Busse|first4=Reinhard|publisher=Wolrd Health Organization|year=2008|isbn=9789289042932|location=Copenhagen|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was further institutionalized with the establishment of the congressional [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (OTA) in 1972-1973. HTA is defined as a comprehensive form of policy research that examines short- and long-term consequences of the application of technology, including benefits, costs, and risks.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chile: The Adult Health Policy Challenge|last=World Bank|first=|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=1995|isbn=0821332244|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the broad scope of technology assessment, it requires the participation of individuals besides scientists and health care practitioners such as managers and even the consumers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There are several American organizations that provide health technology assessments and these include the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] through its VA Technology Assessment Program (VATAP). The models adopted by these institutions vary, although they focus on whether a medical technology being offered is therapeutically relevant.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Health Technology Assessments by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence: A Qualitative Study|last=Schlander|first=Michael|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2007|isbn=9780387719955|location=New York|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 2007 noted that the assessments still did not use formal economic analyses.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Aside from its development, however, assessment in the health technology industry has been viewed as sporadic and fragmented&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Healthcare Politics and Policy in America: 2014|last=Patel|first=Kant|last2=Rushefsky|first2=Mark|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780765626042|location=Oxon|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues such as the determination of products that needed to be developed, cost, and access, among others, also emerged. These - some argue - need to be included in the assessment since health technology is never purely a matter of science but also of beliefs, values, and ideologies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; One of the mechanisms being suggested – either as an element of- or an alternative to the current TAs is [[bioethics]], which is also referred to as the "fourth-generation" evaluation framework.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of the Ethics of New Technologies|last=Chadwick|first=Ruth|publisher=Academic Press|year=2001|isbn=0121663558|location=San Diego, CA|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least two dimensions to an ethical HTA. The first involves the incorporation of ethics in the methodological standards employed to assess technologies while the second is concerned with the use of ethical framework in research and judgment on the part of the researchers who produce information used in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Roots of Bioethics: Health, Progress, Technology, Death|last=Callahan|first=Daniel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199931378|location=New York|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monitoring one's health ==
Smartphones, [[Tablet computer|tablets]], and [[wearable computer]]s have allowed people to monitor their own health. These devices run numerous applications that are designed to provide simple [[Health care|health services]] and the monitoring of one's health.  An example of this is [[Fitbit]], a fitness tracker that is worn on the user's wrist. This wearable technology allows people to track their steps, heart rate, floors climbed, miles walked, active minutes, and even sleep patterns. The data collected and analyzed allow users not just to keep track of their own health but also help manage it, particularly through its capability to identify health risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Healthcare Ethics and Training: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|last=Information Resources Management Association|first=|publisher=IGI Global|year=2017|isbn=9781522522379|location=Hershey, PA|pages=482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the case of the Internet, which serves as a repository of information and expert content that can be used to "self-diagnose"  instead of going to their doctor. For instance, one need only enumerate symptoms as search parameters at [[Google]] and the [[Web search engine|search engine]] could identify the illness from the list of contents  uploaded to the world wide web, particularly those provided by expert/medical sources. These advance may eventually have some effect on doctor visits from patients&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21736138-welcome-doctor-you-revolution-health-care-coming|title=A revolution in health care is coming|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and change the role of the health professionals from "gatekeeper to [[Health care|secondary care]] to facilitator of information interpretation and decision-making."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emotions, Technology, and Health|last=Tettegah|first=Sharon|last2=Garcia|first2=Yolanda Evie|publisher=Academic Press|year=2016|isbn=9780128017371|location=London|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from basic services provided by Google in [[Google Search|Search]], there are also companies such as [[WebMD]] or [[Infermedica]] with its product Symptomate that already offer dedicated symptom-checking apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/20/11978338/google-symptom-search-app-web-md-health-doctor|title=Google will help your self-diagnosis with new symptom search|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hedonophobia is formally defined as the fear of experiencing pleasure. 'Hedon' or 'hedone' comes from ancient Greek, meaning 'pleasure' + fear: 'phobia'. Hedonophobia is the inability to enjoy pleasurable experiences, and is often a persistent [[malady]]. Diagnosis of the condition is usually related to the age of 'maturity' in each country where the syndrome exists. For instance, in the US a person must be 18 years old to be considered an adult,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ageofconsent.net/highest-and-lowest|title=What are the Highest and Lowest Ages of Consent?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Canada he or she must be 18 or 19 years old, depending on the province of residence. Globally, the ages range from (+/-) 12 to 24&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chartsbin.com/view/hxj|title=Minimum Legal Age of Consent - Female|first=|last=ChartsBin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; years and are mainly determined by traditional ethical practices from previous societies. High anxiety, panic attacks, and extreme fear are symptoms that can result from anticipating pleasure of any kind. Expecting or anticipating pleasure at some point in the future can also trigger an attack.

Hedonophobics have a type of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about feeling pleasure or experiencing pleasurable sensations, due to a cultural background or training (either religious or cultural) that eschews pleasurable pursuits as frivolous or inappropriate. Oftentimes, social guilt is connected to having fun while others are suffering, and is common for those who feel undeserving or have self-worth issues to work through. Also, there is a sense that they shouldn't be given pleasures due to their lack of performance in life, and because they have done things that are deemed "wrong" or "undeserving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcounseling.com/library/hedonophobia-symptoms-and-causes-of-hedonophobia-treatment/|title=Hedonophobia – Symptoms and Causes of Hedonophobia – Treatment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine the depth of the diagnosis for those who suffer from hedonophobia, background is crucial. For example, when a child is taught that a strong work ethic is all that makes them worthy of the good things in life, guilt becomes a motivator to move away from pleasure when they begin to experience it. The individual learns that pleasures are bad, and feeling good is not as sanctified as being empathetic towards those who suffer.

C.B.T. ([[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]]) is an effective approach to the resolution of past beliefs that infiltrate and affect the sufferer's current responses to various situations. Medication is only necessary when there is an interference in the person's normal daily functioning. Various techniques are used by those afflicted with the condition to hide, camouflage or mask their aversion to pleasure.

Any relationship that includes things that are pleasurable is re-established when the sufferer learns that he is not worthy of anything pleasurable, or that he only deserves the opposite of those things which are pleasurable. A disconnect is necessary to determine the sufferer's lack of ability to intervene in the overall process.

'''Ligneous conjunctivitis''' is a rare form of chronic [[conjunctivitis]] characterized by recurrent, [[fibrin]]-rich pseudomembranous [[lesions]] of wood-like consistency that develop mainly on the underside of the eyelid ([[conjunctiva#Gross anatomy|tarsal conjunctiva]]).&lt;ref name=pubmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schuster | first1 = V. | last2 = Seregard | first2 = S. | title = Ligneous conjunctivitis | journal = Survey of ophthalmology | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 369–388 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12850227 | doi=10.1016/s0039-6257(03)00056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally a [[systemic disease]] which may involve the periodontal tissue, the upper and lower respiratory tract, kidneys, middle ear, and female genitalia.&lt;ref name=Orpha&gt;{{cite web|title=Ligneous conjunctivitis|url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&amp;Expert=97231|publisher=Orphanet|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be sight-threatening,&lt;ref name=Orpha/&gt; and death can occasionally occur from pulmonary involvement.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

{{nihongo|'''Miyuki Ishikawa'''|石川 ミユキ|''Ishikawa Miyuki''|extra=born 1897, date of death unknown}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[midwife]] and [[serial killer]] who is believed to have murdered many infants with the aid of several accomplices throughout the 1940s. It is estimated that her victims numbered between 85 and 169, however the general estimate is 103.&lt;ref name="mugen"&gt;{{cite web | author= | script-title=ja:寿産院事件 | publisher=無限回廊 | language=Japanese | url=http://www.alpha-net.ne.jp/users2/knight9/kotobuki.htm | date= | accessdate=2007-11-14|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717211837/http://www.alpha-net.ne.jp/users2/knight9/kotobuki.htm|archivedate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was finally apprehended, the [[Tokyo High Court]]'s four-year sentence she received was remarkably light considering that Miyuki's actions resulted in a death toll so high that it remains unrivaled by any other [[Japanese serial killers|serial killer in Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} According to a report of [[Children's Rainbow Center]], writer {{nihongo|Kenji Yamamoto|山本健治|Yamamoto Kenji}} referred to the incident as ''unbelievable and unbearable''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.crc-japan.net/contents/guidance/pdf_data/h15research.pdf 虐待の援助法に関する文献研究 （第1報：1970年代まで）]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ishikawa was born in [[Kunitomi, Miyazaki|Kunitomi]], [[Miyazaki Prefecture]] and graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]]. She later married Takeshi Ishikawa. The relationship did not produce any children.

She worked as a hospital director in the {{nihongo|Kotobuki maternity hospital|寿産院|''Kotobuki San-in''}} and was an experienced midwife.

== Infanticide of at least 103 newborns ==
In the 1940s, there were many babies in her maternity hospital, and Miyuki Ishikawa found herself facing what she perceived to be something of a quandary. The parents of many of these infants were poor and unable to raise their children properly without financial struggle, and she herself was unable to help the infants because of a lack of social and charitable services.

In order to solve this dilemma, Ishikawa chose to neglect numerous infants, many of whom died as a direct result of this abuse. The exact number of victims is unknown, but it is estimated that she killed at least 103 babies.&lt;ref name="mugen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/koseki-t/yougo2.html |script-title=ja:養護施設の子どもたち・・・・・・児童と福祉に関連するできごと |author=Takashi Koseki |language=Japanese |accessdate=2008-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211225216/http://homepage3.nifty.com/koseki-t/yougo2.html |archivedate=February 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage2.nifty.com/kousinren/nenhyo/nenpyo4/1948.htm|script-title=ja:1948年|publisher=Kousinren|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of the other midwives employed by the ''Kotobuki'' maternity hospital were disgusted by this practice and resigned from their positions.

Later she also attempted to garner payment for these murders. She and her husband Takeshi solicited large sums of money from the parents, claiming that it would be less than the actual expense of raising these unwanted children. A doctor, Shiro Nakayama, was also complicit in this scheme and aided the couple by falsifying death certificates. The [[Shinjuku]] ward office ignored their actions.

== Prior incidents ==
Similar cases had occurred in Japan before this incident. The people of [[Itabashi, Tokyo|Itabashi]] were accused in 1930 of murdering 41 foster children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] | script-title=ja:岩ノ坂もらい子殺し発覚 | publisher= | language=Japanese | url=http://www.c20.jp/1930/04iwaks.html | date= | accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hatsutarō Kawamata]] was arrested in 1933 for murdering at least 25 foster children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| script-title=ja:目黒もらい子殺し| publisher=誰か昭和を想わざる| language=Japanese| url=http://www.geocities.jp/showahistory/history01/08c.html| date=| accessdate=2007-12-22| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ko1GNPjC?url=http://www.geocities.jp/showahistory/history01/08c.html| archivedate=2009-10-26| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese government was aware of this crisis, but did nothing.

Japanese tradition also disputed the rights of infants. Cases of infanticide by a parent had typically been regarded as bodily injury resulting in death under the [[Criminal Code of Japan]] until 1907.

== Arrest and trial ==
[[Image:Report of Kotobuki Sanin.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Asahi Shimbun]] on January 17, 1948, describing their suspicion for 169 murders and her admitting "[[malice aforethought]]".]]
Two police officers from the Waseda police station accidentally found the remains of five of Ishikawa's victims on January 12, 1948. Autopsies performed on the bodies of the five babies proved that they had not died of natural causes. She and Takeshi were arrested on January 15, 1948.

The victims were [[child abandonment|deserted children]], and so she insisted that parents were responsible for their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=yabusaka | script-title=ja:寿産院もらい子殺し事件 | publisher=オワリナキアクム | language=Japanese | url=http://yabusaka.moo.jp/kotobuki.htm | date= | accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public supported the assertion, but [[Yuriko Miyamoto]] criticized them, saying it was an example of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mirror.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000311/files/15985_28853.html|script-title=ja:"生れた権利"をうばうな|author=[[Yuriko Miyamoto]]|publisher=[[Aozora Bunko]]|language=Japanese|date=1948-01-23|accessdate=2008-02-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722105512/http://mirror.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000311/files/15985_28853.html|archivedate=2011-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon further investigation the police found over 40 dead bodies in the house of a mortician. Thirty corpses were later discovered in a temple. The sheer number of dead bodies recovered and the length of time over which the murders took place made it difficult for the authorities to determine the exact number of victims. Consequently, the exact death toll remains unknown.

The authorities viewed her homicides as a [[crime of omission]]. In the [[Tokyo District Court]], Ishikawa was sentenced to eight years in prison, Takeshi and Dr. Shiro Nakayama were each sentenced to four years imprisonment. The couple appealed their sentences and in 1952 the [[Tokyo High Court]] revoked the original sentence and sentenced Ishikawa to four years in prison and Takeshi to two years.

== Aftermath ==
This incident is regarded as the principal reason the Japanese Government began to consider the legalisation of [[abortion in Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web|url= http://dspace.wul.waseda.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2065/306/5/Honbun-02chapter01.pdf |title=第1章 少子化社会に至るまでの経緯と少子化問題への対応 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(103&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | script-title=ja:第１４７回国会　国民福祉委員会　第１０号 | publisher=[[National Diet Library]] | language=Japanese | url=http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/sangiin/147/0008/14703150008010a.html | date=2000-03-15 | accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons this incident was thought to have occurred was as the result of an increase in the number of unwanted infants born in Japan. On July 13, 1948, the Eugenic Protection Law (now the Mother's Body Protection Law) and a national examination system for midwives was established. On June 24, 1949, abortion for economic reasons was legalised under the Eugenic Protection Law in Japan.

[[Ultrasound]] can be [[modulation|modulated]] to carry an audio signal (like radio signals are modulated). This is often used to carry messages underwater, in [[underwater diving]] communicators, and short-range (under five miles) communication with [[submarine]]s; the received ultrasound signal is decoded into audible sound by a modulated-ultrasound receiver. A modulated ultrasound receiver is a device that receives a modulated ultrasound signal and [[Code|decode]]s it for use as sound, navigational-position information, etc. Its function is somewhat like that of a [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]].

==Range limitation==
Due to the absorption characteristics of seawater, ultrasound (sound at frequencies greater than human hearing, or approximately greater than 20,000 hertz) is not used for long-range underwater communications.  The higher the frequency, the faster the sound is absorbed by the seawater, and the more quickly the signal fades.  For this reason, most underwater "telephones" either operate in "baseband" mode (at the same frequency as the voice and is basically a loudspeaker), in a "[[UQC]]-1" mode (as defined in [[MIL-C-15240D]]) with a modulated carrier of 7,500&amp;nbsp;Hz, or in "UQC-2" mode (as defined in [[MIL-C-22509]]) from around 8,500 hertz to approximately 12,000 hertz, or in the later "WQC-2" mode from 8,500 hertz to approximately 100,000 hertz - with most use around 32,500 hertz) (Also see NATO STANAG-1074 ED.4 for descriptions of internationally used frequencies.)

See [[Sound from ultrasound]] for modulated ultrasound that can make its carried signal audible without needing a receiver set.

'''Mumm-Ra''' is a fictional character and the primary [[antagonist]] of the ''[[ThunderCats]]'' franchise. He is an [[undead]] evil [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] bound to the servitude of four malevolent, godlike entities known as the [[Ancient Spirits of Evil]]. Native to the planet of [[Third Earth (ThunderCats)|Third Earth]], Mumm-Ra's goal is to destroy the ThunderCats and ensure his world remains under his control.

==Fictional character biography==

===1985 series===

During development of the show, the creators were looking for various names for the main villain character, nothing sounded "evil" enough, not until [[Haim Saban]] suggested to use Mummia Raa (A Bad Mummy in Hebrew), it was shortened to Mumm-Ra and the rest is history .

The demon sorcerer Mumm-Ra is the self-proclaimed "ever-living source of evil" on Third Earth, having powers of sorcery and an apparently unlimited lifespan. He is, in fact, a bound servant to the Ancient Spirits of Evil (represented by four anthropomorphic statues of a boar, crocodile, vulture, and ox thus resembling oversized twisted mockeries of Egyptian [[canopic jars]], within the burial chamber of his pyramid), who provide him with increased power and virtual immortality to further his pursuit of spreading their dark influence throughout Third Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Thunder Thursdays: Know Your ThunderCats!|work= [[IGN]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/117/1176532p2.html|accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residing within the Black Pyramid amid the ruins of what appears to be an [[ancient Egypt]]ian civilization, Mumm-Ra exists in a decayed, weakened form that must return to a stone sarcophagus to replenish his energy. He can summon the power to transform himself into a more vigorous and muscular form - Mumm-Ra, the Ever-Living - by reciting the incantation: "''Ancient Spirits of Evil, transform this decayed form to Mumm-Ra, the Ever-Living!''". While in this form, Mumm-Ra possesses fortification of his mystical might — casting spells, throwing energy bolts, etc. — to battle his foes.  He can also alter his physical form into a variety of alter-egos to deceive his enemies.

Seemingly invincible in whatever form he chooses, Mumm-Ra appears to have a singular weakness: seeing his own hideous reflection neutralizes his ability to remain outside the Black Pyramid and forces him to withdraw there in his emaciated mummy form. However, at the beginning of the second season, the Ancient Spirits of Evil overcame this shortcoming. Mumm-Ra is a master of deception, and will use whatever means necessary to fight against the forces of good. In later episodes, while endowing Mumm-Ra with his powers, the statues of the Ancient Spirits of Evil came down from their perches, and extend their arms over him.

He uses his magic to create disguises and deceive the ThunderCats on various occasions. Among these are: Diamondfly (in the episode "Queen of Eight Legs"), Gregory Gregion ("All That Glitters"), Silky ("The Garden of Delights"), The Netherwitch ("The Astral Prison"), and Pumm-Ra (in the episode "Pumm-Ra"). He once took the form of [[King Arthur]] to acquire the legendary magic sword [[Excalibur]], using it against the Sword of Omens.

In a few episodes, Mumm-Ra has an even more powerful form beyond "Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living" called "Mumm-Ra the All-Powerful": in this manifestation, Mumm-Ra absorbs the entire power of the Ancient Spirits of Evil to become grander in size and strength, and the design pattern on his loin cloth changes, as does his voice. This form is only presented in the series three times. In another incarnation, calling himself "Mumm-Ra the Dream Master," he is able to enter dreams to subliminally influence the ThunderCats in their sleep as a form of mind control.

Mumm-Ra is regarded as immortal, and when defeated, he simply returns to his sarcophagus. Mumm-Ra cannot be truly killed; even in cases where his body is destroyed, he will eventually be restored, as he often states: "Wherever evil exists, Mumm-Ra lives!"

Later, Mumm-Ra is shown to have a blue [[undead]], [[bulldog]]-like companion named Ma-Mutt, capable of flight and supernatural feats of strength and speed. He is generally evil, though some episodes depict him as having sympathetic qualities. Ma-Mutt is the only living creature Mumm-Ra shows any compassion and love for - in one episode, after the machine he was using in his evil plan was destroyed, he frantically searched for Ma-Mutt, and upon finding him, apologized for being horrible to him earlier in the episode.

Fed up with Mumm-Ra's repeated failures, the Ancient Sprirts of Evil demand that he destroys the ThunderCats or else he will be exiled from Third Earth. When Mumm-Ra fails the deadline, the Ancient Spirits of Evil trap Mumm-Ra in a crystal with a miniature pyramid and cast to the farthest reaches of the universe. When the ThunderCats decide to colonize New Thundera to rebuild it, the Ancient Spirits of Evil free Mumm-Ra and rebuild his cauldron on Third Earth. In one episode, it was said that Mumm-Ra once owned the Sphere of Seti which increased his power. When he managed to recover it after it was found by Char, he planned to use it to increase his power and free himself from servitude to the Ancient Spirits of Evil. Angered at his plot as well as at his deceptive attempts to hide it, the Ancient Spirits seal off the Black Pyramid, forcing Mumm-Ra to choose between sustenance (the pyramid) or power (the sphere). Ultimately, Mumm-Ra admits that he cannot survive without the pyramid—thus he begrudgingly surrenders the sphere and once again resumes his role as a servant of the Ancient Spirits.

===2011 version===
In the 2011 version, Mumm-Ra is an Ancient Spirit of Evil employed by the Ancient Spirits of Evil (confirmed by series Art Director Dan Norton) with changes including demon wings on his Ever-Living form, a larger body, and a weakness to intensely bright light. His ultimate goal is universal domination and enforcing his ideal order on it. When utilizing the power of the Gauntlet of Plun-Darr, Mumm-Ra's power increases and he gains a robed armored form (this continuity's equivalent to the All-Powerful form), with a skeletal mask and Egyptian headdress. In his Ever-Living form, he continues the show's trend of all characters and creatures being animals by showing traits of a leaf-nosed vampire bat.

Centuries prior to the new series, Mumm-Ra used advanced technology and magic at his disposal to enslave the ancestors of the ThunderCats and the Animals into serving him so he would gather the Four Powerstones (the War Stone, the Tech Stone, the Spirit Stone, and the Soul Stone) from various planets to place on the Sword of Plun-Darr, a weapon forged from a star he had collapse at the cost of the entire Plun-Darr galaxy. But managing to take the War Stone (which would become the Eye of Thundera) while staging a rebellion with the Animals' help, the ThunderCat Leo defeats Mumm-Ra and strips him of the other Powerstones. But when Mumm-Ra's pyramid spacecraft was pulled into Third Earth's atmosphere, Mumm-Ra entered his tomb to bide his time for everyone else to die in the resulting crash. However, the controls were smashed and Mumm-Ra was trapped within his pyramid as the stones and survivors spread across Third Earth.

Many centuries later, Mumm-Ra used Grune to release him from his prison and masterminded Thundera's downfall. With the aid of Grune and Slythe, Mumm-Ra not only plans to obtain the Eye of Thundera, but to regain the other three Powerstones in order to get to the Sword of Plundarr and the remaining stones. Mumm-Ra also resurrected Pumyra to serve him and planted her amongst the Thunderian slaves. After Grune ends up trapped in the Astral Plane, Mumm-Ra has Slithe recruit the homicidal Addicus and sociopathic Kaynar to not only restore the Lizard army morale and punish any who quit, but also increase their numbers with members of the new generals' respective races. Later, through a calculated scheme involving the reveal of his agent Pumyra, Mumm-Ra regains the Sword of Plun-Darr (along with his All-Powerful form) and the Tech Stone while gaining a new ally in Vultaire. The series, had it not been cancelled, would presumably have followed Mumm-Ra's search for the final Stone, the Soul Stone.

==Powers and abilities==
An absolute master of magic, Mumm-Ra possesses nearly unlimited knowledge of mystical arts from all corners of the universe. As such, he can summon their use to assist him in almost any manner he chooses. His abilities include [[electricity]] manipulation, [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], [[necromancy]], [[alchemy]], [[shapeshifting]], [[time travel|temporal manipulation]], [[teleportation]], [[psychokinesis]], [[:wikt:transfiguration|transfiguration]], [[mind control]], [[astral projection]], [[scrying]], and so on.

While in the form of Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living, he becomes a conduit for the Ancient Spirits of Evil; such that he can amplify his aforementioned abilities to a nearly cosmic scale, gain superhuman strength, as well as retain his undead status despite the passage of time or any injuries sustained. The price of this power however, is extremely limited stamina: once Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living has surpassed a given threshold of energy-expenditure, he must revert to his mummified form, and enter his sarcophagus to rejuvenate himself. Also, Mumm-Ra's power in his Ever-Living form is directly linked to the condition of both his sarcophagus and the Ancient Spirits' four statues within his pyramid; should any of them be harmed or destroyed, his power weakens immediately and considerably.

In the 2011 show, Mumm-Ra's Ever-Living form similarly amplifies his already formidable mystic powers, while not seeming to have any definite limit as to how long he can maintain this form. Once he recovers the Gauntlet of Plun-Darr (the precursor to the Gauntlet of Omens, Lion-O's gauntlet), he is able to use a double-edged sword decorated with bat wings and a ring where the Eye of Thundera could fit. He can use the gauntlet in his Ever-Living form so as to achieve an All-Powerful form (or a form analogous to the 1980s version) which increases his power further, allowing his double-edged sword to become a dual-bladed scimitar. However, this form can only be achieved if he has two or more of the Powerstones in his possession. If his Powerstones are stripped from his gauntlet while in his All-Powerful form, Mumm-Ra reverts to his skinny, mummified self.

==Reception==
Mumm-Ra has been generally well received by the public and fans alike. Viewers have noted the character for his notoriously frightening appearance and deep, raspy voice. In addition, Mumm-Ra is also praised for being much more competent than other famous cartoon villains from the 1980s; such as [[Skeletor]] of ''[[Masters of the Universe]]'' fame.

[[WatchMojo.com]] placed Mumm-Ra 5th place in their "Top 10 Television Cartoon Villains" list, stating that he was the most memorable character in the ''[[ThunderCats (1985 TV series)|ThunderCats]]'' series, labeling him as "a bad guy that audiences could actually fear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKnuBopmyhA|title=Top 10 Television Cartoon Villains|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NAGE EMS''' is a labor union, a division of NAGE / SEIU Local 5000 ([[National Association of Government Employees]]) that represents [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] professionals working for private [[ambulance]] ([[Emergency Medical Services]], [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]], [[Paramedic]], [[Dispatcher]], [[Registered Nurses]], Support Staff)  in self-autonomous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nage.org/stewards/|title= Stewards &amp; Officers - Resource Center|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; union locals.  NAGE EMS locals elect their own local governing executive boards and officers and are provided representational, legal, contract, and political support by NAGE but govern and manage their own affairs.

== History ==
NAGE EMS was created by NAGE in 2012 by NAGE leaders to address the unique, complicated conditions that EMS professionals must navigate and to address the perceived negative effects of changes in EMS on the EMS professionals providing services to the public.  NAGE believed the privatization push that began 20 years ago in EMS led to private companies supplying a significant part of the public safety network with 911 emergency and non-emergency services to communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nage-ems.org/about/know/nage-history.php|title=NAGE EMS History|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAGE EMS division was codified into the NAGE National Bylaws at the 2014 NAGE National Convention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nage.org/login/assets/images/National%20By-Laws%202014.pdf|title=NATIONAL CONSTITUTION &amp; BY-LAWS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Corporate and privately owned EMS has grown over the past few years, and that increases  the downward pressure on compensation for those hard working employees.  Our mission at NAGE EMS is to help those employees through superior union representation, strong contracts, and safe working conditions for NAGE EMS members and the people they serve.” - David J. Holway, NAGE President on NAGE EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nage-ems.org/about/know/leader-in-ems.php|title=Leader In NAGE EMS|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==

NAGE EMS locals set their own political positions and advocate for their own political positions.  Because NAGE EMS is a division of NAGE / SEIU Local 5000, NAGE EMS locals gain access to the political resources of NAGE.  Because NAGE is affiliated with SEIU, NAGE gains access to the political resources of SEIU.  NAGE EMS locals rely on these resources to help advance their own political agendas and issues.  NAGE EMS locals also participate in COPE (Committee On Political Education).  COPE is a voluntary political action fund that supports NAGE EMS political and legislative activities. COPE contributions are used to support grassroots lobbying efforts and help elect local, state and federal candidates who support the collective bargaining agreements, issues and concerns of NAGE EMS members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nage.org/member/cope.php|title=Committee On Political Education (COPE)|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NAGE, on behalf of NAGE EMS locals is on the congressional record in California as being opposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/sen/sb_0551-0600/sb_556_cfa_20140828_132215_sen_floor.html|title=SB 556 Senate Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; to California Senate Bill 556,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legiscan.com/CA/text/SB556/id/1044441|title=Bill Text: CA SB556}}&lt;/ref&gt; a bill that would require EMS professionals working for a private ambulance company performing public safety services (911 emergency services) under a public contract to wear specific labels.  NAGE requested California Governor Brown veto the bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nage.org/login/assets/images/CASB556%20Letter%20to%20Governor%20Brown%20RE%20Veto%20Request%20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics ==

Some critics of NAGE EMS claim that NAGE EMS is actually the IAEP ([[International Association of EMTs and Paramedics]], another division of NAGE)in disguise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://memecrunch.com/meme/4GT8O/nage-ems}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that NAGE EMS is some form of re-branding of IAEP.  NAGE claims that "NAGE has two EMS divisions.  The IAEP represents public, third-service, and private EMS across the U.S.  NAGE EMS is focused specifically on private EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.nage-ems.org/why/smears/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Some critics of NAGE EMS claim that NAGE EMS was created after a failed affiliation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=https://www.scribd.com/doc/146130534/NAGE-vs-NEMSA-Complaint}}&lt;/ref&gt; between NAGE and NEMSA [[National Emergency Medical Services Association]] ([[NEMSA]]).  NAGE claims "NAGE tried to address issues specific to private EMS in several ways, including affiliating with other unions. Finally, the NAGE Board of Directors chose to create a NAGE division specifically to address issues related to private EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.nage-ems.org/why/smears/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17734">Conservative governments set targets for the [[NHS]] in the 1990s – for example, guaranteeing a maximum two-year wait for non-emergency surgery and reducing rates of death from specific diseases.  The [[Blair government]] introduced far more targets and managed performance far more aggressively - a management regime sometimes referred to as 'targets and terror'. Targets have been blamed for distorting clinical priorities, and in particular for one organisation achieving a target at the expense of another. For example, ambulances have been forced to queue up outside a busy emergency departments so that the ambulances might not be able to meet their target in responding to emergency calls, but the hospital can meet its A&amp;E target. Excess emphasis on the targets can mean that other important aspects of care, especially those not easily measured, may be neglected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Have targets improved NHS performance?|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/general-election-2010/performance-targets|accessdate=22 December 2017|publisher=Kings Fund|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[NHS England]] under the Conservative governments reduced the number of targets, in particular removing most of those relating to health inequality, and encouraged a system wide approach. However shortage of staff and funding meant that performance against targets declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Check NHS cancer, A&amp;E and operations targets in your area|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-41483322|accessdate=22 December 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Guidance published in February 2018 conceded that most of the targets would not be met before April 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS allowed to miss A&amp;E target for another year|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/news/nhs-plans-to-miss-aande-target-for-another-year/7021601.article|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NHS Constitution for England]] specifies waiting times in the accompanying Handbook, but does not provide a remedy should they be breached.

==Accident and emergency departments ==
A '''four-hour target in emergency departments''' was introduced by the [[Department of Health]] for [[National Health Service]] [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] [[hospitals]] in [[England]]. The original target was set at 100%, but lowered to reflect clinical concerns that there will always be patients who need to spend slightly longer in A&amp;E, under observation.  Setting a target that, by 2004, at least 98% of patients attending an [[emergency department|A&amp;E department]] must be seen, treated, and admitted or discharged in under four hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxford.gov.uk/files/meetingdocs/27833/item%207.pdf The Four Hour Target in Accident and Emergency]&lt;/ref&gt; The target was further moved to 95% of patients within four hours in 2010 as a result of the coalition's claims that 98% was not clinically justified.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/02/nhs-four-hour-targets-aande&lt;/ref&gt; Trusts which failed to meet the target could be fined.  In July 2016 NHS trusts were set new "performance improvement trajectories". For 47 of the 140 trusts with "type one" major A&amp;E facilities this meant a target of less than 95% waiting under 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Third of providers will still miss A&amp;E target in March 2017|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/sectors/acute-care/third-of-providers-will-still-miss-ae-target-in-march-2017/7009417.article|accessdate=19 March 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2017 [[Jeremy Hunt]] announced that the target would in future only apply to "urgent health problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeremy Hunt ditches four-hour target as A&amp;E crisis deepens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/09/labour-party-jeremy-hunt-nhs-waiting-time|accessdate=19 March 2017|publisher=Guardian|date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018 only 77.1% of patients were admitted or discharged within four hours, the worst ever performance for type one A&amp;E departments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trolley waits soar to record high|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/trolley-waits-soar-to-record-high/7021648.article|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In December 2018 it was reported that patients with only minor ailments could be excluded from the target and a new target introduced so the most urgent cases should be seen within an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NHS chiefs look to scrap four-hour A&amp;E maximum wait |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/02/nhs-four-hour-maximum-wait-patients-minor-ailments-miss-out?fbclid=IwAR0TvalWW1ETOCn00CQUCUirdopYp8Hy8t2uTTffAOB3q6urY0jv7qmbXJM |accessdate=2 December 2018 |publisher=Guardian |date=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland the target is for 95% of A&amp;E patients to be either admitted, transferred or discharged in four hours. It was last met in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SNP attacked over year of missed NHS targets |url=https://www.express.co.uk/scotland/995976/snp-missed-nhs-targets-scottish-national-party-health |accessdate=14 August 2018 |publisher=Scottish Express |date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objective===

The [[Labour Party (UK)|UK Labour]] government had identified a requirement to promote improvements in A&amp;E departments, which had suffered underfunding for a number of years.   The target, accompanied by extra financial support, was a key plan to achieve the improvements. [[Tony Blair]] felt the targets had been successful in achieving their aim. "We feel, and maybe we are wrong, that one way we've managed to do that promote improvements in A&amp;E is by setting a clear target".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4339653.stm BBC NEWS | Health | Target 'putting A&amp;E care at risk'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

48% of departments said they did not meet the target for the period ending 31 December 2004.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/AandEwaiting BMA - BMA survey of accident and emergency waiting times, March 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Government figures show that in 2005-06, 98.2% of patients were seen, diagnosed and treated within four hours of their arrival at A&amp;E, the first full financial year in which this has happened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6267897.stm BBC NEWS | Health | A&amp;E success 'not sustainable'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4-hour target triggered the introduction of the [[acute assessment unit]] (also known as the medical assessment unit), which works alongside the emergency department but is outside it for statistical purposes in the [[bed management]] cycle. It is claimed that though A&amp;E targets have resulted in significant improvements in completion times, the current target would not have been possible without some form of patient re-designation or re-labeling taking place, so true improvements are somewhat less than headline figures might suggest and it is doubtful that a single target (fitting all A&amp;E and related services) is sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/media/stories/story_96_105659_69284.html |accessdate=2008-05-20 |author=Mayhew, Les |author2=Smith, David |date=December 2006 |title=Using queuing theory to analyse completion times in accident and emergency departments in the light of the Government 4-hour target |publisher=[[Cass Business School]] |pages=2, 34 |isbn=978-1-905752-06-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the four-hour target helped to bring down waiting times when it was first introduced, since September 2012 (after the introduction of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]] and top-down reorganisation of the NHS) hospitals in England struggled to stick to it, prompting suggestions that A&amp;E departments may be reaching a limit in terms of what can be achieved within the available resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blunt|first1=Ian|title=Why are people waiting longer in A&amp;E?|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/blog/why-are-people-waiting-longer-ae|website=QualityWatch|publisher=Nuffield Trust &amp; Health Foundation|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement of the reduction of the target from 98% to 95% was immediately followed by a reduction in attainment to the lower level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodcock|first1=Thomas|last2=Poots|first2=Alan J|last3=Bell|first3=Derek|title=The impact of changing the 4 h emergency access standard on patient waiting times in emergency departments in England|journal=Emergency Medicine Journal|date=March 2013|volume=30|issue=3|pages=e22–e22|doi=10.1136/emermed-2012-201175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance====
By December 2014, the number of patients being treated within four hours had fallen to 91.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indicator: A&amp;E waiting times|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/indicator/ae-waiting-times|website=QualityWatch|publisher=Nuffield Trust &amp; Health Foundation|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From December 2015 the 95% target over England as a whole was missed every month.  From October 2016 to December 2016 only 4 out of 139 hospitals with major type 1 A&amp;E departments met the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What's going on in A&amp;E?

Only 88.9% of patients were seen within four hours in September. The number of people admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours in emergency departments in September was up more than 3% compared to September 2017 with a 7% rise in emergency admissions said by [[John Appleby (economist)|John Appleby]] to be astonishing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A&amp;Es miss national objective with record low performance |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/aandes-miss-national-objective-with-record-low-performance/7023561.article? |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing the target===

According to the BMA&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; the main reasons for not reaching this target are:

*Not enough [[inpatient]] beds
*Delayed discharges
*Delay in accessing specialist opinion 
*Not enough nurses
*Not enough middle grade doctors 
*Department too small 
*Delay in accessing diagnostic services

In 2014, research conducted by [[QualityWatch]], a joint programme from the [[Nuffield Trust]] and the [[Health Foundation]], tracked 41 million visits to A&amp;E departments in England in order to better understand the pressures leading to increased waiting times and breaches of the four-hour target. Researchers identified a rise in older patients and related increase in long-term conditions as key factors, alongside extremes of temperature (in both summer and winter) and crowding at peak times. They noted that the majority of pressure was falling on major A&amp;E units, and proposed that rising demand as a result of ageing and population growth may be pushing already stretched emergency departments beyond maximum capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blunt|first1=Ian|title=Focus on: A&amp;E attendances|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/focus-on/ae-attendances|website=QualityWatch|publisher=Nuffield Trust &amp; Health Foundation|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 the [[Royal College of Emergency Medicine]] produced a report saying that the NHS needed at least 5,000 more beds to achieve safe bed occupancy levels and hit the four-hour target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS needs 5,000 more beds, warn leading A&amp;E doctors|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/exclusive-nhs-needs-5000-more-beds-warn-leading-aande-doctors/7019214.article?|accessdate=23 August 2017|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pressure===

Even though exceptions are allowed to the targets, concerns have been raised that the target has put pressure on A&amp;E staff to compromise patient care. A significant proportion (90%) of A&amp;E consultants welcomed the four hour target in a study but felt that 98% was too high a target.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Twelve hour target===
At the same time as the four target was introduced a target that no patient should wait longer than 12 hours before they are admitted to a ward, if that is required, was introduced.  Between January and March 2012 only 15 patients in England waited more than 12 hours, but in the same months in 2017 1,597 patients breached the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=12-hour patient waits in A&amp;E increase by 10,000% in five years|url=http://healthcareleadernews.com/article/12-hour-patient-waits-ae-increase-10000-five-years|accessdate=22 December 2017|publisher=Healthcare Leader|date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In January 2018 1,043 patients waited over 12 hours for a bed, the worst figure ever recorded.  272 were at [[University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trolley waits soar to record high|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/trolley-waits-soar-to-record-high/7021648.article|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned treatment==
Over four million patients were waiting for non urgent hospital care as of July 2017.  The [[Royal College of Surgeons]] together with other medical groups fear patients are waiting longer in anxiety and pain for hospital procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/aug/10/patients-waiting-planned-nhs-england-hospital-care-top-4-million-for-first-time-in-a-decade Patients waiting for planned NHS hospital care top 4m for first time in a decade]&lt;/ref&gt;  The target was that 90% of patients admitted to hospital for treatment and 95% of those not admitted should receive consultant-led care within 18 weeks unless it is clinically appropriate not to do so, or they choose to wait.  The proportion of people waiting more than the six week target for diagnostic tests was at its highest since records began in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A&amp;Es miss national objective with record low performance |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/aandes-miss-national-objective-with-record-low-performance/7023561.article? |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One year wait===
In December 2017 there were 1,750 patients waiting a year or more,  the highest total since August 2012.  242 were at [[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]], 156 at [[Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust]] and 114 at [[Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust]].  11.8% of those waiting for a procedure had waited 18 weeks or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Year-plus elective waiters at highest number since 2012|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/year-plus-elective-waiters-at-highest-number-since-2012/7021651.article|accessdate=2 April 2018|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2018 there were 2,647. The largest numbers were at [[Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], [[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]], [[King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust]], [[Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust]] and [[East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Year-plus waiters rise 75 per cent |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/year-plus-waiters-rise-75-per-cent-/7022542.article |accessdate=17 August 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six month wait===
445,360 had been waiting six months or more by the end of December 2017 - three times more than in 2013. The President of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] said it was “completely shameful” that patients were being forced to resort to paying for operations the NHS should provide as these waiting times led to an increase of 53% between 2012 and 2016 in the numbers paying personally for private operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Numbers 'going private' for surgery soaring as NHS rationing deepens |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/11/numbers-going-private-surgery-soaring-nhs-rationing-deepens/ |accessdate=14 August 2018 |publisher=Telegraph |date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellations===
Between January and March 2018 25,475 operations were cancelled at the last minute for non-clinical reasons by NHS providers - 20% more than the first quarter of 2017, and the highest number since records began in 1994-95. This was 1.3% of all elective activity - the highest proportion recorded since 2004-05.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Last minute cancelled operations hits highest rate since 2005 |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/last-minute-cancelled-operations-hits-highest-rate-since-2005/7022344.article |accessdate=13 August 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hammock nap on patio.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Hammock]] napping on a [[patio]], in [[Costa Rica]]]]
A '''nap''' is a short period of sleep, typically taken during daytime hours as an adjunct to the usual nocturnal sleep period. Naps are most often taken as a response to [[drowsiness]] during waking hours. A nap is a form of [[biphasic or polyphasic sleep]], where the latter terms also include longer periods of sleep in addition to one single period. Cultural attitudes toward napping during the [[work day]] vary. In many [[Western culture]]s, children and the elderly are expected to nap during the day and are provided with designated periods and locations in which to do so.  In these same cultures, most working adults are not expected to sleep during the day and [[sleeping on the job|napping on the job]] is widely considered unacceptable.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Other cultures (especially those in hot climates) serve their largest meals at [[midday]], with allowance for a nap period ([[siesta]]) afterwards before returning to work.

==Benefits==
Napping is physiologically and psychologically beneficial. Napping for 20 minutes can help refresh the mind, improve overall alertness, boost mood and increase productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Camile and William. ''The Art of Napping at Work'', Larson Publication, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Napping may benefit the heart. In a six-year study of Greek adults, researchers found that men who took naps at least three times a week had a 37 percent lower risk of heart-related death.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.msn.com/health-topics/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100233156&amp;GT1=31036 |title=25 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Your Body and Health |work=[[Health (magazine)|Health]] |year=2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429223148/http://health.msn.com/health-topics/articlepage.aspx?cp-documentid=100233156&amp;GT1=31036 |archivedate=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For years, scientists have been investigating the benefits of napping, including the 30-minute nap as well as sleep durations of 1–2 hours. Performance across a wide range of cognitive processes has been tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov/zteam/fcp/pubs/jsr.art.html |title=NASA: Alertness Management: Strategic Naps in Operational Settings |date=1995 |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419073208/http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov/zteam/fcp/pubs/jsr.art.html |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies demonstrate that naps are as good as a night of sleep for some types of memory tasks. A [[NASA]] study led by [[David F. Dinges]], professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]], found that naps can improve certain memory functions and that long naps are more effective than short ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/03jun_naps.htm |title=NASA Nap |date=2005-06-03 |accessdate=2007-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214223630/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/03jun_naps.htm |archivedate=14 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that NASA study, volunteers spent several days living on one of 18 different sleep schedules, all in a laboratory setting. To measure the effectiveness of the naps, tests probing memory, alertness, response time, and other cognitive skills were used.

The [[National Institute of Mental Health]] funded a team of doctors, led by Alan Hobson, [[Robert Stickgold]], and colleagues at [[Harvard University]] for a study which showed that a midday nap reverses [[information overload]]. Reporting in ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', [[Sara Mednick]], Stickgold and colleagues also demonstrated that, in some cases, a 1-hour nap could even boost performance to an individual's top levels. The NIMH team wrote: "The bottom line is: we should stop feeling guilty about taking that 'power nap' at work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jul2002/nimh-02.htm |title=The National Institute of Mental Health Power Nap Study |date=2002-07-01 |accessdate=2002-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020802060144/http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jul2002/nimh-02.htm |archivedate=2 August 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiovascular benefits of napping, siesta or daytime sleep===
The [[siesta]] habit has recently been associated with a 37% reduction in coronary mortality, possibly due to reduced cardiovascular stress mediated by daytime sleep (Naska et al., 2007). Nevertheless, epidemiological studies on the relations between cardiovascular health and siesta have led to conflicting conclusions, possibly because of poor control of moderator variables, such as physical activity. It is possible that people who take a siesta have different physical activity habits, e.g. waking earlier and scheduling more activity during the morning. Such differences in physical activity may mediate different 24-hour profiles in cardiovascular function. Even if such effects of physical activity can be discounted for explaining the relationship between siesta and cardiovascular health, it is still unknown whether it is the daytime nap itself, a supine posture or the expectancy of a nap that is the most important factor. It was recently suggested that a short nap can reduce stress and blood pressure (BP), with the main changes in BP occurring between the time of lights off and the onset of stage 1 (Zaregarizi, M. 2007 &amp; 2012).

Zaregarizi and his team have concluded that the acute time of falling asleep was where beneficial cardiovascular changes take place. This study has indicated that a large decline in blood pressure occurs during the daytime sleep-onset period only when sleep is expected; however, when subjects rest in a supine position, the same reduction in blood pressure is not observed. This blood pressure reduction may be associated with the lower coronary mortality rates seen in Mediterranean and Latin American populations where siestas are common. Zaregarizi assessed cardiovascular function (blood pressure, heart rate, and measurements of blood vessel dilation) while nine healthy volunteers, 34 years of age on average, spent an hour standing quietly; reclining at rest but not sleeping; or reclining to nap. All participants were restricted to 4 hours of sleep on the night prior to each of the sleep laboratory tests. During three daytime naps, he noted significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate. By contrast, the team did not observe changes in cardiovascular function while the participants were standing or reclining at rest.

These findings also show that the greatest decline in blood pressure occurs between lights-off and onset of daytime sleep itself. During this sleep period, which lasted 9.7 minutes on average, blood pressure decreased, while blood vessel dilation increased by more than 9 percent.

"There is little change in blood pressure once a subject is actually asleep," Zaregarizi noted, and he found minor changes in blood vessel dilation during sleep (Zaregarizi, M. 2007 &amp; 2012).

==Negative effects==
For those suffering from [[insomnia]] or [[depression (mood)|depression]], naps may aggravate already disrupted sleep-wake patterns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=50785&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power nap==
{{Main|Power nap}}
A [[power nap]], also known as a Stage 2 nap, is a short slumber of 20 minutes or less which terminates before the occurrence of deep [[slow-wave sleep]] (SWS), intended to quickly revitalize the napper. The expression "power nap" was coined by [[Cornell University]] [[social psychologist]] [[James Maas]].&lt;ref name="Mednick"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mednick |first=Sara C. |author2=Mark Ehrman |title=Take a Nap! Change Your Life |year=2006 |edition=First |publisher=Workman Publishing |location=New York, NY, USA |isbn=978-0-7611-4290-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20-minute nap increases alertness and motor skills.&lt;ref name="Mednick"/&gt; Various durations may be recommended for power naps, which are very short compared to regular sleep. The short duration prevents nappers from sleeping so long that they enter the slow wave portion of the normal sleep cycle without being able to complete the cycle. Entering deep, slow-wave sleep and failing to complete the normal sleep cycle, can result in a phenomenon known as [[sleep inertia]], where one feels groggy, disoriented, and even sleepier than before beginning the nap. In order to attain optimal post-nap performance, a Stage 2 nap must be limited to the beginning of a sleep cycle, specifically [[sleep stages]] N1 and N2, typically 18–25 minutes. 

Experimental confirmation of the benefits of this brief nap comes from a Flinders University study in Australia in which 5, 10, 20, or 30 minute sleeps were given. The greatest immediate improvement in measures of alertness and cognitive performance came after the 10 minutes of sleep. The 20 and 30 minute sleeps showed evidence of sleep inertia immediately after the naps and improvements in alertness more than 30 minutes later but not to a greater level than after the 10 minutes of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brooks |first=A |author2=Lack, L. |year=2006 |url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.url?eid=2-s2.0-33745118693&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=350283ECD84BD6A56AA7FBA2A5F7C097.53bsOu7mi7A1NSY7fPJf1g%3a1 |title=A brief afternoon nap following nocturnal sleep restriction:which nap duration is most recuperative? |journal=Sleep |issue=29 |page=831-840 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who regularly take these short naps, or catnaps as they used to be called, may develop a good idea of the duration which works best for them, as well as which tools, environment, position, and associated factors help produce the best results. Power naps are effective even when schedules allow a full night's sleep. Mitsuo Hayashi and Tadao Hori&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1440-1819.1998.tb01031.x |title=The effects of a 20-min nap before post-lunch dip |date=1998-04-01 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; have demonstrated that a nap improves mental performance, even after a full night's sleep.

==Stimulant or caffeine nap==
A [[Power nap#Stimulant nap|short nap preceded by the intake of caffeine]] was investigated by British researchers. In a driving simulator and a series of studies, Horne and Reyner looked at the effects of cold air, radio, a break with no nap, a nap, caffeine pill vs. placebo and a short nap preceded by caffeine on mildly sleep-deprived subjects. The caffeine nap was by far the most effective in reducing driving "incidents" and subjective sleepiness. Caffeine in coffee takes up to a half-hour to have an alerting effect, hence "a short (&lt;15min) nap will not be compromised if it is taken immediately after the coffee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horne |first= J.A. |author2=Reyner, L.A. |year=1996 |url=http://www.websciences.org/cftemplate/NAPS/archives/indiv.cfm?ID=19960113 |title=Driver sleepiness - "in-car" countermeasures: cold air and car radio |journal=Sleep Research |issue=25 |page=99 |format=Abstract |accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horne |first=J.A. |author2=Reyner, L.A. |year=1995 |title=Driver sleepiness: practical countermeasures caffeine &amp; nap |journal=Sleep Research |issue=24A |page=438 |url=http://www.websciences.org/cftemplate/NAPS/archives/indiv.cfm?ID=19979427 |format=Abstract |accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Loughborough University researchers issue new warning to tired drivers |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/service/publicity/news-releases/2004/04_110_micro-sleep.html |accessdate=2007-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifehacker.com/306029/reboot-your-brain-with-a-caffeine-nap Lifehacker article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systematic napping as a lifestyle==
A contemporary idea called [[polyphasic sleep]]ing entails avoiding long sleeps, instead taking regularly spaced short naps. [[Sara Mednick]], whose sleep research investigates the effects of napping, included a chapter, "Extreme Napping", in her book ''Take a Nap!''.&lt;ref name="Mednick"/&gt; In response to questions from readers about the "uberman" schedule of "polyphasic sleeping", she commented as follows:
{{quote|This practice rests upon one important hypothesis that our biological rhythms are adaptable. This means that we can train our internal mechanisms not only when to sleep and wake, but also when to get hungry, have energy for exercise, perform mental activities. Inferred in this hypothesis is that we have the power to regulate our mood, metabolism, core body temperature, endocrine and stress response, basically everything inside this container of flesh we call home. Truly an Uberman feat!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mednick |first=Sara |url=http://www.saramednick.com/blog/?p=15 |title=Uberman, napping is all there is... |accessdate=2008-03-23 |date=11 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013103649/http://saramednick.com/blog/?p=15#more-15 |archivedate=13 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}; &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Polyphasic sleep is claimed to be of particular benefit in cases where very long periods of wakefulness (+24 hours) are necessary and a normal circadian rhythm is impossible (such as certain cases of military duty or emergency service). Critics of polyphasic sleep dispute the notion that the human brain can simply be [[classical conditioning|classically conditioned]] to tolerate a state of near constant wakefulness without deleterious effects. Studies{{which|date=September 2014}} by the US military showed the success rate of introducing polyphasic sleep varied widely depending on individual physiology/psychology, the amount of time provided to acclimate to the new schedule, and the type and difficulty of the tasks being performed. Attempting to acclimate to a polyphasic schedule often induced significant stresses in the participants, with a corresponding deficits in alertness and skill that became progressive and did not improve until the restoration of normal sleep.{{fact|date=September 2014}} Many of the more radical cycles (such as the "Uberman Schedule", allowing only 15 minute naps every 4 hours) are so demanding that to date their only successes have been anecdotal reports from serious devotees and are widely{{ww|date=September 2014}} considered to be harmful and physically unsustainable for the average person.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==History==
The Narcotics act was passed in 1990 by the Parliament of Bangladesh. It repealed the previous laws, the Opium Act of 1878, the Excise Act of 1909, the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1930, the Opium Smoking Act of 1932 and the Prohibition Rules of 1950. The government added amendments to the act in 2000, 2002, and 2004. The act came into force on 2 January 1990. The act made the  [[Department of Narcotics Control]] the central agency of the government drug police. The act made the [[National Narcotics Control Board (Bangladesh)|National Narcotics Control Board]] the highest government body responsible for Narcotics control policy in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Law and Our Rights |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712070042/https://www.thedailystar.net/law/2009/06/04/review.htm |accessdate=3 June 2018 |publisher=The Daily Star |date=27 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712070042/https://www.thedailystar.net/law/2009/06/04/review.htm |archivedate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Department of Narcotics Control]] was established on 2 January 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Abuse of Narcotics Drugsshould be controlled |url=http://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/235371/Abuse-of-Narcotics-Drugsshould-be-controlled- |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=The Daily Sun |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the government created a draft Narcotics Control Act 2018 to modernize the Narcotics Control Act 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stricter narcotics control law on the cards |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/special/2018/04/01/stricter-narcotics-control-law-cards/ |accessdate=3 June 2018 |work=Dhaka Tribune |date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiang received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1955, with William D. Neff as his advisor, and he has many notables in the auditory field among his ex-students.&lt;ref name=neurotree&gt;{{cite web |title=Nelson YS Kiang |url=https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=912 |website=Neurotree |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received an honorary M.D. from the [[University of Geneva]].  In 1992 he founded the Speech and Hearing Sciences Program (now [[Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology]] Ph.D. program) which he directed until he retired.  His former student [[M. Charles Liberman]]&lt;ref name=neurotree/&gt; replaced him as director of the Eaton-Peabody Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles Liberman |url=https://www.sciencefriday.com/person/charles-liberman/ |website=Science Friday |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Kiang is an honorary or advisory professor at four Chinese universities and advises people in five ministries in China.{{cn|date=July 2018}}  His present interests are in world health and world education.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Kiang recounts the early history of the EPL in a memoir&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kiang |first1=Nelson |url=http://research.meei.harvard.edu/eplhistory/Documents/EPL%20history%2011%20copy.pdf | title = The Early History of EPL | accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is part of the EPL history project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A History of the Eaton-Peabody Laboratory |url=http://research.meei.harvard.edu/eplhistory/welcome_to_History_of_EPL/Home_page.html |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiang has been credited as the first to demonstrate the [[auditory brainstem response]], and to propose using such electrical signals from the brain to diagnose hearing disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Møller |first1=Aage R. |title=Hearing: Anatomy, Physiology, and Disorders of the Auditory System |date=2012 |publisher=Plural Publishing |isbn=9781597566292 |page=215 |edition=Third |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQ62CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;dq=eaton-peabody+laboratories+history+kiang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9O-4xqVxUh&amp;sig=vq6OEQIND9YtDPTmbr8gY7Smo8o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ2NiL3qvcAhViFzQIHUegBawQ6AEITjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=eaton-peabody%20laboratories%20history%20kiang&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, as a pioneering researcher on sound coding in the auditory nerve, Kiang proposed the possibility of translating sound into multi-channel electrical signals as a way to give a sense of hearing to people with cochlear deafness – that is, [[cochlear implant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kiang, Nelson YS, Takeshi Watanabe, Eleanor C. Thomas, and Louise F. Clark. "Stimulus Coding in the Cat's Auditory Nerve: Preliminary Report." Annals of Otology, Rhinology &amp; Laryngology 71, no. 4 (1962): 1009-1026.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 1970s, after cochlear implantation experiments on humans had started with single-channel devices, Kiang strongly supported those urging caution with such human experimentation, arguing that our knowledge of coding in the auditory system was not yet sufficient and that single-channel devices were not up to the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sources of Medical Technology: Universities and Industry |date=1995 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=9780309176682 |page=109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=it2TW9fAZnkC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=nelson+kiang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxm-mh6ancAhUBCTQIHbYlBX0Q6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=nelson%20kiang&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both single- and multi-channel experimentation continued, and human experimentation along with continued auditory research led to advances (and continue to do so into the 21st century) that support success with modern multi-channel cochlear implants.

In the 1990s, Kiang suggested investigating the response of the vestibular part of the inner ear to very low frequencies in relation to [[wind turbine syndrome]].&lt;ref name=turbine/&gt;

The '''Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. At the time of its passage, the '''Act''' was intended to extend the protection of workplace [[Occupational safety and health|health, safety and welfare]] under the [[Factories Act 1961]] to other employees in [[Great Britain]]. Though {{As of|2008|lc=on}} some of it remains in force, it has largely been superseded by the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] and [[Health and safety regulations in the United Kingdom|regulations made under it]].

Breach of the residual provisions is still a [[crime]] punishable on [[summary conviction]] in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]] by a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] of up to £400 or, on [[indictment]] in the [[Crown Court]], [[imprisonment]] for up to two years and an unlimited fine.&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, s.33(3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Sentencing and costs – Penalties | work=Enforcement Guide | publisher=Health and Safety Executive | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/court/sentencing/penalties.htm | accessdate=2008-07-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516105856/http://www.hse.gov.uk/enforce/enforcementguide/court/sentencing/penalties.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of [[damages|damage]] arising from a breach of the '''Act''', there may be [[civil liability]] for [[breach of statutory duty]]. Though no such liability is stipulated by the '''Act''' itself, none is excluded and the facts could be such as to give rise to a [[cause of action]] in that [[tort]].&lt;ref&gt;''Halsbury'' vol.20(1) '''623'''&lt;/ref&gt; A breach not actionable in itself may be evidential towards a claim for [[common law]] [[negligence]]. In particular, a criminal conviction may be given in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Civil Evidence Act 1968]], s.11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The '''Act''' stemmed from the 1949 [[Ernest Gowers|Gowers Report]] which had already led to the [[Mines and Quarries Act 1954]], [[Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956]] and [[Factories Act 1961]]. The 1963 '''Act''' extended protection to a further 8 million employees.&lt;ref name="reading2"/&gt;

==Scope of Act==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==Health, safety and welfare of employees (general provisions)==
Sections 4 to 16 defined general broad requirements for safe and healthy workplace working conditions:
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Cleanliness]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Overcrowding]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Temperature]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Ventilation (architecture)|Ventilation]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Lighting]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Sanitary convenience]]s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washing facilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply of [[drinking water]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accommodation for clothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting facilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seating for sedentary work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating facilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] of [[floor]]s, [[stairway]]s and passageways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

These provisions were [[repeal]]ed and superseded, as far as they applied to "workplaces", by the [[Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992]]&lt;ref name="workplacerepeal"&gt;Reg.27/ Sch.2&lt;/ref&gt; with effect from 1 January 1993 for new workplaces and 1 January 1996 for established workplaces.&lt;ref name="workplacecommence"&gt;Reg.1&lt;/ref&gt; There is still a potential residual scope of application to "offices, shops and railway premises" that are not "workplaces" as the definition of "workplace" is in some ways limited.&lt;ref&gt;Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992, reg.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="explan"&gt;{{ cite web | author=Office of Public Sector Information | title=Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 - Explanatory Note | year=1992 | url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1992/Uksi_19923004_en_5.htm#exnote | accessdate=2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patricia J. Bauer''' (born 1957) is Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Psychology at [[Emory University]]. She is known for her research in the field of [[cognitive development]], with a specific focus on how children develop their earliest memories and how their memory is influenced by parents, peers, and the environment around them. Her research has explored the phenomenon of  [[childhood amnesia]] and how social, cognitive, and neural changes relate to the development of [[autobiographical memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychology.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/bauer-patricia.html|title=Patricia J.

Her book ''Remembering the Times of Our Lives: Memory in Infancy and Beyond'' was named Book of the Year (2007) by the Cognitive Development Society''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62089961|title=Remembering the times of our lives : memory in infancy and beyond|last=J.|first=Bauer, Patricia|date=2007|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=9780805857337|location=Mahwah, N.J.|oclc=62089961}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Simona Ghetti]], Bauer edited  the volume ''Origins and Development of Recollection: Perspectives from Psychology and Neuroscience'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/744297057|title=Origins and development of recollection : perspectives from psychology and neuroscience|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Ghetti, Simona., Bauer, Patricia J.|isbn=0195340795|location=Oxford|oclc=744297057}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Robyn Fivush]], she edited ''The'' ''Wiley Handbook on the Development of Children's Memory'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861536653|title=The Wiley handbook on the development of children's memory|others=Bauer, Patricia J., Fivush, Robyn,|isbn=1119993997|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=861536653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer has served as editor of the ''Journal of'' ''Cognition and Development'' (2005–2009) and the ''Society for Research in Child Development Monographs'' (2013–2018).

== Biography ==

Bauer received her Bachelor of Sciences degree in Psychology at [[Indiana Central University]] in 1981. She went to graduate school at [[Miami University]] where she obtained her  M.A. and Ph. D. in Experimental Developmental Psychology. In graduate school, Bauer was mentored by Cecilia Shore, who introduced her to Piaget's genetic epistemology. Cecilia's guidance educated her in applying constructivist theory to a variety of issues regarding language and cognition.

Upon graduation, Bauer completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the [[University of California, San Diego]], where she conducted  studies of categorization in infants and young children in collaboration with [[Jean Matter Mandler|Jean Mandler.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandler|first=Jean M.|last2=Bauer|first2=Patricia J.|title=The cradle of categorization: Is the basic level basic?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0885-2014(88)90011-1|journal=Cognitive Development|volume=3|issue=3|pages=247–264|doi=10.1016/0885-2014(88)90011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to joining the faculty of Emory University in 2007, Bauer held faculty positions at the Institute of Child Development at the [[University of Minnesota]] (1989-2005) and at [[Duke University]] (2005-2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychology.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/bauer-patricia.html|title=Emory College of Arts and Sciences Faculty Profile: Patricia J. Bauer|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the University of Minnesota, Bauer was awarded the Horace T. Morse University of Minnesota Alumni Association Award for Outstanding Contributions to Undergraduate Education (2002). Here, she put together a small team of intelligent and ambitious graduate and undergraduate students, motivated to chase further research on the origins of long-term memory and its theoretical shift from infancy to early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/awards/early-career-contribution.aspx|title=APA Distinguished Scientific Awards for an Early Career Contribution to Psychology|last=|first=|date=|website=APA|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Bauer is widely recognized for her research on the early development of memory, with a specific focus on autobiographical memory of people, objects, and events of personal significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Reviewed by Chad S.|last2=Jaswal|first2=Vikram K.|date=2010-08-11|title=A Review of: "Remembering the Times of Our Lives: Memory in Infancy and Beyond.

Bauer's work highlights a number of factors that contribute to  the formation of memories, including the environment in which an event occurred and its emotional intensity, and the extent to which the information to relates to other pieces of information already stored in memory.&lt;ref name="Emory"&gt;{{cite web|title=ScholarBlogs {{!}} Emory's Own WordPress Instance for Teaching and Research|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/|website=scholarblogs.emory.edu|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of her papers co-authored with Mandler, Bauer tested the ability of toddlers to remember events and whether their abilities were comparable to those of preschool-age children as well as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Patricia J.|last2=Mandler|first2=Jean M.|title=One thing follows another: Effects of temporal structure on 1- to 2-year-olds' recall of events.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.25.2.197|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–206|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.2.197}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study demonstrated the importance of causal connections and temporal structure in supporting children's earliest event memories. Toddlers, like older children and adults, are more likely to remember a series of events if causal relationships were present that linked the elements in the series.  Other notable work on the development of memory is Bauer and colleagues' SRCD monograph on ''Parameters of Remembering and Forgetting in the Transition from Infancy to Early Childhood.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Patricia J.|last2=Wenner|first2=Jennifer A.|last3=Dropik|first3=Patricia L.|last4=Wewerka|first4=Sandi S.|last5=Howe|first5=Mark L.|date=2000|title=Parameters of Remembering and Forgetting in the Transition from Infancy to Early Childhood|jstor=3181580|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=65|issue=4|pages=i–213|doi=10.2307/3181580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a [[virus]], [[bacterium]], or [[entomopathogenic fungus|fungus]]) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant [[pathogen]]s, weeds, [[mollusca|molluscs]], [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[fish]], [[nematode]]s (roundworms), and [[microbe]]s that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]. Although pesticides have benefits, some also have drawbacks, such as [[Pesticide poisoning|potential toxicity]] to humans and other species.

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) has defined ''pesticide'' as:
:any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals, causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage,  transport, or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances that may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids, or other pests in or on their bodies.  The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant, or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit. Also used as substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.&lt;ref name=code /&gt;

Pesticides can be classified by target [[organism]] (e.g., [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, [[rodenticide]]s, and [[pediculicide]]s&lt;ref name="Gilden RC, Huffling K, Sattler B 2010 103–10"/&gt; – see table), chemical structure (e.g., organic, inorganic, synthetic, or [[biopesticide|biological (biopesticide)]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | date=1997|title=Educational and Informational Strategies to Reduce Pesticide Risks|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=26|issue=2|pages=191–200|doi=10.1006/pmed.1996.0122|issn=0091-7435|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the distinction can sometimes blur), and physical state (e.g. [[fumigation|gaseous (fumigant)]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Biopesticide]]s include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/types-pesticide-ingredients|title=Types of Pesticide Ingredients | date=Jan 3, 2017|website=US Environmental Protection Agency|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Dec 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant-derived pesticides, or "botanicals", have been developing quickly. These include the [[pyrethrum|pyrethroid]]s, [[rotenone|rotenoid]]s, [[nicotine|nicotinoid]]s, and a fourth group that includes [[strychnine]] and [[scilliroside]].&lt;ref name=Kamrin1997&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Pesticide-Profiles-Toxicity-Environmental-Impact-and-Fate/Kamrin/p/book/9781566701907|title=Pesticide Profiles: Toxicity, Environmental Impact, and Fate| vauthors = Kamrin MA |date=1997|publisher=CRC|year=|isbn=1566701902|edition=1st|location=Boca Raton|pages=|oclc=35262311}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|15}}

Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include [[organochlorine]]s, [[organophosphate]]s, and [[carbamate]]s. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., [[DDT]]) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]].&lt;ref name=Kamrin1997/&gt;{{Rp|239–240}} Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]], allowing [[acetylcholine]] to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.&lt;ref name=Kamrin1997/&gt;{{Rp|136–137}} Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. [[2,4-D]]), triazines (e.g., [[atrazine]]), ureas (e.g., [[diuron]]), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., [[alachlor]]). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system.&lt;ref name=Kamrin1997/&gt;{{Rp|300}} Triazines interfere with photosynthesis.&lt;ref name=Kamrin1997/&gt;{{Rp|335}} Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including [[glyphosate]].

The application of pest control agents is usually carried out by dispersing the chemical in a (often hydrocarbon-based) [[solvent]]-[[surfactant]] system to give a homogeneous preparation. A virus lethality study performed in 1977 demonstrated that a particular pesticide did not increase the lethality of the virus, however combinations which included some surfactants and the solvent clearly showed that pretreatment with them markedly increased the viral lethality in the test mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Safe S, Plugge H, Crocker JF |date=1977|title=Analysis of an aromatic solvent used in a forest spray program|journal=Chemosphere|volume=6|issue=10|pages=641–651|doi=10.1016/0045-6535(77)90075-3|issn=0045-6535|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method. Most pesticides work by [[poison]]ing pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psep.cce.cornell.edu/Tutorials/core-tutorial/module04/index.aspx|title=Pesticide Applicator Core Tutorial: Module 4 - Toxicity of Pesticides | date=|website=Pesticide Safety Education Program (PSEP)|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Dec 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant. With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the [[xylem]]) and outward. Increased efficiency may be a result. Systemic insecticides, which poison [[pollen]] and [[nectar]] in the [[flower]]s, may kill [[bees]] and other needed [[pollinator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Rortais A, Arnold G, Halm MP, Touffet-Briens F |date=2005|title=Modes of honeybees exposure to systemic insecticides: estimated amounts of contaminated pollen and nectar consumed by different categories of bees|journal=Apidologie|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=71–83|doi=10.1051/apido:2004071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the development of a new class of fungicides called [[paldoxins]] was announced. These work by taking advantage of natural defense chemicals released by plants called [[phytoalexins]], which fungi then detoxify using enzymes. The paldoxins inhibit the fungi's detoxification enzymes. They are believed to be safer and greener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/acs-np030909.php|title=New 'green' pesticides are first to exploit plant defenses in battle of the fungi|author = American Chemical Society |date=2009|work=EurekAlert!|access-date=Dec 1, 2018|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Since before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops. The first known pesticide was elemental [[sulfur]] dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia. The [[Rig Veda]], which is about 4,000 years old, mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao GV, Rupela OP, Rao VR, Reddy YV |date=2007|title=Role of biopesticides in crop protection: present status and future prospects|url=http://oar.icrisat.org/872/1/Indian_Journal_of_Plant_Protection_35_1_1-9_2007.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Indian Journal of Plant Protection|volume=35|issue=1|pages=1–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as [[arsenic]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[lead]] were being applied to crops to kill pests. In the 17th century, [[nicotine]] [[sulfate]] was extracted from [[tobacco]] leaves for use as an insecticide. The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, [[pyrethrum]], which is derived from [[chrysanthemum]]s, and [[rotenone]], which is derived from the roots of tropical [[vegetable]]s.&lt;ref name="Miller2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Living in the Environment| vauthors = Miller GT |publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning|year=2002|isbn=9780534376970|edition=12th|location=Belmont|pages=|oclc=819417923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant.&lt;ref name="Pinpointing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/87/8707cover1a.html|title=Pinpointing Trends In Pesticide Use In 1939| vauthors = Ritter SK |date=2009|work=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|access-date=|publisher=[[American Chemical Society|ACS]]|year=2009|issue=7|volume=87|issn=0009-2347}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Hermann Müller|Paul Müller]] discovered that [[DDT]] was a very effective insecticide. Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S. by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975. Since then, [[pyrethrin]] compounds have become the dominant insecticide.&lt;ref name=Pinpointing/&gt; Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".&lt;ref name=Pinpointing/&gt;

In the 1960s, it was discovered that DDT was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing, which was a serious threat to [[biodiversity]]. [[Rachel Carson]] wrote the best-selling book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' about [[biological magnification]].

==Uses==
Pesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful.&lt;ref name="purdue"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/ppp/ppp-70.pdf|title=The Benefits of Pesticides, A Story Worth Telling|v authors = Whitford F |publisher=Purdue Extension|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they are used to kill [[mosquitoes]] that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like [[West Nile virus]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]]. They can also kill [[bee]]s, [[wasp]]s or [[ant]]s that can cause allergic reactions. Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by [[parasitism|parasites]] such as [[flea]]s.&lt;ref name="purdue"/&gt; Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by [[mold]]y food or diseased produce. Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees, and brush. They can also kill invasive [[weed]]s that may cause environmental damage. Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control [[algae]] and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant.&lt;ref name="VCE"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/waterquality/420-013/420-013.html|title=Pesticides and aquatic animals: A guide to reducing impacts on aquatic systems | vauthors = Helfrich LA, Weigmann DL |date=Jun 1996|website=Virginia Cooperative Extension|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305060503/http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/waterquality/420-013/420-013.html|archive-date=Mar 5, 2009|dead-url=yes|access-date=Oct 14, 2007|last3=Hipkins|first3=P|last4=Stinson|first4=ER}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mold can damage structures such as houses.&lt;ref name="purdue"/&gt; Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage [[rodents]] and insects that infest food such as grain. Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk. Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and the [[Pest Management Regulatory Agency]] (PMRA) of Canada.

[[DDT]], sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochlorine that has been used to fight [[malaria]] since the 1950s. Recent policy statements by the [[World Health Organization]] have given stronger support to this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/|title=WHO gives indoor use of DDT a clean bill of health for controlling malaria | date=Sep 15, 2006|website=[[World Health Organization|WHO]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Sep 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DDT and other organochlorine pesticides have been banned in most countries worldwide because of their persistence in the environment and human toxicity.

==Amount used==
In 2006 and 2007, the world used approximately [[orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|{{convert|2.4|Mt|lb}}]] of pesticides, with herbicides constituting the biggest part of the world pesticide use at 40%, followed by insecticides (17%) and fungicides (10%). In 2006 and 2007 the U.S. used approximately {{convert|0.5|Mt|lb}} of pesticides, accounting for 22% of the world total, including {{convert|857|e6lb}} of conventional pesticides, which are used in the agricultural sector (80% of conventional pesticide use) as well as the industrial, commercial, governmental and home &amp; garden sectors. The state of California alone used 117 million pounds.

The US used some 1&amp;nbsp;kg (2.2 pounds) per [[hectare]] of [[arable land]] compared with: 4.7&amp;nbsp;kg in China, 1.3&amp;nbsp;kg in the UK, 0.1&amp;nbsp;kg in [[Cameroon]], 5.9&amp;nbsp;kg in Japan and 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg in Italy. Insecticide use in the US has declined by more than half since 1980 (.6%/yr), mostly due to the near phase-out of [[organophosphate]]s. In corn fields, the decline was even steeper, due to the switchover to [[transgenic]] [[Bt corn]].&lt;ref name=s730&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Infographic: pesticide planet | journal = Science | volume = 341 | issue = 6147 | pages = 730–1 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23950524 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.341.6147.730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two levels of benefits for pesticide use, primary and secondary. Primary benefits are direct gains from the use of pesticides and secondary benefits are effects that are more long-term.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

===Primary benefits===

Controlling [[pest (organism)|pest]]s and plant disease vectors
*Improved [[crop yield|crop]]/livestock yields
*Improved crop/livestock quality
*[[Invasive species]] controlled

Controlling human/livestock [[disease vector]]s and nuisance organisms
*Human lives saved and disease reduced. Diseases controlled include malaria,&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; with millions of lives having been saved or enhanced with the use of [[DDT]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamey G | title = Roll Back Malaria: a failing global health campaign | journal = Bmj | volume = 328 | issue = 7448 | pages = 1086–7 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15130956 | pmc = 406307 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7448.1086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Wooden structures protected&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

===Monetary===
In one study, it was estimated that for every dollar ($1) that is spent on pesticides for crops can yield up to four dollars ($4) in crops saved.&lt;ref name="Pimental1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pimentel D, Acquay H, Biltonen M, Rice P, Silva M | year = 1992 | title = Environmental and Economic Costs of Pesticide Use | journal = BioScience | volume = 42 | issue = 10| pages = 750–60 | jstor=1311994 | doi = 10.2307/1311994}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means based that, on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides, $10 billion, there is an additional $40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds. In general, farmers benefit from having an increase in crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year. Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year-round.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooper J, Dobson H |date=2007|title=The benefits of pesticides to mankind and the environment|url=https://croplifefoundation.org/Documents/Research%20Briefs/PesticideBenefitsResearchPaper.pdf|dead-url=yes|journal=Crop Protection|volume=26|issue=9|pages=1337–1348|doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2007.03.022 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110927225454/https://croplifefoundation.org/Documents/Research%20Briefs/PesticideBenefitsResearchPaper.pdf |archive-date=Sep 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental effects===
{{Main|Environmental effects of pesticides}}
Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt; [[Pesticide drift]] occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides are one of the causes of [[water pollution]], and some pesticides are [[persistent organic pollutants]] and contribute to [[soil contamination]].

Pests can develop a resistance to the pesticide  ([[pesticide resistance]]), necessitating a new pesticide. Alternatively a greater dose of the pesticide can be used to counteract the resistance, although this will cause a worsening of the ambient pollution problem.

The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]], listed 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent [[organic chemicals]] that were (now mostly obsolete) organochlorine pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pops.int/documents/guidance/beg_guide.pdf |title=Ridding The World of Pops: A Guide to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |date=April 2005 |access-date= 5 February 2017 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315065236/http://www.pops.int/documents/guidance/beg_guide.pdf |archive-date=15 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilden RC, Huffling K, Sattler B 2010 103–10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilden RC, Huffling K, Sattler B | title = Pesticides and health risks | journal = Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–10 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20409108 | doi = 10.1111/j.1552-6909.2009.01092.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides [[Fat-soluble|dissolve in fats]] and are not excreted, organisms tend to retain them almost indefinitely. [[Biomagnification|Biological magnification]] is the process whereby these chlorinated hydrocarbons (pesticides) are more concentrated at each level of the food chain.

In order to reduce negative impacts, it is desirable that pesticides be degradable or at least quickly deactivated in the environment.

In one study, the human health and environmental costs due to pesticides in the United States was estimated to be [[Orders of magnitude (currency)|$9.6 billion]]: offset by about $40 billion in increased agricultural production.&lt;ref name="Pimental"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pimentel D | year = 2005 | title = Environmental and Economic Costs of the Application of Pesticides Primarily in the United States | url = http://www.beyondpesticides.org/documents/pimentel.pesticides.2005update.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 229–252 | doi=10.1007/s10668-005-7314-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional costs include the registration process and the cost of purchasing pesticides: which are typically borne by agrichemical companies and farmers respectively. The registration process can take several years to complete (there are 70 different types of field test) and can cost $50–70 million for a single pesticide.&lt;ref name="Pimental" /&gt; At the beginning of the 21st century, the United States spent approximately $10 billion on pesticides annually.&lt;ref name="Pimental" /&gt;

==Alternatives==
Alternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of [[biological pest control]]s (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides), [[genetic engineering]], and methods of interfering with insect breeding.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt;  Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.&lt;ref name="nematodes"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McSorley R, Gallaher RN | title = Effect of yard waste compost on nematode densities and maize yield | journal = Journal of Nematology | volume = 28 | issue = 4S | pages = 655–60 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 19277191 | pmc = 2619736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides. In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers.

Cultivation practices include [[polyculture]] (growing multiple types of plants), [[crop rotation]], planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of [[trap crop]]s that attract pests away from the real crop.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt; Trap crops have successfully controlled pests in some commercial agricultural systems while reducing pesticide usage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shelton AM, Badenes-Perez FR | title = Concepts and applications of trap cropping in pest management | journal = Annual Review of Entomology | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 285–308 | date = 2005-12-06 | pmid = 16332213 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ento.51.110104.150959 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in many other systems, trap crops can fail to reduce pest densities at a commercial scale, even when the trap crop works in controlled experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|last3=Lee|first3=Doo-Hyung|last4=Nyrop|first4=Jan P.|last5=Sanderson|first5=John P. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012-06-01|title=Designing an effective trap cropping strategy: the effects of attraction, retention and plant spatial distribution |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|volume=49|issue=3|pages=715–722|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02137.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}

Release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use. These organisms can include natural [[predator]]s or [[parasite]]s of the pests.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt; [[Biological pesticides]] based on [[entomopathogenic fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es cause disease in the pest species can also be used.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt;

Interfering with insects' reproduction can be accomplished by [[Sterile insect technique|sterilizing males]] of the target species and releasing them, so that they [[mating|mate]] with females but do not produce offspring.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt; This technique was first used on the [[Cochliomyia hominivorax|screwworm fly]] in 1958 and has since been used with the [[medfly]], the [[tsetse fly]],&lt;ref&gt;(July 2007), [http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/B/Biocontrols.html The biological control of pests]. Retrieved on September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[gypsy moth]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-401/ch17.htm SP-401 Skylab, Classroom in Space: Part III - Science Demonstrations, Chapter 17: Life Sciences]. History.nasa.gov. Retrieved on September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt;

===Push pull strategy===
{{main|Push–pull technology}}

The term "push-pull" was established in 1987 as an approach for [[integrated pest management]] (IPM).  This strategy uses a mixture of behavior-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of insects. "Push" means the insects are repelled or deterred away from whatever resource that is being protected.  "Pull" means that certain stimuli (semiochemical stimuli, pheromones, food additives, visual stimuli, genetically altered plants, etc.) are used to attract pests to trap crops where they will be killed.&lt;ref name=PushPull&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cook SM, Khan ZR, Pickett JA | title = The use of push-pull strategies in integrated pest management | journal = Annual Review of Entomology | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 375–400 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16968206 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ento.52.110405.091407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are numerous different components involved in order to implement a Push-Pull Strategy in IPM.

Many case studies testing the effectiveness of the push-pull approach have been done across the world.  The most successful push-pull strategy was developed in Africa for subsistence farming.  Another successful case study was performed on the control of ''Helicoverpa'' in cotton crops in Australia.  In Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, push-pull strategies were successfully used in the controlling of ''Sitona lineatus'' in bean fields.&lt;ref name=PushPull/&gt;

Some advantages of using the push-pull method are less use of chemical or biological materials and better protection against insect habituation to this control method.  Some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable.  Furthermore, because the push-pull method is not a very popular method of IPM operational and registration costs are higher.

=== Effectiveness ===

Some evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals. For example, [[Sweden]] has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}} In Indonesia, farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65% and experienced a 15% crop increase.&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}  A study of [[Maize]] fields in northern Florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high [[carbon to nitrogen ratio]] to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic [[nematode]]s and increasing crop yield, with yield increases ranging from 10% to 212%; the observed effects were long-term, often not appearing until the third season of the study.&lt;ref name="nematodes" /&gt;

However, pesticide resistance is increasing. In the 1940s, U.S. farmers lost only 7% of their crops to pests.  Since the 1980s, loss has increased to 13%, even though more pesticides are being used.{{dubious|date=September 2014}}  Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panna.org/issues/pesticides-101-primer#2 |title=Pesticides 101 - A primer on pesticides, their use in agriculture and the exposure we face &amp;#124; Pesticide Action Network |publisher=Panna.org |access-date=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}

==Types==
Pesticides are often referred to according to the type of pest they control. Pesticides can also be considered as either biodegradable pesticides, which will be broken down by microbes and other living beings into harmless compounds, or persistent pesticides, which may take months or years before they are broken down: it was the persistence of DDT, for example, which led to its accumulation in the food chain and its killing of birds of prey at the top of the food chain. Another way to think about pesticides is to consider those that are chemical pesticides are derived from a common source or production method.&lt;ref name=US-EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Pesticides|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/types.htm|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecticides===
[[Neonicotinoids]] are a class of neuro-active [[insecticide]]s chemically similar to [[nicotine]]. [[Imidacloprid]], of the neonicotanoid family, is the most widely used insecticide in the world.&lt;ref name=Yamamoto1999&gt;{{cite book| first = Izuru | last = Yamamoto | name-list-format = vanc | contribution = Nicotine to Nicotinoids: 1962 to 1997 | pages = 3–27 | editor-first = Izuru | editor-last = Yamamoto | editor2-first = John | editor2-last = Casida | editor2-link = John E.

In 2013, the [[European Union]] and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain neonicotinoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cressey D | title = Europe debates risk to bees | journal = Nature | volume = 496 | issue = 7446 | pages = 408 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23619669 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/496408a }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gill RJ, Ramos-Rodriguez O, Raine NE | title = Combined pesticide exposure severely affects individual- and colony-level traits in bees | journal = Nature | volume = 491 | issue = 7422 | pages = 105–8 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23086150 | pmc = 3495159 | doi = 10.1038/nature11585 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dicks L | title = Bees, lies and evidence-based policy | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7437 | pages = 283 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23426287 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/494283a }}&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Stoddart C | doi = 10.1038/nature.2012.11626 | title = The buzz about pesticides | journal = Nature | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osborne JL | title = Ecology: Bumblebees and pesticides | journal = Nature | volume = 491 | issue = 7422 | pages = 43–5 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23086148 | doi = 10.1038/nature11637 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cressey | first1 = D. | doi = 10.1038/nature.2013.12234 | title = Reports spark row over bee-bothering insecticides | journal = Nature | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECbees&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/liveanimals/bees/neonicotinoids_en.htm Bees &amp; Pesticides: Commission goes ahead with plan to better protect bees.] 30 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organophosphate]] and [[carbamate]] insecticides have a similar [[mode of action]]. They affect the nervous system of target pests (and non-target organisms) by disrupting [[acetylcholinesterase]] activity, the enzyme that regulates [[acetylcholine]], at nerve [[synapse]]s. This inhibition causes an increase in synaptic [[acetylcholine]] and over-stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colović MB, Krstić DZ, Lazarević-Pašti TD, Bondžić AM, Vasić VM | title = Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: pharmacology and toxicology | journal = Current Neuropharmacology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 315–35 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 24179466 | pmc = 3648782 | doi = 10.2174/1570159X11311030006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these insecticides, first developed in the mid 20th century, are very poisonous.  Although commonly used in the past, many older chemicals have been removed from the market due to their health and environmental effects (''e.g.'' [[DDT]], [[chlordane]], and [[toxaphene]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  However, many [[organophosphate]]s are not persistent in the environment.

[[Pyrethroid]] insecticides were developed as a synthetic version of the naturally occurring pesticide pyrethrin, which is found in chrysanthemums. They have been modified to increase their stability in the environment. Some synthetic pyrethroids are toxic to the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hayes' Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology|last=Soderlund|first=David|publisher=Academic Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-12-374367-1|editor-last=Kreiger|editor-first=Robert | name-list-format = vanc |edition=3|location=|pages=1665–1686|chapter=Chapter 77 – Toxicology and Mode of Action of Pyrethroid Insecticides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopesticides===
{{Main|Biopesticide}}
[[Biopesticides]] are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals. For example, canola oil and baking soda have pesticidal applications and are considered biopesticides.  Biopesticides fall into three major classes:

* [[Microbial]] pesticides which consist of bacteria, [[entomopathogenic fungi]] or viruses (and sometimes includes the metabolites that bacteria or fungi produce). Entomopathogenic [[nematode]]s are also often classed as microbial pesticides, even though they are multi-cellular.&lt;ref name="Coombs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coombs|first=Amy | name-list-format = vanc |title=Fighting Microbes with Microbes|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33703/title/Fighting-Microbes-with-Microbes/|work=The Scientist|access-date=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Borgio J, Sahayaraj K and Alper Susurluk I (eds) .

* Biochemical pesticides or herbal pesticides&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Antifungal activity of some common weed extracts against wilt causing fungi, ''Fusarium oxysporum''|date = 2013|url = http://www.ijcdi.com/FILEPath/82.pdf | vauthors = Pal GK, Kumar B |journal = Current Discovery|publisher = International Young Scientist Association for Applied Research and Development |issue = 1|volume = 2|pages = 62–67|deadurl = yes|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131216235945/http://www.ijcdi.com/FILEPath/82.pdf|archive-date = December 16, 2013|df = }}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; are naturally occurring substances that control (or monitor in the case of [[pheromones]]) pests and microbial diseases.
* Plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) have genetic material from other species incorporated into their genetic material (''i.e.'' [[GM crop]]s). Their use is controversial, especially in many European countries.&lt;ref&gt;National Pesticide Information Center  Last updated November 21, 2013 [http://npic.orst.edu/reg/pip.html Plant Incorporated Protectants (PIPs) / Genetically Modified Plants]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further types===
The term pesticide also include these substances:

Defoliants: Cause leaves or other foliage to drop from a plant, usually to facilitate harvest.&lt;br /&gt;
Desiccants: Promote drying of living tissues, such as unwanted plant tops.&lt;br /&gt;
Insect growth regulators: Disrupt the molting, maturity from pupal stage to adult, or other life processes of insects.&lt;br /&gt; 
Plant growth regulators: Substances (excluding fertilizers or other plant nutrients) that alter the expected growth, flowering, or reproduction rate of plants.&lt;br /&gt;
Wood preservatives: They are used to make wood resistant to insects, fungus, and other pests.

In Europe, recent{{when|date=September 2013}} EU legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are [[carcinogenic]], [[mutagenic]] or toxic to reproduction, those that are endocrine-disrupting, and those that are persistent, [[bioaccumulative]] and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB). {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Measures were approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/066-45937-012-01-03-911-20090112IPR45936-12-01-2009-2009-false/default_en.htm Pesticide Legislation Approved] last retrieved 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides, and products on which they were used are traded across international borders. To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries.&lt;ref name="regWillson"/&gt; The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations | url = http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/Code/PM_Code.htm | title = Programmes: International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121011073056/http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/code/PM_Code.htm | archive-date = 2012-10-11 | dead-url = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.&lt;ref name=code&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations | date = 2002 | url = http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/Code/Download/code.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130404190746/http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGP/AGPP/Pesticid/Code/Download/code.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 4 April 2013 | title = International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the [[United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade]] and the [[Codex Alimentarius|United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}  The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries.&lt;ref name="reynoldsjd"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reynolds JD | year = 1997 | url = http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/landuse/Vol131/REYN.HTMl | title = International pesticide trade: Is there any hope for the effective regulation of controlled substances? | journal = Florida State University Journal of Land Use &amp; Environmental Law | volume = 131 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120527062748/http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/landuse/vol131/reyn.html | archive-date = 2012-05-27 }} =&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesticides safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from [[pesticide misuse]], but do not eliminate all misuse. Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use.&lt;ref name="VCE"/&gt;  [[Integrated pest management]], the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as [[Indonesia]], [[China]], [[Bangladesh]], the U.S., [[Australia]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="sustaining"/&gt; IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an [[ecosystem]], so that natural balances are not upset.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; New pesticides are being developed, including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks.  In addition, applicators are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides.

Pesticides can be created that are targeted to a specific pest's lifecycle, which can be environmentally more friendly.&lt;ref name="potatonema"&gt;''Science Daily'', (October 11, 2001), [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/10/011010074556.htm Environmentally-friendly pesticide to combat potato cyst nematodes].

[[File:Monsanto's Lasso herbicide (cropped).jpg|thumb|Preparation for an [[pesticide application|application]] of hazardous herbicide in the US]]

In the [[United States]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]] (FIFRA) and the [[Food Quality Protection Act]] (FQPA).&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/health/public.htm#regulation | title = Pesticides and Public Health | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency | access-date = 2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies must be conducted to establish the conditions in which the material is safe to use and the effectiveness against the intended pest(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/data_requirements.htm|title=Data Requirements for Pesticide Registration|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA regulates pesticides to ensure that these products do not pose adverse effects to humans or the environment.  Pesticides produced before November 1984 continue to be reassessed in order to meet the current scientific and regulatory standards.  All registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards.&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt; During the registration process, a label is created. The label contains directions for proper use of the material in addition to safety restrictions. Based on acute toxicity, pesticides are assigned to a [[Toxicity Class]].

Some pesticides are considered too hazardous for sale to the general public and are designated [[restricted use pesticide]]s.  Only certified applicators, who have passed an exam, may purchase or supervise the application of restricted use pesticides.&lt;ref name="regWillson"/&gt; Records of sales and use are required to be maintained and may be audited by government agencies charged with the enforcement of pesticide regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/policies/incentives/auditing/apcol-fifra.pdf|title=Protocol for Conducting Environmental Compliance Audits under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/publications/monitoring/fifra/manuals/fifra/fiframanch_19.pdf|title=Restricted-Use Pesticides: Dealer and Applicator Records Inspections | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; These records must be made available to employees and state or territorial environmental regulatory agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3084.html|title=Chemical Hazard Communication | publisher = United States Department of Labor; Occupational Safety and Health Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/lcra.html | title = Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA regulates pesticides under two main acts, both of which amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. In addition to the EPA, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) set standards for the level of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops.&lt;ref name="Regulations"&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Toth SJ | publisher = North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service | url = http://ipm.ncsu.edu/safety/factsheets/laws.pdf | title = Federal Pesticide Laws and Regulations | date = March 1996 }} &lt;/ref&gt; The EPA looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be associated with the use of the pesticide.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web | date = February 16, 2011 | url = http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/registration.htm | title = Pesticide Registration Program | publisher =  United States Environmental Protection Agency | access-date = February 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the U.S. EPA uses the National Research Council's four-step process for human health risk assessment: (1) Hazard Identification, (2) Dose-Response Assessment, (3) Exposure Assessment, and (4) Risk Characterization.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/riskassess.htm | title = Assessing Health Risks from Pesticides | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently Kaua'i County (Hawai'i) passed Bill No. 2491 to add an article to Chapter 22 of the county's code relating to pesticides and GMOs. The bill strengthens protections of local communities in Kaua'i where many large pesticide companies test their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://media.wix.com/ugd/5f73cf_56e4e700de9ae57e7b709740824bbed4.pdf | title=Bill No. 2491, Draft 2 | publisher = Council of the County of Kaua‘i | date = October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residue==
{{Main|Pesticide residue}}

Pesticide residue refers to the pesticides that may remain on or in food after they are applied to food crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=pesticide residue|file=P04520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum allowable levels of these residues in foods are often stipulated by regulatory bodies in many countries. Regulations such as pre-harvest intervals also often prevent harvest of crop or livestock products if recently treated in order to allow residue concentrations to decrease over time to safe levels before harvest. Exposure of the general population to these residues most commonly occurs through consumption of treated food sources, or being in close contact to areas treated with pesticides such as farms or lawns.&lt;ref name=EPAres&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/eroe/index.cfm?fuseaction=detail.viewInd&amp;lv=list.listByAlpha&amp;r=224028&amp;subtop=312|title=Pesticide Residue|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these chemical residues, especially derivatives of chlorinated pesticides, exhibit [[bioaccumulation]]  which could build up to harmful levels in the body as well as in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garzia NA, Spinelli JJ, Gotay CC, Teschke K | title = Literature review: dermal monitoring data for pesticide exposure assessment of farm workers | journal = Journal of Agromedicine | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–214 | date = 2018-07-03 | pmid = 30047858 | doi = 10.1080/1059924x.2018.1448734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chlorinatedpest&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crinnion WJ | title = Chlorinated pesticides: threats to health and importance of detection | journal = Alternative Medicine Review | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 347–59 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20030461 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persistent organic pollutant|Persistent chemical]]s can be magnified through the [[food chain]] and have been detected in products ranging from meat, poultry, and fish, to vegetable oils, nuts, and various fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=fattyfood&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chung SW, Chen BL | title = Determination of organochlorine pesticide residues in fatty foods: a critical review on the analytical methods and their testing capabilities | journal = Journal of Chromatography.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Prader–Willi syndrome''' ('''PWS''') is a [[genetic disorder]] due to loss of function of specific genes.&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt; In [[newborn]]s symptoms include [[hypotonia|weak muscles]], poor feeding, and slow development.&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt; Beginning in childhood the person becomes constantly hungry which often leads to [[obesity]] and [[type 2 diabetes]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt; There is also typically mild to moderate [[intellectual impairment]] and behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt; Often the forehead is narrow, hands and feet small, height short, skin light in color, and those affected are [[infertile|unable to have children]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
About 74% of cases occur when part of the father's [[chromosome 15]] is deleted.&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt; In another 25% of cases the person has two copies of chromosome 15 from their mother and none from their father.&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt; As parts of the chromosome from the mother are [[genomic imprinting|turned off]] they end up with no working copies of certain genes.&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt; PWS is not generally [[Heredity|inherited]] but instead the genetic changes happen during the formation of the [[egg]], [[sperm]], or in early development.&lt;ref name=NIH2014 /&gt; There are no known risk factors.&lt;ref name=NIH2014Epi /&gt; Those who have one child with PWS have less than a 1% chance of the next child being affected.&lt;ref name=NIH2014Epi /&gt; A similar mechanism occurs in [[Angelman syndrome]] except there is a defective chromosome 15 from the mother or two copies from the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/prader-willi/conditioninfo/Pages/faqs.aspx |title=Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS): Other FAQs |publisher=NICHD |date=2014-01-14 |accessdate=2016-08-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727232941/https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/prader-willi/conditioninfo/Pages/faqs.aspx |archivedate=July 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angelman syndrome|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/angelman-syndrome#expand-collapse-start|website=Genetic Home Reference|accessdate=20 August 2016|date=May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827221651/https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/angelman-syndrome#expand-collapse-start|archivedate=August 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Pws.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype at 15 years of age. Note absence of typical PWS facial features and presence of mild truncal obesity.]]
There are many signs and symptoms of Prader–Willi syndrome. The symptoms can range from poor muscle tone during infancy to behavioral problems in early childhood. Some symptoms that are usually found in infants, besides poor muscle tone, would be a lack of eye coordination; some are born with almond-shaped eyes; and due to poor muscle tone the infant may not have a strong sucking reflex. Their cry is weak, and they have difficulty waking up. Another sign of this condition is a thin upper lip.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

More aspects seen in a clinical overview include hypotonia and abnormal neurologic function, hypogonadism, developmental and cognitive delays, hyperphagia and obesity, short stature, and behavioral and psychiatric disturbances.&lt;ref name=Cas2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassidy|first1=Suzanne B|last2=Driscoll|first2=Daniel J|title=Prader–Willi syndrome|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=10 September 2008|volume=17|issue=1|pages=3–13|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2008.165|pmc=2985966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuro-cognitive ===
Individuals with PWS are at risk of learning and attention difficulties. Curfs and Fryns (1992) conducted research into the varying degrees of [[learning disability]] found in PWS.&lt;ref name="pmid1340242"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Curfs LM, Fryns JP | title = Prader-Willi syndrome: a review with special attention to the cognitive and behavioral profile | journal = Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–104 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1340242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their results, using a measure of [[IQ]], were as follows:
* 5%: IQ above 85 (high to low average intelligence)
* 27%: IQ 70–85 (borderline intellectual functioning)
* 39%: IQ 50–70 (mild intellectual disability)
* 27%: IQ 35–50 (moderate intellectual disability)
* 1%: IQ 20–35 (severe intellectual disability)
* &lt;1%: IQ &lt;20 (profound intellectual disability)

Cassidy found that 40% of individuals with PWS have borderline/low average intelligence,&lt;ref name="pmid9391886"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cassidy SB | title = Prader-Willi syndrome | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | pages = 917–23 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9391886 | pmc = 1051120 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.34.11.917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure higher than the 32% found in Curfs and Fryns' study.&lt;ref name="pmid1340242" /&gt; However, both studies suggest that most individuals (50–65%) fall within the mild/borderline/low average intelligence range.

Children with PWS show an unusual cognitive profile. They are often strong in visual organization and perception, including reading and vocabulary, but their spoken language (sometimes affected by [[hypernasality]]) is generally poorer than their comprehension. A marked skill in completing [[jigsaw puzzle]]s has been noted,&lt;ref name="Udwin"&gt;{{cite web |author=Udwin O |title=Prader-Willi syndrome: Psychological and behavioural characteristics |date=November 1998 |publisher=Contact a Family |url=http://www.cafamily.org.uk/medicalinformation/conditions/azlistings/p33_3.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716085822/http://www.cafamily.org.uk/medicalinformation/conditions/azlistings/p33_3.html |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holm VA, Cassidy SB, Butler MG, Hanchett JM, Greenswag LR, Whitman BY, Greenberg F | title = Prader-Willi syndrome: consensus diagnostic criteria | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 91 | issue = 2 | pages = 398–402 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8424017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this may be an effect of increased practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whittington J, Holland A, Webb T, Butler J, Clarke D, Boer H | title = Cognitive abilities and genotype in a population-based sample of people with Prader-Willi syndrome | journal = J Intellect Disabil Res | volume = 48 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 172–87 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14723659 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2004.00556.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditory information processing and sequential processing are relatively poor, as are arithmetic and writing skills, visual and [[Working memory|auditory short-term memory]] and auditory [[attention span]]. These sometimes improve with age, but deficits in these areas remain throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name="Udwin" /&gt;

There may be an association with psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boer|first1=H|last2=Holland|first2=A|last3=Whittington|first3=J|last4=Butler|first4=J|last5=Webb|first5=T|last6=Clarke|first6=D|title=Psychotic illness in people with Prader Willi syndrome due to chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy.|journal=Lancet|date=12 January 2002|volume=359|issue=9301|pages=135–6|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07340-3|pmid=11809260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral ===
Prader–Willi syndrome is frequently associated with a constant, extreme, ravenous insatiable appetite which persists no matter how much the patient eats, often resulting in [[morbid obesity]].  Caregivers need to strictly limit the patients' access to food, usually by installing locks on refrigerators and on all closets and cabinets where food is stored.&lt;ref name="treatments"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/prader-willi/conditioninfo/Pages/treatments.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706030852/https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/prader-willi/conditioninfo/Pages/treatments.aspx |archivedate=July 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common genetic cause of morbid obesity in children.&lt;ref name="Nordqvist" /&gt; There is currently no consensus as to the cause for this symptom, although genetic abnormalities in chromosome 15 disrupt the normal functioning of the [[hypothalamus]].&lt;ref name="pmid9391886" /&gt; Given that the hypothalamus [[arcuate nucleus]] regulates many basic processes, including appetite, there may well be a link. In the hypothalamus of people with PWS, nerve cells that produce [[oxytocin]], a hormone thought to contribute to satiety, have been found to be abnormal.

People with Prader–Willi syndrome have high [[ghrelin]] levels, which are thought to directly contribute to the increased appetite, hyperphagia, and obesity seen in this syndrome.&lt;ref name="pmid12091883"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cummings DE, Clement K, Purnell JQ, Vaisse C, Foster KE, Frayo RS, Schwartz MW, Basdevant A, Weigle DS | title = Elevated plasma ghrelin levels in Prader Willi syndrome | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 643–4 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12091883 | doi = 10.1038/nm0702-643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassidy states the need for a clear delineation of behavioral expectations, the reinforcement of behavioural limits and the establishment of regular routines.

The main mental health difficulties experienced by people with PWS include compulsive behaviour (usually manifested in skin picking) and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Udwin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clark DJ, Boer H, Webb T |title=General and behavioural aspects of PWS: a review |journal=Mental Health Research |volume=8 |issue=195 |pages=38–49 |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatric symptoms, for example, hallucinations, paranoia and depression, have been described in some cases&lt;ref name="Udwin" /&gt; and affect approximately 5–10% of young adults.&lt;ref name="pmid9391886" /&gt;  Patients are also often extremely stubborn and prone to anger.&lt;ref name="treatments" /&gt; Psychiatric and behavioural problems are the most common cause of hospitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassidy SB, Devi A, Mukaida C |title=Aging in PWS: 232 patients over age 30 years |journal=Proc. Greenwood Genetic Centre |volume=13 |pages=102–3 |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is typical for to 70–90% of affected individuals to develop behavioral patterns in early childhood.&lt;ref name=Cas2008 /&gt; Aspects of these patterns can include stubbornness, temper tantrums, controlling and manipulative behavior, difficulty with change in routine, and compulsive-like behaviors.&lt;ref name=Cas2008 /&gt;

=== Endocrine ===
There are several aspects of PWS that support the concept of growth hormone deficiency in individuals with PWS. Specifically, individuals with PWS have short stature, are obese with abnormal body composition, have reduced fat free mass (FFM), have reduced lean body mass (LBM) and total energy expenditure, and have decreased bone density.

PWS is characterized by hypogonadism. This is manifested as undescended testes in males and benign premature [[adrenarche]] in females. Testes may descend with time or can be managed with surgery or testosterone replacement. Adrenarche may be treated with hormone replacement therapy.

=== Ophthalmologic ===
PWS is commonly associated with development of [[strabismus]]. In one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hered RW, Rogers S, Zang YF, Biglan AW | title = Ophthalmologic features of Prader-Willi syndrome | journal = J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 145–50 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3397859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; over 50% of patients had strabismus, mainly [[esotropia]].

== Genetics ==
[[File:Angelman.PNG|right]]
PWS is a disorder caused by an epigenetic phenomenon known as [[Genomic imprinting|imprinting]]. PWS is caused by the deletion of the paternal copies of the [[Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N|SNRPN]] and [[NDN (gene)|necdin]] genes along with clusters of [[snoRNA]]s: [[Small nucleolar RNA SNORD64|SNORD64]], SNORD107, SNORD108 and two copies of SNORD109, 29 copies of [[small nucleolar RNA SNORD116|SNORD116]] (HBII-85) and 48 copies of [[small nucleolar RNA SNORD115|SNORD115]] (HBII-52). These are on [[chromosome 15 (human)|chromosome 15]] located in the region 15q11-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|17627|Prader-Willi Syndrome; PWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de los Santos T, Schweizer J, Rees CA, Francke U | title = Small evolutionarily conserved RNA, resembling C/D box small nucleolar RNA, is transcribed from PWCR1, a novel imprinted gene in the Prader-Willi deletion region, which Is highly expressed in brain | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 1067–82 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11007541 | pmc = 1288549 | doi = 10.1086/303106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cavaillé J, Buiting K, Kiefmann M, Lalande M, Brannan CI, Horsthemke B, Bachellerie JP, Brosius J, Hüttenhofer A | title = Identification of brain-specific and imprinted small nucleolar RNA genes exhibiting an unusual genomic organization | journal = Proc.

Other less common mechanisms include; [[uniparental disomy]], sporadic [[mutations]], chromosome [[translocations]], and gene deletions. Due to imprinting, the maternally inherited copies of these genes are virtually silent, only the paternal copies of the genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="pmid7795645"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buiting|first1=K|last2=Saitoh|first2=S|last3=Gross|first3=S|last4=Dittrich|first4=B|last5=Schwartz|first5=S|last6=Nicholls|first6=RD|last7=Horsthemke|first7=B|title=Inherited microdeletions in the Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes define an imprinting centre on human chromosome 15.|journal=Nature Genetics|date=April 1995|volume=9|issue=4|pages=395–400|pmid=7795645|doi=10.1038/ng0495-395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-major-breakthrough-prader-willi-syndrome-parental.html |title=Major breakthrough in understanding Prader-Willi syndrome, a parental imprinting disorder |publisher=Medicalxpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428215805/http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-05-major-breakthrough-prader-willi-syndrome-parental.html |archivedate=April 28, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; PWS results from the loss of paternal copies of this region. Deletion of the same region on the maternal chromosome causes [[Angelman syndrome]] (AS). PWS and AS represent the first reported instances of imprinting disorders in humans.

The risk to the sibling of an affected child of having PWS depends upon the genetic mechanism which caused the disorder. The risk to siblings is &lt;1% if the affected child has a gene deletion or uniparental disomy, up to 50% if the affected child has a mutation of the imprinting control region, and up to 25% if a parental chromosomal translocation is present. [[Prenatal testing]] is possible for any of the known genetic mechanisms.

A [[microdeletion]] in one family of the snoRNA HBII-52 has excluded it from playing a major role in the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Runte M, Varon R, Horn D, Horsthemke B, Buiting K | title = Exclusion of the C/D box snoRNA gene cluster HBII-52 from a major role in Prader-Willi syndrome. | journal = Hum Genet | volume = 116 | issue = 3 | pages = 228–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15565282 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-004-1219-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
It is traditionally characterized by [[hypotonia]], short stature, [[hyperphagia]], [[obesity]], behavioral issues (specifically [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]]-like behaviors), small hands and feet, [[hypogonadism]], and mild intellectual disability.&lt;ref name="killeen-41" /&gt; However, with early diagnosis and early treatment (such as with growth hormone therapy), the prognosis for persons with PWS is beginning to change. Like autism, PWS is a spectrum disorder and symptoms can range from mild to severe and may change throughout the person's lifetime. Various organ systems are affected.

Traditionally, Prader–Willi syndrome was diagnosed by clinical presentation. Currently, the syndrome is diagnosed through genetic testing; testing is recommended for newborns with pronounced [[hypotonia]]. Early diagnosis of PWS allows for early intervention as well as the early prescription of [[growth hormone]]. Daily recombinant growth hormone (GH) injections are indicated for children with PWS. GH supports linear growth and increased muscle mass, and may lessen food preoccupation and weight gain.

The mainstay of diagnosis is [[genetic testing]], specifically DNA-based methylation testing to detect the absence of the paternally contributed Prader–Willi syndrome/[[Angelman syndrome]] (PWS/AS) region on [[chromosome 15]]q11-q13. Such testing detects over 97% of cases. Methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the diagnosis of PWS in all individuals, but especially those who are too young to manifest sufficient features to make the diagnosis on clinical grounds or in those individuals who have atypical findings.

Prader–Willi syndrome is often misdiagnosed as other syndromes due to many in the medical community's unfamiliarity with PWS.&lt;ref name="Nordqvist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordqvist|first=Christian|title=What Is Prader-Willi Syndrome?

== Treatment ==
Prader–Willi syndrome has no cure; however, several treatments are in place to lessen the condition's symptoms. During infancy, subjects should undergo therapies to improve muscle strength. Speech and occupational therapy are also indicated. During the school years, children benefit from a highly structured learning environment as well as extra help. The largest problem associated with the syndrome is severe obesity.  Access to food must be strictly supervised and limited, usually by installing locks on all food-storage places including refrigerators.&lt;ref name="treatments" /&gt;

Because hypotonia can be a symptom of PWS, it is vital to provide proper nutrition during infancy.  It is also very important to stress physical activity in individuals with PWS for all ages in order to optimize strength and promote a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Cas2008 /&gt;

Prescription of daily recombinant [[growth hormone]] injections are indicated for children with PWS. GH supports linear growth and increased muscle mass, and may lessen food preoccupation and weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies PS, Evans S, Broomhead S, Clough H, Day JM, Laidlaw A, Barnes ND | title = Effect of growth hormone on height, weight, and body composition in Prader-Willi syndrome | journal = Arch.

Because of severe obesity, obstructive [[sleep apnea]] is a common [[sequelae|sequela]], and a [[positive airway pressure]] machine is often needed. There may come a time when a person who has been diagnosed with PWS may have to undergo surgical procedures. One surgery that has proven to be unsuccessful for treating the obesity is gastric bypass.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Patients with Prader–Willi syndrome have a very high tolerance to pain; therefore they may be experiencing significant abdominal symptoms such as acute gastritis, appendicitis, or cholecystitis and not be aware of it until later.

Behavior and psychiatric problems should be detected early for the best results.  These issues are best when treated with parental education and training.  Sometimes medication is introduced as well.  Serotonin agonists have been most effective in lessening temper tantrums and improving compulsivity.&lt;ref name=Cas2008 /&gt;

Despite its rarity, Prader–Willi syndrome has been often referenced in popular culture, partly due to curiosity surrounding the insatiable appetite and obesity that are symptoms.

Prader–Willi syndrome has been depicted and documented several times in television. A fictional individual with Prader–Willi syndrome featured in the episode "Dog Eat Dog" of the television series ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', which aired on November 24, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.csifiles.com/reviews/csi/dog_eat_dog.shtml| publisher = Csifiles.com| title = Dog Eat Dog| accessdate = June 12, 2009| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090604224224/http://csifiles.com/reviews/csi/dog_eat_dog.shtml| archivedate = June 4, 2009| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK media in July 2007, [[Channel 4]] aired a 2006 documentary called ''[[Can't Stop Eating (documentary)|Can't Stop Eating]]'', surrounding the everyday lives of two people with Prader–Willi syndrome, Joe and Tamara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/F/family/problems/pws.html | title = Can't Stop Eating | publisher = Channel4.com | accessdate = June 12, 2009 | year = 2006 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725045948/http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/F/family/problems/pws.html | archivedate = July 25, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the May 9, 2010 episode of ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]],'' [[Sheryl Crow]] helped [[Ty Pennington]] rebuild a home for a family whose youngest son, Ethan Starkweather, was living with Prader–Willi syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aoltv.com/tag/Extreme+Makeover:+Home+Edition/ |title=Extreme Makeover: Home Edition Articles on AOL TV |publisher=Aoltv.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211411/http://www.aoltv.com/tag/Extreme+Makeover%3A+Home+Edition/ |archivedate=September 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the March 22, 2012 episode of ''[[Mystery Diagnosis]]'' on the Discovery Health channel, Conor Heybach, who has Prader–Willi syndrome, shared his story of how he was diagnosed with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwsausa.org/Anouncements/March2010-TV.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714151810/http://www.pwsausa.org/Anouncements/March2010-TV.htm|date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Real world evidence''' (RWE) in medicine means evidence obtained from [[real world data]] (RWD), which are [[observational data]] obtained outside the context of [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCTs) and generated during routine clinical practice. In order to assess patient outcomes and to ensure that patients get treatment that is right for them, real world data needs to be utilized. RWE is generated by analyzing data which is stored in [[electronic health records]] (EHR), medical claims or billing activities databases, registries, patient-generated data, mobile devices, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RealWorldEvidence/default.htm|title=Real World Evidence|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be derived from [[retrospective]] or [[Prospective search|prospective]] [[Observational study|observational studies]] and observational registries. In the USA the [[21st Century Cures Act]] required the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to expand the role of real world evidence.
 
Real World Evidence comes into play when clinical trials cannot really account for the entire patient population of a particular disease. Patients suffering from comorbidities or belonging to a distant geographic region or age limit who did not participate in any clinical trial may not respond to the treatment in question as expected. RWE provides answers to these problems and also to analyze effects of drugs over a longer period of time. Pharmaceutical companies and Health Insurance Payers study RWE to understand patient pathways to deliver appropriate care for appropriate individuals and to minimize their own financial risk by investing on drugs that work for patients.

A '''regenerative thermal oxidizer''' ('''RTO''') is a piece of industrial equipment used for the treatment of exhaust air. The system is a type of [[thermal oxidizer]] that uses a bed of [[ceramic]] material to absorb heat from the [[exhaust gas]]. It then uses this captured heat to preheat the incoming process gas stream and destroy air pollutants emitted from process exhaust streams at temperatures ranging from 815&amp;nbsp;°C (1,500 F) to 980&amp;nbsp;°C (1,800 F)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecmmgroup.com/regenerative-thermal-oxidizer/|title=Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) - The CMM Group|work=The CMM Group|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

These gas streams are usually produced by processes requiring ventilation, including paint booths, printing, and [[paper mill]]s. Municipal waste treatment facilities such as [[mechanical biological treatment]] plants are required by law in Germany to incorporate these systems. Biological alternatives to this system include [[biofilter]]s and [[bioscrubber]]s.

They are suited to applications with low [[volatile organic compound|VOC]] concentrations but high waste stream flow rates. This is due to their high thermal [[energy recovery]]. The basic operation of an RTO consists of passing a hot gas stream over a [[heat sink]] material in one direction and recovering that heat by passing a cold gas stream through that same heat sink material in an alternate cycle. They are used to destroy air toxins, odors, VOCs, and [[:category:hazardous air pollutants|hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer: How It Works|url=http://www.tksindustrial.com/regenerative-thermal-oxidizer|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are discharged in industrial process exhausts.

There are a number of RTO suppliers throughout North America, Europe and Asia.  From a technical stand point the most advanced form of RTO technology is the rotary valve RTO.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4388">The '''Resource Allocation Working Party''' was a group set up within the [[National Health Service]] in 1975 to suggest a mechanism whereby resources for [[secondary care]] could be matched to [[need]] (Gatrell, 2002).

Between 1948 and 1968 NHS financial allocations were essentially based on sequential inflation uplifts. A [[List of NHS Regional Health Authorities (before 1996)|Regional Health Authority]] or [[Teaching Hospital]] could argue for an increase.  The richer parts of the country had better funding in 1948 than the more deprived areas and so the differences between the various regions widened over time. In 1976-1977 there was an almost 30% difference in the revenue allocation between the 14 regions, with the North West having the least and North-East Thames region the most per head of population.

[[Richard Crossman]] developed a formula based on population, beds and cases but its fundamental problem was that the formula was partly based on utilisation and current resources. Since utilisation depends on availability of resources which were unequally distributed it could not rectify the problem. When [[Barbara Castle]] was [[Secretary of State for Health]] in 1972, the problem of regional resource inequality was addressed again. Her Special Adviser Professor [[Brian Abel-Smith]] had a particular interest in this problem (on which he had already advised Crossman, whose Special Adviser he had been earlier). He  chaired the Advisory Committee to the Social Medicine and Health Services Research Unit at [[St Thomas' Hospital]]. He drew the attention  of the Committee to the problems of resource allocation and encouraged them to consider possible research to rectify this unacceptable situation.  They produced a proposal for a complicated randomised controlled trial of different funding formulae, but the Minister, [[David Owen]], rejected it as interesting but politically impossible.

Owen established the Resource Allocation Working Party (RAWP), to examine the possibilities of a better funding formula. It came to the conclusion that Standardised Mortality Ratios were a reasonable indicator of regional variations in health care needs in the acute sector.  The Report of the Working Party also emphasised the need to develop and apply positive preventive measures such as promoting changes in smoking habits and improving the environments in which people live and work.

The [[Royal Commission on the National Health Service]] drew attention to the inequalities of funding. Expenditure on NHS services in Scotland was £127.10 per head of population, in the NW Thames [[Regional health authority (UK)|region]] £122.38, in the West Midlands £91.52.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 3|date=July 1979|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0 10 176150 3|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-3/|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four Metropolitan Thames Regional Health Authorities and most of the London Teaching Hospitals were disadvantaged by, and unhappy about, the new formula. The simplicity and transparency of the formula made it difficult for politicians to manipulate.  The idea that mortality should be used to influence the distribution of health resources was questioned on the grounds that most health care is provided for people who do not die.  The formula devised by the Resource Allocation Working Party survived until 1989 and did reduce the funding gap between the Northern regions and London.  It was replaced by a more complex formula announced in the publication of [[Working for Patients]] in 1989,and there have since been further changes and debate, particularly about the relative weighting to be given to old age, which favours more prosperous Southern areas, and deprivation which favours poorer Northern areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Prof Walter|title=Improving Health Services|year=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd|isbn=978 1 78347 018 1|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/2013/12/18/information-resource-allocation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rick Hodes''' is an American medical doctor specializing in cancer, heart disease, and spinal conditions. Since the 1980s he has worked in [[Ethiopia]] and has adopted a number of children from the country.&lt;ref name="npr" &gt;{{cite web|title=Humpbacked Children Have a Hero in Ethiopia|publisher=National Public Radio|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130610321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rd" /&gt; Currently, he is the senior consultant at a Catholic mission working with sick destitutes suffering from heart disease (rheumatic and congenital), spine disease (TB and scoliosis), and cancer. He is medical director of the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]].

Hodes has been responsible for the health of Ethiopians immigrating to Israel and has worked with refugees in [[Rwanda]], [[Zaire]], [[Tanzania]], [[Somalia]], and [[Albania]].

==Career==

Hodes graduated from [[Middlebury College]], University of Rochester Medical School, and trained in internal medicine at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref name="rd" &gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Rick Hodes Helps the Children of Ethiopia|url=http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/dr-rick-hodes-helps-the-children-of-ethiopia/article104652.html|publisher=Readers Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first went to Ethiopia as a relief worker during the 1984 famine. He returned there on a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] to teach internal medicine, and in 1990 was hired by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, a humanitarian group, as the medical advisor for the country. His original position was to care for 25,000 potential immigrants to Israel. In 1991, he was an active contributor during [[Operation Solomon]], helping the Ethiopian Jews airlifted to Israel. 

In 2001 Hodes adopted two Ethiopian children, putting them on his insurance plan so they could receive treatment in the US for spinal [[tuberculosis]] ([[Pott's disease]]).&lt;ref name="rd" /&gt; Since then he has adopted a total of five children from the country.

In 2007, Hodes was selected as a "[[CNN Hero]]," a program that highlights ordinary people for their extraordinary achievements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/dr-rick-hodes-helps-the-children-of-ethiopia/article104652.html&lt;/ref&gt; The American College of Physicians has awarded him “Mastership,” and the Rosenthal Award for creative practice of medicine

Hodes work in Ethiopia was the subject of a HBO documentary, "Making the Crooked Straight" and a Marilyn Berger book, "This Is a Soul: The Mission of Rick Hodes".&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=This Is a Soul: The Mission of Rick Hodes|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061759543/This_Is_a_Soul/index.aspx?AA=index_authorIntro_35327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making the Crooked Straight|url=http://www.makingthecrookedstraight.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early diagnosis is necessary to properly manage sepsis, as initiation of rapid therapy is key to reducing deaths from severe sepsis.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012/&gt; Some hospitals use alerts generated from [[electronic health record]]s to bring attention to potential cases as early as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synergy Between Nurses And Automation Could Be Key To Finding Sepsis Early|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/02/22/583846656/synergy-between-nurses-and-automation-could-be-key-to-finding-sepsis-early|website=NPR.org|access-date=26 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the first three hours of suspected sepsis, diagnostic studies should include [[white blood cell counts]], measuring serum lactate, and obtaining appropriate cultures before starting antibiotics, so long as this does not delay their use by more than 45 minutes.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012 /&gt; To identify the causative organism(s), at least two sets of [[blood culture]]s using bottles with [[growth medium|media]] for [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[anaerobic organism]]s should be obtained, with at least one drawn [[percutaneously|through the skin]] and one drawn through each vascular access device (such as an IV catheter) in place more than 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012 /&gt; Bacteria are [[bacteremia|present in the blood]] in only about 30% of cases.&lt;ref name="Wacker2013"/&gt; Another possible method of detection is by [[polymerase chain reaction]]. If other sources of infection are suspected, cultures of these sources, such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid, wounds, or respiratory secretions, also should be obtained, as long as this does not delay the use of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012 /&gt;

Within six hours, if blood pressure remains low despite initial fluid resuscitation of 30&amp;nbsp;ml/kg, or if initial lactate is ≥ 4&amp;nbsp;mmol/l (36&amp;nbsp;mg/dl), [[central venous pressure]] and [[central venous oxygen saturation]] should be measured.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012 /&gt; Lactate should be re-measured if the initial lactate was elevated.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012 /&gt; Evidence for [[point of care]] lactate measurement over usual methods of measurement, however, is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris E, McCartney D, Lasserson D, Van den Bruel A, Fisher R, Hayward G | title = Point-of-care lactate testing for sepsis at presentation to health care: a systematic review of patient outcomes | journal = The British Journal of General Practice | volume = 67 | issue = 665 | pages = e859-e870 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29158243 | pmc = 5697556 | doi = 10.3399/bjgp17X693665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within twelve hours, it is essential to diagnose or exclude any source of infection that would require emergent source control, such as necrotizing soft tissue infection, infection causing [[Peritonitis#Infected peritonitis|inflammation of the abdominal cavity lining]], [[cholangitis|infection of the bile duct]], or intestinal infarction.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012 /&gt; A pierced [[viscus|internal organ]] (free air on abdominal x-ray or CT scan), an abnormal [[chest radiograph|chest x-ray]] consistent with [[pneumonia]] (with focal opacification), or [[petechia]]e, [[purpura]], or [[purpura fulminans]] may be evident of infection.

=== Definitions ===
{{SIRS}}
[[File:Sepsis Steps.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Sepsis Steps. Training tool for teaching the progression of sepsis stages]]
Previously, SIRS criteria had been used to define sepsis. If the SIRS criteria are negative, it is very unlikely the person has sepsis; if it is positive, there is just a moderate probability that the person has sepsis. According to SIRS, there were different levels of sepsis: sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.&lt;ref name="1992consensus"/&gt; The definition of SIRS is shown below:

* SIRS is the presence of two or more of the following: abnormal [[body temperature]], [[heart rate]], [[respiratory rate]], or [[blood gas]], and [[white blood cell]] count.
* ''Sepsis'' is defined as SIRS in response to an infectious process.&lt;ref name=Soong2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soong J, Soni N | title = Sepsis: recognition and treatment | journal = Clinical Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 276–80 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22783783 | doi = 10.7861/clinmedicine.12-3-276 | url = http://www.clinmed.rcpjournal.org/content/12/3/276 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204718/http://www.clinmed.rcpjournal.org/content/12/3/276 | df =  | deadurl = no | archive-date = 23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Severe sepsis'' is defined as sepsis with sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or tissue hypoperfusion (manifesting as hypotension, elevated lactate, or [[oliguria|decreased urine output]]). Severe sepsis is an infectious disease state associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012/&gt;
* ''[[Septic shock]]'' is severe sepsis plus persistently [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], despite the administration of intravenous fluids.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012/&gt;

In 2016 a new consensus was reached to replace screening by [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS) with [[qSOFA]].&lt;ref name=Sepsis2016/&gt; However, the [[American College of Chest Physicians]] (CHEST) raised concerns that qSOFA and SOFA criteria may lead to delayed diagnosis of serious infection, leading to delayed treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simpson SQ | title = New Sepsis Criteria: A Change We Should Not&amp;nbsp;Make | journal = Chest | volume = 149 | issue = 5 | pages = 1117–8 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26927525 | doi = 10.1016/j.chest.2016.02.653 | quote = We believe that adopting a more restrictive definition that requires further progression along the sepsis pathway may delay intervention in this highly time-dependent condition, with additional risk to patients. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although SIRS criteria can be too sensitive and not specific enough in identifying sepsis, SOFA also has its own limitation and is not intended to replace the SIRS definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vincent JL, Martin GS, Levy MM | title = qSOFA does not replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis | journal = Critical Care | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 210 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27423462 | pmc = 4947518 | doi = 10.1186/s13054-016-1389-z | quote = We hope this editorial will clarify that the qSOFA is meant to be used to raise suspicion of sepsis and prompt further action—it is not a replacement for SIRS and is not part of the definition of sepsis. }}&lt;/ref&gt; qSOFA has also been found to be poorly sensitive though decently specific for the risk of death with SIRS possibly better for screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fernando SM, Tran A, Taljaard M, Cheng W, Rochwerg B, Seely AJ, Perry JJ | title = Prognostic Accuracy of the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment for Mortality in Patients With Suspected Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 168 | issue = 4 | pages = 266–275 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29404582 | doi = 10.7326/M17-2820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== End-organ dysfunction ===
{{Main|Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome}}
Examples of [[end organ damage|end-organ dysfunction]] include the following:&lt;ref name="pmid17948334"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abraham E, Singer M | title = Mechanisms of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 10 | pages = 2408–16 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17948334 | doi = 10.1097/01.CCM.0000282072.56245.91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lungs: [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS) ([[PaO2/FiO2 ratio|PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio]]&lt; 300), different ratio in  [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome#Terminology|pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome]]
* Brain: [[encephalopathy]] symptoms including agitation, confusion, coma; causes may include ischemia, bleeding, formation of blood clots in small blood vessels, microabscesses, multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy
* Liver: disruption of protein synthetic function manifests acutely as progressive [[coagulopathy|disruption of blood clotting]] due to an inability to synthesize [[clotting factors]] and disruption of metabolic functions leads to impaired [[bilirubin]] metabolism, resulting in elevated unconjugated serum [[bilirubin]] levels
* Kidney: [[oliguria|low urine output]] or [[anuria|no urine output]], [[electrolyte abnormalities]], or [[volume overload]]
* Heart: systolic and diastolic [[heart failure]], likely due to [[cytokines|chemical signals]] that depress myocyte function, cellular damage, manifest as a [[troponin]] leak (although not necessarily ischemic in nature)

More specific definitions of end-organ dysfunction exist for SIRS in pediatrics.&lt;ref name="pmid15636651"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldstein B, Giroir B, Randolph A | title = International pediatric sepsis consensus conference: definitions for sepsis and organ dysfunction in pediatrics | journal = Pediatric Critical Care Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–8 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15636651 | doi = 10.1097/01.PCC.0000149131.72248.E6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cardiovascular dysfunction (after fluid resuscitation with at least 40&amp;nbsp;ml/kg of crystalloid)
** hypotension with blood pressure &lt; 5th percentile for age or systolic blood pressure &lt; 2 standard deviations below normal for age, or
** [[vasopressor]] requirement, or
** two of the following criteria:
*** unexplained [[metabolic acidosis]] with [[base deficit]] &gt; 5 mEq/l
*** [[lactic acidosis]]: serum lactate 2 times the upper limit of normal
*** oliguria (urine output {{nowrap|&lt; 0.5 ml/kg/h}})
*** prolonged [[capillary refill]] &gt; 5 seconds
*** core to peripheral temperature difference {{nowrap|&gt; 3 °C}}
* Respiratory dysfunction (in the absence of a [[cyanotic heart defect]] or a known chronic [[respiratory disease]])
** the ratio of the arterial partial-pressure of oxygen to the fraction of oxygen in the gases inspired (PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; 300 (the definition of [[acute lung injury]]), or
** arterial partial-pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; 65 torr (20 [[millimetre of mercury|mmHg]]) over baseline PaCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (evidence of [[hypercapnia|hypercapnic]] [[respiratory failure]]), or
** supplemental oxygen requirement of greater than FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 0.5 to maintain oxygen saturation ≥ 92%
* Neurologic dysfunction
** [[Glasgow Coma Score]] (GCS) ≤ 11, or
** [[altered level of consciousness|altered mental status]] with drop in GCS of 3 or more points in a person with [[developmental delay]]/[[intellectual disability]]
* Hematologic dysfunction
** [[platelet]] count {{nowrap|&lt; 80,000/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} or 50% drop from maximum in chronically thrombocytopenic, or
** [[international normalized ratio]] (INR) &gt; 2
** [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]]
* Kidney dysfunction
**serum [[creatinine]] ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal for age or 2-fold increase in baseline [[creatinine]] in people with [[chronic kidney disease]]
* Liver dysfunction (only applicable to infants &gt; 1 month)
** total serum [[bilirubin]] ≥ 4&amp;nbsp;mg/dl, or
** [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT) ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal

Consensus definitions, however, continue to evolve, with the latest expanding the list of signs and symptoms of sepsis to reflect clinical bedside experience.&lt;ref name="pmid12682500" /&gt;

=== Biomarkers ===

A 2013 [[review]] concluded moderate-quality evidence exists to support use of the [[procalcitonin]] level as a method to distinguish sepsis from non-infectious causes of SIRS.&lt;ref name="Wacker2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wacker C, Prkno A, Brunkhorst FM, Schlattmann P | title = Procalcitonin as a diagnostic marker for sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 426–35 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23375419 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(12)70323-7 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0056874/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906203715/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0056874/ | df =  | deadurl = no | archive-date = 6 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review found the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of the test to be 77% and the specificity to be 79%. The authors suggested that procalcitonin may serve as a helpful diagnostic marker for sepsis, but cautioned that its level alone cannot definitively make the diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Wacker2013"/&gt; A 2012 systematic review found that [[SuPAR|soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor]] (SuPAR) is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and does not accurately diagnose sepsis.&lt;ref name="Backes2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Backes Y, van der Sluijs KF, Mackie DP, Tacke F, Koch A, Tenhunen JJ, Schultz MJ | title = Usefulness of suPAR as a biological marker in patients with systemic inflammation or infection: a systematic review | journal = Intensive Care Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 9 | pages = 1418–28 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22706919 | pmc = 3423568 | doi = 10.1007/s00134-012-2613-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This same review concluded, however, that SuPAR has prognostic value, as higher SuPAR levels are associated with an increased rate of death in those with sepsis.&lt;ref name="Backes2012"/&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===
The [[differential diagnosis]] for sepsis is broad and has to examine (in order to exclude) the non-infectious conditions that may cause the systemic signs of SIRS: [[alcohol withdrawal]], [[acute pancreatitis]], [[burn]]s, [[pulmonary embolism]], [[thyrotoxicosis]], [[anaphylaxis]], [[adrenal insufficiency]], and [[neurogenic shock]].&lt;ref name=Hospital2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayr2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mayr FB, Yende S, Angus DC | title = Epidemiology of severe sepsis | journal = Virulence | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–11 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24335434 | pmc = 3916382 | doi = 10.4161/viru.27372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperinflammatory syndromes such as [[hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis]] (HLH) may have similar symptoms and should also be included in differential diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Machowicz2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Machowicz R, Janka G, Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W | title = Similar but not the same: Differential diagnosis of HLH and sepsis | journal = Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology | volume = 114 | pages = 1–12 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28477737 | doi = 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2017.03.023 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1040842817301828 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neonatal sepsis ===
In common clinical usage, [[neonatal sepsis]] refers to a bacterial [[bacteremia|blood stream infection]] in the first month of life, such as [[meningitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[pyelonephritis]], or [[gastroenteritis]],&lt;ref name="Satar2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Satar M, Ozlü F | title = Neonatal sepsis: a continuing disease burden | journal = The Turkish Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages = 449–57 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23427506 | url = http://www.turkishjournalpediatrics.org/pediatrics/pdf/pdf_TJP_1099.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141219145816/http://www.turkishjournalpediatrics.org/pediatrics/pdf/pdf_TJP_1099.pdf | df =  | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 19 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but neonatal sepsis also may be due to infection with fungi, viruses, or parasites.&lt;ref name="Satar2012"/&gt; Criteria with regard to hemodynamic compromise or respiratory failure are not useful because they present too late for intervention.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Sepsis fig.png|thumb|Phenotypic strategy switches of microbes capable of provoking sepsis]]

Sepsis is caused by a combination of factors related to the particular invading pathogen(s) and to the status of the immune system of the host.&lt;ref name=Critical2005 /&gt; The early phase of sepsis characterized by excessive inflammation (sometimes resulting in a [[cytokine storm]]) may be followed by a prolonged period of [[immunosuppression|decreased functioning of the immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shukla P, Rao GM, Pandey G, Sharma S, Mittapelly N, Shegokar R, Mishra PR | title = Therapeutic interventions in sepsis: current and anticipated pharmacological agents | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 171 | issue = 22 | pages = 5011–31 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 24977655 | pmc = 4253453 | doi = 10.1111/bph.12829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Either of these phases may prove fatal. On the other hand, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) occurs in people without the presence of infection, for example, in those with [[burn]]s, [[polytrauma]], or the initial state in [[pancreatitis]] and [[chemical pneumonitis]]. However, sepsis also causes similar response to SIRS.&lt;ref name="1992consensus" /&gt;

=== Microbial factors ===
Bacterial [[virulence factor]]s, such as [[glycocalyx]] and various [[adhesins]], allow colonization, immune evasion, and establishment of disease in the host.&lt;ref name=Critical2005&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1= Jesse B. |editor-last1= Hall |editor-first2= Gregory A. |editor-last2= Schmidt |editor-first3= Lawrence D.H. |editor-last3= Wood |first1= E.

This forced receptor interaction induces the production of pro-inflammatory chemical signals ([[cytokines]]) by T-cells.&lt;ref name=Critical2005 /&gt;

There are a number of microbial factors that may cause the typical septic [[Inflammation|inflammatory cascade]]. An invading pathogen is recognized by its [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern]]s (PAMPs). Examples of PAMPs include lipopolysaccharides and [[flagellin]] in gram-negative bacteria, [[muramyl dipeptide]] in the [[peptidoglycan]] of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall, and [[CpG dinucleotide|CpG bacterial DNA]]. These PAMPs are recognized by the [[pattern recognition receptors]] (PRRs) of the innate immune system, which may be membrane-bound or cytosolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leentjens J, Kox M, van der Hoeven JG, Netea MG, Pickkers P | title = Immunotherapy for the adjunctive treatment of sepsis: from immunosuppression to immunostimulation.

Invariably, the association of a PAMP and a PRR will cause a series of intracellular signalling cascades. Consequentially, transcription factors such as [[nuclear factor-kappa B]] and [[AP-1 transcription factor|activator protein-1]], will up-regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Antonopoulou A, Giamarellos-Bourboulis EJ | title = Immunomodulation in sepsis: state of the art and future perspective | journal = Immunotherapy | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–28 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21174562 | doi = 10.2217/imt.10.82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Host factors ===
Upon detection of microbial [[antigen]]s, the host systemic immune system is activated. Immune cells not only recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns, but also [[damage-associated molecular pattern]]s from damaged tissues. An uncontrolled immune response is then activated because [[leukocyte]]s are not recruited to the specific site of infection, but instead they are recruited all over the body. Then, an [[immunosuppression]] state ensues when the proinflammatory [[T helper cell]] 1 (TH1) is shifted to TH2,&lt;ref name="Yuki"/&gt; mediated by [[interleukin 10]], which is known as "compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome".&lt;ref name="Polat"/&gt; The [[apoptosis]] (cell death) of lymphocytes further worsens the immunosuppression. Subsequently, [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]] ensues because tissues are unable to use oxygen efficiently due to inhibition of [[cytochrome c oxidase]].&lt;ref name="Yuki"/&gt;

Inflammatory responses cause [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]] through various mechanisms as described below. Increased permeability of the lung vessels causes leaking of fluids into alveoli, which results in [[pulmonary edema]] and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS). Impaired utilization of oxygen in the liver impairs [[bile salt]] transport, causing [[jaundice]] (yellowish discoloration of skin). In kidneys, inadequate oxygenation results in tubular epithelial cell injury (of the cells lining the kidney tubules), and thus causes [[acute kidney injury]] (AKI). Meanwhile, in a human heart, impaired calcium transport, and low production of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), can cause myocardial depression, reducing cardiac contractility and causing [[heart failure]]. In the [[gastrointestinal tract]], increased permeability of the mucosa alters the microflora, causing mucosal bleeding and [[paralytic ileus]]. In the [[central nervous system]], direct damage of the brain cells and disturbances of neurotransmissions causes altered mental status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujishima S | title = Organ dysfunction as a new standard for defining sepsis | journal = Inflammation and Regeneration | volume = 36 | issue = 24 | pages = 24 | date = 1 November 2016 | pmid = 29259697 | pmc = 5725936 | doi = 10.1186/s41232-016-0029-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cytokines such as [[TNF-alpha|tumor necrosis factor]], [[Interleukin 1 family|interleukin 1]], and [[interleukin 6]] may activate [[coagulation|procoagulation]] factors in the [[endothelium|cells lining blood vessels]], leading to endothelial damage. The damaged endothelial surface inhibits anticoagulant properties as well as increases [[antifibrinolytic|antifibrinolysis]], which may lead to intravascular clotting, the formation of [[thrombosis|blood clots]] in small blood vessels, and multiple organ failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nimah M, Brilli RJ | title = Coagulation dysfunction in sepsis and multiple organ system failure | journal = Critical Care Clinics | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 441–58 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12848314 | doi = 10.1016/s0749-0704(03)00008-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The low blood pressure seen in those with sepsis is the result of various processes, including excessive production of chemicals that [[Vasodilation|dilate blood vessels]] such as [[nitric oxide]], a deficiency of chemicals that [[vasoconstriction|constrict blood vessels]] such as [[vasopressin]], and activation of [[ATP-sensitive potassium channel]]s.&lt;ref name="Marik2014"/&gt; In those with severe sepsis and septic shock, this sequence of events leads to a type of [[circulatory shock]] known as [[distributive shock]].&lt;ref name="Marik2014Chest"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marik PE | title = Early management of severe sepsis: concepts and controversies | journal = Chest | volume = 145 | issue = 6 | pages = 1407–1418 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24889440 | doi = 10.1378/chest.13-2104 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.661.7518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
Early recognition and focused management may improve the outcomes in sepsis. Current professional recommendations include a number of actions ("bundles") to be followed as soon as possible after diagnosis. Within the first three hours someone with sepsis should have received antibiotics and, intravenous fluids if there is evidence of either low blood pressure or other evidence for inadequate blood supply to organs (as evidenced by a raised level of lactate); blood cultures also should be obtained within this time period. After six hours the blood pressure should be adequate, close monitoring of blood pressure and blood supply to organs should be in place, and the lactate should be measured again if initially, it was raised.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012/&gt; A related bundle, the "[[Sepsis Six]]", is in widespread use in the [[United Kingdom]]; this requires the administration of antibiotics within an hour of recognition, blood cultures, lactate and hemoglobin determination, urine output monitoring, high-flow oxygen, and intravenous fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daniels R | title = Surviving the first hours in sepsis: getting the basics right (an intensivist's perspective) | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 66 Suppl 2 | issue = Supplement 2 | pages = ii11-23 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21398303 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkq515 | url = https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-pdf/66/suppl_2/ii11/2342004/dkq515.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SIGN139&gt;{{cite book | author=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) | authorlink=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network | title=Guideline 139: care of deteriorating patients | location=Edinburgh | publisher=SIGN | date=May 2014 | url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/139/ | isbn=978-1-909103-26-9 | deadurl=yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209172424/http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/139/ | archive-date=9 December 2014 | df=dmy-all | access-date=6 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the timely administration of fluids and [[antibiotic]]s, the management of sepsis also involves surgical drainage of infected fluid collections and appropriate support for organ dysfunction. This may include [[dialysis|hemodialysis]] in [[kidney failure]], [[mechanical ventilation]] in [[lung]] dysfunction, transfusion of [[blood plasma|blood products]], and drug and fluid therapy for circulatory failure. Ensuring adequate nutrition—preferably by [[enteral feeding]], but if necessary, by [[parenteral nutrition]]—is important during prolonged illness.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012/&gt; Medication to prevent [[deep vein thrombosis]] and [[gastric ulcers]] also may be used.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012 /&gt;

=== Antibiotics ===
Two sets of blood cultures (aerobic and anaerobic) should be taken without delaying the initiation of antibiotics. Cultures from other sites such as respiratory secretions, urine, wounds, cerebrospinal fluid, and catheter insertion sites (in-situ more than 48 hours) can be taken if infections from these sites are suspected.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; In severe sepsis and septic shock, [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]]s (usually two, a [[β-lactam antibiotic]] with broad coverage, or broad-spectrum [[carbapenem]] combined with fluoroquinolones, macrolides, or aminoglycosides) are recommended. However, combination of antibiotics is not recommended for the treatment of sepsis but without shock and immunocompromised persons unless the combination is used to broaden the anti-bacterial activity. The choice of antibiotics is important in determining the survival of the person.&lt;ref name="Marik2014Chest"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sepsis2017/&gt; Some recommend they be given within one hour of making the diagnosis, stating that for every hour of delay in the administration of antibiotics, there is an associated 6% rise in mortality.&lt;ref name=Soong2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marik2014Chest"/&gt; Others did not find a benefit with early administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sterling SA, Miller WR, Pryor J, Puskarich MA, Jones AE | title = The Impact of Timing of Antibiotics on Outcomes in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 43 | issue = 9 | pages = 1907–15 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26121073 | pmc = 4597314 | doi = 10.1097/CCM.0000000000001142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors determine the most appropriate choice for the initial antibiotic regimen. These factors include local patterns of bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics, whether the infection is thought to be a [[Hospital-acquired infection|hospital]] or community-acquired infection, and which organ systems are thought to be infected.&lt;ref name="Marik2014Chest"/&gt; Antibiotic regimens should be reassessed daily and narrowed if appropriate. Treatment duration is typically 7–10&amp;nbsp;days with the type of antibiotic used directed by the results of cultures. If the culture result is negative, antibiotics should be de-escalated according to person's clinical response or stopped altogether if infection is not present to decrease the chances that the person is infected with [[multiple drug resistance]] organisms. In case of people having high risk of being infected with [[multiple drug resistance]] organisms such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'', addition of antibiotic specific to gram-negative organism is recommended. For [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]] (MRSA), [[vancomycin]] or [[teicoplanin]] is recommended. For [[Legionella]] infection, addition of [[macrolide]] or [[fluoroquinolone]] is chosen. If fungal infection is suspected, an [[echinocandin]], such as [[caspofungin]] or [[micafungin]], is chosen for people with severe sepsis, followed by [[triazole]] ([[fluconazole]] and [[itraconazole]]) for less ill people.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in people who has SIRS without any infectious origin such as [[acute pancreatitis]] and [[burn]]s unless sepsis is suspected.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt;

Once daily dosing of [[aminoglycoside]] is sufficient to achieve peak plasma concentration for clinical response without kidney toxicity. Meanwhile, for antibiotics with low volume distribution (vancomycin, teicoplanin, colistin), loading dose is required to achieve adequate therapeutic level to fight infections. Frequent infusions of beta-lactam antibiotics without exceeding total daily dose would help to keep the antibiotics level above [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] (MIC), thus providing better clinical response.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; Giving beta-lactam antibiotics continuously may be better than giving them intermittently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts JA, Abdul-Aziz MH, Davis JS, Dulhunty JM, Cotta MO, Myburgh J, Bellomo R, Lipman J | title = Continuous versus Intermittent β-Lactam Infusion in Severe Sepsis.

=== Intravenous fluids ===
The [[Surviving Sepsis Campaign]] has recommended 30 ml/kg of fluid to be given in adults in the first 3 hours followed by fluid titration according to blood pressure, urine output, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation with a target [[mean arterial pressure]] (MAP) of 65 mmHg.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; In children an initial amount of 20ml/kg is reasonable in shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Caen AR, Berg MD, Chameides L, Gooden CK, Hickey RW, Scott HF, Sutton RM, Tijssen JA, Topjian A, van der Jagt ÉW, Schexnayder SM, Samson RA | title = Part 12: Pediatric Advanced Life Support: 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care | journal = Circulation | volume = 132 | issue = 18 Suppl 2 | pages = S526-42 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26473000 | doi = 10.1161/cir.0000000000000266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of severe sepsis and septic shock where a [[central venous catheter]] is used to measure blood pressures dynamically, fluids should be administered until the [[central venous pressure]] (CVP) reaches 8–12mmHg.&lt;ref name="Marik2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marik PE | title = Iatrogenic salt water drowning and the hazards of a high central venous pressure | journal = Annals of Intensive Care | volume = 4 | pages = 21 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 25110606 | pmc = 4122823 | doi = 10.1186/s13613-014-0021-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once these goals are met, the [[central venous oxygen saturation]] (ScvO2), i.e., the oxygen saturation of venous blood as it returns to the heart as measured at the vena cava, is optimized.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; If the ScvO2 is less than 70%, blood may be given to reach a hemoglobin of 10&amp;nbsp;g/dL and then [[inotrope]]s are added until the ScvO2 is optimized.&lt;ref name=Critical2005 /&gt; In those with [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS) and sufficient tissue blood fluid, more fluids should be given carefully.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012/&gt;

=== Blood products ===
The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended [[packed red blood cells]] transfusion for [[hemoglobin]] levels below 70 g/L if there is no [[myocardial ischemia]], [[hypoxemia]], or acute bleeding.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; In a 2014 trial, blood transfusions to keep target hemoglobin above 70 or 90 g/L did not make any difference to survival rates; meanwhile, those with a lower threshold of transfusion received fewer transfusions in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holst LB, Haase N, Wetterslev J, Wernerman J, Guttormsen AB, Karlsson S, Johansson PI, Aneman A, Vang ML, Winding R, Nebrich L, Nibro HL, Rasmussen BS, Lauridsen JR, Nielsen JS, Oldner A, Pettilä V, Cronhjort MB, Andersen LH, Pedersen UG, Reiter N, Wiis J, White JO, Russell L, Thornberg KJ, Hjortrup PB, Müller RG, Møller MH, Steensen M, Tjäder I, Kilsand K, Odeberg-Wernerman S, Sjøbø B, Bundgaard H, Thyø MA, Lodahl D, Mærkedahl R, Albeck C, Illum D, Kruse M, Winkel P, Perner A  | display-authors = 6 | title = Lower versus higher hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in septic shock | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 15 | pages = 1381–91 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25270275 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1406617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erythropoietin]] is not recommended in the treatment of anemia with septic shock because it may precipitate [[Thrombosis|blood clotting]] events. [[Fresh frozen plasma]] transfusion usually does not correct the underlying clotting abnormalities before a planned surgical procedure. However, platelet transfusion is suggested for platelet counts below (10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L) without any risk of bleeding, or (20 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L) with high risk of bleeding, or (50 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L) with active bleeding, before a planned surgery or an invasive procedure.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; IV immunoglobulin is not recommended because its beneficial effects are uncertain.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; Monoclonal and polyclonal preparations of [[intravenous immunoglobulin|intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)]] do not lower the rate of death in newborns and adults with sepsis.&lt;ref name="Alejandria2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alejandria MM, Lansang MA, Dans LF, Mantaring JB | title = Intravenous immunoglobulin for treating sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = CD001090 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24043371 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001090.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the use of [[immunoglobulin M|IgM]]-enriched polyclonal preparations of IVIG is inconsistent.&lt;ref name="Alejandria2013"/&gt; On the other hand, the use of [[antithrombin#As medication|antithrombin]] to treat [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] is also not useful. Meanwhile, the blood purification technique (such as [[hemoperfusion]], plasma filtration, and coupled plasma filtration adsorption) to remove inflammatory mediators and bacterial toxins from the blood also does not demonstrate any survival benefit for septic shock.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt;

=== Vasopressors ===
If the person has been sufficiently fluid resuscitated but the [[mean arterial pressure]] is not greater than 65&amp;nbsp;mmHg, [[vasopressor]]s are recommended.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; [[Norepinephrine (medication)|Norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) is recommended as the initial choice.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt;

Norepinephrine raises blood pressure through a vasoconstriction effect, with little effect on [[stroke volume]] and heart rate.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2017/&gt; If a single vasopressor is not enough to raise the blood pressure, [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) or [[vasopressin]] may be added. However, one of the adrenaline side effects is that it reduces blood flow to abdominal organs and may cause increased lactate levels. Vasopressin can be used in septic shock because studies have shown that there is a relative deficiency of vasopressin when shock continues for 24 to 48 hours. However, vasopressin reduces blood flow to the heart, finger/toes, and abdominal organs, resulting in a lack of oxygen supply to these tissues.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; [[Dopamine]] is typically not recommended. Although dopamine is useful to increase the stroke volume of the heart, it causes more [[Heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] than norepinephrine and also has an immunosuppressive effect. Dopamine is not proven to have protective properties on the kidneys.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2017/&gt; [[Dobutamine]] may be used if heart function is poor or blood flow is insufficient despite sufficient fluid volumes and blood pressure.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2017/&gt;

=== Steroids ===
The use of [[steroids]] in sepsis is controversial.&lt;ref name=Steroids2012 /&gt; Studies do not give a clear picture as to whether and when [[glucocorticoid]]s should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volbeda M, Wetterslev J, Gluud C, Zijlstra JG, van der Horst IC, Keus F | title = Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis | journal = Intensive Care Medicine | volume = 41 | issue = 7 | pages = 1220–34 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26100123 | pmc = 4483251 | doi = 10.1007/s00134-015-3899-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against their use in those with septic shock if intravenous fluids and vasopressors are able to stabilize the person's cardiovascular function. Low dose [[hydrocortisone]] is only used if both intravenous fluids and vasopressors are not able to adequately treat septic shock.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; A 2015 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Annane D, Bellissant E, Bollaert PE, Briegel J, Keh D, Kupfer Y | title = Corticosteroids for treating sepsis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | issue = 12 | pages = CD002243 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26633262 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002243.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During critical illness, a state of [[adrenal insufficiency]] and tissue resistance to [[corticosteroids]] may occur.

It should be suspected in those poorly responding to resuscitation with fluids and vasopressors. Neither [[Cort-stim test|ACTH stimulation testing]]&lt;ref name="pmid18496365" /&gt; nor random [[cortisol]] levels are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt; The method of stopping glucocorticoid drugs is variable, and it is unclear whether they should be slowly decreased or simply abruptly stopped. However, the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended to taper steroids when vasopressors are no longer needed.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt;

=== Anesthesia ===
A target [[tidal volume]] of 6 mL/kg of [[predicted body weight]] (PBW) and a [[plateau pressure]] less than 30&amp;nbsp;cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is recommended for those who require [[mechanical ventilation| ventilation]] due to sepsis-induced severe ARDS. High [[positive end expiratory pressure]] (PEEP) is recommended for moderate to severe ARDS in sepsis as it opens more lung units for oxygen exchange. Predicted body weight is based on sex and height.&lt;ref name="Ards"&gt;{{cite web |title=NHLBI ARDS Network {{!}} Tools |url=http://www.ardsnet.org/tools.shtml |website=www.ardsnet.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment maneuvers may be necessary for severe ARDS by briefly raising the transpulmonary pressure. It is recommended that the head of the bed be raised if possible to improve ventilation. However, [[beta2-adrenergic agonist|β2 adrenergic receptor agonists]] are not recommended to treat ARDS because it may reduce survival rates and precipitate [[Heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]]. A [[spontaneous breathing trial]] using [[continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP), T piece, or inspiratory pressure augmentation can be helpful in reducing the duration of ventilation. Minimizing intermittent or continuous sedation is helpful in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation.&lt;ref name= Sepsis2017/&gt;

General anesthesia is recommended for people with sepsis who require surgical procedures to remove the infective source. Usually inhalational and intravenous anesthetics are used. Requirements for anesthetics may be reduced in sepsis. Inhalational anesthetics can reduce the level of proinflammatory cytokines, altering leukocyte adhesion and proliferation, inducing [[apoptosis]] (cell death) of the lymphocytes, possibly with a toxic effect on [[mitochondria]]l function.&lt;ref name="Yuki"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yuki K, Murakami N | title = Sepsis pathophysiology and anesthetic consideration | journal = Cardiovascular &amp; Hematological Disorders Drug Targets | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–69 | date = 6 January 2016 | pmid = 25567335 | pmc = 4704087 | doi = 10.2174/1871529x15666150108114810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[etomidate]] has a minimal effect on the cardiovascular system, it is often not recommended as a medication to help with [[intubation]] in this situation due to concerns it may lead to [[adrenal insufficiency|poor adrenal function]] and an increased risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cherfan AJ, Arabi YM, Al-Dorzi HM, Kenny LP | title = Advantages and disadvantages of etomidate use for intubation of patients with sepsis | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 475–82 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22488264 | doi = 10.1002/j.1875-9114.2012.01027.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan CM, Mitchell AL, Shorr AF | title = Etomidate is associated with mortality and adrenal insufficiency in sepsis: a meta-analysis* | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 2945–53 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22971586 | doi = 10.1097/CCM.0b013e31825fec26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The small amount of evidence there is, however, has not found a change in the risk of death with etomidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu WJ, Wang F, Tang L, Liu JC | title = Single-dose etomidate does not increase mortality in patients with sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies | journal = Chest | volume = 147 | issue = 2 | pages = 335–346 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25255427 | doi = 10.1378/chest.14-1012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paralytic agents]] should be avoided unless ARDS is suspected.&lt;ref name=Sepsis2012/&gt;

=== Early goal directed therapy ===
[[Early goal directed therapy]] (EGDT) is an approach to the management of severe sepsis during the initial 6&amp;nbsp;hours after diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Campaign2008 /&gt; It is a step-wise approach, with the physiologic goal of optimizing cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility.&lt;ref name="EGDT"/&gt; It includes giving early antibiotics.&lt;ref name="EGDT"/&gt; EGDT also involves monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and specific interventions to achieve key resuscitation targets which include maintaining a central venous pressure between 8–12 mmHg, a mean arterial pressure of between 65–90 mmHg, a central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) greater than 70% and a urine output of greater than 0.5 ml/kg/hour.

There are a number of prognostic stratification systems, such as [[APACHE II]] and Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis. APACHE II factors in the person's age, underlying condition, and various physiologic variables to yield estimates of the risk of dying of severe sepsis. Of the individual covariates, the severity of underlying disease most strongly influences the risk of death. Septic shock is also a strong predictor of short- and long-term mortality.

Sepsis occurs in 1–2% of all hospitalizations and accounts for as much as 25% of ICU bed utilization.

From 1979 to 2000, data from the United States National Hospital Discharge Survey showed that the incidence of sepsis increased fourfold, to 240 cases per 100,000 population, with higher incidence in men when compared to women. During the same time frame, the in-hospital case fatality rate was reduced from 28% to 18%. However, according to the nationwide inpatient sample from the United States, the incidence of severe sepsis increased from 200 per 10,000 population in 2003 to 300 cases in 2007 for population aged more than 18 years. The incidence rate is particularly high among infants, with the incidence of 500 cases per 100,000 population.

Though severe systemic toxicity had already been observed, it was only in the 19th century that the specific term&amp;nbsp;– sepsis&amp;nbsp;– was used for this condition.

The terms "septicemia", also spelled "septicaemia", and "blood poisoning" referred to the microorganisms or their toxins in the blood and are no longer commonly used.&lt;ref name=NEJM2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="1992consensus"/&gt; The modern term for this is [[bacteremia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bacteremia - Infections - Merck Manuals Consumer Version|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/infections/bacteremia-sepsis-and-septic-shock/bacteremia/|website=The Merck Manuals|access-date=25 November 2017|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728011557/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/infections/bacteremia-sepsis-and-septic-shock/bacteremia/|archive-date=28 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, it was widely believed that [[microbes]] produced substances that could injure the [[mammalian]] host and that soluble [[toxins]] released during infection caused the fever and shock that were commonplace during severe infections. [[Richard Friedrich Johannes Pfeiffer|Pfeiffer]] coined the term [[endotoxin]] at the beginning of the 20th century to denote the pyrogenic principle associated with ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. It was soon realised that endotoxins were expressed by most and perhaps all [[gram-negative bacteria]]. The [[lipopolysaccharide]] character of enteric endotoxins was elucidated in 1944 by Shear.&lt;ref name=Shear1944&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shear |first= MJ |year= 1944 |title= Chemical treatment of tumors, IX: Reactions of mice with primary subcutaneous tumors to injection of a hemorrhage-producing bacterial polysaccharide |journal= [[Journal of the National Cancer Institute]] |volume= 4 |issue= 5 |pages= 461–76 |doi= 10.1093/jnci/4.5.461}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular character of this material was determined by Luderitz et al. in 1973.&lt;ref name=Luderitz1973&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lüderitz O, Galanos C, Lehmann V, Nurminen M, Rietschel ET, Rosenfelder G, Simon M, Westphal O | title = Lipid A: chemical structure and biological activity |year= 1973 |journal= [[The Journal of Infectious Diseases]] |volume= 128 |page= 29 |display-authors= 6 |jstor= 30106029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy occurred in the scientific community over the use of mouse models in research into sepsis in 2013, when scientists published a review of the mouse immune system compared to the human immune system, and showed that on a systems level, the two worked very differently; the authors noted that as of the date of their article over 150 clinical trials of sepsis had been conducted in humans, almost all of them supported by promising data in mice, and that all of them had failed.

'''Sewage treatment''' is the process of removing [[pollutant|contaminants]] from municipal [[wastewater]], containing mainly household [[sewage]] plus some [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]]. Physical, chemical, and biological processes are used to remove contaminants and produce treated wastewater (or treated [[effluent]]) that is safe enough for release into the environment. A by-product of sewage treatment is a semi-solid waste or slurry, called [[sewage sludge]]. The sludge has to undergo further [[sewage sludge treatment|treatment]] before being suitable for disposal or application to land.

Sewage treatment may also be referred to as [[wastewater treatment]]. However, the latter is a broader term which can also refer to industrial wastewater. For most cities, the [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]] will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pre-treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load. If the sewer system is a [[combined sewer]] then it will also carry [[urban runoff]] (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via [[piping]] and in a flow aided by [[gravity]] and [[pump]]s. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a [[bar screen]] to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in [[dumpster]]s and disposed of in landfills. [[Fat]] and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Terminology==
The term "sewage treatment plant" (or "sewage treatment works" in some countries) is nowadays often replaced with the term '''[[wastewater treatment]] plant''' or wastewater treatment station.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_WV6CgAAQBAJ|title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Reuse|last1=Tchobanoglous|first1=George|last2=Burton|first2=Franklin L.|last3=Stensel|first3=H. David|last4=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2003|isbn=0-07-112250-8|edition=4th|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewage can be treated close to where the sewage is created, which may be called a "decentralized" system or even an "on-site" system (in [[septic tank]]s, [[biofilters]] or [[aerobic treatment system]]s). Alternatively, sewage can be collected and transported by a network of pipes and pump stations to a municipal treatment plant. This is called a "centralized" system (see also [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]] and [[Sewage collection and disposal|pipes and infrastructure]]).

==Origins of sewage==
{{Main|Sewage}}
Sewage is generated by residential, institutional, commercial and industrial establishments. It includes [[household waste]] liquid from [[toilet]]s, [[bathing|baths]], [[shower]]s, [[kitchen]]s, and [[sink]]s draining into [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s. In many areas, sewage also includes liquid waste from industry and commerce. The separation and draining of household waste into [[greywater]] and [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] is becoming more common in the developed world, with treated greywater being permitted to be used for watering plants or recycled for flushing toilets.

===Sewage mixing with rainwater===
Sewage may include [[stormwater]] runoff or [[urban runoff]]. [[Sewerage]] systems capable of handling storm water are known as [[combined sewer]] systems. This design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Metcalf &amp; Eddy"&gt;{{cite book | author=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. | title=Wastewater Engineering | year=1972 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York | isbn=0-07-041675-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than [[sanitary sewer]]s. Heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage treatment system, causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers, and they are not designed to transport stormwater. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive [[Infiltration/Inflow|infiltration/inflow]] (dilution by stormwater and/or groundwater) is allowed into a sanitary sewer system. Communities that have [[Urbanization|urbanized]] in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.&lt;ref name="Burrian"&gt;Burrian, Steven J., et al. (1999).[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000E6J7.txt "The Historical Development of Wet-Weather Flow Management."] US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH. Document No. EPA/600/JA-99/275.&lt;/ref&gt;

As rainfall travels over roofs and the ground, it may pick up various contaminants including [[soil]] particles and other [[sediment]], [[heavy metals]], [[organic compound]]s, animal waste, and [[oil]] and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]]. Some [[jurisdiction]]s require stormwater to receive some level of treatment before being discharged directly into waterways. Examples of treatment processes used for stormwater include [[retention basin]]s, [[constructed wetland|wetlands]], buried [[Stormwater detention vault|vaults]] with various kinds of [[media filter]]s, and [[Hydrodynamic separator|vortex separators]] (to remove coarse solids).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burton, Jr. |first1=G.

===Industrial effluent===
{{Main|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
In highly regulated developed countries, [[industrial effluent]] usually receives at least pretreatment if not full treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load, before discharge to the sewer. This process is called [[industrial wastewater treatment]] or pretreatment. The same does not apply to many developing countries where industrial effluent is more likely to enter the sewer if it exists, or even the receiving water body, without pretreatment.

Industrial wastewater may contain pollutants which cannot be removed by conventional sewage treatment. Also, variable flow of industrial waste associated with production cycles may upset the population dynamics of biological treatment units, such as the [[Activated sludge|activated sludge process]].

==Process steps==

=== Overview ===
Sewage collection and treatment is typically subject to local, state and federal regulations and standards.

Treating wastewater has the aim to produce an [[effluent]] that will do as little harm as possible when discharged to the surrounding environment, thereby preventing [[pollution]] compared to releasing untreated wastewater into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Environmental Pollution Monitoring And Control |last= Khopkar |first= S. M.|year= 2004|publisher= New Age International |location=New Delhi |isbn= 81-224-1507-5 |page= 299|url= https://books.google.com/?id=TAk21grzDZgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewage treatment generally involves three stages, called primary, secondary and tertiary treatment.
*''Primary treatment'' consists of temporarily holding the sewage in a quiescent basin where heavy solids can settle to the bottom while oil, grease and lighter solids float to the surface. The settled and floating materials are removed and the remaining liquid may be discharged or subjected to secondary treatment. Some sewage treatment plants that are connected to a combined sewer system have a bypass arrangement after the primary treatment unit. This means that during very heavy rainfall events, the secondary and tertiary treatment systems can be bypassed to protect them from hydraulic overloading, and the mixture of sewage and stormwater only receives primary treatment.
*''[[Secondary treatment]]'' removes dissolved and suspended biological matter. Secondary treatment is typically performed by [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]], water-borne micro-organisms in a managed habitat. Secondary treatment may require a separation process to remove the micro-organisms from the treated water prior to discharge or tertiary treatment.
*''Tertiary treatment'' is sometimes defined as anything more than primary and secondary treatment in order to allow ejection into a highly sensitive or fragile ecosystem (estuaries, low-flow rivers, coral reefs,...). Treated water is sometimes disinfected chemically or physically (for example, by lagoons and [[microfiltration]]) prior to discharge into a [[stream]], [[river]], [[bay]], [[lagoon]] or [[wetland]], or it can be used for the [[irrigation]] of a golf course, green way or park. If it is sufficiently clean, it can also be used for [[groundwater recharge]] or agricultural purposes.

[[File:SchemConstructedWetlandSewage.jpg|upright=3.05|thumb|center|[[Process flow diagram]] for a typical treatment plant via subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SFCW)]]

===Pretreatment===
Pretreatment removes all materials that can be easily collected from the raw sewage before they damage or clog the pumps and sewage lines of primary treatment [[clarifier]]s. Objects commonly removed during pretreatment include trash, tree limbs, leaves, branches, and other large objects.

The influent in sewage water passes through a [[bar screen]] to remove all large objects like cans, rags, sticks, plastic packets etc. carried in the sewage stream.&lt;ref&gt;Water and Environmental Health at London and Loughborough (1999). [http://www.lut.ac.uk/well/resources/technical-briefs/64-wastewater-treatment-options.pdf "Waste water Treatment Options."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210830/http://www.lut.ac.uk/well/resources/technical-briefs/64-wastewater-treatment-options.pdf |date=2011-07-17 }} Technical brief no. 64. London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and Loughborough University.&lt;/ref&gt; This is most commonly done with an automated mechanically raked bar screen in modern plants serving large populations, while in smaller or less modern plants, a manually cleaned screen may be used. The raking action of a mechanical bar screen is typically paced according to the accumulation on the bar screens and/or flow rate. The solids are collected and later disposed in a landfill, or incinerated. Bar screens or mesh screens of varying sizes may be used to optimize solids removal. If gross solids are not removed, they become entrained in pipes and moving parts of the treatment plant, and can cause substantial damage and inefficiency in the process.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer"&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2004). [https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-resources "Primer for Municipal Waste water Treatment Systems."] Document no. EPA 832-R-04-001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

====Grit removal====
&lt;!--[[Grit removal]] redirects to this section; if the section name is changed, please change this redirect accordingly--&gt;
Grit consists of sand, gravel, cinders, and other heavy materials. It also includes organic matter such as eggshells, bone chips, seeds, and coffee grounds. Pretreatment may include a sand or grit channel or chamber, where the velocity of the incoming sewage is adjusted to allow the settlement of sand and grit. Grit removal is necessary to (1) reduce formation of heavy deposits in aeration tanks, aerobic digesters, pipelines, channels, and conduits; (2) reduce the frequency of digester cleaning caused by excessive accumulations of grit; and (3) protect moving mechanical equipment from abrasion and accompanying abnormal wear. The removal of grit is essential for equipment with closely machined metal surfaces such as comminutors, fine screens, centrifuges, heat exchangers, and high pressure diaphram pumps. Grit chambers come in 3 types: horizontal grit chambers, aerated grit chambers and vortex grit chambers. Vortex type grit chambers include mechanically induced vortex, hydraulically induced vortex, and multi-tray vortex separators. Given that traditionally, grit removal systems have been designed to remove clean inorganic particles that are greater than {{convert|0.210|mm}}, most grit passes through the grit removal flows under normal conditions. During periods of high flow deposited grit is resuspended and the quantity of grit reaching the treatment plant increases substantially. It is, therefore important that the grit removal system not only operate efficiently during normal flow conditions but also under sustained peak flows when the greatest volume of grit reaches the plant.&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858915999 |title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Resource Recovery |others=Tchobanoglous, George; Stensel, H. David; Tsuchihashi, Ryujiro; Burton, Franklin L.; Abu-Orf, Mohammad; Bowden, Gregory |date=2014 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780073401188 |edition=Fifth |location=New York |oclc=858915999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flow equalization====
[[Clarifier]]s and mechanized secondary treatment are more efficient under uniform flow conditions. [[Equalizing basin|Equalization basins]] may be used for temporary storage of diurnal or wet-weather flow peaks. Basins provide a place to temporarily hold incoming sewage during plant maintenance and a means of diluting and distributing batch discharges of toxic or high-strength waste which might otherwise inhibit biological secondary treatment (including portable toilet waste, vehicle holding tanks, and septic tank pumpers). Flow equalization basins require variable discharge control, typically include provisions for bypass and cleaning, and may also include aerators. Cleaning may be easier if the basin is downstream of screening and grit removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=October 1971 |title=Process Design Manual for Upgrading Existing Wastewater Treatment Plants |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100WEPH.txt |publisher=EPA |chapter=Chapter 3. Flow Equalization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fat and grease removal====
In some larger plants, [[fat]] and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] are removed by passing the sewage through a small tank where skimmers collect the fat floating on the surface. Air blowers in the base of the tank may also be used to help recover the fat as a froth. Many plants, however, use primary clarifiers with mechanical surface skimmers for fat and grease removal.

===Primary treatment===
&lt;!--[[Primary Treatment]] redirects to this section; if the section name is changed, please change this redirect accordingly--&gt;
[[File:Sewer Plant.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|Primary treatment tanks in Oregon, USA]]
In the primary [[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] stage, sewage flows through large tanks, commonly called "pre-settling basins", "primary sedimentation tanks" or "primary [[clarifier]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Huber Company, Berching, Germany (2012). [http://www.huber.de/products/sedimentation-tanks.html "Sedimentation Tanks."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118005951/http://www.huber.de/products/sedimentation-tanks.html |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tanks are used to settle sludge while grease and oils rise to the surface and are skimmed off. Primary settling tanks are usually equipped with mechanically driven scrapers that continually drive the collected sludge towards a hopper in the base of the tank where it is pumped to sludge treatment facilities.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|9–11}} Grease and oil from the floating material can sometimes be recovered for [[saponification]] (soap making).

===Secondary treatment===
{{main|Secondary treatment}}
[[Secondary treatment]] is designed to substantially degrade the biological content of the sewage which are derived from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent. The majority of municipal plants treat the settled sewage liquor using aerobic biological processes. To be effective, the [[biota (ecology)|biota]] require both [[oxygen]] and food to live. The [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. [[sugar]]s, fats, organic short-chain [[carbon]] molecules, etc.) and bind much of the less soluble fractions into [[flocculation|floc]].

Secondary treatment systems are classified as fixed-film or suspended-growth systems.
*Fixed-film or attached growth systems include [[trickling filter]]s, [[constructed wetlands]], bio-towers, and [[rotating biological contactor]]s, where the biomass grows on media and the sewage passes over its surface.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|11–13}} The fixed-film principle has further developed into [[Moving bed biofilm reactor|Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors]] (MBBR)&lt;ref&gt;

*Suspended-growth systems include [[activated sludge]], where the biomass is mixed with the sewage and can be operated in a smaller space than trickling filters that treat the same amount of water. However, fixed-film systems are more able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|11–13}}

Some secondary treatment methods include a secondary clarifier to settle out and separate biological floc or filter material grown in the secondary treatment bioreactor.

===Tertiary treatment===
The purpose of tertiary treatment is to provide a final treatment stage to further improve the effluent quality before it is discharged to the receiving environment (sea, river, lake, wet lands, ground, etc.). More than one tertiary treatment process may be used at any treatment plant. If disinfection is practised, it is always the final process. It is also called "effluent polishing."

====Filtration====
[[Sand filter|Sand filtration]] removes much of the residual suspended matter.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|22–23}} Filtration over [[activated carbon]], also called ''carbon adsorption,'' removes residual [[toxin]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

====Lagoons or ponds====
[[File:Everett sewage.jpg|thumb|right|A sewage treatment plant and lagoon in [[Everett, Washington]], USA]]
Lagoons or ponds provide settlement and further biological improvement through storage in large man-made ponds or lagoons. These lagoons are highly aerobic and colonization by native [[macrophyte]]s, especially reeds, is often encouraged. Small filter-feeding [[invertebrate]]s such as ''[[Daphnia]]'' and species of ''[[Rotifera]]'' greatly assist in treatment by removing fine particulates.

====Biological nutrient removal====
Biological nutrient removal (BNR) is regarded by some as a type of secondary treatment process,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and by others as a tertiary (or "advanced") treatment process.

Wastewater may contain high levels of the nutrients [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]. Excessive release to the environment can lead to a buildup of nutrients, called [[eutrophication]], which can in turn encourage the overgrowth of weeds, [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae). This may cause an [[algal bloom]], a rapid growth in the population of algae. The algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of them die. The decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die, which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose. In addition to causing deoxygenation, some algal species produce toxins that contaminate [[drinking water]] supplies. Different treatment processes are required to remove nitrogen and phosphorus.

=====Nitrogen removal=====
Nitrogen is removed through the biological [[redox|oxidation]] of nitrogen from [[ammonia]] to [[nitrate]] ([[nitrification]]), followed by [[denitrification]], the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas is released to the atmosphere and thus removed from the water.

Nitrification itself is a two-step aerobic process, each step facilitated by a different type of bacteria. The oxidation of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) is most often facilitated by ''Nitrosomonas'' spp. ("nitroso" referring to the formation of a [[nitroso]] functional group). Nitrite oxidation to nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), though traditionally believed to be facilitated by ''Nitrobacter'' spp. (nitro referring the formation of a [[nitro functional group]]), is now known to be facilitated in the environment almost exclusively by ''Nitrospira'' spp.

Denitrification requires anoxic conditions to encourage the appropriate biological communities to form. It is facilitated by a wide diversity of bacteria. Sand filters, lagooning and reed beds can all be used to reduce nitrogen, but the activated sludge process (if designed well) can do the job the most easily.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Since denitrification is the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen (molecular nitrogen) gas, an [[electron donor]] is needed. This can be, depending on the waste water, organic matter (from feces), [[sulfide]], or an added donor like [[methanol]]. The sludge in the anoxic tanks (denitrification tanks) must be mixed well (mixture of recirculated mixed liquor, return activated sludge [RAS], and raw influent) e.g. by using [[submersible mixer]]s in order to achieve the desired denitrification.

Sometimes the conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrate alone is referred to as tertiary treatment.

Over time, different treatment configurations have evolved as denitrification has become more sophisticated. An initial scheme, the Ludzack–Ettinger Process, placed an anoxic treatment zone before the aeration tank and clarifier, using the return activated sludge (RAS) from the clarifier as a nitrate source. Influent wastewater (either raw or as effluent from primary clarification) serves as the electron source for the facultative bacteria to metabolize carbon, using the inorganic nitrate as a source of oxygen instead of dissolved molecular oxygen. This denitrification scheme was naturally limited to the amount of soluble nitrate present in the RAS. Nitrate reduction was limited because RAS rate is limited by the performance of the clarifier.

The "Modified Ludzak–Ettinger Process" (MLE) is an improvement on the original concept, for it recycles mixed liquor from the discharge end of the aeration tank to the head of the anoxic tank to provide a consistent source of soluble nitrate for the facultative bacteria. In this instance, raw wastewater continues to provide the electron source, and sub-surface mixing maintains the bacteria in contact with both electron source and soluble nitrate in the absence of dissolved oxygen.

Many sewage treatment plants use [[centrifugal pump]]s to transfer the nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification. These pumps are often referred to as ''Internal Mixed Liquor Recycle'' (IMLR) pumps. IMLR may be 200% to 400% the flow rate of influent wastewater (Q). This is in addition to Return Activated Sludge (RAS) from secondary clarifiers, which may be 100% of Q. (Therefore, the hydraulic capacity of the tanks in such a system should handle at least 400% of annual average design flow (AADF). At times, the raw or primary effluent wastewater must be carbon-supplemented by the addition of methanol, acetate, or simple food waste (molasses, whey, plant starch) to improve the treatment efficiency. These carbon additions should be accounted for in the design of a treatment facility's organic loading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wefnet.org/mopnew/Operation_of_Municipal_Wastewater_Treatment_Plants/Chapter%2022%20Revised_6th%20Edition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210203528/http://www.wefnet.org/MOPNEW/Operation_of_Municipal_Wastewater_Treatment_Plants/Chapter%2022%20Revised_6th%20Edition.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further modifications to the MLE were to come: Bardenpho and Biodenipho processes include additional anoxic and oxidative processes to further polish the conversion of nitrate ion to molecular nitrogen gas. Use of an anaerobic tank following the initial anoxic process allows for luxury uptake of phosphorus by bacteria, thereby biologically reducing orthophosphate ion in the treated wastewater. Even newer improvements, such as [[Anammox]] Process, interrupt the formation of nitrate at the nitrite stage of nitrification, shunting nitrite-rich mixed liquor activated sludge to treatment where nitrite is then converted to molecular nitrogen gas, saving energy, alkalinity, and secondary carbon sourcing. Anammox™ (ANaerobic AMMonia OXidation) works by artificially extending detention time and preserving denitrifiying bacteria through the use of substrate added to the mixed liquor and continuously recycled from it prior to secondary clarification. Many other proprietary schemes are being deployed, including DEMON™, Sharon-ANAMMOX™, ANITA-Mox™, and DeAmmon™.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=March 2013 |title=Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management |chapter=Chapter 3.

=====Phosphorus removal=====
Every adult human excretes between {{convert|200|and|1000|g}} of phosphorus annually. Studies of United States sewage in the late 1960s estimated mean per capita contributions of {{convert|500|g}} in urine and feces, {{convert|1000|g}} in synthetic detergents, and lesser variable amounts used as corrosion and scale control chemicals in water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=1976 |title=Process Design Manual for Phosphorus Removal |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20007TYZ.txt |pages=2–1 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 625/1-76-001a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Source control via alternative detergent formulations has subsequently reduced the largest contribution, but the content of urine and feces will remain unchanged. Phosphorus removal is important as it is a limiting nutrient for algae growth in many fresh water systems. (For a description of the negative effects of algae, ''see'' [[Sewage treatment#Nutrient removal|Nutrient removal]]). It is also particularly important for water reuse systems where high phosphorus concentrations may lead to fouling of downstream equipment such as [[reverse osmosis]].

Phosphorus can be removed biologically in a process called [[enhanced biological phosphorus removal]]. In this process, specific bacteria, called [[polyphosphate-accumulating organisms]] (PAOs), are selectively enriched and accumulate large quantities of phosphorus within their cells (up to 20 percent of their mass). When the biomass enriched in these bacteria is separated from the treated water, these [[biosolids]] have a high [[fertilizer]] value.

Phosphorus removal can also be achieved by chemical [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], usually with [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of [[iron]] (e.g. [[ferric chloride]]), [[aluminum]] (e.g. [[alum]]), or lime.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|18}} This may lead to excessive sludge production as hydroxides precipitate and the added chemicals can be expensive. Chemical phosphorus removal requires significantly smaller equipment footprint than biological removal, is easier to operate and is often more reliable than biological phosphorus removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansmiddendorp.blogspot.com/|title=De toekomst voor de waterschappen|last=|first=|date=|website=Hansmiddendorp|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method for phosphorus removal is to use granular [[Laterite#Waste water treatment|laterite]].

Some systems use both biological phosphorus removal and chemical phosphorus removal.  The chemical phosphorus removal in those systems may be used as a backup system, for use when the biological phosphorus removal is nor removing enough phosphorus, or may be used continuously.  In either case, using both biological and chemical phosphorus removal has the advantage of not increasing sludge production as much as chemical phosphorus removal on its own, with the disadvantage of the increased initial cost associated with installing two different systems.

Once removed, phosphorus, in the form of a phosphate-rich [[sewage sludge]], may be dumped in a landfill or used as fertilizer. In the latter case, the treated sewage sludge is also sometimes referred to as biosolids.

====Disinfection====
{{Further|Advanced oxidation process}}
The purpose of [[disinfection]] in the treatment of waste water is to substantially reduce the number of [[microorganism]]s in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking, bathing, irrigation, etc. The effectiveness of disinfection depends on the quality of the water being treated (e.g., cloudiness, pH, etc.), the type of disinfection being used, the disinfectant dosage (concentration and time), and other environmental variables. Cloudy water will be treated less successfully, since solid matter can shield organisms, especially from [[ultraviolet light]] or if contact times are low. Generally, short contact times, low doses and high flows all militate against effective disinfection. Common methods of disinfection include [[ozone]], [[chlorine]], ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|16}} [[Chloramine]], which is used for drinking water, is not used in the treatment of waste water because of its persistence. After multiple steps of disinfection, the treated water is ready to be released back into the [[water cycle]] by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture. Afterwards, the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses.

[[Water chlorination|Chlorination]] remains the most common form of waste water disinfection in [[North America]] due to its low cost and long-term history of effectiveness. One disadvantage is that chlorination of residual organic material can generate chlorinated-organic compounds that may be [[carcinogenic]] or harmful to the environment. Residual chlorine or chloramines may also be capable of chlorinating organic material in the natural aquatic environment. Further, because residual chlorine is toxic to aquatic species, the treated effluent must also be chemically dechlorinated, adding to the complexity and cost of treatment.

[[Ultraviolet]] (UV) light can be used instead of chlorine, iodine, or other chemicals. Because no chemicals are used, the treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it, as may be the case with other methods. UV radiation causes damage to the [[gene]]tic structure of bacteria, [[virus]]es, and other [[pathogen]]s, making them incapable of reproduction. The key disadvantages of UV disinfection are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the UV radiation (i.e., any solids present in the treated effluent may protect microorganisms from the UV light). In the United Kingdom, UV light is becoming the most common means of disinfection because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water. Some sewage treatment systems in Canada and the US also use UV light for their effluent water disinfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tapas K. |date=August 2001 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection application to a wastewater treatment plant |journal=Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy |publisher=Springer Berlin/Heidelberg |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=69–80 |url= |doi=10.1007/S100980100108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Tallahassee, FL. [http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wastewater/dom/domuv.htm "Ultraviolet Disinfection for Domestic Waste water."] 2010-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ozone]] ({{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is generated by passing oxygen ({{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through a high [[voltage]] potential resulting in a third oxygen [[atom]] becoming attached and forming {{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Ozone is very unstable and reactive and oxidizes most organic material it comes in contact with, thereby destroying many pathogenic microorganisms. Ozone is considered to be safer than chlorine because, unlike chlorine which has to be stored on site (highly poisonous in the event of an accidental release), ozone is generated on-site as needed. Ozonation also produces fewer disinfection by-products than chlorination. A disadvantage of ozone disinfection is the high cost of the ozone generation equipment and the requirements for special operators.

=== Fourth treatment stage ===
{{Further|Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products}}
Micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, ingredients of household chemicals, chemicals used in small businesses or industries, [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]] (EPPP) or pesticides may not be eliminated in the conventional treatment process (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment) and therefore lead to [[water pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;UBA (Umweltbundesamt) (2014): [http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/378/publikationen/texte_85_2014_massnahmen_zur_verminderung_des_eintrages_von_mikroschadstoffen_in_die_gewaesser_0.pdf Maßnahmen zur Verminderung des Eintrages von Mikroschadstoffen in die Gewässer]. Texte 85/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although concentrations of those substances and their decomposition products are quite low, there is still a chance to harm aquatic organisms. For [[pharmaceuticals]], the following substances have been identified as "toxicologically relevant": substances with [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting]] effects, [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] substances and substances that enhance the development of [[Antimicrobial resistance|bacterial resistances]].&lt;ref name="Walz"&gt;Walz, A., Götz, K.

ISOE-Materialien zur Sozialen Ökologie Nr. 36 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; They mainly belong to the group of [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s. Techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are being tested in Germany, Switzerland{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández Leal, L. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1363 Removal of micropollutants from grey water – Combining biological and physical/chemical processes]. PhD thesis, Wageningen University&lt;/ref&gt; However, since those techniques are still costly, they are not yet applied on a regular basis. Such process steps mainly consist of [[activated carbon]] filters that adsorb the micropollutants. Ozone can also be applied as an oxidative method.&lt;ref&gt;Ternes, T. (2009): [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1378 Challenges for the future: emerging micropollutants in urban water cycle]. BFG, Koblenz, Germany (presentation for a seminar at UNESCO-IHE, Delft)&lt;/ref&gt; Also the use of enzymes such as the enzyme laccase is under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Margot | first1 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2013 | title = Bacterial versus fungal laccase: potential for micropollutant degradation| url = | journal = AMB Express | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 63 | doi = 10.1186/2191-0855-3-63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new concept which could provide an energy-efficient treatment of micropollutants could be the use of laccase secreting fungi cultivated at a wastewater treatment plant to degrade micropollutants and at the same time to provide enzymes at a cathode of a microbial biofuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biooekonomie-bw.de/en/articles/news/crude-mushroom-solution-to-degrade-micropollutants-and-increase-the-performance-of-biofuel-cells/|title=Crude mushroom solution to degrade micropollutants and increase the performance of biofuel cells|website=www.biooekonomie-bw.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial biofuel cells are investigated for their property to treat organic matter in wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logan | first1 = B. | last2 = Regan | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Microbial Fuel Cells—Challenges and Applications| doi = 10.1021/es0627592 | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 40| issue = 17| pages = 5172–5180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce pharmaceuticals in water bodies, also "source control" measures are under investigation, such as innovations in drug development or more responsible handling of drugs.&lt;ref name="Walz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lienert | first1 = J. | last2 = Bürki | first2 = T. | last3 = Escher | first3 = B.I. | year = 2007 | title = Reducing micropollutants with source control: Substance flow analysis of 212 pharmaceuticals in faeces and urine | url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1406 | journal = Water Science &amp; Technology | volume = 56 | issue = 5| pages = 87–96 | doi=10.2166/wst.2007.560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Odor control==
[[Odors]] emitted by sewage treatment are typically an indication of an anaerobic or "septic" condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harshman |first1=Vaughan |last2=Barnette |first2=Tony |date=2000-12-28|title=Wastewater Odor Control: An Evaluation of Technologies |journal=Water Engineering &amp; Management |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.wwdmag.com/Wastewater-Odor-Control-An-Evaluation-of-Technologies-article1698 |issn=0273-2238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early stages of processing will tend to produce foul-smelling gases, with [[hydrogen sulfide]] being most common in generating complaints. Large process plants in urban areas will often treat the odors with carbon reactors, a contact media with bio-slimes, small doses of [[chlorine]], or circulating fluids to biologically capture and metabolize the noxious gases.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, James D. and Welles Products Corporation (1976).[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4421534.html "Tower for removing odors from gases."] U.S. Patent No. 4421534.&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of odor control exist, including addition of iron salts, [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[calcium nitrate]], etc. to manage [[hydrogen sulfide]] levels.

[[High-density solids pump]]s are suitable for reducing odors by conveying sludge through hermetic closed pipework.

== Energy requirements ==
For conventional sewage treatment plants, around 30 percent of the annual operating costs is usually required for energy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|1703}} The energy requirements vary with type of treatment process as well as wastewater load. For example, [[constructed wetland]]s have a lower energy requirement than [[activated sludge]] plants, as less energy is required for the aeration step.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, H., Platzer, C., von Münch, E., Winker, M. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/930 Technology review of constructed wetlands – Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment]. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Sewage treatment plants that produce biogas in their [[sewage sludge treatment]] process with [[anaerobic digestion]] can produce enough energy to meet most of the energy needs of the sewage treatment plant itself.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|1505}}

In conventional secondary treatment processes, most of the electricity is used for aeration, pumping systems and equipment for the dewatering and drying of [[sewage sludge]]. Advanced wastewater treatment plants, e.g. for nutrient removal, require more energy than plants that only achieve primary or secondary treatment.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|1704}}

==Sludge treatment and disposal==
{{main|Sewage sludge treatment}}
The sludges accumulated in a wastewater treatment process must be treated and disposed of in a safe and effective manner. The purpose of digestion is to reduce the amount of [[organic matter]] and the number of disease-causing [[microorganism]]s present in the solids. The most common treatment options include [[anaerobic digestion]], [[aerobic digestion]], and [[composting]]. [[Incineration]] is also used, albeit to a much lesser degree.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|19–21}}

Sludge treatment depends on the amount of solids generated and other site-specific conditions. Composting is most often applied to small-scale plants with aerobic digestion for mid-sized operations, and anaerobic digestion for the larger-scale operations.

The sludge is sometimes passed through a so-called pre-thickener which de-waters the sludge. Types of pre-thickeners include centrifugal sludge thickeners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/centrifuge-thickening-and-dewatering|publisher=EPA|access-date=16 October 2017|title=Centrifuge Thickening and Dewatering}}&lt;/ref&gt; rotary drum sludge thickeners and belt filter presses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/belt-filter-press|publisher=EA|access-date=16 October 2017|title=Belt Filter Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewatered sludge may be incinerated or transported offsite for disposal in a landfill or use as an agricultural soil amendment.

==Environment aspects==

Many processes in a wastewater treatment plant are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes that occur in the environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall [[ecology]] of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to [[ultraviolet]] radiation. Consequently, in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including [[hormone]]s (from [[animal husbandry]] and residue from human [[hormonal contraception]] methods) and synthetic materials such as [[phthalate]]s that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/444304/1290036/1290100/1290353/1294402/1311542/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |title=Environment Agency (archive) – Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic PBT substances |accessdate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804195610/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/444304/1290036/1290100/1290353/1294402/1311542/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |archivedate=August 4, 2006 |df= }}. environment-agency.gov.uk.

USGS&lt;/ref&gt; In the US and [[European Union|EU]], uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law, and strict water quality requirements are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential. (For requirements in the US, ''see [[Clean Water Act#Point sources|Clean Water Act]].'') A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries.

===Effects on biology===
Sewage treatment plants can have multiple effects on nutrient levels in the water that the treated sewage flows into. These nutrients can have large effects on the biological life in the water in contact with the effluent.
[[Stabilization pond]]s (or sewage treatment ponds) can include any of the following:
* Oxidation ponds, which are aerobic bodies of water usually {{convert|1|–|2|m}} in depth that receive effluent from sedimentation tanks or other forms of primary treatment.
:* Dominated by [[algae]]
* Polishing ponds are similar to oxidation ponds but receive effluent from an oxidation pond or from a plant with an extended mechanical treatment.
:* Dominated by [[zooplankton]]
* [[Facultative lagoon]]s, raw sewage lagoons, or sewage lagoons are ponds where sewage is added with no primary treatment other than coarse screening. These ponds provide effective treatment when the surface remains aerobic; although anaerobic conditions may develop near the layer of settled sludge on the bottom of the pond.&lt;ref name="Metcalf &amp; Eddy" /&gt;{{rp|552–554}}
* Anaerobic lagoons are heavily loaded ponds.
:* Dominated by [[bacteria]]
* Sludge lagoons are aerobic ponds, usually {{convert|2|to|5|m}} in depth, that receive anaerobically digested primary sludge, or activated secondary sludge under water.
:* Upper layers are dominated by algae &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00288330.1968.9515271|author=Haughey, A. |year=1968|title=The Planktonic Algae of Auckland Sewage Treatment Ponds|journal=New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research|volume=2|issue=4|pages=721–766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphorus limitation is a possible result from sewage treatment and results in flagellate-dominated [[plankton]], particularly in summer and fall.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, W.T. (1972). "Nutrients and Phytoplankton in Lake Washington." in ''Nutrients and Eutrophication: The Limiting Nutrient Controversy.'' American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Special Symposia. Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[phytoplankton]] study found high nutrient concentrations linked to sewage effluents. High nutrient concentration leads to high [[chlorophyll a]] concentrations, which is a proxy for primary production in marine environments. High primary production means high [[phytoplankton]] populations and most likely high zooplankton populations, because zooplankton feed on phytoplankton. However, effluent released into marine systems also leads to greater population instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Caperon, J.|author2=Cattell, S. A.|author3=Krasnick, G.|lastauthoramp=yes|url=http://www.nospam.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_16/issue_4/0599.pdf|title=Phytoplankton Kinetics in a Subtropical Estuary: Eutrophication|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=16|issue=4|pages=599–607|year=1971|doi=10.4319/lo.1971.16.4.0599}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planktonic trends of high populations close to input of treated sewage is contrasted by the [[bacterial]] trend. In a study of ''[[Aeromonas]]'' spp. in increasing distance from a wastewater source, greater change in seasonal cycles was found the furthest from the effluent. This trend is so strong that the furthest location studied actually had an inversion of the ''Aeromonas'' spp. cycle in comparison to that of [[fecal coliforms]]. Since there is a main pattern in the cycles that occurred simultaneously at all stations it indicates seasonal factors (temperature, solar radiation, phytoplankton) control of the bacterial population. The effluent dominant species changes from ''Aeromonas caviae'' in winter to ''Aeromonas sobria'' in the spring and fall while the inflow dominant species is ''Aeromonas caviae'', which is constant throughout the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=184551 |pmid=2389929 |year=1990 |last1=Monfort |first1=P |last2=Baleux |first2=B |title=Dynamics of Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria, and Aeromonas caviae in a sewage treatment pond |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=1999–2006 |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reuse ==
{{Main|Reclaimed water}}
With suitable technology, it is possible to reuse sewage effluent for drinking water, although this is usually only done in places with limited water supplies, such as [[Windhoek]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;PUB (Singapore National Water Agency)(2011). [http://www.pub.gov.sg/about/historyfuture/Pages/NEWater.aspx "NEWater: History."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610102220/http://www.pub.gov.sg/about/historyfuture/pages/newater.aspx |date=2013-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[arid]] countries, treated wastewater is often used in [[agriculture]]. For example, in Israel, about 50 percent of agricultural water use (total use was {{convert|1000000000|m3|spell=in}} in 2008) is provided through reclaimed sewer water. Future plans call for increased use of treated sewer water as well as more [[desalination plant]]s as part of [[water supply and sanitation in Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Farming in Israel, without a drop to spare |first=Andrew |last=Martin |newspaper=New York Times |date=2008-08-10 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-10feed.15134930.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constructed wetland]]s fed by wastewater provide both treatment and [[habitats]] for flora and fauna. Another example for reuse combined with treatment of sewage are the [[East Kolkata Wetlands]] in India. These wetlands are used to treat [[Kolkata]]'s sewage, and the nutrients contained in the wastewater sustain fish farms and agriculture.

== Developing countries ==
[[File:Sewage treatment plant in Gobabis, Namibia (2018).jpg|thumb|Sewage treatment plant in [[Gobabis]], [[Namibia]] (2018) {{Coordinate|NS=-22.476398|EW= 18.951620|type=landmark|region=NA-OH|text=ICON2|name=Sewage treatment Gobabis, Namibia}}]]
Few reliable figures exist on the share of the wastewater collected in sewers that is being treated in the world. A global estimate by [[UNDP]] and [[UN-Habitat]] is that 90% of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corcoran, E., C. Nellemann, E.

In Latin America about 15 percent of collected wastewater passes through treatment plants (with varying levels of actual treatment). In [[Venezuela]], a below average country in [[South America]] with respect to wastewater treatment, 97 percent of the country’s [[sewage]] is discharged raw into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Appropriate Technology for Sewage Pollution Control in the Wider Caribbean Region |last = Caribbean Environment Programme |year=1998 |publisher= United Nations Environment Programme |location=Kingston, Jamaica |isbn= |pages= |url=http://www.cep.unep.org/publications-and-resources/technical-reports/tr40en.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-12}} Technical Report No. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iran]], a relatively developed [[Middle East]]ern country, the majority of [[Tehran]]'s population has totally untreated sewage injected to the city’s groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;Massoud Tajrishy and Ahmad Abrishamchi (2005).

''Water Conservation, Reuse, and Recycling: Proceedings of the Iranian-American Workshop''. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the construction of major parts of the sewage system, collection and treatment, in Tehran is almost complete, and under development, due to be fully completed by the end of 2012. In Isfahan, Iran's third largest city, sewage treatment was started more than 100 years ago.

Only few cities in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] have sewer-based [[sanitation]] systems, let alone wastewater treatment plants, an exception being South Africa and – until the late 1990s – Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbabwe: [https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/11/19/zimbabwe-water-and-sanitation-crisis Water and Sanitation Crisis], Human Rights Watch, &lt;/ref&gt; Instead, most urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa rely on on-site sanitation systems without sewers, such as [[septic tanks]] and [[pit latrines]], and [[fecal sludge management]] in these cities is an enormous challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhry, S., Koné, D.

==History==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:FaradayFatherThames.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Stink]] of 1858 stimulated research into the problem of sewage treatment. In this caricature in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Michael Faraday]] reports to ''Father [[River Thames|Thames]]'' on the state of the river.]]
Basic sewer systems were used for waste removal in ancient [[Mesopotamia]], where vertical shafts carried the waste away into cesspools. Similar systems existed in the [[Indus Valley]] civilization in modern-day India and in Ancient [[Crete]] and [[Greece]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] the sewer systems built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] fell into disuse and waste was collected into cesspools that were periodically emptied by workers known as 'rakers' who would often sell it as [[fertilizer]] to farmers outside the city.

Modern sewage systems were first built in the mid-nineteenth century as a reaction to the exacerbation of sanitary conditions brought on by heavy [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. Due to the contaminated water supply, [[cholera]] outbreaks occurred in [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics|1832, 1849 and 1855]] in [[London]], killing tens of thousands of people. This, combined with the [[Great Stink]] of 1858, when the smell of untreated human waste in the [[River Thames]] became overpowering, and the report into sanitation reform of the [[Royal Commission]]er [[Edwin Chadwick]],&lt;ref name=Ashton-Ubido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] appointing [[Joseph Bazalgette]] to construct a vast underground sewage system for the safe removal of waste. Contrary to Chadwick's recommendations, Bazalgette's system, and others later built in [[Continental Europe]], did not pump the sewage onto farm land for use as fertilizer; it was simply piped to a natural waterway away from population centres, and pumped back into the environment.

===Early attempts===
One of the first attempts at diverting sewage for use as a fertilizer in the farm was made by the [[cotton mill]] owner [[James Smith (inventor)|James Smith]] in the 1840s. He experimented with a piped distribution system initially proposed by James Vetch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GV1YAAAAYAAJ|title=A short description of the plans of Captain James Vetch for the sewerage of the metropolis|author=Lewis Dunbar B. Gordon|year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; that collected sewage from his factory and pumped it into the outlying farms, and his success was enthusiastically followed by Edwin Chadwick and supported by organic chemist [[Justus von Liebig]].

The idea was officially adopted by the [[Health of Towns Association|Health of Towns Commission]], and various schemes (known as sewage farms) were trialled by different municipalities over the next 50 years. At first, the heavier solids were channeled into ditches on the side of the farm and were covered over when full, but soon flat-bottomed tanks were employed as reservoirs for the sewage; the earliest patent was taken out by William Higgs in 1846 for "tanks or reservoirs in which the contents of sewers and drains from cities, towns and villages are to be collected and the solid animal or vegetable matters therein contained, solidified and dried..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6tvSwAACAAJ|title=History of Sewage Treatment in Britain|author=H. H. Stanbridge|year=1976|publisher=Institute of Water Pollution Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements to the design of the tanks included the introduction of the horizontal-flow tank in the 1850s and the radial-flow tank in 1905. These tanks had to be manually de-sludged periodically, until the introduction of automatic mechanical de-sludgers in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/leeds/cooper.pdf|title=Historical aspects of wastewater treatment|author=P. F. Cooper|accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precursor to the modern [[septic tank]] was the [[cesspool]] in which the water was sealed off to prevent contamination and the solid waste was slowly liquified due to anaerobic action; it was invented by L.H Mouras in France in the 1860s. Donald Cameron, as [[Surveying|City Surveyor]] for [[Exeter]] patented an improved version in 1895, which he called a 'septic tank'; septic having the meaning of 'bacterial'. These are still in worldwide use, especially in rural areas unconnected to large-scale sewage systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXnX4KkV00YC|title=The Sanitary City: Environmental Services in Urban America from Colonial Times to the Present|author=Martin V. Melosi|year=2010|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|page=110|isbn=978-0-8229-7337-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological treatment===
[[File:Frankland Edward 1894.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Frankland]], a distinguished chemist, who demonstrated the possibility of chemically treating sewage in the 1870s]]

It was not until the late 19th century that it became possible to treat the sewage by biologically decomposing the organic components through the use of [[microorganism]]s and removing the pollutants. Land treatment was also steadily becoming less feasible, as cities grew and the volume of sewage produced could no longer be absorbed by the farmland on the outskirts.

[[Edward Frankland]] conducted experiments at the sewage farm in [[Croydon]], England, during the 1870s and was able to demonstrate that filtration of sewage through porous gravel produced a nitrified effluent (the ammonia was converted into nitrate) and that the filter remained unclogged over long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-2rWpwJevEC|title=Edward Frankland: Chemistry, Controversy and Conspiracy in Victorian England|author=Colin A. Russell|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=372–380|isbn=978-0-521-54581-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This established the then revolutionary possibility of biological treatment of sewage using a contact bed to oxidize the waste. This concept was taken up by the chief chemist for the London [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], William Libdin, in 1887:
:...in all probability the true way of purifying sewage...will be first to separate the sludge, and then turn into neutral effluent... retain it for a sufficient period, during which time it should be fully aerated, and finally discharge it into the stream in a purified condition. This is indeed what is aimed at and imperfectly accomplished on a sewage farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=thEigV6yl64C|title=Advances in Water Treatment and Pollution Prevention|author1=Sharma, Sanjay Kumar |author2=Sanghi, Rashmi |year=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-007-4204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1885 to 1891 filters working on this principle were constructed throughout the UK and the idea was also taken up in the US at the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]] in [[Massachusetts]], where Frankland's work was confirmed. In 1890 the LES developed a '[[trickling filter]]' that gave a much more reliable performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ironwood.cpe.uchicago.edu/CPE_Workshop/paper/Cain-Rotella-Sept2005.pdf|title=Epidemics, demonstration effects, and municipal investment in sanitation capital.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904172532/http://ironwood.cpe.uchicago.edu/CPE_Workshop/paper/Cain-Rotella-Sept2005.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact beds were developed in [[City of Salford|Salford]], [[Lancashire]] and by scientists working for the [[London City Council]] in the early 1890s. According to Christopher Hamlin, this was part of a conceptual revolution that replaced the philosophy that saw "sewage purification as the prevention of decomposition with one that tried to facilitate the biological process that destroy sewage naturally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucessjb/Hamlin%201992.pdf|title=Edwin Chadwick and the Engineers, 1842–1854: Systems and Antisystems in the Pipe-and-Brick Sewers War Technology and Culture|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact beds were tanks containing the inert substance, such as stones or slate, that maximized the surface area available for the microbial growth to break down the sewage. The sewage was held in the tank until it was fully decomposed and it was then filtered out into the ground. This method quickly became widespread, especially in the UK, where it was used in [[Leicester]], [[Sheffield]], [[Manchester]] and [[Leeds]]. The bacterial bed was simultaneously developed by Joseph Corbett as Borough Engineer in [[City of Salford|Salford]] and experiments in 1905 showed that his method was superior in that greater volumes of sewage could be purified better for longer periods of time than could be achieved by the contact bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZRY6rrpKFGgC|title=Aerobic Wastewater Treatment Processes: History and Development|author=Tilley, David F.|year=2011|publisher=IWA Publishing|date=2011|isbn=978-1-84339-542-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal published its eighth report in 1912 that set what became the international standard for sewage discharge into rivers; the '20:30 standard', which allowed {{convert|20|mg}} [[Biochemical oxygen demand]] and {{convert|30|mg}} suspended solid per litre ({{convert|1|l|USgal|disp=out}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924003641929 Final report of the commissioners appointed to inquire and report what methods of treating and disposing of sewage (1912)]. us.archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surrogate alcohol''' is a term for any substance containing [[ethanol]] that is intentionally consumed by humans but is not meant for human consumption. Some definitions of the term also extend to [[Moonshine|illegally produced alcoholic beverages]].&lt;ref name="Lachenmeier"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lachenmeier|first1=Dirk W.|last2=Rehm|first2=Jürgen|last3=Gmel|first3=Gerhard|title=Surrogate Alcohol: What Do We Know and Where Do We Go?|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|date=October 2007|volume=31|issue=10|pages=1613–1624|doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2007.00474.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumption of such substances carries extreme health risks, both from the ethanol content and other more toxic substances that may be present. Users risk both acute [[poisoning]] from substances such as [[methanol]], and chronic poisoning from substances such as [[lead poisoning|lead]].&lt;ref name="Lachenmeier"/&gt;

Most people turn to these as a last resort either out of desperation, being underaged or being unable to afford consumable alcoholic beverages (with [[homeless]] [[alcoholic]]s) or due to lack of access to drinking ethanol (for example with prison inmates and individuals in [[psychiatric ward]]s).

== Common surrogate alcohols ==
[[File:Troynoy Odekolon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Popular Russian ''[[Eau de Cologne]]'' "Тройной" (Troynoy; Triple)]]
Many alcoholic liquids contain alcohol but are not meant to be ingested in the same way as [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Typical surrogate alcohols include:
*[[Hand sanitizer]]
*[[Mouthwash]]
*[[Aftershave]] or [[Eau de Cologne|cologne]]
*[[Cooking wine]]
*Cleaning fluids such as [[Windex]]
*[[Extract]]s
*[[Charcoal lighter fluid]]
*[[Rubbing alcohol]]
*[[Windshield washer fluid]]
*[[Antifreeze]]
*[[Denatured alcohol]] – [[ethanol]] rendered unfit to drink by mixing with [[methanol]] or bittering agents
*[[Sterno]]
*[[Moonshine]] and other homemade alcohols, including two or more of the above mixed together
*[[Disinfectant]]s
*[[Liquid soap]]
*[[Paint]]
*[[Ethanol fuel]]

== Dangers to health ==
Most surrogate alcohols have very high alcoholic levels, some as high as 95%, and thus can lead to [[alcohol poisoning]], along with other symptoms of alcohol abuse such as [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], impaired [[motor coordination|coordination]], [[balance (ability)|balance]] and [[judgment]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], blurred [[visual perception|vision]], and even long-term effects such as [[heart failure]], [[stroke]], and [[death]].

Besides alcohol, there are many other toxic substances in surrogate alcohol such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[antiseptic]]s, [[ketone]]s, as well as alcohols other than [[ethanol]] (drinking alcohol) such as [[isopropanol]] and [[methanol]]. Methanol, and, to a far lesser extent isopropanol, is a poison. The effect of other chemicals on health has not been adequately studied, and so the health risks, while assumed, are unclear.&lt;ref name=Lachenmeier/&gt; However, observations in countries with high consumption of surrogate alcohols, such as Russia, indicate that the impurities in the consumed drink lead to high mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;"Russian 'Surrogate' Alcohols Are A Killer." ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 14 October 2005. [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/10/051014073614.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, [[2016 Irkutsk mass methanol poisoning|62 people died]] from drinking surrogate alcohol in the Russian city of [[Irkutsk]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/21/vladimir-putin-clampdown-surrogate-alcohol-deaths-fake-bath-tincture-irkutsk Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tapologo''''' is a 2007 documentary film.

== Synopsis ==
In Freedom Park, a squatter settlement in [[South Africa]], a group of [[HIV]]-infected former sex-workers, created a network called Tapologo. They learned to nurse their community, transforming degradation into solidarity and squalor into hope. Catholic bishop [[Kevin Dowling (bishop)|Kevin Dowling]] participates in Tapologo, and raises doubts on the official doctrine of the [[Catholic Church]] regarding [[AIDS]] and sexuality in the African context.

A '''Tornwaldt cyst''' is a benign [[cyst]] located in the upper posterior [[nasopharynx]]. It can be seen on [[computed tomography]] (CT) or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the head as a well-circumscribed round mass lying in the midline. In most cases, treatment is not necessary. It was first described by [[Gustav Ludwig Tornwaldt]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20435">A '''wheelchair trainer''' or wheelchair treadmill is an apparatus that allows a manual [[wheelchair]] user to simulate linear (translational) travel while remaining stationary in a manner similar to an ambulatory person walking or running on a [[treadmill]] or a cyclist pedaling a bicycle on a [[bicycle trainer]]. The rear wheelchair wheels are placed in contact with vertical or horizontal rollers which may also be attached to [[flywheel]]s, mechanical resistance or braking mechanisms, motors and various speed and force sensors.{{sfn|Stanford|2006}} Flywheels may be sized to provide a user of a certain mass with a rotational [[inertia]] equivalent to their translational (linear) inertia in order to more realistically approximate actual wheelchair propulsion.

Wheelchair trainers having independent contact rollers permit simulated directional travel ([[omnidirectional treadmill]]). Trainers may also incorporate [[rotary encoder]]s, [[accelerometer]]s and [[torque sensor]]s to enable  interface with computer [[data acquisition]] systems (DAQ) for analysis of propulsion [[kinematics]]. A quadrature rotary encoder or [[hall effect sensor]] can be implemented to provide sufficient speed and direction information to enable virtual navigation interface with [[video game]]s in a manner similar to using a [[joystick]] or [[Video game console|gaming console]]. Calculation of [[rolling resistance]] between the tire &amp; contact roller interface, [[axle friction]], and inertial characteristics of wheelchair wheels and flywheels may be used in determination of stationary propulsion [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]].&lt;sup&gt;[[#a-dynamics|[dynamics]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==History==
The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) has substantially invested in decades long research and development for two wheelchair trainer devices: the Wheelchair Aerobic Fitness Trainer (WAFT),{{sfn|Langbein|Fehr|1993}}&lt;ref name="WAFT"/&gt; and GameWheels.{{sfn|O'Connor|Fitzgerald|Cooper|Thorman|2002}} The history of wheelchair trainer development may be summarized from the 10 patents issued by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] for stationary wheelchair trainers/treadmills/[[Exercise machine|ergometers]]/[[dynamometer]]/[[simulators]] issued from 1980 to 2009.&lt;ref name="patents"/&gt;

==Development==
The last patent is being commercialized under the trademark Trekease, designed to serve as an acronym for Translational &amp; Rotational Equivalent Kinetic Energy Aerobic Stationary Exertainment and as a homonym for [[Trekkies]]&amp;nbsp;– fans of [[Star Trek]].&lt;ref name="r-10"/&gt;{{sfn|''The Daily Texan''}}&lt;ref name="Trekease"/&gt; None of the other cited patents, including the experimental prototypes developed by the VA, are currently being commercialized; however simple unidirectional ramp and roller systems similar in design to patent #4,966,362 are being marketed by others.{{sfn|Cooper|2006}} (See also [[#External links|External links]]).

[[Arcade game]] software and clinical data acquisition use were first introduced by the Veterans Administration's WAFT as a means of promoting stationary wheelchair propulsion as a beneficial [[aerobic exercise]]. Clinical professionals are not currently in agreement regarding the cardiovascular health benefits associated with manual wheelchair propulsion and the possible long term repetitive use injuries attributed to manual wheelchair operation.&lt;sup&gt;[[#a-aerobics|[aerobics]]]&lt;/sup&gt; These debates have encouraged developments to enhance wheelchair seating,{{sfn|Kotajarvi|Sabick|An|Zhao|2004}} back support, frame, wheel, and hand-rim designs. Innovative lever styled mechanisms add a new level to improve the overall efficiency, posture and ergonomics of manual wheelchair propulsion.&lt;sup&gt;[[#a-ergonomics|[ergonomics]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Utilizing lever propulsion technologies on a wheelchair trainer equipped with flywheel and resistance enables one to engage in an activity similar to [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] with all its associated health benefits and risks.{{sfn|McLaurin|2005}}&lt;ref name="r-32"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6463">'''Women's health in Ethiopia''' can be broken down into several sections: general health status, women’s status, maternal health, women and HIV, harmful traditional practices, and violence against women.

==Background==
[[Ethiopia]] is the oldest independent and second most-populous country in [[Africa]]. A projection from the 2007 census, it has a total of 90 million inhabitants in 2015 (CSA 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.et/images/banners/csa2 |format=PDF |title=ማዕከላዊ ስታቲስቲክስ ኤጀንሲ ወቅታዊ የኢትዮጵÁን ሕዝብ ብዛት" ¾¨&lt;MÅƒ U×’@ አስመልክቶ የተዘጋጀ ¾T&gt;Ç=Á መግለጫ |publisher=Csa.gov.et |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sex ratio]] between male and female is almost equal; women in the reproductive age group constitute 23.4% of the population. The total fertility rate declined from 5.5 in 2000 to 4.1 in 2014.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;a 69% reduction according to UN estimates&lt;/ref&gt;

==General health status in Ethiopia==
The average [[life expectancy]] for an Ethiopian has increased from 45 years in 1990 to 64 years in 2014, which is higher than the African average (58 years) but lower than the global average of 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/situation_trends/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Life expectancy |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Ethiopia one of the six countries that made top individual gains since 1990. The achievement is attributed to the dramatic drop in the under five mortality (U5MR) and an improvement in other socio-economic determinants of health. The U5MR has dropped from 204/1000 live births in 1990 to 64/1000 live births in 2013, the target for achieving MDG4 being 67/1000 live births. Thus Ethiopian has achieved the MDG 4 by the year 2013 well ahead of the proposed time for 2015.

==Women’s status in Ethiopia==
In Ethiopia, women of [[reproductive age]] constitute about a quarter of the entire population of 90 million. Around 80% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture, and 84% live in [[rural]] parts of the country. Poverty is multidimensional, and its impact is different on men and women. 43% of rural women aged 10 years and above are economically active, mostly in agriculture.
*	Women in Ethiopia highly contribute for the development of livestock production. But they have very little control on the income. According to the federal civil service commission report in 2005, only 33% of the civil servants were women and 98.2% of women employees were working in lower position. At federal level only 13% of the women were at professional level. In the Informal sector, however, 64.93% are women concentrated in a low paying job.
*	Women in Ethiopia are engaged with the triple role of [[production (economics)|production]], [[reproduction]] and household duties. On an average a rural woman will spend 15 – 18 hours a day on agricultural and domestic activities
*	Eleven percent of women are married to a man with more than one wife and Sixty-three percent of women in Ethiopia are married by age 18, compared with just 14% of men [[File:Age at first marriage and sex.png|thumb|Gender difference on age at first sex]]•	62% women and 18% of men age 25-49 were sexually active by the age of 18, i.e., Women start sexual activity about four and a half years earlier than men (median age of 16.6 years for women and 21.2 years for men) &lt;ref name="dhsprogram1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR255/FR255.pdf |format=PDF |title=Ethiopia : Demographic and Health Survey |date=2011 |publisher=Dhsprogram.com |accessdate=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maternal health==
Good progress has been registered in [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]] reduction, a 69% reduction according to UN estimates from the 1400/100000 live births in 1990 to 420/100,000 live births in 2013.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Maternal wellbeing is crucial for the nations development. Majority of maternal deaths occur in the [[peripartum]] period. Deliveries attended by a [[skilled health care provider]] were shown to improve both [[maternal]] and [[neonatal]] survival. In [[Ethiopian]] most of the deliveries occur at home and unattended by skilled provider[[File:SBA and MMR in Ethiopia.png|thumb|Skilled birth attendance and Maternal Mortality trend in Ethiopia]]

==Women and HIV==
[[HIV]] Sero – prevalence in adults aged between 15–49 years in Ethiopia is estimated at 1.5% [5.5% urban, 0.7% rural]. However, the prevalence in women is about double than the prevalence in men, 1.9% versus 1%, respectively.

== Harmful traditional practices ==
Seventy four percent of women had a [[FGM]] out of which, 6% have their [[vaginas]] sewn closed.&lt;ref name="dhsprogram1"/&gt; Around 8% of all marriages occur after through [[Bride kidnapping|abduction]].

==Violence against women==
The most common forms of [[violence against women in Ethiopia]] include [[physical violence]] ([[intimate partner violence]]) and [[sexual violence]]. A study done in [[Kofele]], ([[Oromia region]], [[Arsi Province|Arsi]], Ethiopia) in 2004 showed the lifetime and the 12 months prevalence of [[physical violence]] among married women was 64% and 55%, respectively. Another study performed in North-west Ethiopia ([[Dabat]] High school) in 2005 revealed that sexual harassment was seen in 44% of the students and [[rape]] was experienced by 33.3% of sexually active students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gender-besed violence among high school students in north west Ethiopia. |date=2015-04-20 |pmid=16523641 | volume=43 |journal=Ethiop Med J |pages=215–21 | last1 = Fitaw | first1 = Y | last2 = Haddis | first2 = K | last3 = Million | first3 = F | last4 = Selassie | first4 = K | last5 = Delil | first5 = M | last6 = Yohannes | first6 = M | last7 = Bekele | first7 = N | last8 = Selassie | first8 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tertiary level of education the sexual violence was also alarmingly high as this was also confirmed by a study conducted at [[Addis Ababa University]] in 2004 on more than 600 students, where [[sexual harassment]] was experienced by 58% in life time and 41.8% in the last one year, rape was experienced by 12.7% of the students, and 27.5% of the student had escaped an attempted rape.

'''Your Health Idaho''', sometimes known as the '''Idaho Health Insurance Exchange''', is the [[health insurance marketplace]] for the U.S. state of Idaho. The exchange enables people and small businesses to purchase health insurance at federally subsidized rates.

==Background==
Health insurance exchanges were established as a part of the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] to enable individuals to purchase health insurance in state-run marketplaces.&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/healthcare/policy/231001432
|title=HHS Proposes Health Insurance Exchange Rules
|last=Lewis
|first=Nicole
|work=Information Week
|date=July 12, 2011
|accessdate=November 16, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this legislation, states could choose to establish their own health insurance exchanges; if they choose not to do so, the federal government would run one for the state.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

In 2014, [[Healthcare.gov]] will be responsible for enrolling consumers in on-exchange health plans in the state of Idaho.

==Participating Insurance Providers==
4 insurance companies are participating in the Idaho Health Insurance Exchange in 2014:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
