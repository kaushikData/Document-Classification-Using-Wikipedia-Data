      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4517">'''Abortion in the Republic of Macedonia''' is legal on request during the first ten weeks of pregnancy. After ten weeks, it is permitted in cases where the woman's health or life is in danger, when the child is expected to have severe defects, when the pregnancy results from a crime, or the woman's health is affected by difficult circumstances. Since a controversial 2013 anti-abortion law, several restrictions are in place, making access to abortion more difficult.
Abortions can only be performed by an [[obstetrician-gynecologist]] in a health organization that meets certain minimum standards.

The 1977 law regulating abortion, enacted when the [[Republic of Macedonia]] was part of [[Yugoslavia]], was not significantly altered until 2013.&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite book | title=Abortion Policies: A Global Review | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/ | chapter=TFYR of Macedonia | chapterurl=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/macedonia.doc | deadurl=no | year=2002 | publisher=United Nations Population Division | volume=Country Profiles | format=DOC | oclc=48213121 | pages=127–9 | archivedate=11 January 2005 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050111012745/http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/macedonia.doc }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At its peak in 1986, the abortion rate in the Republic of Macedonia was 70.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44; the rate fell after independence, to 28.5 by 1996.&lt;ref name="un"/&gt; {{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 11.1 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2013 Law on Termination of Pregnancy==
Between 2005-2016, Macedonia was strongly dominated by conservative political forces, which promoted [[traditional values]].&lt;ref&gt;https://whogoverns.eu/1830-2/&lt;/ref&gt; A strong anti-abortion movement developed, which culminated with a new [[anti-abortion]] law in 2013. The government of Macedonia, backed by the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], has also conducted advertising campaigns against abortion, aimed at increasing the country's birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=26 November 2013 |title=Macedonia: State anti-abortion ad faces criticism |url=https://news.yahoo.com/macedonia-state-anti-abortion-ad-faces-criticism-181803713.html |agency=Associated Press |location= |publisher= |accessdate=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although abortion is still permitted, access has been restricted. 
In 2013, the Parliament passed the law, just 20 days after it had received the first draft. Although some changes from the original harsh draft of the law were made, due to opposition from the public and NGOs, several restrictions remained – restrictions which complicate the access to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/strategic_framework_macedonia.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://hera.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ana-M-Kajevska-Abortus-Ukinuvanje-na-demokratijata_ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The new law enacted includes: mandatory filing of a written request for the termination of unwanted pregnancy by the woman to the appropriate health institution, mandatory counseling about the potential advantages of continuing the pregnancy, as well as about the health risks for the woman from undergoing an abortion, and a mandatory waiting period of three days after counseling before medical intervention is conducted to terminate the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CCPR/Shared%20Documents/MKD/INT_CCPR_ICO_MKD_17688_E.docx.&lt;/ref&gt; The original form of the law also stipulated that the woman's partner had to be informed about the abortion – a provision which drew severe opposition and was consequently withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.criticatac.ro/lefteast/womens-rights-in-macedonia/&lt;/ref&gt; The law, as well as the anti-abortion campaigns, have been criticized as stigmatizing women and being contrary to [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ippfen.org/news/new-abortion-law-macedonia-hurts-women-and-girls&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aetokremnos''' is a rock shelter near [[Limassol]] on the southern coast of [[Cyprus]]. It is situated on a steep cliff site c. {{convert|40|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} above the Mediterranean sea. The name means ''"Cliff of the eagles"'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Around {{convert|40|m2|sqft|2|abbr=on}} have been excavated and out of the four layers documented, the third is sterile.

The site contains mainly bones of the late [[Holocene]] [[Insular dwarfism|dwarf fauna]], such as [[Dwarf elephant|pygmy elephants]] (''Elephas cypriotes''), the [[Cyprus Dwarf Hippopotamus]] (''Hippopotamus minor'') and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (c. 1,000 flints including thumbnail [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s of the [[Mesolithic]] type). There are no bones that show marks of butchery, but an unusually high frequency (30%) of burned bones. The pygmy hippos make up c. 74% of the bones, followed by fish remains (25%) and birds, mainly [[bustard]]s. Dwarf elephants are comparatively rare (3 individuals). The presence of [[fallow deer]] (4 bones) and pig (13 bones) is puzzling, since these animals are thought to have been introduced only in the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|Neolithic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/7655638/akrotiri_aetokremnos_20_years_later |title=akrotiri aetokremnos 20 years later |publisher=Academia edu |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the excavators, [[hearth]] remains are found in the layer containing the bone beds of the extinct [[megafauna]]. This would make it the oldest site on the island and evidence of [[Epipaleolithic (Levant)|Epipalaeolithic]] occupation. The original 31 [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] put the date of the bones at c. 12,500 years BP. and suggest a short-term occupation. These dates have been challenged as the excavators considered the nine bone dates to be the least reliable and did not agree with the dates of the [[stratigraphy]] where they were found. As of 2013 there are now 36 radiocarbon dates of which 13 were taken from animal bones (pig and hippo). A 2013 report states that even discarding these and relying on the other 23 determinations on charcoal, sediment and shell "we reaffirm our original interpretation of a relatively short occupation of some 300 years centered around 11,775 years BP, with a range of 11,652 to 11,955 years BP at one standard deviation, or 11,504 to 12,096 years BP at two standard deviations. This is in general accord with Manning’s (2013:501 to 503) masterful compilation of all early Cypriot radiocarbon determinations, in which he places Aetokremnos within an approximate 12,950 to 10,950 years BP range while also preferring a somewhat longer occupation than we presented."&lt;ref name="Simmons"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simmons|first1=Alan H.|title=Akrotiri-Aetokremnos (Cyprus) 20 Years Later: An Assessment Of Its Significance|journal=Eurasian Prehistory|date=2013|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=139–156|url=https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/files/9_Simmons_start.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asor.org/pubs/books-monographs/swiny.pdf |title=THE FIRST HUMANS AND LAST PYGMY HIPPOPOTAMI OF CYPRUS |publisher=Asor.org |date= |author= |accessdate=January 4, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227080612/http://www.asor.org/pubs/books-monographs/swiny.pdf |archivedate=December 27, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other deposits with bones of pygmy elephants and hippopotami on the island, but these do not contain artifacts.

'''Banco Privado Português''' '''(BPP)''' was a private [[Portugal|Portuguese]] bank, based in [[Lisbon]].

Founded by João Rendeiro it's currently in [[liquidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/dossies/dossiest_economia/dossie_caso_banco_privado/bpp-joao-rendeiro-saldou-tres-milhoes-de-dividas-ao-fisco=f528749|title=BPP: João Rendeiro saldou três milhões de dívidas ao fisco|newspaper=[[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]]|date=31 July 2009|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MENSAGEM DA COMISSÃO LIQUIDATÁRIA|url=http://informa.bpp.pt/MensagemAdm.aspx|work=Liquidation Board|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2009, Paulo Guichard and Salvador Fezas Vital, two former [[Board of directors|board]] [[committee]] members of BPP were suspended by [[Banco de Portugal]], and joined João Rendeiro in the [[BPP case]], to be indicted for falsifying accounts, tax crimes and [[money laundering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/dossiers/economia/caso-bpp/noticias/interior/caso-bpp-constituidos-mais-dois-arguidos--1317030.html|title=Caso BPP: constituídos mais dois arguidos|publisher=[[Diário de Notícias]]|date=25 July 2009|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 2010, the [[Banco de Portugal]], Portugal central bank, "after verifying the impossibility of recapitalization and recovery efforts of this institution", ordered the [[liquidation]] of the Banco Privado Português.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeiou.expresso.pt/banco-de-portugal-decreta-fim-do-bpp=f576935 |author=Lima, Pedro |title=Banco de Portugal decreta fim do BPP |newspaper=[[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]] |date=16 April 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421011040/http://aeiou.expresso.pt/banco-de-portugal-decreta-fim-do-bpp%3Df576935 |archivedate=2010-04-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 2010, the [[Polícia Judiciária]] conducted searches at the homes of former officials of the BPP under the scope of an investigation into suspected money laundering and [[fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeiou.expresso.pt/bpp-buscas-na-casa-de-ex-administradores=f614691 |title=BPP: Buscas na casa de ex-administradores |newspaper=[[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]] |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=16 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115234823/http://aeiou.expresso.pt/bpp-buscas-na-casa-de-ex-administradores%3Df614691 |archivedate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CanalDigitaal logo.gif|thumb|CanalDigitaal previous logo]]
'''CanalDigitaal''' is a provider of digital television via satellite for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] market, using the [[SES Astra|Astra]] satellites at [[Astra 23.5°E|23.5° east]].

Initially customers were mainly Dutch citizens in the countryside who did not have cable access. But in the meantime the company also managed to expand into the cities. This is sometimes complicated in the Netherlands due to local [[building code]]s restricting the placement of [[satellite dish]]es.

CanalDigitaal is owned by the [[Luxembourg]] [[M7 Group S.A.]], also owner of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[TV Vlaanderen Digitaal]] and [[TéléSAT Numérique]], the [[Austria]]n [[Austriasat]], the [[Czech Republic|Czech]]/[[Slovakia|Slovak]] [[Skylink (TV platform)|Skylink]] and [[CS Link]].

==Smartcard==
Unlike many [[Germany|German]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] broadcasters, the Dutch [[Netherlands Public Broadcasting|public]] and commercial broadcasts are not freely available via satellite. To receive the Dutch broadcasts a [[smartcard]] is required to decrypt the [[Mediaguard]] signal. CanalDigitaal has recently switched from Mediaguard 2 to Mediaguard 3.

A standard [[DVB-S]] or [[DVB-S2]] receiver is used, which can also receive other [[free-to-air]] broadcasts.

==Fastscan channel list==
The CanalDigitaal Fastscan lists all channels carried on the CanalDigitaal platform and almost all [[free-to-air]] channels on the [[Astra 19.2°E|19.2° east]], [[Astra 23.5°E|23.5° east]] and [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2° east]] satellites. Many channels are free, others are available only with a subscription.

'''China – Iceland relations''' are foreign relations between [[China]] and [[Iceland]]. Diplomatic relations between them were established on December 8, 1971.  China has an embassy in [[Reykjavík]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign missions|url=http://www.mfa.is/diplomatic-missions/foreign-missions|publisher=Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland has an embassy in [[Beijing]] and an honorary counsulate in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Icelandic missions|url=http://www.mfa.is/diplomatic-missions/icelandic-missions|publisher=Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
In May 1972, China assigned the first resident ambassador to Iceland. In 1995, Iceland set up its embassy in Beijing and assigned its first resident ambassador to China. In December 1995, China resumed the practice of sending resident ambassadors to Iceland (between 1983 and 1995, the Chinese ambassador to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], was also accredited to Iceland).

In 2010, Enex, an Icelandic firm, signed an agreement on digging for geothermal energy in [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Shaanxi]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iceland banks on geothermal for economic expansion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/12/iceland-banks-geothermal-economic|website=The Guardian|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Chinese tycoon Huang Nubo offered to buy [[Grímsstaðir]] in North-East Iceland. The deal fell through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hands off our wilderness|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21530165|website=The economist|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Iceland signed a free trade agreement with China. This was the first Chinese free trade agreement with a European country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iceland Is First in Europe to Sign Free Trade Pact With China|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-15/iceland-is-first-in-europe-to-sign-free-trade-pact-with-china|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DirecTV''' (stylized as '''DIRECTV''') is an American [[direct broadcast satellite]] service provider based in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], [[California]] and is a subsidiary of [[AT&amp;T]]. Its satellite service, launched on June 17, 1994, transmits digital [[satellite television]] and audio to households in the [[United States]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]]/Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directvcaribbean.com/|title=DirecTV Caribbean|author=DTV Group|date=June 26, 2010|work=DirecTV|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DirecTV launches first satellite service to Caribbean|author=Staff writer|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/1997/01/13/daily20.html|publisher=[[South Florida Business Journal]]|date=January 17, 1997 |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary competitors are [[Dish Network]] and [[cable television]] providers. On July 24, 2015, after receiving approval from the [[United States Federal Communications Commission]] and [[United States Department of Justice]], AT&amp;T acquired DirecTV in a transaction valued at $67.1 billion.&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T, Inc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.att.com/story/att_completes_acquisition_of_directv.html|title=AT&amp;T Completes Acquisition of DirecTV|work=AT&amp;T, Inc.|date=July 24, 2015 |accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnmay19&gt;{{cite web|last=Stelter|first=Brian|title=AT&amp;T and DirecTV strike $49 billion deal|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/18/news/companies/att-directv/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|accessdate=May 19, 2014|work=CNN|date=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DirecTV provides television and audio services to subscribers through satellite transmissions. Services include the equivalent of many local television stations, broadcast television networks, subscription television services, satellite radio services, and private video services. Subscribers have access to hundreds of channels, so its competitors are cable television service and other satellite-based services.&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T, Inc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnmay19"/&gt;

Most subscribers use reception antennas which are much smaller than the first generation antennas, which were typically a few yards (meters) across. Advances in antenna technology, including [[fractal antennas]], have allowed a general reduction in antenna size across all industries and applications. Receiving equipment includes a satellite dish, an integrated receiver/decoder and a DirecTV access card, which is necessary to operate the receiver/decoder.&lt;ref name="doj20030220"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/tollesonPlea.htm |title=Smyrna Businessman Pleads Guilty in Satellite Piracy Case |last=Vines |first=James |date=February 20, 2003 |work=U.S. Department of Justice |accessdate=April 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305004041/http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/tollesonPlea.htm |archivedate=March 5, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers who purchase DirecTV subscribe to various packages of DirecTV programming for which the subscriber pays a monthly fee. Additional monthly fees may include a protection plan (which provides for repair or replacement of consumer-leased equipment from damages caused by lightning, power surges, floods, etc.), DVR, additional receivers, HD channels, and other premium channel packages. A subscriber also can order [[pay-per-view]] and [[video on demand]] events and movies. DirecTV contracts with and pays program providers such as cable networks, motion picture distributors, sports leagues, event promoters, and other programming rights holders, for the right to distribute their programming to its subscribers. All programming distributed by DirecTV is delivered to its broadcast centers in [[Castle Rock, Colorado]], and Los Angeles, where it is then digitized and compressed. The resulting signal is encrypted by DirecTV to prevent its unauthorized reception. DirecTV then transmits these signals to several satellites located in [[geostationary orbit]].&lt;ref name="doj20030220" /&gt;

As of Q1 2017, DirecTV U.S. had 21 million subscribers (26 million if combined with U-verse) and revenues of $12 billion.

In addition to serving residences, DirecTV offers service to bars, restaurants, hotels, dorms, and hospitals through their DirecTV for business service. The company also offered mobile service for cars, boats, and RVs (DirecTV Mobile) as well as aircraft (DirecTV Airborne) in cooperation with [[Connexion by Boeing]]. On November 30, 2016, [[DirecTV Now]], their internet [[Internet television|streaming TV]] service, was launched.&lt;ref name=DirectvNowHonolulu&gt;{{cite news | title = AT&amp;T says new streaming service will cost $35 a month | url = http://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/10/25/business/business-breaking/att-says-new-streaming-service-will-cost-35-a-month | agency = Associated Press | newspaper = [[Honolulu Star-Advertiser]] | date = October 25, 2016 | accessdate = October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, [[Howard Hughes]] created the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] (HHMI), to which he transferred full ownership of [[Hughes Aircraft]]. Ostensibly created as a non-profit medical research foundation, HHMI was accused of being used by Hughes as a tax shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/magazine/the-richest-foundation.html|title=The Richest Foundation|last=Brinkly|first=Joel|date=1986-03-30|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-02-03|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Hughes' death in 1976, HHMI was incorporated in 1977, and litigation ensued to determine whether it would be allowed to maintain its interest in Hughes Aircraft.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 1984, the court appointed a new board for HHMI, which proceeded to sell off Hughes Aircraft to [[General Motors]] on December 20, 1985, for an estimated $5.1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/23/business/gm-purchase-of-hughes.html|title=G.M. Purchase Of Hughes|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 December 1985|access-date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors then merged Hughes Aircraft with its subsidiary [[Delco Electronics]] to create Hughes Electronics Corporation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The new subsidiary was initially composed of four units: Delco Electronics Company, Hughes Aircraft Company, Hughes Space and Communications Company, and Hughes Network Systems.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[Hubbard Broadcasting|Stanley E. Hubbard]] founded [[United States Satellite Broadcasting]] (USSB) in 1981 and was a leading proponent for the development of direct-broadcast satellite service in the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} USSB was awarded five frequencies by the FCC, at the coveted 101-degree west satellite location.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Hughes Communications, Inc. was also awarded 27 frequencies at the same 101-degree location.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} After many years, the technology was developed to enable the building of very high-power satellites, and digital compression ([[MPEG-2]]) standards were developed that allowed multiple digital television channels to be sent through each satellite frequency.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Hughes attempted to create a joint venture with [[NBC]], [[News Corp.]], and [[Cablevision Systems|Cablevision]] in 1990, to launch the first high-power digital television service called [[American Sky Broadcasting|Sky Cable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-22/news/mn-1704_1_cable-operator |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Paul |last=Richter |title=New Satellite-to-Home TV Service Due in 1993 : Broadcasting: Four firms back -billion Sky Cable venture. The system could carry up to 108 channels |date=February 22, 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Failing to do so, the company instead created DirecTV as a separate division and secured an agreement with USSB to build and launch the first high-power direct-broadcast satellite system.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} DirecTV's name is a [[portmanteau]] of "direct" and "TV" (as in [[direct broadcast satellite]] [[television]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Hughes/DirecTV then turned to [[Thomson Consumer Electronics]] (under the RCA, GE, and ProScan brands) to develop the digital satellite system for the service that would be capable of receiving 175 channels on a small 18-inch dish.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} These dishes utilized a new generation of smaller, lighter receiver dishes based on military technology introduced by the [[Global Broadcast Service|Global Broadcast System]], which predated DirecTV's viability by almost ten years.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Hughes was awarded the contract to build and launch the new high-powered satellites, and USSB and DirecTV agreed that the new satellites would carry the two separate programming services: USSB and DirecTV.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The USSB and DirecTV programming services were launched on June 17, 1994.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] provided the hardware for DirecTV, Matrixx Marketing (part of [[Cincinnati Bell]]) provided customer care via the Matrixx Plus department, and DBS Systems created the billing software.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In December 1998, DirecTV acquired [[United States Satellite Broadcasting|USSB]] for $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion, and combined the two satellite services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/Hughes-buys-satellite-firm-for-1.3-billion/2100-1033_3-219066.html |title=Hughes buys satellite firm for $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion |publisher=CNET news |author=Cory Grice |date=December 14, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, DirecTV acquired [[PrimeStar]], a competitor in the satellite television industry, for $1.83&amp;nbsp;billion, dramatically increasing its share of the satellite television market in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/1999/01/17479 |title=DirecTV Buys PrimeStar |author=Joanna Glasner |newspaper=Wired |date=January 22, 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507080432/http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/1999/01/17479 |archivedate=May 7, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1996, Hughes purchased 70% of [[PanAmSat]] for $3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lander|first=Mark|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/20/business/hughes-deal-for-panamsat-is-reported-to-be-complete.html|title=Hughes Deal For Panamsat Is Reported To Be Complete|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, GM spun off Delco Electronics from Hughes and transferred it to [[Delphi Automotive Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/Delco_Electronics_Corporation |title=Delco Electronics Corporation |last=Bowman|first=Bill|publisher=GM Heritage Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, Hughes Aircraft was sold to [[Raytheon]] for $9.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-17/news/mn-19465_1_hughes-aircraft|last=Peltz|first=JamesPeltz|newspaper=L.A.

Direct satellite broadcaster were mandated in 1992 to set aside 4% of its channel space for noncommercial educational and informational programming. DirecTV selected [[C-SPAN]], [[EWTN]] and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] from its current channel lineup plus request additional proposals from other programmers. DirecTV had given [[PBS Kids]], PBS's original application, carriage that did not count against the set aside six weeks before the deadline. DirecTV selected an additional six channels; Clara+Vision, [[INSP (TV network)|Inspirational Life]], [[NASA TV]], [[PBS YOU]], StarNet and [[Link TV|WorldLink TV]], for the mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Behrens |first1=Steve|last2=Bedford |first2=Karen Everhart|title=DirecTV okays channels from PBS and ITVS|url=http://current.org/wp-content/uploads/archive-site/in/in923d.html|accessdate=February 21, 2017|work=Current|publisher=American University School of Communication|date=December 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2000, GM executives, under pressure from GM's shareholders as a result of its poor performance and the substantially greater market worth of Hughes, authorized Hughes executives to begin seeking buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/07/business/fi-16889/2|title=GM Revving Up the Bidding War for Hughes Sale|newspaper=L.A.

On April 9, 2003, News Corporation agreed to purchase a 34% controlling interest in Hughes, including GM's entire share of the company, for $6.6 billion, subject to SEC approval.&lt;ref name=newscorp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article1128673.ece|author=Nic Hopkins|title=News Corp buys control of DirecTV|newspaper=The Times|date=April 10, 2003|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the financing for the deal, [[Liberty Media]] agreed to take a $500-million option of stock in News Corporation that would be exercised upon the closing of the deal.

===Becoming a standalone entity===
In February 2004, Hughes announced its intent to focus solely on its satellite television operations and divest its other interests, renaming itself The DirecTV Group, Inc. on March 16, 2004 and changing its ticker symbol from "HS" to "DTV".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944868/000119312505038986/d10k.htm |title=2004 Form 10-K, The DirecTV Group |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |date=March 17, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April of that year, it sold its controlling interest in PanAmSat to a private consortium led by [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] for $3.53&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/21/business/fi-panamsat21 |title=DirecTV Agrees to Sale of PanAmSat Unit |newspaper=L.A. Times |date=April 24, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 2005, DirecTV spun off Hughes Network Systems into a separate entity and sold 50% of the new entity to [[SkyTerra]], acquiring $157.4&amp;nbsp;million in the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944868/000104746906003209/a2168249z10-k.htm |title=2005 Form 10-K, The DirecTV Group, Inc. |publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission |date=March 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2006, DirecTV sold its remaining 50% share in Hughes Network Systems to SkyTerra for $100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hughes.com/HNS%20Library%20Press%20Release/01-03-06_SkyTerra_acquires_remaining_interest_in_HNS_LLC_from_DirecTV.htm |title=SkyTerra Communications Acquires Remaining Interest in Hughes Network Systems LLC from The DirecTV Group |date=January 3, 2006 |publisher=SkyTerra Communications, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale effectively ended DirecTV's 20-year existence through Hughes Electronics as a technology conglomerate, leaving it solely with its satellite television services.

In 2004, DirecTV abandoned the Mexican market, though it maintained 41% ownership of [[SKY México]].&lt;ref name="DTV Q4/Y2006"&gt;{{cite web|title=The DIRECTV Group Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2006 Results |url=http://investor.directv.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=286317 |publisher=DirecTV |accessdate=2013-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2005, DirecTV stopped carrying [[Music Choice]] audio-only channels, replacing it with 73 channels of [[XM Satellite Radio]]. In 2007, DirecTV abandoned the Brazilian market, with the customers being migrated to the 74% DirecTV-owned Brazilian affiliate of [[SKY Brasil]].&lt;ref name="DTV Q4/Y2006"/&gt; In 2010, DirecTV increased its stake in Sky Brasil to 93%.

=== Expansion ===

On January 9, 2007, DirecTV announced they would introduce up to 100 national HD channels during 2007, all of which would be MPEG-4 encoded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2007/01/09/directv-to-carry-100-national-hd-channels-in-2007/|title=DirecTV to carry 100 National HD Channels in 2007 |publisher=Engadgethd.com |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 3, 2008, DirecTV announced that it would offer HD local channels in 121 markets by year end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPage.jsp?assetId=P4800002|title=DirecTV Locals|publisher=Directv.com|accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, News Corporation announced its intention to transfer its 38.5% controlling interest in The DirecTV Group, four regional [[Fox Sports Net]] stations and $550&amp;nbsp;million cash to Liberty Media in exchange for Liberty's 19% interest in News Corp., giving the Murdoch family tighter control of the latter firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-12-07-liberty-news_x.htm |title=Deal would give Liberty reins of DirecTV |author=David Lieberman |newspaper=USA Today |date=December 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal, valued at $11&amp;nbsp;billion, was approved by News Corp. shareholders in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/04/business/media/04liberty.html |title=News Corp.

On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the four FSN channels acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in [[Game Show Network]], into a separate company to be merged with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner [[John Malone]]'s stake in DirecTV to 24%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=auGzOOELO3.0|title=DirecTV Group to Combine With Liberty Entertainment|newspaper=Bloomberg News|author=Tim Mullaney and Kelly Riddell|date=May 4, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107022247/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=auGzOOELO3.0|archivedate=November 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.directv.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=425628|title=DirecTV Completes Merger Transaction with Liberty Media|publisher=DirecTV|date=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his [[preferred stock]] in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of [[common stock]], reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as Chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsatelliteservices.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 15, 2017 |title=New Satellite Services |publisher=DirecTV |date=June 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015204934/http://newsatelliteservices.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 9, 2010, DirecTV dropped [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM Radio]] and replaced the channel lineup with [[DMX (music)|Sonic Tap]] audio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Subsidiary of AT&amp;T (2015–present) ===
[[File:Full Directv logo.png|thumb|right|200px|DirecTV transitional logo following purchase by AT&amp;T]]
On May 18, 2014, [[AT&amp;T]] announced that it would purchase DirecTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-directv-att-20140430,0,802533.story|title=AT&amp;T interested in acquiring satellite broadcaster DirecTV |last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-atatdirectv"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/att-to-buy-directv-for-48-5-billion/|title=AT&amp;T to Buy DirecTV for $48.5 Billion|last=de la Merced|first=Michael|last2=Gelles|first2=David|work=The New York Times|date=May 18, 2014|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the deal, which had been approved by boards of both companies, DirecTV stockholders received $95 a share in cash and stock, valuing the deal at $48.5 billion. Including assumed debt, the total purchase price was about $67.1 billion.  The deal was aimed at increasing AT&amp;T's market share in the pay-TV sector; its existing [[AT&amp;T U-verse|U-verse]] brand had modest market share (5.7 million users compared to DirecTV's 20 million US customers as of 2014) and operates in only 22 states. It also gave AT&amp;T access to fast-growing Latin American markets, where DirecTV has 18 million subscribers.

The deal faced regulatory approval by the FCC, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], and some Latin American governments. It was expected to take about 12 months to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercecable.com/story/att-purchase-directv-49b-deal/2014-05-18|title=AT&amp;T to purchase DirecTV in $49B Deal|last=Marek|first=Sue|work=Fierce Cable|date=May 18, 2014 |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was also contingent on the combined company's ability to renew its exclusive rights to carry the [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] service beyond the [[2015 NFL season]] on "substantially the terms discussed between the parties."&lt;ref name="lat-sundayticket"&gt;{{cite web|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=DirecTV deal with AT&amp;T includes NFL Sunday Ticket exit clause |date=May 19, 2014|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-ct-directv-att-nfl-sunday-ticket-20140519-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition was officially approved by the FCC on July 24, 2015; it is subject to conditions for four years, requiring AT&amp;T to expand its fiberoptic broadband service to additional customers, public libraries, and schools, and to "refrain from imposing discriminatory usage-based allowances or other discriminatory retail terms and conditions on its broadband internet service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/att-directv-merger-fcc-approval-1201484821/|title=AT&amp;T &amp; DirecTV Merger Gets FCC Approval – With Conditions|website=Deadline.com|date=July 24, 2015 |accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/24/8876267/att-directv-merger-approved|title=FCC approves AT&amp;T–DirecTV merger|website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=July 24, 2015|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an analyst meeting in August 2015, AT&amp;T announced plans to converge DirecTV and its [[IPTV]]-based U-verse service around a common "home entertainment gateway" platform based upon DirecTV hardware, with "very thin hardware profiles". AT&amp;T Entertainment and Internet Services CEO John Stankey explained that the new platform would offer "single truck roll installation for multiple products, live local streaming, improved content portability, over-the-top integration for mobile broadband, and user interface re-engineering. All of these are steps that are planned to deliver that premium effortless entertainment experience anywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/ATT-Outlines-the-Changes-DirecTV-and-UVerse-Users-Will-See-134789 |title=AT&amp;T Outlines the Changes DirecTV (and U-Verse) Users Will See|last=Bode|first=Karl|work=DSL Reports|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercecable.com/story/att-stop-investing-u-verse-cpe-will-move-new-home-architecture-using-direct/2015-08-12|title=AT&amp;T to stop investing in U-verse CPE, will move to new in-home architecture using DirecTV system|last=Dano|first=Mike|work=FierceCable|date=August 12, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/att-put-genie-u-verse-s-bottle/393005|title=AT&amp;T to Put 'Genie' Into U-Verse's Bottle|last=Baumgartner|first=Jeff|work=MultiChannel News|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2015, AT&amp;T selected [[Ericsson]] to be hardware provider for the new platform, and hired former [[Sirius XM]], [[Cisco Systems]] and [[Microsoft]] executive VP Enrique Rodriguez to be vice president and CTO of the AT&amp;T Entertainment and Internet Services division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/att-enrique-rodriguez-cto-sirius-xm-cisco-directv-1201595226/|title=AT&amp;T Taps Former Sirius XM, Cisco Exec as Video and Internet CTO|last=Roettgers|first=Kano|work=Variety|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/people/enrique-rodriguez-lead-att-directv-integration-report/393832|title=Enrique Rodriguez to Lead AT&amp;T-DirecTV Integration |last=Baumgartner |first=Jeff|work=MultiChannel News|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2015, AT&amp;T announced plans to phase out the DirecTV brand as part of the introduction of the new platform, which will be marketed as AT&amp;T Entertainment. The company also adopted a new logo, replacing its previous emblem with that of AT&amp;T.&lt;ref name="Farrell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/distribution/att-enters-next-phase-directv-branding/395664|title=AT&amp;T Enters Next Phase in DirecTV Branding|last=Farrell|first=Mike|work=MultiChannel News|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercecable.com/story/att-begin-transitioning-away-directv-brand-starting-january/2015-12-02|title=AT&amp;T to begin transitioning away from DirecTV brand starting in January, report says|last=Frankel|first=Daniel|work=FierceCable|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/ATT-Plans-on-Killing-the-DirecTV-Name-Starting-in-January-135765|title=AT&amp;T Plans on Killing the DirecTV Name Starting in January|last=Bode|first=Karl|work=DSL Reports|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, ''Bloomberg'' reported that AT&amp;T was in the process of phasing out the U-verse IPTV service by encouraging new customers to purchase DirecTV satellite service instead, and by ending the production of new set-top boxes for the service. An AT&amp;T spokesperson denied that U-verse was being shut down, and explained that the company was "leading its video marketing approach with DirecTV" to "realize the many benefits" of the purchase, but would still recommend U-verse TV if it better-suited a customer's needs. AT&amp;T CFO John Stephens had also previously stated that DirecTV's larger subscriber base as a national service gave the service a higher degree of leverage in negotiating carriage deals, thus resulting in lower content costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-16/at-t-takes-u-turn-on-u-verse-as-it-pushes-users-toward-directv|title=AT&amp;T Takes U-Turn on U-Verse as It Pushes Users Toward DirecTV|last=Moritz|first=Scott|work=Bloomberg|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/distribution/att-stops-making-u-verse-tv-boxes-report/402596|title=AT&amp;T Stops Making U-verse TV Boxes: Report|last=Baumgarnter|first=Jeff|work=MultiChannel News|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercecable.com/story/att-reportedly-halts-u-verse-set-top-production-latest-directv-push/2016-02-16|title=AT&amp;T reportedly halts U-verse set-top production in latest DirecTV push|last=Frankel|first=Daniel|work=Fierce Cable|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DirecTV Now ===
{{Main|DirecTV Now}}
On March 1, 2016, AT&amp;T announced plans for several DirecTV-branded [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] services, including [[DirecTV Now]]—a contract-free over-the-top internet television service, DirecTV Mobile—a service which will offer "premium video and made for digital content" for phones, and DirecTV Preview, an ad-supported service featuring content from [[Audience Network]], Otter Media, and other partners.&lt;ref name="OTT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/att-take-directv-over-top/402950|title=AT&amp;T to Take DirecTV Over-The-Top|last=Baumgartner|first=Jeff|work=MultiChannel News|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OTT2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legitreviews.com/att-allows-directv-video-services-internet-connection_179547|title=AT&amp;T Allows DIRECTV Video Services Over a Your Internet Connection|last=Kirsch|first=Nathan|work=Legit Reviews|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OTT3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/att-directv-streaming-video-services-plans-1201712085/|title=AT&amp;T Unveils DirecTV Streaming Video Plans With TV And Short-Form Content|last=Lieberman|first=David|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DirecTV Now]] launched on November 30, 2016, and is directly competing against [[Sling TV]] and [[PlayStation Vue]]. AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson stated of the service that "there is a huge customer base out there that we are convinced, while they don't subscribe to a bundle of premium content today, at the right price point [delivered] over-the-top, they will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/blog/bauminator/directv-now-coming-november/408638|title=DirecTV Now Coming in November|last=Baumgartner|first=Jeff|work=MultiChannel News|date=October 25, 2016|accessdate=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/18/13676884/directv-now-launch-event-att-november-28th AT&amp;T will reveal everything about DirecTV Now on November 28th] ''The Verge'', November 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satellites==
{{main|DirecTV satellite fleet}}
{{Asof|2016|6}}, DirecTV manages a fleet of 13 satellites in [[geostationary orbit]] at positions ranging from [[95th meridian west|95°W]] to [[119th meridian west|119°W]], ensuring strong coverage of the North American continent.

==Receivers==
In the past, receivers were manufactured by DirecTV and other companies, including [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Philips]], [[Sony Electronics]], [[Panasonic]], [[Mitsubishi Electronics]], and [[Toshiba]]. Other companies' DirecTV receivers have been phased out and DirecTV now designs their own models with companies such as [[Pace Micro Technology]] of Britain, [[LG Electronics|LG]] of South Korea (which had manufactured boxes under the LG and [[Zenith Electronics]] names), and [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] of France (which had previously manufactured boxes under the RCA name, GE (under license), and the [[ProScan]] brand). DirecTV and [[TiVo]] announced on September 3, 2008, that they will work together to develop a version of the TiVo service for DirecTV's broadband-enabled HD DVR platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=DIRECTV|url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPage.jsp?assetId=P4900010|title=DirecTV and TiVo to Launch New HD DirecTV DVR with TiVo Service|date=September 3, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally scheduled to launch in the second half of 2009, it was expected to be available in spring 2010 but delayed again.&lt;ref name="tivoReinvent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/439948-Can_TiVo_Reinvent_Itself_.php|title=Can TiVo Reinvent Itself?|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=December 14, 2009|publisher=Multichannel News|accessdate=December 14, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615224505/http://www.multichannel.com/article/439948-Can_TiVo_Reinvent_Itself_.php|archivedate=June 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally released on December 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CNET|title=DirecTV TiVo DVRs coming to select markets this week?|author=Don Reisinger|date=December 6, 2011|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-57337590-17/directv-tivo-dvrs-coming-to-select-markets-this-week/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new unit, model THR22, is now available in select markets.&lt;ref name="2011-12-08-tivo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tivo.com/products/source/satellite/tivo-directv/ |title=DIRECTV TiVo – DIRECTV DVR with TiVo service – TiVo |publisher=TiVo |date=December 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125073343/http://www.tivo.com/products/source/satellite/tivo-directv/ |archivedate=January 25, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2011-12-08-directv"&gt;{{cite web|title=HD DVR – Tivo® for DIRECTV |url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/content/technology/tivo_receiver|publisher=DirecTV| date=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The THR22 DVR does not have all the features of the HR24 DVRs.&lt;ref name="THR22 vs HR24"&gt;{{cite web|title=THR22 DIRECTV HD TiVo DVR FAQ|url=http://www.weaknees.com/thr22-directv-hd-tivo-faq.php|publisher=weaKnees|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DirecTV typically uses a fixed {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[Parabolic antenna|dish antenna]] to receive its signals. Traditionally an 18×24-inch elliptical was used; however, most new installations use an 18×20-inch antenna to receive signals from three [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellite positions simultaneously. These systems are becoming more common as DirecTV attempts to squeeze more programming onto its growing systems. DTV is now installing a dish that has five [[low-noise block converter|LNBs]] for [[high-definition television|HDTV programming]] and local channels in selected markets. These systems receive signals from up to five separate satellites in both the {{Ku band}} and {{Ka band}}. After the new satellite, [[DirecTV satellite fleet#DirecTV-11|DirecTV 11]], is fully operational, DirecTV will stop supplying dual, triple, and five-LNB dishes to all customers and move to supplying a three-LNB Ka/Ku dish known as the Slimline3. This dish will see orbital locations 99, 101, and 103 degrees West. The Slimline3 will be the new standard install dish (for HD and SD programming), while the five-LNB Slimline will be used for installs in areas that receive local or international programming from orbital locations 110 or 119. The Slimline3 looks nearly identical to its predecessor, aside from a smaller LNB.

The new DirecTV HD channels require an H20/HR20 or H21/HR21/HR22/HR23/H24/HR24 [[set top box]] (STB). In order to receive the new HD channels (channels added after September 2007), all HD receivers except the HR23 must have a [[B band|B-Band]] converter installed. If the converter is not installed, viewers can only receive older HD channels (channels 70–99). The B-Band Converter (BBC) is also not required with the new Single Wire Multiswitch (SWM or SWiM) system, which preselects the satellite and transponder tuning and can feed up to 8 tuners via a single coaxial cable. The "HR" moniker designates the receiver as an [[High-definition television|HD]] [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) model.

Only the H20/HR20 support direct reception of [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] [[ATSC]] broadcasts. The H21/HR21/HR22/HR23/H24/HR24 receivers do not have a built-in ATSC tuner, but the AM21 external tuner is available. In addition, there is [[HDMI]] support for [[HDTV|HDTVs]] with an HDMI port. New STBs also support [[MPEG-4]] standard for HD *Programming. DirecTV also offers the AM21 (an ATSC add-on for the HR21), the HR21-Pro (an HD-DVR with 100 hours HD or 400 hours SD recording capacity), and an online DVR scheduler.
* ''DirecTV Receiver'' is a common standard-definition model. D12 was the last one produced, as this type of receiver is being slowly phased out, according to DirecTV's February 28, 2008 Investors Info.
* ''DirecTV HD Receiver'' (H10/H20/H21/H23/H24/H25) is a receiver which can receive an HD signal and broadcast in 1080i resolution. H25 is the latest version. After a 2009 software upgrade, the H2n series is capable of receiving 1080p resolution. The H2n series is also the only series capable of operating with the Whole-Home DVR.
* ''DirecTV Plus DVR'' (R15/R16/R22) is a standard receiver with a built-in digital video recorder. It contains a 160 GB (new models as of 2010 have a 360 GB) hard disk using the [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] 40-pin connection and can store up to 100 hours of programming. R16-300 is the last of these line of receivers; they are being slowly phased out, according to DirecTV's February 28, 2008 Investors Info. The R22 is a "watered down" HR21 as it can receive MPEG4 and has all the features of the HD DVR, including HD output. However, the unit is locked to output standard definition only. In 2010 the R22 is unlocked to output HD output.
* ''DirecTV Plus HD-DVR'' (HR20/HR21/HR22/HR23/HR24), the most advanced everyday-consumer receiver in the lineup, is capable of full 1080p high definition and combines both high-definition and DVR capabilities in one unit. It contains a 320&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive (500&amp;nbsp;GB on the HR22, HR23,and HR24) using the [[Serial ATA|SATA]] interface connection. The DirecTV Plus HD DVR also features Media Share, allowing users to view photos and listen to music stored on their computer (with compatible DLNA server software) on their TV, and Whole-Home DVR Service which allows them to watch any recorded program on any HD or HD-DVR receiver in the house. The HR24 is the latest, with the HR23 being its predecessor. The HR24 like the HR21, HR22, and HR23, lacks an ATSC tuner as the HR20s had, but does support the AM21 external tuner for over-the-air channels. The HR24 can be expanded to 2TB drive on the eSATA port for up to 480 hours of HD and 1,750 hours of SD recording.
* ''DirecTV Pro HD-DVR'' (HR21-Pro), the most advanced home theater receiver with HD and DVR in one unit, has a larger capacity hard drive, better cooling and is rack mountable. The DirecTV Pro HD DVR also features Media Share, allowing users to enjoy photos and music stored on their Intel Viiv processor technology-based PC on their TVs. HR24 is the latest (May 2010). Guide scrolling and channel surfing is much faster than previous models.
* ''The DirecTV "Genie" Home Media Center HD DVR'' (HR-34) the successor to the HR-24 features the ability to record 5 shows at once, allows for Picture in Picture, and has 1 TB of hard drive space allowing for 200 hours of high-definition recording or 800 hours of [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]] recording. A second-generation Genie, the HR44, is now available and the HR34 has been discontinued. A new generation Genie, the HR54, has been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.solidsignal.com/showthread.php/3860-Solid-Signal-goes-quot-Hands-On-quot-with-the-new-HR44-Genie-DVR |title=Solid Signal goes "Hands On" with the new HR44 Genie DVR - The Solid Signal Blog |publisher=Forums.solidsignal.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The DirecTV H44 "Genie Lite"'' was released to the public in July 2015. As delivered, it provides the Genie experience including controlling client boxes and standalone television. With the addition of a specific, DIRECTV-branded hard drive it converts into a five-tuner DVR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.solidsignal.com/showthread.php/7622-Solid-Signal-s-HANDS-ON-REVIEW-DIRECTV-H44-Genie-Lite-and-external-hard-drive |title=Solid Signal's HANDS ON REVIEW: DIRECTV H44 Genie Lite and external hard drive - The Solid Signal Blog |publisher=Forums.solidsignal.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''DirecTV Sat-Go'' ("Satellite-To-Go") is the world's first portable satellite TV system, conceived by producer [[Rick Rosner]].&lt;ref name="manly20078"&gt;Manly, Lorne (January 8, 2007).

It was discontinued in 2010.
* ''DirecTV DVR with TiVo Service'' (THR22) uses the same technology as the HR22 but has a TiVo user interface. The interface is currently the older SD one. This DVR does connect to the Internet, but only for TiVo program guide information. Currently, the THR22 cannot download program content via broadband.&lt;ref name="THR22 vs HR24"/&gt;

AT&amp;T's planned over-the-top service for DirecTV won't require a satellite dish or a receiver to receive DirecTV programming, but simply a high-speed internet connection. DirecTV Now will be available through [[digital media player]] devices such as [[Roku]], [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Chromecast]], and [[Apple TV]].&lt;ref name="OTT1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OTT2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OTT3" /&gt;

==Access card history==
DirecTV transmits programming with [[encryption]] to mitigate [[pirate decryption|signal piracy]]. The receiver (also known as an IRD, or "integrated receiver-decoder") utilizes [[ISO/IEC 7816]] [[smart card|smart cards]] which tell the receiver how to decrypt the programming for viewing. In a continuing effort to combat piracy, an access card generation is created approximately every two years, superseding the old set. DirecTV is now utilizing the fifth generation of access cards.
* P1, also known as F cards, were used until 1997. F cards have a picture of a satellite and the DSS logo on the front.
* P2, also known as H cards, were introduced in 1996 and eventually replaced F cards. H cards look the same as F cards. H cards were in use until 2002.
* P3, also known as HU cards, were introduced in 1999 and were used until April 2004. HU cards have a picture of a football player, a basketball, a clapperboard, and a film canister on the front. HU cards originally shipped with receivers with serial numbers above 0001 700 000. These were removed from circulation because piracy plagued the system.
* P4 cards were introduced in 2002 and are currently still in use. P4 cards are labeled "Access Card: 4."
* D1 cards were introduced in 2004 following compatibility problems with the P4 cards in some receivers. These cards can be identified by the silver edges, and simply bear the word "DirecTV" on the front (no number).
* D2/P12 cards were introduced in 2005. This is the current "standard issue" card. These cards can be identified by a two-toned blue dot pattern resembling the DirecTV logo in addition to the DirecTV logo and the words "DirecTV Access Card". This card has a picture of a satellite on the front. The period 12 card is the only card that will work with R15, H20, and HR20 series receivers.

DirecTV has battled with an active signal piracy underground for many years. One infamous event that temporarily hampered pirates was known as 'Black Sunday', which took place one week before Super Bowl Sunday in 2001. Hackers saw a string of software updates starting in late 2000 that seemed harmless, but included code that once complete searched for and destroyed 98% of hacked smart cards. Hacks continued after that event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/01/25/directv_attacks_hacked_smart_cards/|title=DirecTV attacks hacked smart cards|publisher=Theregister.co.uk|date=2001-01-25|accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/05/tarnovsky?currentPage=all |work=Wired|title=From the Eye of a Legal Storm, Murdoch's Satellite-TV Hacker Tells All|date=May 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Atwood |first=Jeff |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/revisiting-the-black-sunday-hack.html|title=Revisiting the Black Sunday Hack|publisher=Coding Horror|date=2008-05-31|accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like its competitors, DirecTV offers [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) and interactive services.

To handle the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive HDTV broadcasting, DirecTV rebroadcasts local HDTV stations using the [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] [[codec]] while employing a newer transmission protocol ([[DVB-S2]]) over the newer satellites. This allows DirecTV to squeeze much more HD programming over its satellite signal than was previously feasible using the older [[MPEG-2]] compression and [[Digital Satellite Service|DSS]] protocol it has been using. This technology will be gradually expanded to the existing satellites as customer equipment is replaced with new MPEG-4-capable receivers.

Receiving the channels encoded in MPEG-4 requires newer receivers, such as the H20 as well as the 5-LNB K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; dish. DirecTV has contracted with Britain's [[Pace Micro Technology]], Korea's [[LG Electronics]] and France's [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] to manufacture these new receivers. Pace manufactures the DirecTV Plus HD DVR (Model HR20-700, and HR21-700) and [[LG Electronics]] offers the Model H20-600 receiver, while Thomson provides the Model H20-100 and HR20-100 DVR receivers. DirecTV has admitted to software issues with some of the H20 receivers and HR20 DVRs, which have been plagued with random problems since they were released in mid-2006. DirecTV regularly released software updates for the HR20 receivers, in an effort to reduce issues to an acceptable level.

DirecTV has phased out its original [[TiVo]]-branded HD DVR, the HR10-250, which can only decode the older MPEG-2 signals. All DirecTV-delivered local HDTV stations (outside of the NYC and LA network stations) are encoded in MPEG-4. The HR10-250 cannot receive the MPEG-4 local HDTV stations in these markets but can still receive over-the-air [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] broadcasts in these markets. After a multi-year hiatus, TiVo and DirecTV are developing a new TiVo-enabled HD DVR that will be able to receive/decode DirecTV's current MPEG-4 satellite signals. Originally slated for release in the second half of 2009, it is now available in select markets.&lt;ref name="2011-12-08-tivo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2011-12-08-directv"/&gt;

==4K television==
In November 2014, DirecTV became the first television provider to begin offering [[4K resolution|4K]] [[ultra-high definition]] content. On launch, 4K content was limited to renting a small library of on-demand films, downloaded to the subscriber's Genie DVR (some 4K content can also be pre-loaded automatically to the set-top box via the Genie Recommends feature). The 4K service could also only be used on "DirecTV 4K Ready" televisions, which support [[RVU protocol]]; this was limited to selected [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] 4K televisions released in 2014.&lt;ref name="cnet-4kdirectv"&gt;{{cite web|title=DirecTV launches 4K exclusive to Samsung TVs|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/directv-launches-4k-exclusively-to-samsung-tvs/|website=CNET|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, DirecTV introduced 4K Genie Mini set-top boxes, which can be connected to any [[HDMI]] 2.0/[[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] 2.2-compliant devices to provide 4K video.&lt;ref name="techhive-directv4kgenie"&gt;{{cite web|title=DirecTV solves its 4K TV compatibility problem with new Genie Mini set-top boxes|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2973627/video-players/directv-solves-its-4k-tv-compatibility-problem-with-new-genie-mini-set-top-boxes.html|website=TechHive|publisher=IDG|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, DirecTV began live sports broadcasts in 4K to eligible subscribers, including coverage from the [[2016 Masters Tournament]],&lt;ref name="engadget-directv4k"&gt;{{cite web|title=DirecTV's first live 4K show is the Masters golf tournament|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/09/directv-first-live-4k-show/|website=Engadget|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="svg-masters4k"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Masters in 4K: DirecTV, CBS Sports Tee Up First Live 4K UHD Broadcast in U.S.|url=http://www.sportsvideo.org/2016/03/09/directv-tees-up-first-live-4k-production-at-the-masters/|website=Sports Video Group|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 ''[[MLB Network]] Showcase'' baseball games in the 2016 season (subject to local [[Major League Baseball blackout policy|blackout restrictions]]) beginning April 15, 2016,&lt;ref name="variety-4kmlbn"&gt;{{cite web|title=DirecTV to Carry MLB Network Games in 4K Ultra HD|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/directv-mlb-4k-ultra-hd-1201751249/|website=Variety|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame college football]] home games during the 2016 season.&lt;ref name="mcn-4knd"&gt;{{cite web|title=DirecTV To Offer Notre Dame Football Telecasts In 4K|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/directv-offer-notre-dame-football-telecasts-4k/407605|website=Multichannel News|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local channels==
DirecTV also offers local channels like [[MeTV]], [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]], [[Comet (TV network)|Comet]], [[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], [[MyNetworkTV]], [[Telemundo]], [[TV Azteca|Azteca]], [[Univision]], [[ION Television]] (in markets that carry that network), and some [[independent station|independent stations]] in markets covering over 99.2% of U.S. TV households.&lt;ref name="DTV Locals"&gt;{{cite web|title=HD Locals|url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/content/hd/hd_locals|publisher=DirecTV|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In markets that lack an OTA CW affiliate, DirecTV offers [[WDCW]] from Washington or [[KTLA]] from Los Angeles (both in standard definition, only). Because DirecTV does not carry local [[digital subchannel|digital subchannels]], however, broadcast networks such as [[MeTV]] and [[Antenna TV]] are not available on DirecTV in most markets.

Subscribers located where they cannot receive an adequate terrestrial television signal and/or live in a tiny market that only has a couple of stations can receive feeds from New York and Los Angeles for CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox, as well as a feed from the Washington, D.C. CW affiliate, though a waiver from the local affiliate stations may be required to allow this, approved at their discretion. National [[PBS Satellite Service|PBS]] and ION channels are also available.

In the largest markets, local channels are carried on the satellite at 101°W. In some smaller markets, the local channels are carried on a second satellite located at 119°W which requires a slightly larger dish with two or three [[Low-noise block converter|LNBs]] or the newer K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; 5-LNB dish. In a few smaller markets, local stations are located on a satellite at 72.5°W that requires a second dish to be installed.

In late 2005, DirecTV began providing local HDTV channels to the largest markets, requiring newer receivers with a larger dish capable of receiving signals from up to five satellites at once. The K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band signals on the newer K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; dish are received from 101°W, 110°W, and 119°W, while K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-band signals are from 99°W and 103°W.

Local television channels are transmitted over [[optical fiber]] links, [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band]] satellite uplink, [[microwave]], and conventional terrestrial transmission to [[Satellite truck|uplink centers]] located throughout the United States. DirecTV can provide true HD into hotels (Pro:Idiom). Cable companies have been able to provide true HD to hotels for over 2 years now with the installation of private video networks (FTTP to Coax conversion &amp; Pro:Idiom) or with HFC HD video distribution systems (Pro:Idiom).

==Programming==
{{See also|Audience Network}}
DirecTV's exclusive general entertainment channel [[Audience Network]] has dozens of original and acquired programs, most of them unedited and commercial-free. It had its own exclusive [[3DTV]] channel called [[n3D]] that launched in 2010 and shut down in 2012. DirecTV serves [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[JetBlue]], and [[United Airlines]].

DirecTV owns regional sports networks [[AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh]], [[AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest]], [[AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain]], and [[Root Sports Northwest]] (all under the umbrella of [[AT&amp;T Sports Networks]]). It also owns minority shares of [[Game Show Network]] and [[MLB Network]]. DirecTV is also the exclusive U.S. rights holder to the [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] sports package. It also exclusively carries the "DirecTV Experience", which includes bonus coverage of [[Men's major golf championships|men's major golf tournaments]] and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam tennis tournaments]], including live feeds not available on other networks such as [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[ESPN]], [[Golf Channel]] and [[Tennis Channel]] that cover the events. DirecTV was also the exclusive provider of defunct sports packages [[NASCAR Hot Pass]] and [[Mega March Madness]].

==Marketing==
Beginning in 2006, DirecTV began a series of [[commercials]] in which characters from popular movies and television shows [[break the fourth wall]] to tout the service's picture quality and the number of channels available in high definition. Instead of using [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] the original actors normally reprise their roles on recreated sets, and resulting footage is mixed with the original scenes. The productions are recent and appeal to DirecTV's "male-oriented marketing message."&lt;ref name="farhi"&gt;Farhi, Paul. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/06/AR2007080601540.html Scene 1, Double Take 2]" ''The Washington Post'', August 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These characters include [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]], ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''), Bill Harding ([[Bill Paxton]], ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''), The Economics Teacher ([[Ben Stein]], ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''), [[Dr. Emmett Brown]] ([[Christopher Lloyd]], ''[[Back to the Future]]''), [[Burton Guster]] ([[Dulé Hill]], ''[[Psych]]''), [[C.J. Parker]] ([[Pamela Anderson]], ''[[Baywatch]]''), Rick "Wild Thing" Vaughn ([[Charlie Sheen]], ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]''), [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]] ([[Upgrade U]] music video), Nadia ([[Shannon Elizabeth]], ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''), [[Turtle (Entourage)|Turtle]] ([[Jerry Ferrara]], ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''), [[Ellen Ripley]] ([[Sigourney Weaver]], ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''), Steve Freeling ([[Craig T. Nelson]], ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]''), [[Annie Wilkes]] ([[Kathy Bates]], ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]''), [[Mini-Me]] ([[Verne Troyer]], ''[[Austin Powers In Goldmember]]''), The Girl in the Ferrari ([[Christie Brinkley]], ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]''), [[Daisy Duke]] ([[Jessica Simpson]], ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]''), [[T-1000]] ([[Robert Patrick]], ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''), Ann Darrow ([[Naomi Watts]], ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]''), [[Hellboy]] ([[Ron Perlman]], ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]''), Richard Hayden ([[David Spade]], ''[[Tommy Boy (film)|Tommy Boy]]''), [[The Black Eyed Peas]] ([[Meet Me Halfway]] music video), [[Christina Aguilera]] ([[Keeps Gettin' Better]] music video) and Honey Hornee ([[Kim Basinger]], ''[[Wayne's World 2]]''). Also in this series of commercials were [[Peyton Manning]], [[Eli Manning]], and [[Archie Manning]] promoting [[NFL Sunday Ticket]], and [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] promoting [[NASCAR Hot Pass]]. Cartoon characters have also been used in the ads, beginning with [[Scooby-Doo]] and the Mystery, Inc. gang. Recent commercials have also featured model [[Hannah Davis (model)|Hannah Davis]] and a "talking" horse.

DirecTV during that time also ran series of ads that take shots at cable television's service (or lack of service). Beginning in March 2010, they did a spoof of the classic game show ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' with [[Alex Trebek]] hosting the show. The series of commercials both pays homage to the [[Goodson-Todman]] game show, and take shots at both cable and DirecTV's archrival [[Dish Network]], who later sued for [[false advertising]]. Another series of commercials, promoting the 2010 NFL Sunday Ticket package of all-football programming, featured neighbors committing uncivil acts to neighbors who watched the "wrong" football team. One spot had a woman leaving a snack platter for a neighbor on which the food spelled out "DIRT BAG"; another showed a dog trashing a neighbor's property; yet another showed an on-duty policeman knocking on a DirecTV customer's door, stunning him with a taser and leaving him passed out in his open doorway. In August 2011, [[Deion Sanders]] began appearing in DirecTV's ads for NFL Sunday Ticket, urging people to switch from cable. These ads originally claimed NFL Sunday Ticket is now "free" for new customers for one year with a subscription to their Premiere package and a two-year contract. In response, on August 4, 2011, [[Comcast]] sued DirecTV for false advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/472011-Comcast_Looks_To_Sack_DirecTV_s_Sunday_Ticket_Campaign.php Comcast Looks To Sack DirecTV's Sunday Ticket Campaign] ''Multichannel News'' August 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast dropped the case on August 19, 2011, after DirecTV altered the ads to remove the word "free", changing it to "at no extra charge".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120621201232/http://www.multichannel.com/article/472609-Comcast_Drops_Suit_Against_DirecTV_Over_NFL_Sunday_Ticket_Ads.php Comcast Drops Suit Against DirecTV Over NFL Sunday Ticket Ads] ''Multichannel News'' August 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===DirecTV blimp===
[[File:DirecTV Blimp over Las Vegas.jpg|thumb|DirecTV Blimp flying over West Las Vegas during the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] 2015.]]
The DirecTV blimp named "lefty" was launched in October 2007 at the [[MLB]] [[World Series]] in [[Boston]] and has been seen all over the [[United States]] since its inception. The blimp flies mainly over live sporting events but has also been seen at other entertainment and charitable venues. This second generation A-170LS Video Lightsign Lightship features the state of the art video screen that displays full-color video images day or night. This lightsign, the only one of its kind in the world, is used to display messaging and [[advertising]] for DirecTV. The blimp has been recently spotted on [[Twitter]] as followers track the journeys of the blimp from one event to another. The [[airship]] is owned and operated by [[The Lightship Group]], an advertising company based in [[Orlando, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightships.com/tlgdirectv.php|title=Client Highlights &gt;&gt; DirecTV|publisher=Lightships|accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DirecTV was awarded a J.D. Power award for residential cable and satellite TV customer satisfaction in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cable360.net/voice/DirecTV-Sweeps-J-D-Power-Survey_25138.html DirecTV Sweeps J.D.

DirecTV's customer service is provided by many third-party owned call centers both inside and outside the United States. Most of the call centers are contracted to provide agents to answer customer phone calls regarding programming, billing, or technical questions.

{{As of|2012|November}}, DirecTV does not offer a 30-day grace period for those who wish to try the service. "If you do not fulfill your Programming Agreements, DirecTV may charge a pro-rated fee of up to $480."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPage.jsp?assetId=1100106 Agreements] DirecTV official site accessed November 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Better Business Bureau review===
In August 2008, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that DirecTV received 20,000 complaints in less than three years to the [[Better Business Bureau]] on DirecTV slipping in cancellation fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/08/31/directv_says_its_cancellation_fee_is_fair_since_installation_is_free/ DirecTV says its cancellation fee is fair since installation is free] ''The Boston Globe'' August 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the BBB reported that it had received 39,000 complaints against DirecTV in the previous 3 years, and the BBB gave it an F (failing) grade. Many of the complaints concerned DirecTV's early termination fees, billing and service issues.&lt;ref name="DirecTV Customer Service: Fail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/us/post/directv-customer-service-fail-5588 |accessdate=2013-03-20 |title=DirecTV Customer Service: Fail |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425234855/http://www.bbb.org/us/post/directv-customer-service-fail-5588 |archivedate=April 25, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer protection lawsuits and violations==

===Washington State's Attorney General civil complaint===
On December 14, 2009, the Washington Attorney General's office filed a civil complaint against DirecTV seeking injunctive and other relief. The complaint was filed in the public interest when the Attorney General's office determined after a one-year investigation by its Consumer Protection Division, that the company allegedly engaged in numerous repeated violations of the state’s Consumer Protection Act.

The complaint alleged unfair or deceptive practices which include, but are not limited to:
* Unclear disclosures concerning rebate terms and conditions
* Unclear and/or unfair advertising for use of the term “free”;
* Automatically extending contracts when customers require equipment repairs, upgrade equipment or move;
* Failing to disclose financial terms and conditions that the company’s least expensive package of $29.99 per month is only available to customers who meet certain financing conditions and agree to have the costs automatically charged or debited.
* The suit also alleged that some cancellation fees assessed by the company were considered to be unfair, and
* That the company unfairly retained consumer deposits made to obtain services. Those who cancel service prior to the end of their contract lose part of the deposit and may also be charged cancellation fees.

The Attorney General’s Office asked the court to compel DirecTV to change its business practices, impose civil penalties and provide restitution for consumers.

The case was settled in December 2010, with DirecTV agreeing to pay over $1 million, and to correct many of its business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atg.wa.gov/pressrelease.aspx?id=26982|title=Washington Attorney General's 1 million DIRECTV settlement sends clear signal|publisher=Atg.wa.gov|date=December 14, 2010|accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 47 other states joined in a similar suit, the settlement of which required the company to pay over $13 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/state-attorneys-general-accept-13-million-directv-settlement State Attorneys General Accept $13 Million DIRECTV Settlement | Heartlander Magazine]. News.heartland.org. Retrieved on 2013-12-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===California class action lawsuit===
In September 2008, consumers filed a class action lawsuit with the Los Angeles Superior Court to stop DirecTV's practice of charging early cancellation penalties to subscribers. The lawsuit claims that DirecTV fails to disclose the penalty to new customers or to existing customers who replace their equipment or add a new receiver and that these practices are unlawful. In September 2009, a motion for a preliminary injunction was filed to block the company from automatically removing the fees from customers’ bank accounts or charging their credit card accounts without their prior knowledge and written consent until the lawsuit is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DirecTV Takes Disputed Fees Out of Customer Accounts, Suit Charges |url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2009/09/directv_fees.html|accessdate=August 3, 2010|newspaper=Consumer Affairs|date=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telemarketing violations===
In December 2005, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission imposed a $5.3&amp;nbsp;million penalty on DirecTV for its violations of federal telemarketing regulations. It was the largest civil penalty the FTC had ever announced in a case enforcing any consumer protection law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/12/directv.shtm |title=DirecTV to Pay $5.3 Million Penalty for Do Not Call Violations |publisher=Ftc.gov |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2012-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926054313/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/12/directv.shtm |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deceptive advertising===
On March 11, 2015, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed a lawsuit against DirecTV for deceptive advertising. The FTC claims the following:
* DirecTV failed to properly disclose important terms of its TV packages.
* DirecTV typically advertised 12-month deals without noting that:
** A two-year contract is required, 
** Package prices rise substantially during the second year, and 
** Early cancellation fees may be imposed.
* DirecTV failed to mention that offers of free premium channels, such as [[HBO]], would result in charges if the channels were not canceled before the free period ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/11/8191179/directv-deceptive-advertising-charges-ftc|title=FTC alleges DirecTV deceptively advertised TV packages|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=March 11, 2015|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main ingredients are lamb offals (liver, lungs, spleen, heart, kidney), green onions, herbs (dill, parsley, garlic, lovage), eggs (boiled or fresh), and bread soaked in water or milk. The boiled offals are chopped and mixed with all the other ingredients and seasoned with salt and pepper. The [[Caul fat|caul]] of the lamb is stretched over a loaf pan and filled with the mixture.

Lamb drob is one of the most popular traditional dishes, so there are a number of variations of the recipe. One of these is the use of a sheet of dough instead of the caul. Usually, boiled eggs are placed in the middle of the loaf.

In the world there are a few dishes similar to lamb drob, yet the best known is the Scottish haggis. One of the main differences between these foods is that haggis is boiled in the stomach of the sheep and doesn't contain a large amount of herbs like the Romanian one.

'''Espetada''' (also known as '''espetinho''', especially in [[Brazilian Portuguese]]) is the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term used for the technique of cooking food on [[skewers]], and for the [[dish (food)|dishes]] prepared that way. Espetada is a traditional dish in [[Portuguese cuisine]].

In Portugal, espetadas can be prepared with different types of meat, as well as squid or fish, with [[monkfish]] being commonly used. The most common are beef or pork, or a mixture of the two. More recently, turkey or chicken is used. Often pieces of bell pepper, onion, and chorizo are placed between the meat pieces. Espatada is usually accompanied by white rice or potatoes, and salad.

In [[Madeira]], beef on [[bay laurel]] skewers is a typical dish, with origins in the Strait of Câmara de Lobos. The meat, after being cut into cubes and before being grilled, is seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and bay leaf. It is then cooked over hot coals or wood chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

The dish can be served on a skewer which hangs from a hook on a stand for presentation.

The '''Federation of Korean Trade Unions''' (FKTU) was formed in 1960, after a [[coup d'état|military coup]] and the dissolution of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions and its affiliates. The FKTU was placed under the guidance of the military authorities.

The FKTU was the sole legal trade union center in South Korea until the [[Korean Confederation of Trade Unions]] was finally recognized, in November 1999.

The FKTU is affiliated with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] and, in 2007, had 740,308 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koilaf.org/KFeng/engStatistics/bbs_read_dis.php?board_no=137&amp;page=2&amp;keyField=&amp;keyWord= Unionization rate in 2007 stands at 10.8 percent first upward move in 18 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722025436/http://www.koilaf.org/KFeng/engStatistics/bbs_read_dis.php?board_no=137&amp;page=2&amp;keyField=&amp;keyWord= |date=2011-07-22 }} ''Korea International Labour Foundation'', 19 September 2008.

An '''Imperial and Royal Warrant of Appointment''' during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was issued to vendors who supplied goods or services to the Austrian imperial court in [[Vienna]] and/or the Hungarian royal court in [[Budapest]]. The warrant was normally an official document, which enabled the supplier to advertise the fact and thus lend itself prestige. 

Suppliers continued to charge for their goods and services. The application process took years and was given only to those deemed of the highest quality to be worth to receive the honour upon personal approval of the monarch. The warrant was typically advertised on company letter-heads and products by displaying the [[coat of arms]] or the [[heraldic badge]] of the imperial eagle. Underneath the coat of arms would usually appear the phrase "''k.u.k. Hoflieferant''", which translates into English as "'''Purveyor to the Imperial and Royal Court'''". Depending on where the supplier was located within the dual monarchy, it could be adapted into the local language such as "''Ces. i Król. dostawca Dworu''" in Polish, "''C. a k. dvorní dodavatel''" in Czech, or "''Fornitore di corte imperiale e reale''" in Italian.

The warrant was initially given to the owners of a company or a tradeperson, not the company itself. Only later were entire companies given the warrant. 

The warrant was given as a supplier for the overall court. However personal suppliers to the emperor or the empress were given a higher warrant as "''k.u.k. Kammerlieferant''", which translates as "Purveyor to the Imperial and Royal Chamber". It was possible for a supplier to receive both warrant forms for exceptional quality of services and goods. 

== Warrant holders ==
Some warrant holders were from abroad. Companies in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States received the honour including [[Nathaniel Wheeler]] for his sewing machines, [[Charles Lewis Tiffany]], [[William Steinway]] and [[Steinway &amp; Sons]], [[Royal Worcester]], [[Pim Brothers &amp; Co.]] in Dublin, [[Peek Freans]], [[Liverpool Vienna Bakery Kirkland Brothers]], [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]], [[Thomas Hine &amp; Co.]], [[Hancocks &amp; Co]] in London, [[Hammond &amp; Co.]], and [[Elkington &amp; Co.]].

'''Komvux''' (short for ''KOMmunal VUXenutbildning'', literally "municipal adult education") is a form of [[secondary education]] for adults in [[Sweden]]. The government of Sweden allocates funds to the municipalities for this type of education. It is primarily intended for adults who did not finish primary or secondary school, or who did not achieve the grades needed for higher education. 

This form of education has existed since 1968, although the forms for it have changed and some municipalities no longer use the term "Komvux". Courses offered include both theoretical school subjects such as languages and mathematics, and courses directed towards a profession, such as administration or business economics.

Other government funded adult education in Sweden includes ''Särvux'' (adult education for persons with special needs), ''[[Education_in_Sweden#Tertiary_education|KY]]'' (Qualified Vocational Education), and [[Swedish_for_immigrants|''SFI'' (Swedish for immigrants)]]; in smaller municipalities these forms of adult education are often coordinated by the same education centre.

'''Kongolo''' (or '''Nkongolo''') was a leader of [[Luba people]] in the region of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], and the first king of the [[Luba Empire]]. He built his capital in Mwibele, near [[Lake Boya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQNtgjs8WVQC&amp;pg=PA81

 |publisher=KARTHALA Editions |year=2002 |ISBN=2-84586-233-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kongolo Mwamba was trying to extend his kingdom in conquering the Songye neighbouring chiefdoms.

He met a prince of the [[Kunda people]] on behalf of [[Ilunga Mbidi]] through its sisters who had met at the lake; Mbidi, being a late military strategist, helped Kongolo expand his Kingdom. The popularity and the growing power of Mbidi Ilunga overshadowed that of Kongolo, who was advised by his entourage to organize a conspiracy to eliminate Mbidi. With the help of his wives, Ilunga Mbidi absconded by leaving women and children while returning to Kunda.

A son of [[Ilunga Mbidi]] and nephew of Kongolo, [[Kalala Ilunga]], took the place of his father as one of the generals among the warring forces. He also became very powerful, which overshadowed Kongolo. Kongolo tried several times to remove his nephew but failed. At the last attempt, Kalala Ilunga decided to end it, and defeated and killed Kongolo after a victory on the battlefield. After severing the head and genitals of Kongolo, he was proclaimed Emperor, or ''Mulopwe''.

'''''The Company of the Gallows''''' (original title: '''''La Compagnia della Forca''''') is an Italian [[comic book]] series written and drawn by [[Roberto Raviola|Magnus]] from 1977 to 1979 (with the collaboration of [[Giovanni Romanini]]).

== Characters ==

The Company of Monblanc (this is the real name of the company) is a seedy company of mercenaries led by Sir Percy of Montblanc, bumbling knight and young heir of Montblanc family. Other company members are:
* Capitan Golia, magister militum, warrior
* Annalisa of Montblanc, sister of Percy (and more skillful than him), archer
* Bertrando, minstrel and slinger (physically resembling Romanini)
* Messer Ciacco, sutler (and former executioner)
* Ser Crumb, squire of Sir Percy (with a physical resemblance with [[Magnus]])
* Crusca, scullery-boy
The group is joined in some adventures by Doctor Nadir, a scholar of oriental sciences, with his friend King Frog (a frog), and Lattemiele, a cunning accountant.

Oscuro Signore ("Dark Lord"), driven by a prophecy, is trying to destroy the company using his minions. Among them, Crocca, a female vulture which starts the series telling company's story and the defeat of Evil.

Among the characters there are sages, corrupt monks, genies, dragons, dwarves, giants, fantasy and historical characters (York and Lancaster from the [[War of the Roses]], [[Vlad the Impaler|Dracula]]).

== Themes ==
The story is an epic quest without its basic elements: the group, the aim, the battles, a clear separation between the good and the evil, a strong [[protagonist]] who decides what to do.

The style of Magnus pencils often retains funny and grotesque elements shown in ''[[Alan Ford (comics)|Alan Ford]]''.

The text, instead, is a mixture of sarcastic [[Max Bunker]]'s style, [[Tolkien]] fantasy elements, medieval history, classical Northern European and Middle Eastern traditions and lore, and personal travels (for example, Magnus' travel to [[Croatia]]).

'''Latvijas Radio''' ('''LR''') is [[Latvia]]'s national [[public service broadcaster|public-service]] [[radio broadcasting]] network. It began broadcasting on 1 November 1925, and has its headquarters in the Latvian capital, [[Riga]]. Latvijas Radio broadcasts six different channels in the [[FM band]] as well as via the internet: [[Latvijas Radio 1]], [[Latvijas Radio 2]], Latvijas Radio 3 Klasika, Latvijas Radio 4 Doma laukums, [[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Radio 5 Pieci.lv]], and Latvijas Radio 6 – Radio NABA.

Latvijas Radio is a national cultural institution, fostering [[radio drama]], and organizing a radio [[choir]] as well as children's vocal groups. The organization's [[phonograph]]ic archives contain approximately 200,000 [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]]. Latvijas Radio became a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) on 1 January 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latvijasradio.lv/Lapas/LV_ParMums.htm |title=Latvijas Radio misija |language=Latvian |publisher=latvijasradio.lv |accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013 it has collaborated with [[Latvijas Televīzija]] (Latvian Television) as part of the [[Latvijas Sabiedriskais medijs|Latvijas Sabiedriskie Mediji]] (Public Broadcasting of Latvia) news platform and online streaming service. 

Latvijas Radio (as ''Radio Riga'') also broadcast programming in Swedish from 1960 to 1995.

== Radio stations ==
=== Latvijas Radio 1 (LR1) ===
{{main|Latvijas Radio 1}}
LR1 is Latvia's main national radio station, presenting news, talk, current affairs programmes and analysis of economics, Latvian politics and culture, as well as programmes for children. The station's first broadcast was made on 1 November 1925.

Slogan: ''Latvijas radio 1 – vienmēr pirmais'' ("Always first").

=== Latvijas Radio 2 (LR2)===
{{main|Latvijas Radio 2}}
LR2, originally conceived as a youth station, today specializes in the broadcasting of [[Latvian-language]] pop and country music.

Slogan: ''Dziesmas dzimtajā valodā'' ("Songs in our native language").

=== Latvijas Radio 3 – Klasika (LR3)===
LR3 is the only station in Latvia broadcasting classical music and [[jazz]]. Latvijas Radio's membership of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) means that the station's output includes relays of international concerts and other [[live broadcast]]s.

Slogan: ''Mode mainās – klasika paliek'' ("Fashions change – the classics remain").

=== Latvijas Radio 4 – Doma laukums (LR4)===
LR4 broadcasts in [[minority languages]], chiefly in Russian, with programmes serving Latvia's Russian-speaking community.

Slogan: ''Jūsu telpa, jūsu laiks'' ("Your space, your time").

=== Latvijas Radio 5 – Pieci.lv (LR5)===
{{main|Latvijas Radio 5}}
LR5 is Latvijas Radio's newest station, playing youth-oriented music from Latvia and other countries. “Pieci” in Latvian means “Five” and “Pieci.lv” could be translated as “Five.lv”

=== Latvijas Radio 6 – Radio NABA (LR6)===
Free-format radio produced in association with the [[University of Latvia]]. At first, Radio NABA was a radio station produced by University of Latvia with help from Latvijas Radio (until March 2014. - the fifth channel on Latvijas Radio). When Pieci.lv formed in 2014, some programmes from Radio NABA continued to broadcast on Pieci.lv, but from February 2015 Radio NABA continued as a full time radio station as Latvijas Radio sixth channel.

'''NLUUG''' (formerly known as The Netherlands Local Unix User Group) is an association of professional [[Unix|UNIX]] / [[Linux]] users in the [[Netherlands]]. The group aims to increase and extend the awareness and use of Open Standards (including UNIX) and similar [[open system (computing)|open system]]s and Open Source.

The NLUUG also maintains one of the larger FTP mirrors in the world, and is the prime FTP site for several packages including [[Vim (text editor)|VIM]].

==Activities==
Typically, the NLUUG organises two large conferences every year. Topics over the last years include:
* IP Communication
* Languages and Tools
* E-mail and Beyond
* Visualization in Software Engineering
* Open Source in Business
* Security
* Web Applications
* Extreme UNIX

==History==
The NLUUG was founded in 1983, but the initial members were active together a long time before that. 

The NLUUG founded the first Internet provider in the Netherlands, [[NLnet]]. NLnet at the time only was serving businesses, which is why [[XS4All]] usually claims to be the first Internet provider (for consumers).

Other claims to fame are the founding of the SANE Conferences organization and the fact that the NLUUG was the first organisation to have [[Linus Torvalds]] be a speaker on a conference outside Finland.&lt;ref&gt;in Ede, the Netherlands, November 5, 1993. See Chapter XI of: {{cite book | last = Torvalds | first = Linus |author2=David Diamond  | title = [[Just for Fun (book)|Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary]] | publisher = [[HarperCollins]] | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-06-662073-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NLUUG Awards==
The NLUUG sometime gives awards to people who have been helping the cause of Open Systems and Open Standards. Over the years, awards have been given to amongst others [[Piet Beertema]], [[Guido van Rossum]], [[Wietse Venema]], [[Bram Moolenaar]], [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum|Andy Tanenbaum]] and Wytze van der Raay and Teus Hagen.

'''NTV''' is a [[Bengali language]] satellite television channel based in [[Bangladesh]]. It started operation in 2003. It is one of the most popular Bengali TV channels in the country. In the anniversary of the channel, the founder expressed interest in creating NTV2 to satisfy the watchers further. The channel broadcasts coverage of news, soap operas, educational, religious and politics related programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediabangladesh.net/television_bangladesh.php?recordID=7&lt;/ref&gt; NTV is owned by [[Mosaddek Ali Falu]], a businessman. He was leader &amp; vice president of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Under-fire Narayanganj MP Salim Osman, in leaked phone call, abuses journalist|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2016/05/19/under-fire-narayanganj-mp-salim-osman-in-leaked-phone-call-abuses-journalist|accessdate=19 May 2016|publisher=BDNews24.com|date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned from his post on 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/08/06/former-khaleda-aide-mosaddek-ali-falu-resigns-as-bnp-vice-chairman bdnews24.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
* August 2006: a UK-based Bangladeshi TV channel, acquired the rights to show NTV programmes throughout the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Europe]] on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] channel 826, however stopped broadcasting a year later.
* 26 February 2007: NTV, along with its sister station [[RTV (Bangladesh)|RTV]], was temporarily forced off the air due to a massive fire at the station building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_34332.shtml|title=ITTEFAQ.COM|work=ittefaq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three people died and over 100 were injured in the blaze. The fire caused NTV to broadcast reruns of programming. Since NTV was not able to broadcast their own news, they worked with [[Banglavision]] to broadcast Banglavision news on the NTV channel.
* In August 2008 NTV started to broadcast again in the UK after 1 year off the air, on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] channel 834.
* In September 2011, NTV achieved the ISO certificate, as a first Bangladeshi TV channel.&lt;ref name=iso&gt;{{cite news|title=NTV receives ISO certificate|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=201664|accessdate=21 September 2011|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 14 April 2012: NTV was replaced by [[Channel 9 Bangladesh|Channel 9 UK]] on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] channel 834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media247.co.uk/bizasia/channel-9-takesover-ntv-on-sky-digital-epg|title=Channel 9 takesover NTV on Sky Digital EPG|publisher=BizAsia|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=17 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420042314/http://www.media247.co.uk/bizasia/channel-9-takesover-ntv-on-sky-digital-epg|archivedate=20 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 30 April 2012: A new consortium took control of NTV in the UK and resumed broadcasting on Sky channel 852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media247.co.uk/bizasia/ntv-relaunches-on-sky-digital-epg|title=NTV relaunches on Sky Digital EPG|publisher=BizAsia|date=30 April 2012|accessdate=1 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503083754/http://www.media247.co.uk/bizasia/ntv-relaunches-on-sky-digital-epg|archivedate=3 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 19 August 2014: As part of a reshuffle, NTV moved to Sky channel 838.

==NTV online==
Recently NTV authority has taken an initiative to promote its website. As a result, NTV online has been started its journey more elaborately to keep people updated about latest news, entertainment program, sports, tech, travel, automobile, lifestyle, education and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvbd.com/|title=NTV: Latest Bangla News, Infotainment, Online &amp; Live Tv|work=NTV Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Mount Hope III''' was a [[top secret]] [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] American military operation to capture a crashed Soviet-made [[Mil Mi-25]] "Hind-D" [[attack helicopter]], an export model of the Soviet Mi-24. The aircraft had crashed and been abandoned in the [[Chadian–Libyan conflict|conflict between Libya and Chad]]. In 1988 two U.S. [[MH-47]] Chinooks of the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]] flew almost {{convert|500|mi|km|}} at night to the site and retrieved the helicopter without being detected. The mission was conducted entirely within Chad, with the approval of the government of Chad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Night Stalkers | author=[[Michael Durant|Michael J. Durant]], Steven Hartov |location=New York |publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons | isbn = 0-399-15392-6 | pages = 245–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
In April 1987, a retreating, fully armed [[Libyan Air Force]] Mi-25 was captured by French and Chadian military troops after the crew abandoned the helicopter. The Hind was put in storage in [[Ouadi Doum]]. The [[United States Department of State]] negotiated with [[Government of Chad]] to conduct an operation to retrieve the Hind and received permission. The Chadians would not provide assistance. Training was conducted at [[White Sands Missile Range]]. The operation was initiated on 10 June 1988. A [[C-5 Galaxy]] landed at [[N'Djamena International Airport]] with two MH-47s in the cargo hold and 75 troops. French troops also assisted in the operation with one contingent of troops and a few [[Mirage F.1]]s. The Chinooks were offloaded and the troops started flying towards Ouadi Doum; the Hind was still parked there. The crew evaded detection by the Libyans and retrieved the Hind and started flying back toward [[N'Djamena]] with assistance from two [[C-130 Hercules]] at two FARP (Forward Arming and Refueling Point) points; one in [[Faya-Largeau]] and one in [[Moussoro]]. 

Despite sandstorms, the Chinooks reached the FARPs and returned to N'Djamena with the Hind. The Mi-25 Hind was loaded onto a C-5 and the Chinooks on another C-5 and transported to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Shopping in Chad: Operazione Mount Hope III |url=https://sobchak.wordpress.com/tag/operation-mount-hope-iii/ |work=Sobchak Security |date=3 July 2013 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Population dynamics''' is the branch of [[life sciences]] that studies the size and age composition of [[population]]s as [[dynamical systems]], and the [[biology|biological]] and [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] processes driving them (such as [[birth rate|birth]] and [[death rate]]s, and by [[immigration]] and [[emigration]]). Example [[scenarios]] are [[ageing population]]s, [[population growth]], or [[population decline]].

== History ==
Population dynamics has traditionally been the dominant branch of [[mathematical biology]], which has a history of more than 210 years, although more recently the scope of mathematical biology has greatly expanded. The first principle of population dynamics is widely regarded as the exponential law of [[Malthus]], as modeled by the [[Malthusian growth model]]. The early period was dominated by [[demography|demographic]] studies such as the work of [[Benjamin Gompertz]] and [[Pierre François Verhulst]] in the early 19th century, who refined and adjusted the Malthusian demographic model.

A more general model formulation was proposed by [[F.J. Richards]] in 1959, further expanded by [[Simon Hopkins]], in which the models of Gompertz, Verhulst and also [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] are covered as special cases of the general formulation. The [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra predator-prey equations]] are another famous example, as well as the alternative [[Arditi–Ginzburg equations]]. The [[computer game]] ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'' and the [[MMORPG]] [[Ultima Online]], among others, tried to [[computer simulation|simulate]] some of these population dynamics.

In the past 30 years, population dynamics has been complemented by [[evolutionary game theory]], developed first by [[John Maynard Smith]]. Under these dynamics, evolutionary biology concepts may take a deterministic mathematical form. Population dynamics overlap with another active area of research in mathematical biology: [[Mathematical modelling in epidemiology|mathematical epidemiology]], the study of infectious disease affecting populations. Various models of viral spread have been proposed and analyzed, and provide important results that may be applied to health policy decisions.

== Intrinsic rate of increase ==
The rate at which a population increases in size if there are no density-dependent forces regulating the population is known as the ''intrinsic rate of increase''. It is

: &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{dN}{dt} \dfrac{1}{N} = r&lt;/math&gt;

where  the [[derivative]] &lt;math&gt;dN / dt &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of increase of the population, ''N'' is the population size, and ''r'' is the intrinsic rate of increase. Thus ''r'' is the maximum theoretical rate of increase of a population per individual – that is, the maximum population growth rate. The concept is commonly used in insect population biology to determine how environmental factors affect the rate at which pest populations increase.  See also exponential population growth and logistic population growth.&lt;ref name="Jahn2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1603/0046-225X-34.4.938 |title=Effect of Nitrogen Fertilizer on the Intrinsic Rate of Increase of ''Hysteroneura'' setariae(Thomas) (Homoptera: Aphididae) on Rice (Oryza sativaL.) |journal=Environmental Entomology |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=938–43 |year=2005 |last1=Jahn |first1=Gary C |last2=Almazan |first2=Liberty P |last3=Pacia |first3=Jocelyn B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common mathematical models==

===Exponential population growth===
Exponential growth describes unregulated reproduction. It is very unusual to see this in nature. In the last 100 years, [[human population growth]] has appeared to be exponential. In the long run, however, it is not likely. Thomas Malthus believed that human population growth would lead to [[overpopulation]] and [[starvation]] due to [[scarcity]] of resources. They believed that human population  would grow at rate in which they exceed the ability at which humans can find food. In the future, humans would be unable to feed large populations. The biological assumptions of exponential growth is that the per capita growth rate is constant. Growth is not limited by resource scarcity or predation.&lt;ref name="Louie Yang"&gt;Yang, Louie. Population Dynamics. Davis: UC Davis, 2014.{{pn|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple discrete time exponential model===
: &lt;math&gt; N_{t + 1} =  \lambda N_t &lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ'' is the discrete-time per capita growth rate. At ''λ'' = 1, we get a linear line and a discrete-time per capita growth rate of zero. At ''λ'' &lt; 1, we get a decrease in per capita growth rate. At ''λ'' &gt; 1, we get an increase in per capita growth rate. At ''λ'' = 0, we get extinction of the species.&lt;ref name="Louie Yang"/&gt;

===Continuous time version of exponential growth===

Some species have continuous reproduction.

: &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{dN}{dT} = rN&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{dN}{dT} &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of population growth per unit time, ''r'' is the maximum per capita growth rate, and ''N'' is the population size.

At ''r'' &gt; 0, there is an increase in per capita growth rate. At ''r'' = 0, the per capita growth rate is zero. At ''r'' &lt; 0, there is a decrease in per capita growth rate.

===Logistic population growth===

“[[Logistics]]” comes from the French word '''logistique''', which means “to compute”. Population regulation is a density-dependent process, meaning that population growth rates are regulated by the density of a population. Consider an analogy with a thermostat. When the temperature is too hot, the thermostat turns on the air conditioning to decrease the temperature back to [[homeostasis]]. When the temperature is too cold, the thermostat turns on the heater to increase the temperature back to homeostasis. Likewise with density dependence, whether the population density is high or low, population dynamics returns the population density to homeostasis. Homeostasis is the set point, or [[carrying capacity]], defined as K.&lt;ref name="Louie Yang"/&gt;

===Continuous-time model of logistic growth===
: &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{dN}{dT} = rN \Big(1-\dfrac{N}{K}\Big)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Big(1-\dfrac{N}{K}\Big)&lt;/math&gt; is the density dependence, ''N'' is the number in the population, ''K'' is the set point for homeostasis and the carrying capacity. In this [[logistic function|logistic model]], population growth rate is highest at 1/2 ''K'' and the population growth rate is zero around ''K''. The optimum harvesting rate is a close rate to 1/2 ''K'' where population will grow the fastest. Above ''K'', the population growth rate is negative. The logistic models also show density dependence, meaning the per capita population growth rates decline as the population density increases. In the wild, you can't get these patterns to emerge without simplification. Negative density dependence allows for a population that overshoots the carrying capacity to decrease back to the carrying capacity, ''K''.&lt;ref name="Louie Yang"/&gt;

According to [[r/K selection theory]] organisms may be specialised for rapid growth, or stability closer to carrying capacity.

===Discrete time logistical model===
: &lt;math&gt; N_{t + 1} =  N_t + r N_t (1 - {N_t / K}) &lt;/math&gt;

This equation uses ''r'' instead of ''λ'' because per capita growth rate is zero when ''r'' = 0. As r gets very high, there are [[oscillation]]s and [[deterministic chaos]].&lt;ref name="Louie Yang"/&gt; Deterministic chaos is large changes in population dynamics when there is a very small change in ''r''. This makes it hard to make predictions at high ''r'' values because a very small ''r'' error results in a massive error in population dynamics.

Population is always density dependent. Even a severe density independent event cannot regulate populate, although it may cause it to go extinct.

Not all population models are necessarily negative density dependent. The [[Allee effect]] allows for a positive correlation between population density and per capita growth rate in communities with very small populations. For example, a fish swimming on its own is more likely to be eaten than the same fish swimming among a school of fish, because the pattern of movement of the school of fish is more likely to confuse and stun the predator.&lt;ref name="Louie Yang"/&gt;

===Individual-based models===

Cellular automata are used to investigate mechanisms of population dynamics. Here are relatively simple models with one and two species.

[[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]]

[[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of interspecific competition for a single limited resource.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of interspecific competition for a single limited resource]]

== Fisheries and wildlife management ==
{{see also|Population dynamics of fisheries|Matrix population models}}
In [[fisheries]] and [[wildlife management]], population is affected by three dynamic rate functions.

*Natality or [[birth rate]], often recruitment, which means reaching a certain size or reproductive stage. Usually refers to the age a fish can be caught and counted in nets.
*[[Population growth rate]], which measures the growth of individuals in size and length. More important in fisheries, where population is often measured in biomass.
*[[Mortality rate|Mortality]], which includes harvest mortality and natural mortality. Natural mortality includes non-human predation, disease and old age.

If ''N''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of individuals at time 1 then
:::: &lt;math&gt; N_1 = N_0 + B - D + I - E &lt;/math&gt;
where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of individuals at time 0, ''B'' is the number of individuals born, ''D'' the number that died, ''I'' the number that immigrated, and ''E'' the number that emigrated between time 0 and time 1.

If we measure these rates over many time intervals, we can determine how a population's density changes over time. Immigration and emigration are present, but are usually not measured.

All of these are measured to determine the harvestable surplus, which is the number of individuals that can be harvested from a population without affecting long-term population stability or average population size. The harvest within the harvestable surplus is termed "compensatory" mortality, where the harvest deaths are substituted for the deaths that would have occurred naturally. Harvest above that level is termed "additive" mortality, because it adds to the number of deaths that would have occurred naturally. These terms are not necessarily judged as "good" and "bad," respectively, in population management. For example, a fish &amp; game agency might aim to reduce the size of a deer population through additive mortality. Bucks might be targeted to increase buck competition, or does might be targeted to reduce reproduction and thus overall population size.

For the management of many fish and other wildlife populations, the goal is often to achieve the largest possible long-run sustainable harvest, also known as [[maximum sustainable yield]] (or MSY). Given a population dynamic model, such as any of the ones above, it is possible to calculate the population size that produces the largest harvestable surplus at equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mathematical bioeconomics : the optimal management of renewable resources|last=Clark|first=Colin|publisher=Wiley|year=1990|isbn=0471508837|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}{{pn|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the use of population dynamic models along with statistics and optimization to set harvest limits for fish and game is controversial among scientists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/icesjms/fss192 |title=Maximum sustained yield: A policy disguised as science |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=245–50 |year=2013 |last1=Finley |first1=C |last2=Oreskes |first2=N }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been shown to be more effective than the use of human judgment in computer experiments where both incorrect models and natural resource management students competed to maximize yield in two hypothetical fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/15-1295 |pmid=27755756 |title=Human judgment vs. Quantitative models for the management of ecological resources |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=1553–1565 |year=2016 |last1=Holden |first1=Matthew H |last2=Ellner |first2=Stephen P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/sometimes-even-bad-models-make-better-decisions-than-people-4956bade3990#.qv2oz7gd2 |title=Sometimes, Even Bad Models Make Better Decisions Than People|last=Standard|first=Pacific |date=2016-03-11 |newspaper=Pacific Standard|access-date=2017-01-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To give an example of a non-intuitive result, fisheries produce more fish when there is a nearby [[refuge (ecology)|refuge]] from human predation in the form of a [[nature reserve]], resulting in higher catches than if the whole area was open to fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10867-013-9329-5 |pmid=23949368 |pmc=3758828 |title=An ecological perspective on marine reserves in prey–predator dynamics |journal=Journal of Biological Physics |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=749–76 |year=2013 |last1=Chakraborty |first1=Kunal |last2=Das |first2=Kunal |last3=Kar |first3=T.

==For control applications==
{{see also|Evolutionary game theory}}

Population dynamics have been widely used in several [[control theory]] applications. With the use of [[evolutionary game theory]], population games are broadly implemented for different industrial and daily-life contexts. Mostly used in multiple-input-multiple-output ([[MIMO]]) systems, although they can be adapted for use in single-input-single-output ([[Single-input single-output system|SISO]]) systems. Some examples of applications are military campaigns, resource allocation for [[Water supply network|water distribution]], [[Dispatchable generation|dispatch of distributed generators]], lab experiments, transport problems, communication problems, among others.  Furthermore, with the adequate contextualization of industrial problems, population dynamics can be an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for control-related problems. Multiple academic research has been and is continuously carried out.

The '''Press Council Nepal''' is an autonomous and independent media regulatory body set up by the [[Government of Nepal]] that overlooks the development of the [[freedom of the press]] in Nepal and that advises the Government on policy developments to ensure this development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.presscouncilnepal.org/en/2016/07/517#more-517|title=Introduction|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/press-council-nepal-classifies-833-newspapers-magazines/|title=Press Council Nepal classifies 833 newspapers, magazines|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves under the [[Ministry of Information and Communications (Nepal)|Ministry of Information and Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizations under Ministry|url=https://moic.gov.np/en/page/organizations-under-ministry.html|publisher=Ministry of Information and Communications|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The [[Government of Nepal]] first created the ''Press Commission'', a predecessor of the Press Council Nepal in 1957. This was developed into the ''Press Advisory Council'' in 1969. The supervision was handed from the Government to the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] in 1972 and the organisation was renamed to ''Press Council of Nepal''.&lt;ref name="PCN"/&gt;

'''RVi''' [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on [[cable FM]] and [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] in Flanders, [[mediumwave]] and [[satellite radio]] in [[Europe]], and worldwide on [[shortwave]].  It was also available in North America FTA on AMC 4 satellite through the [[Home2US]] platform alongside [[BVN]] Netherlands.

Shortwave and other services ended on December 31, 2011. Domestic Flemish stations [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|Radio 1]] and [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|Radio 2]] will instead be broadcast worldwide via satellite, and all radio channels will also be available worldwide via the Internet. 

RVI was previously known as '''Belgium Radio International''' and broadcast in various languages, including English.

==Education==
Millan received a B.A. in Astronomy and Physics (1995), a M.A. in Physics (1999), and a Ph.D. in Physics (2002), all from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].{{r|Dartmouth bio}}

==Career and impact==
Millan is an associate professor of physics and astronomy at [[Dartmouth College]].&lt;ref name="Zell (May 2015)" /&gt; Her research includes the use of high-altitude scientific balloon experiments to study Earth's radiation belts, specifically, the loss of relativistic electrons from the outer radiation belts into Earth's atmosphere. Millan is principal investigator for the BARREL (Balloon Array for RBSP Relativistic Electron Losses) project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Frazier |date=September 24, 2015 |work=[[Phys.org]] |url=http://phys.org/news/2015-09-nasa-barrel-team-sweden.html |title=NASA's BARREL team returns from Sweden |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which two balloon launches in 2013 and 2014 (of 20 such balloons) floated in the circular wind patterns above the South Pole.&lt;ref name="Zell (June 2015)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dartmouth College |title=Destructive High-Energy Electrons Streaking into Earth's Atmosphere from Space |date=July 23, 2015 |work=[[Science Daily]] |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150723111345.htm |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each balloon tracked electrons from space that get swept up in Earth's magnetic field and slide down into Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Zell (June 2015)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Morrow |first=Ashley |title=BARREL Mission Overview |date=July 30, 2015 |website=[[NASA]] |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission-pages/rbsp/barrel/overview |access-date=September 2, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20160902141841/https://www.nasa.gov/mission-pages/rbsp/barrel/overview |archive-date=September 2, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first test of BARREL—funded by NASA and also supported by NSF's Office of Polar Programs that supports logistics of all research in Antarctica—began in December 2008.&lt;ref name="Zell (May 2015)" /&gt;

Her prior positions include research appointments at Dartmouth and at the University of California, Berkeley. Millan served on the NRC Committee on the role and scope of mission-enabling activities in NASA's space and earth science missions and on the panel on solar wind-magnetosphere interactions for the committee for a decadal strategy for solar and space physics (heliophysics).

Millan has inspired several young researchers as a positive influence on women in the area of space physics.  A former student and project manager for the [[SpaceX]] launch, Julianna Scheimann, made efforts to re-land the first stage booster and has worked for the SES-9 launch. Scheimann worked with Milan on the very early BARREL prototype payloads and conducted her senior thesis on the BARREL piggyback test flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fiorentino |first=Anna |title=Dartmouth Engineer Oversees First NASA Satellite Launch for SpaceX |date=February 2016 |work=Dartmouth Engineer |publisher=[[Thayer School of Engineering]] |url=http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/magazine/dartmouth-engineer-oversees-first-nasa-satellite-launch-for-spacex/ |access-date=September 2, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20160902142455/http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/magazine/dartmouth-engineer-oversees-first-nasa-satellite-launch-for-spacex/ |archive-date=September 2, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
In 2017, Millan received the NASA Exceptional Public Achievement Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.dartmouth.edu/faculty-directory/sites/dartmouth.edu.faculty-directory/files/millan_cv_short_oct2017.pdf|title=CV - Robyn Millan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Millan received the Dartmouth dean of the faculty award for outstanding mentoring and advising and for overall career distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Relman |first=Eliza |title=10 Profs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8248">A '''sherpa'''&lt;ref&gt;http://club.bruxelles2.eu/les-conclusions-du-sommet-premiere-analyse/ Analyse par Nicolas Gros-Verheyde auteur du blog Bruxelles2 (B2), Bruxelles2.eu et de Bruxelles2 - Le Club (Club de B2) suite au sommet européen concernant la situation Ukraine-Russie&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[diplomat|personal representative]] of a [[head of state]] or government who prepares an international summit, particularly the annual [[Group of Seven|G7]] and [[Group of Twenty|G20]] summits. Between the G7 summits there are multiple sherpa conferences where possible agreements are laid out. This reduces the amount of time and resources required at the negotiations of the heads of state at the final summit. The name sherpa—without further context—refers to sherpas for the G7 summit, but the designation can be extended to different regular conferences where the participation of the head of state is required. The sherpa is generally quite influential, although they do not have the authority to make a final decision about any given agreement.

The name is derived from the [[Sherpa people]], a [[Nepal]]ese [[ethnic group]], who serve as guides and [[porter (carrier)|porters]] in the [[Himalayas]], a reference to the fact that the sherpa clears the way for a head of state at a major summit. The name was originally used informally by the states of the [[European Union]], where personal representatives prepare work for the [[Intergovernmental Conference]] (IGC) meetings. While the position of a chief negotiator can be traced back under varying names to the first days of the European Union process, the name has caught on as an official reference since 2005 on the designation of a high-profile group on competition regulation in the European chemistry that names officially a "Sherpa-Subgroup".&lt;ref&gt;European Union, L 156/34, 16. June 2007, Articles 4, 5 and 6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:156:0034:0036:EN:PDF L 156/34 (2007/418/EC): "setting up the High Level Group on the Competitiveness of the Chemicals Industry in the European Union"], Commission Decision of 14 June 2007, Official Journal of the European Union of 16 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;also earlier in L 36/43, 23. December 2005, Articles 3 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:036:0043:0044:EN:PDF L 36/43 (2006/77/EC) "setting up a High Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment"], Commission Decision of 23 December 2005, Official Journal of the European Union of 8 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* In [[France]], [[Paul Jean-Ortiz]] '''''[[:fr:Paul Jean-Ortiz|fr]]''''' is a G8 sherpa. Previous French sherpas include [[Jacques Attali]], [[Anne Lauvergeon]], [[Jean-Marc de La Sablière]], [[Maurice Gourdault-Montagne]], [[Jean-David Levitte]]; [[Pascal Lamy]] was a sherpa on the [[European Commission]] (representing [[Jacques Delors]]).
* In [[Germany]], the canonic name of ''Chefunterhändler'' (chief negotiator) is a common second title to another high-profile position. The [[Bernd Pfaffenbach]] did hold this position since 2004 being also [[secretary of state]] in the [[Federal Ministry for Economics and Labour (Germany)|Ministry of Economics]] (since 2005). The title was held before by [[Horst Köhler]] (former [[President of Germany]]) and [[Hans Tietmeyer]] (became later the President of the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]). Since December 2009 the position of G8-Sherpa is held by [[Jens Weidmann]] who has been sherpa to the [[G-20 major economies|G20]] summits before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,666452,00.html Spiegel Online: "Merkel beruft neuen Super-Sherpa"]&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=May 2018}}

* In [[Italy]], [[Giampiero Massolo]] is Sherpa for the G8 since 1 April 2008

==Sherpa pre-summit==
During the preliminary preparatory process which takes place in advance of a G8 summit, the leader of a G8 host nation conventionally invites representatives from the other G8 participants to send representatives known as "sherpas" to develop the agenda topics and other matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=3209 Statement by the Prime Minister of Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420021101/http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=3209 |date=2010-04-20 }}, 18 March 2010; excerpt, "I think many people are probably not aware that the relatively brief leaders’ summits are the culmination of months of work at various levels of our governments to arrive at the final declarations and next steps forward. You, as the so-called ‘sherpas’ of your countries, play a leading role in this process."&lt;/ref&gt; They often produce communiques which show the current state of negotiations.

Apart from conferences of the sherpas of the head of state there are additional conferences held in specific domains that are routinely attended by other state secretaries in the government—most of the G8 countries have national sherpa teams in the field of foreign affairs (Foreign Affairs Sous-Sherpa) and finance (Finance Sous-Sherpa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g7finance.tesoro.it/en/G7-G8/Background/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616083622/http://www.g7finance.tesoro.it/en/G7-G8/Background/ |archivedate=2009-06-16 |df= }} {{quote| "The G8 mainly operates at the level of Heads of State and Government, who meet once a year on the occasion of the G8 Summit. The Summit is the conclusion of a process that involves coordination between the Ministry of the Economy and Finance (MEF), the Prime Minister's Office, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAE). The coordination between the ministries is left up to the Sherpa (the Prime Minister's personal representative) who, in turn, has two representatives: the Foreign Affairs Sous-Sherpa with regard to MAE related matters and the Financial Sous-Sherpa with regard to MEF responsibilities. // The Finance Ministers meet three times each year in the G7 format, together with the Central Banks’ Governors. Preliminary meetings at the level of Ministers’ Deputies and Deputies' Deputies are convened more frequently. A fourth meeting, known as the Pre-Summit, as it precedes and prepares the Summit of the Heads of State and Government, is held in the G8 format (thus including Russia), but without the participation of the Central Banks’ Governors. // The Communiqués issued at the conclusion of the Finance Ministers’ meetings and the Summits are political documents setting out the decisions made in relation to the measures to be adopted" | Website for the G7 Finance Minister Meetings during Itialian 2009 Presidency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sutgol''' ({{lang-tr|Sütgöl}}, "Milk Lake") or '''Akgol''' ({{lang-tr|Akgöl}}, "White Lake") is a lake in [[Turkish mythology]]. It is a life-giving fountain. Before the birth of a child, the Goddess [[Umay]] takes a drop from the lake and gives it to the child to give him a spirit. According to some sources, this mission is done by ''Ayzıt'' or ''Yıyık''. The lake is located behind the mythological [[Cafcuh|Mountain Kaf]], or on the third floor of the sky.

There are winged horses near the lake. When [[Khidr|Hızır]] went there, wanted to take them. He dropped some wine into the lake, and easily caught the horses. He broke off the horses' wings so they could not escape, and according to the myth, today's horses originated this way.

'''Tadjoura''' ({{lang-aa|Tagórri}}; {{lang-ar|تاجورة}} ''Tağūrah'', {{lang-so|Tajuura}}) is the oldest town in [[Djibouti]] and the capital of the [[Tadjourah Region]]. An important port for many centuries, it was ruled by a succession of polities, including the [[Ifat Sultanate]], [[Adal Sultanate]],  the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[France]] until [[Djibouti]]'s independence in 1977. Lying on the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]], it is home to a population of around 45,000 inhabitants. It is the third largest city in the country after [[Djibouti City]] and [[Ali Sabieh]].

Tadjoura has an [[airstrip]] and is linked by [[ferry]] with Djibouti City. It is also known for its [[whitewash]]ed buildings and nearby [[beach]]es.

==Etymology==
The [[Afar language|Afar]] name ''Tagórri'' derives from the noun ''tágor'' or ''tógor'', (pl. ''tágar'' meaning "outre à puiser" ("goatskin flask for drawing water"). The name ''Tagórri'' is specifically derived from *''tagór-li'', which means "qui a des outre à puiser" ("that which has goatskin flasks to draw water"), in effect meaning "abondante en eau" ("abundant with water").&lt;ref&gt;Didier Morin, "Tadjoura," in ''Dictionnaire historique afar (1288-1982)''. France: 2004, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

During antiquity Tadjoura was part of the city-states that in engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting the merchants with [[Phoenicia]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian Persia]], [[Sabaeans|Saba]], [[Nabataean Kingdom|Nabataea]], and the [[Roman Empire]].

Taǵurrá appears in [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]]'s map of 1154 on the coast of the [[Horn of Africa]], north of the straits of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]].

During the Middle Ages, Tadjoura was ruled by the [[Adal Sultanate]]. It later formed a part of the [[French Somaliland]] protectorate in the first half of the 20th century. While visiting Tadjoura in 1842, Charles Johnston was told that there could be found "stone walls of some extent, but completely in ruins," which "could be seen on the road to the well" between the town and a local well. Upon inspecting the site, Johnston "by raking over the spot with the butt end of a spear very evident marks of the foundations of some extensive buildings were to be seen, but were still too indistinct to enable us to form any idea as to their character."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Travels in Southern Abyssinia through the Country of Adal to the Kingdom of Shoa'' (London, 1844), vol. 1 p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about these ruins only informed Johnston that they were the work of "Turks", or "sometimes, as if correcting themselves, explaining that they meant the Feringees, for that the old possessors had not been Mahomedans but Christians."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mordechai Abir, Tadjoura originally was the seat of the [[Afar people|Afar]] [[Ad-Ali Abli Sultanate]] as well as a port. This ruler, known as the ''Dardar'', "claimed authority over all of the northern Adoimara Afar to the borders of [[Shewa|Showa]]. However, although it was true that some sub-clans of the Ad-Ali and Abli Adoimara roamed as far as the borders of [[Yifat]], even the staunchest supporters of the Sultan agreed that his actual authority did not stretch beyond [[Lake Assal (Djibouti)|Lake Assal]], a short distance from Tadjoura."&lt;ref&gt;Mordechai Abir, ''Ethiopia: The Era of the Princes; The Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian Empire (1769-1855)'' (London: Longmans, 1968), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tadjoura in 1971.jpg|thumb|right|Tadjoura in 1971]]
[[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] notes that it differed from neighboring ports by handling almost entirely the trade of [[Shewa]] and [[Aussa Sultanate|Aussa]], "rather than that of [[Harar]] or the [[Ogaden]]." He quotes [[William Cornwallis Harris]]' description of an annual bazaar that started each September, when "for two months the beach is piled with merchandise, and the suburbs are crowded with camels, mules and donkeys." Pankhurst also cites [[Charles Tilstone Beke|C.T. Beke]] that the trade with the inhabitants of the [[Afar Depression]] was handled entirely by women, "who loaded the camels, bought and sold while the men kept away altogether 'to avoid bloodshed, this country being the scene of constant feuds among the different tribes.'"&lt;ref name=Pankhurst-429&gt;Richard K.P. Pankhurst, ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie University Press, 1968), pp. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Abir observes that the port is not mentioned in all of the material about the Red Sea in the eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, by the mid-19th century Tadjoura was thriving, "while all the other so-called Afar sultanates along the coast were described ... as small decaying villages of no political or commercial importance."&lt;ref&gt;Abir, ''Era of the Princes'', pp. 20f&lt;/ref&gt; Tadjoura owed this success to possessing a major [[slavery|slave market]]; Pankhurst suggests that a rough estimate of 6,000 people a year left Ethiopia through Tadjoura and [[Zeila]].&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The other important commodity sold in Tadjoura in the 19th century was [[ivory]], brought by caravan from [[Aliyu Amba]].&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Other goods exported included [[wheat]], [[durra]], [[honey]], [[gold]], [[ostrich]] feathers, [[senna (plant)|senna]], [[madder]], and [[civetone]]. The value of trade in 1880-1 was estimated at the time as 29,656 [[rupee]]s in exports and 18,513 rupees in imports.&lt;ref name=Pankhurst-429/&gt;
[[File:Tadjoura beach at sunset.jpg|thumb|Tadjoura beach at sunset.]]
Once Tadjoura came under [[History of Djibouti|French control]], the slave trade was abolished by decree on 26 October 1889;&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; however, Noel-Buxton reported that Tajoura still remained a center of the slave trade, but "limited to small though frequent shipments."&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; While during the 1880s the port served as a distribution point for rifles and ammunition to Shewa and Ethiopia (during this period, [[Arthur Rimbaud]] lived in the city), Tajoura's importance inevitably declined with the construction of the [[Franco-Ethiopian railway]], which connected Djibouti with the hinterlands. The railway began to carry traffic on 22 July 1901, was extended to [[Dire Dawa]] 17 months later, and finally to Addis Ababa on 3 December 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, pp. 304-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The port of Tadjoura was modernized in 2000, at a cost of US$1.64 million, allowing it to handle cargo vessels and their contents. The work was described as part of the government's effort to help the economic development of the districts of Tadjourah, Obock, Ali-Sabieh and Dikhil. The new port was formally opened by Djibouti president [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] on 10 October.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocha-eth.org/Archive/DownloadableReports/hoa1000.pdf "Horn of Africa, Monthly Review, September - October 2000"], UN-OCHA Archive (accessed 23 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Featuring an arid climate, the town sees on average 186&amp;nbsp;mm (7.31&amp;nbsp;in) of [[rainfall]] per year. Average [[temperature]]s range from {{convert|26|C|F}} in winter to {{convert|36|C|F}} in summer.

==Transportation==
[[File:Tadjoura Airport.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of a landing strip at the [[Tadjoura Airport]].]]
From [[Djibouti City]] to Tadjoura takes two and a half hour ferry or three thirty dhow or a quarter of an hour by air or two hours by paved road (130&amp;nbsp;km). The first crossing of the Gulf must necessarily be by sea lot slower than by air, it presents more than charm.
In its mountain environment, the white city presents its most attractive face when approached by sea small boxes of old wood gave way to brick houses, whitewashed. Here and there appear the minarets of mosques which give Tadjoura this special character that is its charm. For air transportation, Tajdoura is served by the [[Tadjoura Airport]]. The local port is the proposed terminus of a rebuilt [[standard gauge]] railway to [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article43100&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telstar 12''', previously known as '''Orion 2''', is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[communications satellite]] in the [[Telstar]] series which is operated by [[Telesat]]. It was originally built for [[Orion Network Systems]], which merged with [[Loral Skynet]] shortly before the satellite was launched. It was subsequently transferred to Telesat when it merged with Loral Skynet in 2007.

Telstar 12 is a [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] satellite with coverage of [[North America]] as far west as [[Cleveland, Ohio]], the majority of [[South America]] and [[Europe]]. Telstar 12 also has the capability to provide intercontinental connectivity including [[wikt:transatlantic|trans-Atlantic]] to the [[Mid-East]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loralskynet.com/pdf/telstar12_pamphlet.pdf|title=Telstar 12 15° W|publisher=Loral Skynet|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209075653/http://www.loralskynet.com/pdf/telstar12_pamphlet.pdf|archivedate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eutelsat]] uses four transponders on the satellite for services between Europe and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eutelsat.org/satellites/15w.html www.eutelsat.org "TELSTAR 12 :: [[15th meridian west|15° West]]"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514232155/http://www.eutelsat.org/satellites/15w.html |date=2006-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USA-71''', also known as '''GPS IIA-2''', '''GPS II-11''' and '''GPS SVN-24''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the second of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-71 was launched at 02:32:00 UTC on 4 July 1991, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D206, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rocket launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-71 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star 37#Thiokol Star-37 family|Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name=GSP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 1991, USA-71 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20085|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20274|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.86 minutes, and 55.1 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name=satcat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has PRN 24, and operated in slot 1 of plane D of the GPS constellation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; until it was removed from service in September 2009. It was subsequently relocated, was operational again, briefly covering slot 2 in 2011, before being deactivated in November after [[USA-232]] replaced it.

The '''Naples Eastern University''', or '''University of Naples "L'Orientale"''' ({{lang-it|Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale"}}), is a university located in [[Naples]], [[Italy]].  It was founded in 1732 and is organized in 4 Faculties. It is the oldest school of [[Sinology]] and [[Oriental Studies]] of the [[Europe]]an continent and the main university in Italy specialized in the study of non-European languages and cultures, with research and studies agreements with universities from all over the world.  It is one of the most prestigious universities in the world regarding [[Eastern civilization|Asian cultures and languages]].

==History==
The Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale" is the oldest school of Sinology and Oriental Studies of the European continent.
[[File:Palazzo Orig.jpg|250px|right]]

==Foundation==
The name "Orientale" is a indication to the origins of the institution.  In the mid-17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] established the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] in China and started a remarkable period of openness towards the west.  This included welcoming Christian missionaries and priests.
One such person was the missionary, [[Matteo Ripa]], of the [[Propaganda Fide]], from the [[Kingdom of Naples]], who worked as a painter and copper-engraver at the imperial court of the [[Kangxi Emperor]] between 1711 and 1723.  He returned to Naples from China with four young Chinese Christians, all teachers of their native language; they formed the nucleus of what would become the "Chinese Institute" of Naples, sanctioned by [[Pope Clement XII]] in 1732 to teach Chinese to missionaries and thus advance the propagation of Christianity in China.

The school buildings comprised the ''Complesso dei Cinesi'' located at the boundary of Capodimonte and the [[Rione Sanità]].  What was formerly a private palace had been converted into a monastery and church dedicated to Saint Francesca Romana. Under Matteo Ripa, the complex became a seminary for missionaries to China. 

The school also would educate experts for the [[Ostend Company]] in Indian and Chinese languages.

==Transformations starting in the 19th-century==
After the [[unification of Italy]] in 1861, the institution was transformed into the "Royal Asian College" and other languages such as Russian, Hindustani, and Persian were added to the curriculum. The original buildings also were used as a school for orphans in 1897, and in 1910 into the Elena d'Aosta hospital.

The institution then became a secular school for the study of eastern languages in general, and then, over the course of decades, African languages and, indeed, all modern European languages.  Today more than 50 languages are taught.

==Architecture and Decoration==
The main entrance to the institute has a frescoed coat of arms of the institute with a half bust of ''Matteo Ripa'' sculpted by [[Leonardo Di Candia]]. 

The domed church of the ''Holy Family of the Chinese'' (''Sacra Famiglia dei Cinesi'') was built in 1732,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JoI5AAAAcAAJ |title=Notizie del bello dell'antico e del curioso della città di Napoli |volume=5 |author=Carlo Cerano |editor=Giovanni Battista Chiarini |publisher=Stamperia di Agostino di Pascale |location=Naples |date=1860 |page=379}} This reference says church opened in 1729.&lt;/ref&gt; and refurbished in 1814. The single nave leads to a main altar with marble cherubs sculpted by [[Angelo Viva]]. The main altarpiece depicting a ''Holy Family adored by two of the first Chinese Seminarians'' (1769) was painted by  [[Antonio Sarnelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Celano, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Other paintings were by followers or pupils of  [[Francesco De Mura]], including his brother Gennaro. Four saints carved in wood were designed by [[Francesco Solimena]].  The ''Madonna della Misericordia'' was painted by [[Stanislao Lista]].  The sacristy has sculptures by [[Giuseppe Sammartino]].

==Institutions==
The Orientale moved into its current headquarters, [[Palazzo Giusso (Naples)|Palazzo Giusso]], in 1932. However, like most universities in Italy, the IUO has no single main "campus," but is spread around the city at a number of different sites.  There are several buildings that make up the teaching facilities of the Orientale.  These include Palazzo Giusso in the historic center of Naples; the large converted monastery of Santa Maria Porta Coeli near the Naples cathedral; and the new Palazzo Mediterraneo on via Marina.  Palazzo Mediterraneo now houses CILA, an acronym for Centro Interdipartimentale dei servizi Linguistici ed Audiovisivi— the "language lab," an award-winning facility that has satellite TV for international programming, an impressive recording studio, and computers for instant access to the Internet.

Four faculties:
*[[Foreign Language]]s and [[Literature]]
*[[Arabic-Islamic and Mediterranean Studies]]
*[[Letter (message)|Letters]] and [[Philosophy]]
*[[Political Sciences]]

These are further sub-divided into nine areas:
*Asian Studies
*Classic world and Ancient Mediterranean
*African and Arabic countries
*Oriental Europe
*Social Sciences
*Philosophy and Politics
*Comparative Studies
*American cultural and linguistic studies
*European literature and linguistic studies

Main Library:
*Maurizio Taddei, [[Palazzo Corigliano (Naples)|Palazzo Corigliano]] (over 60.000 ancient volumes)
